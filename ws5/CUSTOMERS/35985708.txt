I'm glad she admits that this family history is part imagination, as befits a 'historian,' as her preface is three years past the publication date (Jan. 15, 2008).  This very obvious discreptancy makes the reader wonder if the other dates are factual or have been changed to protect some- one or -thing.  Implying that there could be a modern Dracula based on the legend of Vlad the Impaler, some one of her ancestors, this is total fantasy. <br /> <br />The map of \\"Cold War Europe\\" is revealing with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (which no longer exists), United Kingdom (never united but warring), Corsica, west of Italy, Sicily, east of the boot's toe, Poland (Hello, Victor Ashe), France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Albania, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Czechoslavakia, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Crete, and Sardinia (now called the United States of Europe).   <br /> <br />A few years ago, Nick Clooney had a book released about the movies that changed us.  I asked him on the phone early one morning that December which movie changed him; and he replied, \\"Dracula.\\"  This has to be the book for him.  Is it possible for the Dracula of myth to have truly existed?   <br /> <br />First, Professor Rossi, then his heir to the family history, search for clues in such faraway places as Budapest, Istanbul and Eastern Europe (the East bloc).  Were there any such evil ancestor of mine, besides the Black Prince of England, I wouldn't want to know.  I certainly would not put myself in danger by delving into the 'dirty linen' in everybody's family history.  The rogues are the most interesting; the first cousin I thought was so handsome was a murderer  -- went to prison twice for killing two men over 'a woman.'  My dad was afraid of that good-looking (but evil on the inside) nephew, and he had reason to live in fear.  Before he died, it was my pleasure and privilege to tell him that Ed had already died.  He didn't believe me.  Sometimes, fear can take over your entire life. <br /> <br />Father & daughter shared hot tea (with lemon) and sardines at a teahouse as he warns her about his quest concerning the truth of their ancestry.  He told her stories; he wrote letters; he kept files full of his research, and a book, DRAKULA, about the feudal lord, Vlad Tepes, a cruel personage people called Bella Lugoisi, Dracula.  She writes as if this were autobiography and it had taken place in Romania.   <br /> <br />After her father's death, she went on her own search for their past.  This tale \\"blends fact and fantasy, history and the present.\\"  Elizabeth Kostova was educated in the USA at Yale and the University of Michigan, but writes this book in Oxford, England.   \\"The more distant history within this story I have researched as carefully as I would any academic test.  There is a final resource to w hich I've resorted when necessary -- the imagination.\\"  All modern historians do.	2005-10-14

This is a part of the Battletech series about the Rebublic of the Sphere.  I liked these names of places: Sirius, Terra Firma, Elgin, Halstead Station (Chicago connection), New Rhodes III, Schedar (instead of Scholar), Woodstock, and Fletcher (Jonathan's friend).  There are nine prefectures, the tenth is Reblic Territory in the middle of the Inner Sphere.  The names he used were familiar Anglican names like Thomas, Ray, Max, Blake, Victor, Kim, Andrea, with a few strange ones tossed in liek Bianca, Ring, and Gypsy.  Pep was a nickname for being small and quick.  Count Hector is the master.  In Santa Fe, North America, there is a Terra Prefecture X, called the Republic of the Sphere.    War is a silly little game where nobody wins.  Huxley commends: \\"Logical consequences are the scarecrows of fools and the beacons of wise men.\\"  Wise men think twice before they act once.  Trostsky felt that \\"an ally has to be watched just like an enemy.\\"  An ancient slogan used proclaims \\"Power corrupts, but absolute power is kind of neat.\\"  Sounds made up to me.    Daniel Boorstin feels that \\"the greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.\\"  Napolean who lost the Battle at Waterloo, stated: \\"A battle sometimes decides everything; and sometimes the merest trifle decides a battle\\" and \\"In war, as in love, we must come into contact before we can triumph.\\"    Accius is quoted as saying :Oderint, dum metuant.  Let them hate, so long as they fear.\\"   He waxes poetic with Shelley, \\"To that high Capital, where kingly Death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay, He came.\\"  Shakespeare qualifies for three quotes, \\"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport,\\" \\"\\"It is to be all made of faith and service...it is to be all made of fantasy,\\" and \\"I am as true as truth's simplicity, and simpler than the infancy of truth.\\"    This is in the form of a narrative by Mason Dunne.  \\"I was in combat, no doubt about it, but I was detached from it.  I knew then that I had to be a Ghost Knight.  I saw another vision.\\"  The fish sees the bait, but not the hook.  George Bernard Shaw wrote \\"He who bears the brand of Cain shall rule the earth.\\"  There are references from the Bible, even one by Jeremiah (prophet of doom).  Sam Donelly tells how he procured a hovercab, Mad Cat III, from a rental agency -- a Cabochon, the most popular model because of its safety construction.  \\"The display was breathtaking and, I'll admit, I'd just started to drift unconsciously past,\\" in vino veritas, was told, 'You don't look like a ghost to me.  \\"No, my friend, I don't, which is exactly why I am one.\\"    Others in this series of Dark Age, LETHAL HERITAGE, BLOOD LEGACY, and LOST DESTINY, are from the Blood of Kerensky.  He wrote two of the 'Twilight of the Clans\\" novels; other writers of this series include Blaine Lee Pardoe, Thomas S. Gressman, and Robert Thurston.	2005-10-14

He did \\"read\\" and learn the trade from another and did very well for that time.  Now, there is someone calling himself a Lincoln lawyer, which fooled me big time, as I expected it to be about one A. Lincoln.  The new one is about an unscrupulous, on the down side of life lawyer who has to do his business out of his car. I remember when Debbie Reynolds said that she had to live out of hers out there in L.A.     It shows what an unethical person does in the gutter as opposed to the very ethical A. Lincoln of the 1850s.  He was known as honest Abe.  You can't say the same for the lawyers represented in the new Lincoln book.  I have worked for lawyers, and had a couple as personal friends, and I have some knowledge of how that part of the law works.    To tear one down for no good reason, is to be on a par with such a seedy, lowdown attorney-at-law who is so low he can't afford a respectable office from which to do legitimate business.  Of course, Mickey and his father who gained the gangster's gun as a reward for getting a guilty person off, are not respectable. He was told not to ever let an innocent person go to prison, but that is exactly what he did and it is time to face the music of his own un-doing.  Only lowlifes would go to someone who does his business out of a car.  It amazes me that even a character in a novel such as this could belong to the Legal Profession.	2005-10-13

This book is \\"For Women Only\\" as the seal on the front cover shows.  She is somewhere between Erma Bombeck and Fanny Flagg with her type of humor and sayings.  This volume was written for those with a sense of humor but, if you've heard all that homespun advice, it's not so funny anymore.    None of the stuff women must live through during midlife crisis would be relevant to men, unless they are married to such creatures; they too have their own type of menopause.  Chapter 7 is all about the causes of men, as she makes fun of the male personality.  One I liked:  \\"Youth looks ahead, Old age looks back, Middle age looks tired.\\"    While the younger years may be the most fun, many grandmothers enjoy a more meaningful relationship with their adolescent grandchildren during the teenage years.   These are times the rebels in the family show their true selves.  They tend to turn for solace to loving grandparents during these turbulent times.  Teens trust those who have given them unconditional love during their growing-up years and who are nonjudgemental.    Memory is a mental bank account for elders.  In it, we deposit the treasures of our lives so that, in time of need, we can withdraw hope and courage.  Remembering good memories can make us feel like mental millionaires.  One of my heroes, General Douglas MacArthur once said, \\"Whatever your years, there is in every being's heart the love of wonder, the undaunted challenges of events, the unfailing childlike appetite for what comes next, and the joy of the game.  You are as young as your hope, as old as your despair.\\"  My doctor told me just today to \\"give in to the body's need to heal\\" and to take the needed naps with joy; don't begrudge the \\"time out\\" but look forward to six weeks down the road when you can do all the things you did before the invasive surgery.  Be accepting of the circumstances and don't fight against your best interests, getting well again.    Ms. Johnson uses an excerpt from one of \\"Dear Abby\\" columns called \\"How to Plant a Special Garden:\\"  First, plant five rows of peas: 'Preparedness,' 'Promptness,' 'Perseverence,' 'Politeness, and \\"Prayer.'  Next to them, plant three rows of squash: 'Squash Gossip,' Squash Criticism,' and 'Squash Indifference.'  Then five rows of lettuce: 'Let us be faithful,' 'Let us be unselfish,' 'Let us be loyal,' 'Let us be truthful,' and 'Let us love one another.'  And no garden is complete without turnips: \\"Turn up for church,' 'Turn up with a smile,' 'Turn up with determination.'  Leonard Levinson's quote, \\"Sorrow is the future tense of love.\\"  You've heard that it is better to be safe than sorry.  But, telling someone you love that you are sorry you said or did something which made them sad is one of the best things a woman can do.    Yes, this book is for women only; but the jokes about being old apply to the men, too.  It's funny -- hilarious to some, I'm sure, but insightful in a way we all need to be reminded.	2005-10-13
3728:US	35985708	R36YRWVOPFH9KY	1592641229	506079550	The Year the Music Changed: The Letters of Achsa McEachern & Elvis Presley	Books	3	1	48	N	N	Goodbye to The Ballads of Yesteryear.	This is really quite juvenile about a young teenager with a crush on a new singer, who is definitely different from the sedate crooners (Perry Como) and belters (Eddie Fisher) of that era.  The music changed in the Fifties from the movie music of the Thirties and Forties.  It has changed many times since and will continue to change as people's tasts in music changes.    The only thing to stay static is classical.  Jazz can be improvised, but classical stays the same.  Ballads were the country folk music before country was even country.  Most of the hillbilly about affairs and broken-hearted women came right out of the ballads.  Listen to \\"The Long Black Veil.\\"    Now, these fictitious letters from a fan to a rising star are pretty silly.  I know because I was a young teen back then, and I did not like Elvis Presley at all.  He was vulgar.  Frank Sinatra was the star of movies and music then, as was pure Pat Boone from Tennessee.  Tennessee Ernie Ford sang the hymns and something silly called 'Sixteen Tons.'  Dinah Shore had her own fashion/music show (she was the Loretta Young of country) with her old-home grace -- that was before Minnie Pearl came into being.      I had a cheap phonograph which looked like that featured on the cover.  As I recall, the turntables in radio stations were a lot different.  She relates how she took a record to one of the stations and it was being played out over the airways, but she could not hear anything in the studio.  All the deejay had to do was flip a switch and boom! the music was louder than the bass the young (and not-so-young) play in their cars to get notice.  I spent many wonderful afternoons visiting local stations to get Eddie Fisher on, as I was the president of \\"The Fisher Notes.\\"   We had a call-in \\"Relay\\" hosted by Bill Ross, a UT student from who-knows-where (I think he was a Cherokee Indian.), and as soon as you requested a certain song, it was on the air.  I would usually request \\"Sunshine Girl.\\"  Sounds good, but it was sad, about a girl who was left at the altar in the lurch.  Since I had no pretensions of ever being at the altar, it didn't bother me that she was deserted before anything ever began.    Life in the Fifties was good and innocent.  The older college kids had private parties around town where liquor was available.   I went to only one, and it was no fun.  In 1955, Patti Page was the rage (I pantomimed some of her songs on a t.v. local talent show; I remember doing \\"Allegheny Moon.\\").  Pat Boone with his white suede shoes was squeeky clean, as was Alan Ladd with his white cowboy boots in the movies.    Elvis came along and tossed his head, twisted his torso, and nothing was ever the same again.  Certainly not for this young, impressionable girl who claimed to have written letters to him.  I had a penpal in Sabadell, Spain, about that time who was amoured with Frank Sinatra recordings.  My photo was in YOUR HIT PARADE magazine, and his brother had written to me at first, then Carlos and I became long-distance friends.  He was a few years older than I and expected me to be more sophisticated than I was.  After all, how can a young girl in Knoxville, Tennessee, ever be sophisticated?  That's almost an impossibility even today.  They may dress adult, but their thinking is backward and uneducated.    Diane Thomas used this device for her first novel.  I tried to review A WOMAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS to a literary club when I was a young matron, at the college, and it bored them to tears.  I had thought that the letters made the characters \\"human\\" when actually it was just the opposite.  Like these purportedly written by a young Elvis, who had no friends of his own and reached out to a disabled girl for solace.  He lived his stardom too fast, and it burned out.    Ms. Thomas and Dr. Aaron J. Gelber are big Elvis fans.  Thousands flock to Graceland every year in August, you'd think they'd go in January (his birthday), but I was told by a local woman that a t-shirt there costs $15.00.  For a devoted fan, it's okay to throw away money on junk; personally, I'd save and spend it on music.  There is an Elvis Museum in Pigeon Forge, and the Love Chapel in Gatlingburg, Tennessee. Music is the name of the game, and the spirit from within.  We all have it; it just comes in different flavors.	2005-10-12

This 'trekker' tribute was written by a Buddhist-loving fan of all genres in which 'Star Trek' appeared from 1966 on.  He lived in  Kathmandu for awhile and is a fan of Dalai Lama, also.  He mentions the science fiction writer, Arthur Clarke as a guide to the motorcycle cop who invented the land of Captain Kirk and his crew along with the 'Enterprise.' <br /> <br />In 1997, Gene Roddenberry's ashes, along with those of LSD guru Timothy Leary and twenty-two other individuals whose families paid $4,800 for the tiny tubes the size of a cigar as they were fired into orbit aboard a Pegasus rocket.  After six years, that would make it 2003, the satellite would become a shooting star as it disintegrated into the night sky.  He had higher dreams for Roddenberry's (The Great Bird) legacy, \\"they should be tucked into the armature of some interstellar probe, with digitally encoded episodes of the 'Star Trek' series. <br /> <br />From the comic books to the t.v. series, the crew are still a part of the lives of fans in obscure areas of the world.  The movies were not as well-received, reaping almost $100,000 for one of them.  Examples of the show's lingo can be heard in Belfast, Tokyo, Berling, London -- anywhere television can be seen. <br /> <br />The 'Enterprise' may be the most famous vehicle since Noah's Ark; more popular that Dr. Who's telephone time-travel box, and Mrs. Peel's fancy car, even Get Smart's shoe phone.  England's rocketeer can't be more newsworthy than Homer Hickman of West Virginia ('October Sky' film was made in Knoxville and the surrounding area).  The stars are gone now, but the spirit will live on. <br /> <br />Since I didn't watch any of the t.v. '60s series (though my boys did), I saw some of the movies.  \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" was Greek to me, a landlubber.  That space lingo sounded more like Fred & Wilma (Betty & Barney) in prehistoric fantasy world.  Now, I did see all of the 'Star Wars' movies. <br /> <br />Jeff Greenwald's 'Star Trek' was a place\\"where humanity's highest calling was exploration\\" (like America's real space program) and its values were freedom and compassion.  In America, we have a semblance of freedom but compassion is sorely lacking.  Only a made-up comic book world can have both simultaneously.  Jeff has also written FEARLESS SALES, SIZE OF THE WORLD, and SCRATCHING THE SURFACE (2002).	2005-10-11

Nothing I can find on Amazon about this writer, so apparently he/she is using an alias.  Before the series from which this story comes, there was another called \\"Magic: The Gathering\\" using different writers for the separate episodes.  Mark Sumner did THE PRODIGAL SORCERER.  Then, he came up with the series, \\"News From the Edge\\" about a tabloid which is 99% trash.<br /><br />In this one, the female reporter who 'works' for something called 'Global Query,' and sets out to interview a real-live vampire.  Williams Crossing here is based on Chester, Vermont, in many ways.  In 2000, NBC used these three books, others are INSANITY, ILLINOIS and THE MONSTER OF MINNESOTA, as a fill-in midseason replacement; didn't see it so don't know how they stretched these three short novels into a t.v. series.<br /><br />There was something similar on the SciFi cable channel in 2001 called 'The Chronicle.'  The female reporter has much to learn about interviews.  First, with a vampire, you don't stand close enough for him to bite you anywhere.  When's the body disappears completely, she has to wonder had it been a ghost, apparition, or merely a figment of her imagination.  She wants to find some truth out there, but no, this has nothing in common with the \\"Cat Who\\" books, nor George Martin's book about vampires.  Now, that is a scary book.  These make-believe monsters are like something out of a low-budget movie (and that's pure nonsense).	2005-10-11

There is a subject index and an author index.  A bit of nonsense, but D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee must have had fun chosing what they considered the worst of the lot.  Of course, everyone has his own opinion and, what's bad for someone may be good to someone else and vice versa.  That's what a reviewer if for, to cause another to think differently from what he might otherwise.  But, of course, you must have an open mind.	2005-10-10

It is said that Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492. At least that is what all elementary school children were always taught: \\"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.\\" Of course, Columbus never did \\"discover\\" North America, and the regions he did explore were already inhabited.   Nova investigated the history and authenticity of the Vinland Map, a document believed by some to be the first to depict America, and to date to 1440, half a century before Columbus' famous voyage. There are accounts the Vinland Sagas, 13th-century chronicles that relate Leif Erikson's discovery of Vinland.  <br /> <br />He only discovered them from the viewpoint of the Europeans. Yet his first voyage did prove one thing for sure, that the earth was not only round, but that it was bigger than he had thought, Eratosthenes notwithstanding. In Washington state, the 9,000-year-old Kennewick Man was a rare find. Only a handful of skeletons this old had ever been found in North America.  <br /> <br />One of the first known celebrations marking the discovery of the \\"New World\\" by Christopher Columbus was in 1792, when a ceremony organized by the Colombian Order was held in New York City honoring Columbus and the 300th anniversary of his landing in the Bahamas.  The Bahamas, a group of 700 islands, dot the Atlantic Ocean from Florida almost to Haiti. Only 30 of the islands are inhabited. When Christopher Columbus first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492, the Arawak Indians were the only inhabitants there. <br /> <br />On October 12, 1866 the Italian population of New York organized the first celebration of the discovery of America. Three years later, in 1869 Italians in San Francisco celebrated October 12 calling it C-Day. How did Christopher Columbus find his way to the \\"New World\\"? He used maps, of course. There was just one problem. His maps were wrong!  <br /> <br />The year is 1492. In three frail boats, Christopher Columbus heads west across the Atlantic Ocean.  Half a world away, on the South China Sea, another ship embarked on a very different kind of journey. In its hold lay the riches of the Far East: intricately embroidered silks and the finest vessels of delicately painted porcelain. These were the treasures that Columbus could only dream of and only China could create.  <br /> <br />Between the 13th and the 16th century, China was the greatest industrial power. Not only in Asia, but I would think in the world. The quality of what China was producing during that period was simply staggering to the vast majority of the consumers in the known world at the time. <br /> <br />On August 2, 1492, Columbus set sail in search of the East Indies. The voyage was financed by Ferdinand and Isabella by making the city of Palos pay back a debt to the crown by providing two of the ships, and by getting Italian financial backing for part of the expenses. The crown had to put up very little money from the treasury.   <br /> <br />Columbus and 90 crewmen boarded the three ships that were to make the first voyage to the New World, the Nia, Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria. On October 12, 1492, Columbus first saw the islands of the new world, landing in the Bahamas. Later in the month, he would sail to Cuba, and to Hispaniola (now Haiti). He thought he had reached the East Indies, the islands off Southeast Asia.  <br /> <br />All educated individuals in the 15th century, and especially sailors, already knew that the earth was round. What was not realized by Columbus, however, was just how big a globe it was. Columbus seriously underestimated the size of the planet.  <br /> <br />On Christmas Day, 1492, the Santa Maria sank off Haiti.  Columbus departed for Spain on January 16, 1493 on the Nia, arriving there on March 4.  Columbus made three additional voyages to the New World. The second voyage set sail in September, 1493, with 17 ships. During his expeditions, he helped to colonize Hispaniola, and discovered the South American mainland.  <br /> <br />He did not, however, see mainland North America during any of his voyages.  He returned to Spain for the last time on November 7, 1504. He died at Valladolid, Spain on May 20, 1506, at the age of 55.   <br /> <br />Much controversy exists over Columbus' expeditions and whether or not one can \\"discover\\" an already-inhabited land. The natives of the Bahamas and other islands on his journey were peaceful and friendly. Yet many of them were later enslaved by the Spanish. Also, it is known that the Vikings explored the North American coast 500 years before Columbus. <br /> <br />To mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus' voyage, in 1892, President Benjamin Harrison made a commemorative proclamation. But it was Colorado, in 1905, that became the first state to observe a Columbus Day. Since 1920 the day has been celebrated annually, and in 1937 President Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed every October 12 as Columbus Day. That's where it remained until 1971 when Congress declared it a federal public holiday on the second Monday in October.	2005-10-09

In 1862, in Baltimore, the Black German used betrayal to risk the life of the woman he loved for the \\"cause.\\"  She in turn betrays another young woman.  Thus is the life and insecurity at the time of a war, any war.    The '48ers were a group of Europeans living in America who fought for the Union.  They were highly educated men and women who'd already developed tools and talents of leadership.  Elizabeth Van Lew, a proud Southern spy for the Union, should have known better.  We would have called her a 'turn-coat.'    The fictional story concerns Eden and Holly, after they join the Sons of Liberty.  Brandon Rolf has a woman, Charise, whose duty is in the undercover world of espionage.  Maryland has the North/South boundary and tried to be non-partisan during the great Civil War.  Feeling Southern sympathies, it is nonetheless a part of the North and most fought for the Union side.  But, then, so did Knoxville, Tennessee.  And I would have been a Confederate spy for sure.	2005-10-08

This book is a study of Elizabeth Cady Stanton's final address in 1892 called \\"Solitude of Self\\" in which she feels the human condition we all suffer sometimes, loneliness.  When she went to London in 1840, the way she was treated made her declare, \\"I am only a woman.\\" <br /> <br />In this different perspective on woman's suffrage and such, the Civil War is called a \\"Revolution\\" of sorts, but it was a fight to the bitter end, a war to remember and which may never be over in people's minds.  She talks about the errors of the past, equality for all, and a century of wrong. <br /> <br />Elizabeth, from upstate New York and later Boston, was concerned with aboliton, suffrage, and the power of religious doctrine.  She spoke in the Grand Opera House in 1975 Chicago to a standing-room only audience.  She was a political activist of her time. This book is based on letters, diaries, speeches, and Mrs. Stanton's THE WOMEN'S BIBLE. <br /> <br />Vivian Gornick has written FIERCE ATTACHMENTS and APPROACHING EYE LEVEL previously.	2005-10-08

For thirty years now, a new kind of astronomy called \\"state of gravitational wave\\" has been taking place as we get ready to \\"listen\\" to what is out there.  Gravitational waves are \\"ripples in space time.\\"  These infinte waves when they do happen will not disturb the placement of objects in four-dimensional space time (what we live in), but they may change the distance between them by stretching space time itself in one direction while compressing it in the other.  Einstein predicted this in 1916 in his general theory of relativity. <br /> <br />Now, in LSU Physics Department, the mathematicians and physists (college instructors, not astronomers) have built LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.  First, they used ALLEGRO to listen since 1991 but as yet no sound has come forth, to show us that there is indeed some intelligent species besides our own.  In ALLEGRO, they used liquid nitrogen (77 degrees K) which can burn out pre-cancers but leave behind masses of scar tissue on a human's face.  The second chamber used liquid helium (4.2 degrees K, the lowest temperature possible in nature). <br /> <br />The two LIGO detectors sensitive to different frequencies are waiting to hear the sound like a big, low-pitched bird.  The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LIGO) is the latest in technology which will track three spacecraft orbiting the sun in formation.  The gravitational wave detector outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will fliter out noise as it waits for the subtle shiver of a gravitational wave passing by. <br /> <br />These waves carry information about extreme astronomical processes now unknowable any other way.  NASA and the European Space Agency are working together for an experiment with LISA in 2014.  Astronomers have observed indirect evidence of this phenonenom with two white dwarf stars circling each other. As they spiral inward  they will fuse into a single mass.  We are eagerly awaiting ET as the changes in gravitational fields send shudders across the universe.   <br /> <br />Thirty years of research and expensive equipment worldwide, but no evidence of what we are waiting or looking for.  Maybe soon, if ET decides to come back to Earth.  In the meantime, we wait and wonder.	2005-10-08

This one is no amateur, as he'd been proclaimed \\"cured\\" and deemed no longer a danger to society.  He was a Jack the Ripper of the past.  Edward Teague doesn't leave proof. <br /> <br />Dr. Winkler left clues as to his next victim, spelling out the word, Stalker.  St. Louis was circled on his map, as were Toledo, Akron, Louisville, Kokomo, Indianapolis, Niles, and Grand Rapids.  This guy did get around.  He'd been trained as a youngster to be a deer stalker, and used that knowledge to choose his victims in bars, on the streets, at parties, wherever.   <br /> <br />He's on a cross-country hunt, Nazi-style, as he is clearly smarter than the law and knows how to circumnavigate around their messes.  He has cunning and precision, honed while locked away, and enjoyed the thrill of the chase as he outran and out-maneuvered the police detectives.  He is a sadistic killer who has returned home to take his revenge and have a bit of fun choosing his victims.  He got his thrills from watching the terror the 'willing' victims had brought down on themselves. <br /> <br />A stalker is dangerous, as you never know when he may go 'off' and decide that 'this is the day' to do his business and get it over with.  The D.A.'s office investigates but don't do anything to prevent the crime.  If there were no crime, there'd be no need for a District Attorney and his enclave of lawyers no capable of having an office of their own.  Crimes and criminals are their business.  This one thinks he is above the law, but no one ever is.  They all get caught in the end.  And God will cause the perpetrator more pain than he could ever possibly put on his victims.  He may tell himself that they were 'just asking for it,' but that is not the answer.  A crime is a crime and must be vindicated.	2005-10-08

There was a children's game I remember seemed puzzling, pulling the pedals off a white daisy saying \\"He loves me, he loves me now.\\"  If the pedals are uneven, you have a happy feeling of being loved.  If they are even, you feel let down because \\"he loves me not.\\"  No matter how many daises you demean, the result is not always the same.  What's puzzling about that quandry?  Who is he?!  A child is too young to feel romantic or sexual love.  Wendy uses this little rhyme to make some sense out of the valentines Rose finds in her mailbox that year. <br /> <br />These are not bought cards, candy in heart-shaped boxes (though a stranger handed me one in Walgreen's one year, one in many he was buying for all the women in his life); the crudely-made \\"paper hearts with no verse or signature, were not the gift of a 'secret admirer.'\\"  He was a stalker -- watching Rose at her 48 Shorewood Lane address.  That Valentine's Day was snowy, and he left footprints outside her windows.  I remember one February the snow weas so deep in middle Tennessee (close to Alabama), and the roads icy.  It seemed to take forever to walk in a roundabout way in the middle of the pavement to mail Valentine cards to my sons.  It took so long to ge to the post office and back home I ended up with a very bad cold.  Rose's stalker is a twisted killer with Tourette Syndrome and used violence against the three young women like that monster assassin did to the young professional woman in the movie, 'Red Eye.' <br /> <br />Liza receoved a business proposition: \\"Dear Ms. Danning:  As you may or may not be aware, I am the author of several best-selling spy novels over the past ten years.  Since my editor retired last month, I have been searching for a new home for my novels.  Would you be interested in meeting me to discuss this possibility?  Enclosed is a round-trip train ticket to Westwood, Rhode Island, for the second week of February.  You will stay at the Bramble Rose Inn.  It is imperative that you keepthis metting confidential.  Sincerely, David Micahel Yates.\\"  Liza wondered, \\"How on earth did he decide on me of all people?\\"  He is an eccentric recluse whose face is unknown as he will not allow his photo to be on his books.  It is rumored that his face is deformed, shot up in Vietnam; or the fact that he may be a woman.  She'd read in an article that he was about to depart for Europe to research his newest novel and was seeking a new publisher. <br /> <br />Jennie received a letter also:  \\"Dear Ms. Towne:  It is our pleasure to inform you that you have won the grand prize  and hereby entitled to an all-expenses-paid weekend in February at the Bramble Rose Inn.  Sincerely, Jasper Hammel, Innkeeper.\\"    She was to get rount-trip transportation on the Crosswinds Bay ferry.  He lures the three women, Rose, Liza, Jennie (posing as Laura) to a magical weekend.  This is the culmination of much planning, as he has been watching them for so long now.  It is predicted to be a 'stormy' weekend in February. <br /> <br /> <br />Wendy Corsi Staub has also written ALL THE WAY HOME, FADE TO BLACK, and DEARLY BELOVED.  This is a nice little thriller in the guise of a romance gone bad.  Nothing and no one will ever be the same after this Valentine's Day.	2005-10-07

In this book, you will find information about leaders we have heard of. some famous and some infamous.  Khomeini Auyatollah, Osama bin Laden, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Jelal Talabani, Kind Faisal I & II, and Saddam Hussein.  American generals include Norman Schwarzkopf and General David Petraeus.  Theirs is a history of duplicity and violence against others.  One of the triumps of the Bush administration's Iraq policy is that \\"they managed to create an environment in which Americans, rather than being thanked, are more likely to be abducted and decapitated if they walk down a street alone.\\" <br /> <br />Iraq was born in the aftermath of WWI, as the Allies carved up the Ottoman Empire and created the nations of the modern Middle East.  The British created an Iraqi government modeled on their own, with a constitutional monarchy established.  Faisal I was chosen to be elected the first King, and his relaitonship with T. E. Lawrence is shown in the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia.' <br /> <br />When wars end, generally the battlefield is cleaned up.  After WWII, warships were mothballed and the California desert was filled with old warplanes.  That would be a sight to see!  When the Cold War was over, USA did nothing to decomission its proxies (tyrants created and sustained in power), and it is now paying the price.  In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda were formed as terrorist groups against their own people. <br /> <br />\\"Life without problems is not interesting\\" and \\"We each have a role to play\\" introduce you to the integrity and devotion of Ahmad Shawkat to his family and to his country.  He felt helpless and told the author, \\"Only America has the power to do these things.\\"    Ahmad looked like someone I know here, Jim Nahmad, always on the prowl to find lost people whom he can help.  Ahmad took chances and went into war torn areas, and paid the price, just as America paid for their intervention with the deaths on 9/11/01.  If you are a listener to Public Radio, you willl haveheard Goldfarb's \\"Inside Out\\" program.  He won the Edward R. Morrow award for one of his features on Ahmad. <br /> <br />I had a doctor called Ahmed.  They said he came to America from India.  I once worked as a medical transcriptionist for Dr. Z also from India.  I became friends with his sister-in-law who, with her two brothers, attended Vo-Tech when I did.  They are secretitive people, innocent in a way about America's abundance, and hire family to work in their offices.  Dr. Z. had his connected to the local hospital; on Secretaries Day, even though I was not one of his employees, I was invited to have a meal with them and he told me, \\"Betty, when I was in school in Chicago, I actually laughed.\\"  I would ask sometimes if he ever smiled; his wife was always smiling.   The different cultures keep nationalities apart as they feel they cannot trust each other and thus, deception rules.  Ahmed is young and agrees that he does not know how to get a specialist, or prescribe the needed medicines.  He was personable, but incompetent as a family doctor.  He wanted to be a specialist and so charged accordingly. <br /> <br />\\"Admad began to feel freedom at last with the fall of Saddam.  He had a newspaper in which he decried terrorists in his editorials.  He as murdered  as a result.  Goldfarb won the Lowell Thomas award for his report about British Jihad in 2005.	2005-10-07

I would call Margaret Atwood a well-rounded writer in all its genres.  She is a Canadian writer, winner of many awards. This new volume includes essays, reviews, and personal prose; her earlier collection such as this, was the 1982 SECOND WORDS.    Writing with intent includes different styles, purpose and motivation, character and plot development, process of historical fiction and writing on political topics.  Her review of Bill McKibben's ENOUGH: STAYING HUMAN IN AN ENGINEERED AGE, dwells on tenetic alteration (cloning), nanotechnology, cybernetics and cryogenics.  \\"Eternal life has only been humanity's great dream since the moment we became conscious.\\"  The pursuit of happiness is what human dreams are made of.  If we were all the same, there would be no need to read Shakespeare or Dante.  There would be knowledge, but no wisdom.  \\"We should leave well enough alone,\\" he avers.    The review she did of Orphan Pamuks' SNOW helpmed make it a bestseller in 2004.  I reviewed it some time ago.  Looking at her reviews made me realize how amateurish mine are, but the difference is that she's a 'pro' and I'm just having fun.    She wrote about Ursula K. LeGuin and her writer mother.  Ursula has eighteen novels of fantasy and science fiction, and ten collections of stories.  Her stories never seem to crash, like our Internet e-mail programs.   There are all kinds of Biblical connotations concerning the left hand.  Although the left hand is the sinister one, God has a left hand so left hands can't all be bad.  The thief was at the left hand of Christ.  The decisive blows are struck left-handed.  Happy Birthday to my left-handed son.  In the painting, \\"The Prodigal Son,\\" his left hand is feminine.    In fiction, Margaret Atwood's work includes CAT'S EYE, BLUEBEARD'S EGG, and BODILY HARM; in non-fiction, DAYS OF THE REBELS, STRANGE THINGS and MOVING TARGETS.  She has written juvenile storybooks for children, FOR THE BIRDS, ANA'S PET, and UP IN THE TREE.  Her poetry includesPOWER POLITICS, INTERLUNAR, and YOU ARE HAPPY.  Today is a good day to be happy.	2005-10-06

This is a definitive history of one of the world's loveliest art froms, from the weaving by young Persian girls, \\"a carpet is poetry itself; you just have to learn to read them.\\"  At the bazaars where they are \\"traded,\\" mystic poets find 'grace and magic' in their timeless design.  \\"Every carpet carries its own story\\" (it is believed they are \\"our soul\\" by those who perform the art) and narrative as the weavers strive for perfection in each design. <br /> <br />I had an orange oriental room-size rug I had to re-claim to bring to my temporary room at the \\"Y\\" to cover a stained and ugly rug in a place with water-stained walls.  The carpet added just the bit of class to go along with the beautiful sunsets over the Sunsphere to inspire my return home, the second time.  I moved it to an apartment to cover a filthy wall-to-wall cheap rug.  Six months later, I found a brand-new apartment and decided not to take it with me, so I gave it to a young man who was always having sales and was good at persuading me to buy things at cheap prices which I did not need.  I said, \\"You could probably get fifteen or twenty dollars for it.\\"  He replied, \\"I will clean it and use it myself as I've always wanted an oriental rug and, thanks to you, I'll now have my own.\\" <br /> <br />There is a unique small building in Bearden, near Homberg Place, with rugs painted on the side, and now that branch of the Harb family is going out of business.  Vendors come to one of the malls occasionally and sell these out of a huge tent.  The madder plant is used for dye, as its brillian red hue adds a spark to the handwoven carpets. <br /> <br />It is a famous and durable Turkey Red used in Alladin's Magic Carpet, pictured on the covers of this book.  Wild madder fields abound in Iran.  Three hundred years ago, (1730s) in an obscure footnote in a medical paper by Dr. Calchier, \\"It can turn our bones red,\\" if eaten.  It gets in the skin of the dyers, \\"no amount of washing can get it out.\\"  It's a powerful thing. <br /> <br />A bit of history: Alexander the Great took over Persia in 334 BC (died nine years later).  Mongol conquerors under Genghis Khan invaded this area in 1220 c.  The Taliban took control under Osama bin Laden in 1996, toppled in 2001 by USA.   Elections took place there in 2004.  A German chemist, Harald Boehmer investigated the dyeing process of the older, natural colors, finding not only the Turkey Red by also Burnt Orange.  \\"We drove north toward the madder fields and back into carpet history.\\" <br /> <br />Brian Murphy wrote THE NEW MEN: INSIDE THE VATICAN'S ELITE SCHOOL FOR AMERICAN PRIESTS.  He lives in Athens, Greece, and has been writer for the Associated Press since 1993.	2005-10-06

It had been seven years since Richard disappeared with Emma, and Susan had just about giving up ever hearing what happened.  Then a sheriff called to say the SUV had been located under a train tresle with his body but an empty infant seat in the back.   <br /> <br />\\"Monday's child is fair of face; <br />Tuesday's child is full of grace; <br />Wednesday's child is full of woe; <br />Thursday's child has far to go. <br />Friday's child is loving and giving;  <br />Saturday's child works hard for its living; <br />But the child born on the Sabbath day <br />  Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.\\" <br /> <br />Jeremiah in the Old Testament used to be my favorite prophet because he was called the prophet of doom.  Perhaps, like Emma, I had been a Wednesday child.  We are the survivors.  Maybe 'woeful' leaves a bad connotation, but it doesn't necessarily mean hopeless. <br /> <br />Richard had been killed before the vehicle was pushed into the water at a curve, where such accidents occur occasionally.  Emma had survived and eventually with the persistence of Susan was found.  They both lead a better, brighter life that that with Richard, as he was unreliable, and it was thought that he might have had another woman. <br /> <br />This is a \\"gripping tale of tension-filled romance and heart-stopping suspense.\\"  Gayle Wilson has written DOUBLE BLIND and TAKE NO PRISONERS.

What if we could communicate with each other simply by thinking about it?  I try that all the time but I don't know if it works.  Now, researchers have developed techniques to connect a human's mind to robots and computers across the Internet.  Using brain implants to restore motion to the paralyzed and sight to blind people allow some patients to control robots (and computers) simply by thinking about it!    'Serenity' is closer to the truth, though based in 2046, with the behavior modification used on rebellious recruits.  It gave power and strength to a skinny little girl, River, with fighting skills of a giant.  I saw the tallest man I ever did see at the post office the other morning, and it was scary seeing how long and skinny his legs were.    Is it good to alter our minds?  I've watched the hypnotist at the fair make \\"normal\\" volunteers from the group watching act silly and do ridiculous things.  I had decided that he'd hypotized them with his melodious, deep voice, as his personality was not spectacular.    Labs worldwide are dabbling with cloning, stem cell research, and genetic engineering as shown so clearly in the movie, 'The Island,' craeting ethical dilemmas as to the \\"rightness\\" to change people in this manner.  The United States of America have imposed severe limits on government funding for stem cell research, but have left the private sector to do what it wants.  Though embryonic stem cell science got its start in the States, the rest of the world is fighting to take the lead.    We were not granted life extensions, which may be possible in the future, but at what cost?  Will it make life better for the \\"altered\\" or will it turn them into robots as in 'The Stepford Wives\\"?  Bodies are flexible; by contrast, \\"our computers are simple, rigid, specialized things.  An e-mail program will never learn to handle voice-mail, despite the similarity between the two.\\"  Voice mail is available on some of the Internet carriers now, but you would need a new, energized system with plenty of memory space.    Should we fear change?  Ramaz Naam doesn't think so.  Thanks to him, I am able to use Internet Explorer to clear out the junk in my daily computing so this old computer will go another day.    He was also intrumental in developing Microsoft Outlook, but that is something I haven't tried.  I am still a novice on the computer, learned word processing some years ago, which come in handy on these reviews.	2005-10-05

This novel based on an actual family portrays the wealthy, privileged families on Manhattan's Upper East Side.  He traces the Carnochan clan in American; the first, David, came to New York in 1829 from Glasgow, Scotland \\"to establish a branch of the family's successful thread business\\" and thrived during the Civil War.  David's youngest son, Peter was a Civil War hero.  David died in 1869, after the war, and Peter's remembrances get the story started.    Four generations are traced, mostly men with names of Bruce, Gordon, Maime, Ronny and Pierre.  Some women, Louisa, Estelle, plus Eliza and Alida who married into the Carnochan family.  By the twentieth century, the'd become lawyers, investment (stocks and bonds), all reputable high class occupations.  In 1918, Pierre went to Harvard and on to Wall Street.  \\"A wife can be a great asset, or a great liability.\\"  This was the world of debutantes.  His cousin went to Yale and became a lawyer with his family's firm.  They were a close knit group.    Louisa (called LouLou) was born in 1890 and died in 1955.  She'd been a nurse who wished she could have gone on to be a doctor.  Her older sister, a dear little thing, Betty, was the \\"beauty\\" of the family.    As we saw in the movie, 'West Side Story,' the gangs and lower classes were on opposite ends of town, as is the case with Knoxville today, only to the contrary -- the wealthy live out West of town with the gangs in the east and north.  In Chicago, wealth moved North and left the Southside to ethnic groups around the University area.  Older houses with walk-up apartments, cheaper one on the top, abound and Geoff sublet a top floor with a multiple, changing \\"boarders\\" as time went by.    Louis Auchincloss came from the upper crust and was declared a \\"living landmark\\" in 2000.  His portrait on inside of back cover is by Cornelia Foss.  He has written a slew of novels (60+), his first in 1947, THE INDIFFERENT CHILDREN, and a few non-fiction.  From the list of many, these titles appealed to me: THE RECTOR OF JUSTIN (which I own), THE CAT AND THE KING, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and MANHATTAN MONOLOGUES.  Non-fiction includes RICHELIEU and THE VANDERBILT ERA.  The front portrait is deceiving as she is not a member of the Carnochan clan.	2005-10-05

This was the 21st of the 'cat who' mysteries and proves that felines do indeed have gifts of perception and instincts.  I like cats, and I like to look at the stars -- so I thought this was just up my alley, so to speak, to keep my mind occupied.<br /><br />Koko, a superior Siamese, showed odd behavior when something strange was going on; his actions could forecast important events.  His owner had moved to the beach house on Lake Superior and, before you know it, two deaths occur, possibly involving drugs.  Koko's \\"psychic tendencies\\" located the first body buried under the deep sand near Seagull Point.  \\"To watch him struggle through that ... would have been comic if it weren't that he was dead serious.\\"  The whole expedition was his idea.<br /><br />One day, Star my cat whose mother was half-Siamese, was restless and wanted to go outside, very unusual for her as she has her special place under the bed to hide.  That day, she was so uptight about something I put the collar and leash I had gotten for her Christmas gift along with a fancy carrier which is too small for her, and we took a little walk to see if she needed to eat some grass.  I carried her around the building and, as we started in the front door, one old woman said \\"Keep that cat away from me; they are as dangerous as snakes.\\"  Whoever heard such a thing?!<br /><br />Koko solved that mystery of the student whose backpack had been tossed aside and Koko's superior intelligence to his sixty whiskers had not changed since the incident.  He ruled the roost, \\"still handsome, intelligent, companionable, unpredictable, somewhat imperious, and frequently exasperating\\" -- not to leave out 'enigmatic.'  But his odd behavior and premonition didn't stop there.  He started spending hours in the dark on the porch watching the sky; he was not seeing stars when he gazed upwards, but aliens from outer space.  Could UFOs really be hovering over the crime scene in the night sky?<br /><br />There is a legion of these books,three of which are THE CAT WHO LIVED HIGH, THE CAT WHO WENT UP THE CREEK and THE CAT WHO WENT INTO THE CLOSET.  Makes the reader wonder if C. S. (Jack) Lewis owned a cat to inspire his Nardia Chronicles in that closet of his.	2005-10-04

This book is about the world of magic in the early 1900's full of illusion and sometimes deception at the time vaudeville was being formed.  Described as a combination of minstrel (Al Jolson), circus (fire-breathing acts), and variety saloons (singing, dancing), along comes William E. Robinson who leads a double life. <br /> <br />He'd been the backstage manager for Hermann the Great, America's #1 magician, and married his assistant.  They re-invented themselves as the \\"Marvelous Chinese Conjurer,\\" Chung Ling Soo, and Suee Seen (Water Lily).  He was a New Yorker and performed in the Black Art act, costumed as a king at the Bijou before he went out on his own.  Harry Kellar, born in Erie, Pennsylvania, was the #2 magician at the time. <br /> <br />As the Chinese marvel, Robinson wore an oriental costume with long pig-tail and slippers with up-turned toes.  London had a whole troup of Chinese performers led by Ling Soo, and they arrived at the theaters in a long red Panhard touring car, top down, in style.  In England, he also formed a second family with wife, Lou, and three children, Hector, Mary, and Ellsworth. <br /> <br />There is a picture on p. 387 of him in costume, about to catch the bullet with a porcelian plate, the act in which he was killed.  After his death, an investigation revealed the deception played out on the world stage, not just Amreica.	2005-10-04

This memoir traces the secret life of the author's father in Israel (in its early days), the coming to terms with her father's past, and the background of the founding of Israel and all it entailed.  She enjoyed hearing her father's 'stories' of his life in Israel, where he had been a member of scientists and idealists, summoned by David Ben-Gurion to develop weapons for defense.   <br /> <br />Bentov had jokingly called himself \\"Invention-a-Minute Ben\\" but she had no idea how important his invention of the first rocket launcher was to the war of Independence, and why he left that new state and came to United States of America.  During the Arab-Israeli conflict, there were five invading armies, and the team of men and women who had to come up with the alternative to death worked around the clock.  It was her father, in fact, who came up with the weapon called Loretta; another was developed with a two-inch-bore, but Ben's had only a one-inch-bore. <br /> <br />\\"While challenging the David-and-Goliath myth, historians agree on the hardships of the first round of the invasion, before the truce on June 11, 1948.  A movie was made, 'Exodus,' and Pat Boone wrote the words to the song used in that docudrama.  She looks on the photograph of this group of the brightest and bravest, many of them refugees from Europe, she seems to have a jaded eye on the group which was called Hemmed. <br /> <br />For the book, she traveled to Israel and interview many of the scientists.  All admired and liked her jolly father, he was at the center of the picture, as he must have been in all of the plans to save his people.  I wonder who that is pretending to be Hitler on the left with mustache, hat and raincoat.  No one else was dressed in that fashion.  It reminds me of the way Mrs. Keys described Julius Rosenberg when she might accidentally run into him on the elevator of the apartment house where they both lived in New York.  He always wore a trench coat and hat as if he had something to hide, she'd related. <br /> <br />She began her search for the truth about her father in his basement laboratory.  The 'telling' is to tell the truth as she lived it, later discovered it, and believes it to be.  This was a self-discovery voyage into the past and the future of Israel. <br />Happy New Year, Rabbi.	2005-10-04

He was probably the best known broadcaster in the world, and his signature sign off was \\"So long, until tomorrow\\" being he was a staple in our lives.  We could depend on him to take us to places we'd only dreamed of; he was there. <br /> <br />In this book, SO LONG UNTIL TOMORROW, Lowell Thomas relates how  many years earlier, he was the first American invited to this exquisitely beautiful and special place in what seemed to be a God-forsaken location. He broadcast the first radio show from Potala and Lhasa as his regular \\"on the road\\" newscast. Getting there was an ordeal because of the terrain; getting back down off these highest mountain ranges in the world was even worse. <br /> <br />When the animal carrying him fell, Lowell Thomas suffered broken bones which created severe pain and hhe had to be airlifted out to civilization.  It was a major event in his life, and if he were alive, he would surely do it all over again.	2005-10-04

For many  years I have been interested in this enchanting land.   A group of Tibetan nuns came here last year to perform a religious ritual at Border's across from West Town Mall. It was a colorful and awe-inspiring thing to watch as they took turns using different shades of sand to create a Sand Mandala. The design they used here had the colors of green, dark blue, yellow, outlined in pink with the inner parts containing their religious symbols in black, turquoise and light blue.  Most times the Tibetans use the five colors which represent different aspects of life in Tibet.In  addition to sand, the nun told me that precious stones (crushed) which were very expensive were used. To them, it is not merely beauty they create, but a significant icon used as a blessing when it is completed. It was fascinating to watch this beauty take place right before our eyes. <br /> <br />A large gathering of watchers enjoyed the sight.  I was struck by the appearance of these young women who had shaved their heads. This is a common practice in Tibet.   I spoke with one of the nuns (the designated English-language spokesperson); when I asked why they had chosen Knoxville as one of the three or four cities to perform this all-day event, she stated they want other countries to be aware of the stifling conditions in Tibet after China took over their little principality. She feels strongly that it is imperative to spread the word of their peril at the hands of the Chinese officials. I told her that since I have been interested in Tibet for a long time that I am aware of this persecution they are enduring. <br /> <br />I asked if they'd been to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where a group of Tibean monks live in convents up in the hills. She said they had visited there before coming to Knoxville and was surprised I knew they resided in that region. I asked again why they came toKnoxville and she explained that there is an active Buddhist group here supporting their efforts at regaining their much-cherished religious freedom. <br /> <br />A favorite actor of mine, Richard Gere, is a practicing Buddhist and marvelous spokesman -- he's the perfect example we were taught to revere in the \\"old days\\": one who \\"shows\\" by \\"doing.\\" <br /> <br />The lure of the East captivates and attracts the minds of intellectuals as well as adventurers.  In Tibetan culture, art is a form of spiritual meditation. For the various colors, they use ground up minerals and precious stones (also gold dust). The designs are intricate and suggest a sense of harmony using traditional images. <br /> <br />It was inevitable that Red China would invade Tibet. It happened on October 7, 1950. Thirty years after the Dahlia Lama went into exile in India, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.	2005-10-04

This was my introduction to Paul Theroux, first with the cassette read by Paul Pritchard, then I ordered to book so that I could review it for the Magazine Club.  He has a way with communicating with people and gives good character analysis. <br /> <br />Reading Paul Theroux's factual account of his trip through China in RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER several years ago, I was impressed that he was brave enough to go where others dared not. His account of the car ride over the Himalayas resulting in an accident and the aid the erratic driver and he received to toll the vehicle to a safe location, the forbidden photos of the Dahlai Lama he distributed along the way while being persued by the Chinese officials made for many daring adventures and close calls before he reached his destination. <br /> <br />I am thinking he no doubt had read H. Harrer's SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET (on which a movie was based) which was originally published in 1953. Harrer was only in his twenties when he spent this time during and after WWII in the 1940s. He observed that the Tibetans are a laughter-loving folk. Since he and his fellow traveler had let their hair and beards grow during the strenuous trek to the holy city, he noticed that, like all Mongols, the <br />Tibetan men have almost no hair on their faces or bodies. Some of the peasants wear a pony tail, but most shave their heads.  He went on to write RETURN TO TIBET. <br /> <br />Paul made many trips, another on a different train, another in China on a boat, and many in his mind.  He influenced my thinking more than any other human being as I read his nonfiction and O-ZONE.  His other fiction was not easy to decipher.  I thought MY SECRET HISTORY was truth, but he admitted later it was all myths, the things he wished he had experienced.  This writer was an intrepid traveler and explorer in his youth, from Peace Corps in Africa to places far and wide. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

The cover shows an irreverent funny man, and this book is written for macho men as he takes on any and everyone in the federal government from the president on down.  It must be his New York years to make him look down on the important people who run the government in Washington, D.C.  What he is forgetting is that the states elect those people and send them there -- at least, some of them.    One truthful thing, which other columnists and nonfiction writers won't admit:  \\"I sat around and made the stuff up.\\"  His chart explaining how Social Security works is informative, and just might be true -- truer than he thinks.  He hates old people, thinks they're more interested in having sex than those able to produce a baby!  Has he looked around and seen all that skin young people expose now in today's way of dressing?      \\"To compensate for the lack of facts, I have included ... snide remarks.\\"  So true.   Making fun of the words which came out of JFK's mouth into a parody \\"in the course of human events (that's Lyndon's thinking) it behooves us, the people, not to ask 'What can our country do for us. anyway?' but rather, whether we have anything to fear except fear itself\\" (FDR) -- the original phrase which moved the Sixties Americans came from a smart speechwriter.    It wouldn't hurt the privileged of today to consider what they can do for this country.  Dave Barry does his best to keep people laughing.  Being too serious about serious matter we can't do anything about only causes you to feel bad.  Who wants that?    He should take on district, regional, etc. government offices, especially GSA, the glorified housekeeping department of the U. S. Govt.  I've tangled with two in Tennessee who are tough old soldiers (one even had military training as a \\"Ranger\\" and now he spends his days worrying about how to get rid of pigeons).  The other, his superior, in Nashville takes off to Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi (who really knows) to be deployed while leaving his Nashville office unattended.  These are old men living off the government worse than welfare people.    \\"Hitting below the belt\\" doesn't mean his crude, bathroom humor and words; it's what the Baptist preacher did when he attacked the Methodist ritual of sprinkling -- then says that only Baptists will get into Heaven.  Seems I heard some other group say that in the past.  I wonder if even Dave would go there.    Other significang pardoies include DAVE BARRY SLEPT HERE, DAVE BARRY IS NOT TAKING THIS SITTING DOWN, and DAVE BARRY DOES JAPAN.	2005-10-03

This is a fitting tribute to the life, works and last days of an author who changed many lives through his writings. His MERE CHRISTIANITY reached out to non-Christians and showed them the way to a better life. But, I think he will best be remembered for the magical world of Narnia he created for children. He'd been born Clive Staples Lewis on November 29, 1898. In 1998, a series of special commemorative stamps was issued, \\"Magical World,\\" featuring THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE. In about two and a half months, the eagerly awaited movie, 'Narnia,' will be in the Regal theaters nationwide and will gather more fans for Jack (C.S.) Lewis.     A musical portrait of his life toured Britain during 1998. Even Hamley's. England's toy shop, hosted a special one-hundredth birthday party in honor of this prodigious writer. It is sad that only fifty people attended his funeral toward the end of November, 1963. On his tombstone is engraved \\"Men ust endure their going hence\\" which had been on the Shakespeare Calendar the day his mother died. At a little past 5:30 p.m. on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Jack gave up the ghost after two or three years of terrible pain from prostate cancer. So, in the passing of C. S. Lewis, all the world's eyes were on their television sets watching the events in Dallas, Texas, play out as Oswald purportedly killed the United States president.    Autumn had always been Jack's favorite season so it is fitting that he ends his life in happiness. October's bright blue sky, even in England of 1960, was lovely as were the beeches which were in their \\"full glory of gold, russet, and amber.\\" Keats called autumn \\"the close-bosomed friend of the maturing sun.\\" That year, the hawthorne bushes were full of crimson haws, and the wild roses were loaded with hips. He came to Cambridge in 1962 to lecture and to finish his last book THE DISCARDED IMAGE. He was in the autmn of his life but he was enjoying an Indian Summer. He'd just finished SURPRISED BY JOY and his book A GRIEF OBSERVED after she died. Yes, he loved the American woman who entered his life so unexpectedly. He also wrote letters of encouragement for some time to an other American woman.    His enduring legacy is the gift his readers receive, that 'sliver of wonder,' which enables them to see beyond the imaginary world to the living God. The lion in the 'Narnia' books was made to appear as Christ-like as he could manage. April is probably the best loved month in Western Europe, as it is here in Knoxville, Tennessee, our beautiful \\"Dogwood\\" celebration. Shakespear wrote of \\"proud-pied April, dressed in all its trim.\\" In April, there is a revitalization of the earth as the birds sing their joyous songs for all to hear. The forget-me-nots are in bloom, and spring green covers the fields. My favorite time of year is the Spring with all of the pastel colors and the feel of life returning after a long winter's sleep.    He was the precursor to all of the inspiration and self-help books which now abound. He had divine inspiration at times, but he was also human. A man with feelings and empathy toward others.	2005-10-03

Written by someone who knows this genre of movie and tries to separate it from the 'thrillers.'  I have always preferred action from the time of the musical, 'West Side Story,' which had so much violence I would not let my young teenage son Justin watch it.  I loved the music, Natalie Wood, and some of the story but I hated the street fighting.  It was not the influence Justin needed in his young life. <br /> <br />Another I loved with Michael Pare in 'The Philadelphia Experiment' full of action and partly science fiction, American style.  He was my blue-eyed strawberry blonde duplicate of Jim Darling.  Eric Lighenfeld mostly talks about some of his favorite action films.  I have seen many of them, but veered away from others for different reasons.  I did not see the Schwarzenegger 'Terminator,' 'Total Recall,' 'True Lies,' or the others he made as I did not want to struggle to understand what he was saying.   <br /> <br />Neither did I watch any of the Clint Eastwood 'Dirty Harry' movies or Stallone's films because of the ugly violence and I don't like to see ugliness when I pay to watch a movie.  I did like Steven Seagal's features but failed to see the 'Death Wish' episodes.  I may have seen 'The Matrix,' but did not watch the sequels, 'Matrix Revolution,\\" or 'The Matrix Reloaded.'  They were just too 'out-of-this-world violent for me.  Most action movies don't bother me except for the loud noises of fighting.  I did like Mel Gibson in 'Braveheart' and 'The Patriot.' <br /> <br />He states that the \\"apotheosis of self-parody for both the genre and for Hollywood as a whole was the movie , 'Last Action Hero.'  He shows that action films use parody over interrogation, self-deprecation over self-reflection.  He should go to see 'Serenity' and 'Better Luck Tomorrow.' <br /> <br />I did see some he mentioned and liked 'Daredevil,' 'Spiderman,' 'The Phantom,' 'The Shadow,' 'Dick Tracy,' 'The Crow' (I loved the song, \\"It Can't Rain All the Time from that feature); saw 'Armageddon' and 'Independence Day' but can't remember whether I liked them or not.  There have been more modern action films the past two years which I have seen, but apparently he hadn't as they were not mentioned.   <br /> <br />Because of the loud noises and violence in this genre, it is popular only with young people (whose violent streak is being repressed in today's society).  The Fifties had many spectacles (Biblical and Egyptian royalty), but it was a violence of a different sort.  Those heathens didn't know any better, and used violence for 'sport.'	2005-10-03

We uncover the \\"myths\\" of love, of the desperation of unrequited love, and loveless marriages.  But life goes on, as these revelations are played out in South America.  I don't think I'll ever put almonds in my French-style green beans again, as he feels that is the \\"smell\\" of unrequited love -- we all experience one or more in our lifetime, and yes, it does leave a bitter tasts in the rejected one's mouth, but not of almonds.  It is painful to not be loved by the person you love; we don't always choose the right one, as the feeling has to be mutual.   <br /> <br />Florentino, the Don Juan who does not sit around moping those fifty or so years while Fermina, now seventy, is made a widow when the doctor she married after she had revoked her promise to be his wife falls out of a tree while chasing his parrot.  Dr. Urbino had left Fermina well off and the loveless life comes to an end.  Marital love can be as mucha 'product of art' as romantic love, which is only for the young who fall in love too easily.   <br /> <br />Both are given a second chance to recapture a meaningful relationship, after all those years of remaining faithful to her -- in his fashion.  Old people marry for many reasons and most are not based on love per se.  Some want companionship or a good home or security against boredom.   But not Florentino, who never marries but has his way with many women.  At last, his patience pays off and he has the woman of his dreams lo those many years. <br /> <br />This author has also written CHRONICLE OF A DEATH FORETOLD and his masterpiece, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE.

There is a kidnapper who travels the cities along the West coast in search of prey; called the Pied Piler because he leaves his calling card, a pennywhistle flute, in the cribs of the babies he has taken.  When the FBI enters the search for this criminal, Lou Boldt in Seattle decides to take matters in his own hands along with skilled accomplices John and Daphne. <br /> <br />Because the kidnapper seems to be receiving information from inside the task force, which enables him to keep one step ahead of apprehension, he knows what is going on.  As a consequence, he takes the detective's baby girl as bait to get him off his trail.  He was a master at snatching unattended babies (and some he targeted) and disappear as the traveled from city to city. <br /> <br />Things get complex as Lou tries to rescue his little girl.  He'd taken his wife, a cancer victim, out to eat in an old train car, one of Seattle's fish-house restaurants with ambiance.  When the Piper took his child that evening, he felt like \\"he had stolen his life.\\"  Tracing him from a low-rent district to a meth lab in Seattle, then on to Portland (where their old theater has a marquee like the Tennessee in Knoxville -- identical in design), where things gets fishy, and on to New Orleans. <br /> <br />This suspense story of deceit and betrayal will keep you alive with the spirit and determination of a father out to find his child alive.  The Piper is tracked to the home for destitute orphans in New Orleans.  There was an orphanage in Memphis, Tennessee, where the matron was selling children to childless couples.

Reading is important to children, young adults and,especially to those wannabe writers.  Like those below:<br /> \\"One day on the bus to town, as were were waiting at a red light,  I looked out the window at some unusual trees. Most bus rider don't know or even think about the species of trees downtown. I've asked several during the past two years what certain trees in different areas are.  No one knew or cared; even the bus drivers I asked had no idea.\\"<br /><br />Too many people today go through their daily routines accepting things as they are and not questioning or appreciating the beauty around them.  These unusual trees reminded me of the cork tree in  Spain where a favorite character of mine in a children's story sat and contemplated a peaceful life in the country. Alas, he was not destined for such a life,  as he was Ferdinand the Bull, scheduled to be the center of attraction in Spain's barbaric sport of bullfighting.  However, Ferdinand was not your average bull. He, for some odd reason, had a halcion nature and refused to follow the norm. In the end, his willpower overcame the obstacles and he was put out to pasture to live out a long, peaceful life.  Michael Feinstein has a marvelous version of this fable in song in his PURE IMAGINATION CD.  No doubt, you've read your share of juvenile literature to your children and grandchildren.<br /><br />I got a late start actually as it was the second birthday of son Geoffrey when a young girl who lived next door asked if I'd accept some of the books she'd outgrown as a gift for this loveable,  sensitive child. When I told her he was much too young for them,  she (in quite a grown up way -- her father was principal at the elementary  school) stated, \\"Oh no, ma'm, you can read to him now.\\"<br /><br />It's a proven fact that children learn from birth from a parent's  reading and spending that precious time devoted exclusively to enjoying  being together.  After Geoffrey had finished first grade, his teacher called me aside at one of our occasional class parties toward the end of the school year to ask where he'd been born. She couldn't believe my answer -- in that small town. Of all her students, she said, he was the very one she knew for sure wasn't Southern. It's because he talked like his mamma who'd read to him that past five years on a \\"catch-up\\" basis (and yes, I am a Knoxville-bred  Southerner but I patterned my speech after my favorite radio announcers); it didn't hurt that his father was a college speech teacher, either.<br /><br />A few years later, when that son (who though much loved had to make up for those first two years of ignorance) had a male teacher in the 6th grade and Mom had gone from Room Mother to PTA president, Mr. Collins emphatically delared to the old-maid principal that Geoffrey had never had a normal childhood.  According to him, while a student at the local junior college, he'd observed my oldest son going around campus quoting Shakespeare.  After all he did have literary inclinations being named for Chaucer! Shortly after his birth, the kindly doctor came to my hospital room refusing to sign his birth certificate until we corrected the spelling of his name.  When I  said, \\"that's the English way,\\" he was taken aback and told me, \\"Next time,  have an American baby.\\"<br /><br />I derived much pleasure dancing at the Swing Dance with a nine-month-old male named Sammy. Though this child could sing to me in \\"baby-speak\\" in return to my serenading him, he could not articulate words. I told his grandfather: \\"Read to this child; talk to him.\\"<br /><br />A time I'll never forget, when Brett was an infant, I'd hold him as I read books to his four-year-old step-sister.  She was the most beautiful child I'd ever seen with her sparkling dark eyes and such a mouthful of healthy teeth with her big smile.  When I  first met Miran, I was inspired by a book I had purchased specifically for her entitled, \\"It's OK to be Different.\\" You see, this \\"Ligeia\\" of mine washalf-Chinese and sometimes when I'd tell Brett how much I loved his blue eyes, so like his dad's (Justin was my blue-eyed child), she'd  look sad and start to pout. But I'd quickly reassure her I loved her  brown eyes, too,  which were like mine and Uncle Jeff's.  After I would finish reading a book to her, she always hugged me and would say \\"I just love you.\\" And I've never loved a child more than beautiful Miran, who didn't live to see her 5th birthday, who  would run to me with open arms and fantastic smile everytime I'd go to her home.  One night, she died in a fire and was taken to rest eternally back to her birthplace in West Tennessee. For me, she'll forever by my little angel, Ligeia, the daughter I was never fortunate to have. I knew her  for such a short span of time, yet she made a major impact on my life.<br /><br />This is taken from one of Wink Martindale's readings, IF I KNEW, \\"There'll always be another day to say I love you -- but just in case I might be wrong, and today is ALL I get,I'd like to say how much I love you. And I hope we never forget that tomorrow is not promised to anyone -- young or old alike -- and today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight.\\"<br /><br />Being different is not so bad. In today's society, it's almost  become the norm. We're all humans on this earth and need to learn to  live together in peace.  Helping each other brings to life the magic in all of us.  Remember, \\"to you, the world might be one person; to someone else, the  world might be YOU.\\"<br /><br />John Milton who lived from 1608 to 1674 wrote: \\"There is nothing that makes men rich and strong but that which they carry inside of them. True wealth is of the heart, not of the hand.\\"  I've just discovered that Richard Evans, acclaimed author of THE CHRISTMAS BOX, has started a series of children's books on virtues in easy-to-understand parables. His first venture into juvenile genre, THE  DANCE, appeared last year, and its subsequent success has resulted in THE  SPYGLASS.  This initial beginning of a series of twelve helps young people understand that Faith is a power through which we accomplish our dreams.<br />THE TOWER, a story which teaches the virtue of humility which we all need, something sadly lacking today and we all need.  All of the profits from this Virtues Collection are donated by Mr. Evans to help abused and neglected children. These beautifully illustrated books are perfect reading material for parents and grandparents.<br /><br />We need to read a variety of books on different subjects to be well-rounded, whether we have visions of becoming a writer, a member of the Merchant Marines, or joining the circus.  Reading makes you 'interesting' and you learn from every book you open.t how much I loved his blue eyes, so like his dad's (Justin was my blue-eyed child), she'd  look sad and start to pout. But I'd quickly reassure her I loved her  brown eyes, too,  which were like mine and Uncle Jeff's.  After I would finish reading a book to her, she always hugged me and would say \\"I just love you.\\" And I've never loved a child more than beautiful Miran, who didn't live to see her 5th birthday, who  would run to me with open arms and fantastic smile everytime I'd go to her home.   One night, she died in a fire and was taken to rest eternally back to her birthplace in West Tennessee. For me, she'll forever by my little angel, Ligeia, the daughter I was never fortunate to have. I knew her  for such a short span of time, yet she made a major impact on my life.    This is taken from one of Wink Martindale's readings, IF I KNEW, \\"There'll always be another day to say I love you -- but just in case I might be wrong, and today is ALL I get,I'd like to say how much I love you. And I hope we never forget that tomorrow is not promised to anyone -- young or old alike -- and today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight.\\"      Being different is not so bad. In today's society, it's almost  become the norm. We're all humans on this earth and need to learn to  live together in peace.  Helping each other brings to life the magic in all of us.   Remember, \\"to you, the world might be one person; to someone else, the  world might be YOU.\\"    John Milton who lived from 1608 to 1674 wrote: \\"There is nothing that makes men rich and strong but that which they carry inside of them. True wealth is of the heart, not of the hand.\\"   I've just discovered that Richard Evans, acclaimed author of THE CHRISTMAS BOX, has started a series of children's books on virtues in easy-to-understand parables. His first venture into juvenile genre, THE  DANCE, appeared last year, and its subsequent success has resulted in THE  SPYGLASS.  This initial beginning of a seriesof twelve helps young people understand that Faith is a power through which we accomplish our dreams.  THE TOWER, a story which teaches the virtue of humility which we all need, something sadly lacking today and we all need.   All of the profits from this Virtues Collection are donated by Mr. Evans to help abused and neglected children. These beautifully illustrated books are perfect reading material for parents and grandparents.    We need to read a variety of books on different subjects to be well-rounded, whether we have visions of becoming a writer, a member of the Merchant Marines, or joining the circus.  Reading makes you 'interesting' and you learn from every book you open.	2005-10-01

I've been interested in Abraham Lincoln since I did some research on the Rosenberg case. You may wonder how these two could possibly be related.  After the Lincoln assassination, the first woman in a federal case was hanged in this country. Ethel Rosenberg was the first to be electrocuted. <br /> <br />An interesting anecdote about this man who could \\"speak so briefly and say so much\\" (Gettysburg address), he never joined any church as he was unable to accept the dogmas attached to organized religion.  However,  he had a profound faith in God. <br /> <br />Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, whose daughter was married to the son of President Zachary Taylor, spent two years in prison -- yet was never brought to trial -- as a conspirator in the assassination, his own role as symbol of Southern determination and sacrifice. Davis was respected, but not loved by his people when he was president.  After the war he acquired a degree of reverence almost equalto that felt for Robert E. Lee. In part, no doubt -- author William C. Davis explains -- he never gave up, and never apologized.  Unrepentant to the end, his personal resistance to the tides of history spoke for all his people. He bowed to the inevitable in 1865 and afterward (that the North had won), but he never accepted defeat.  At that time, most of the South would not recognize Lincoln as our president. <br /> <br />All of this occurred over a hundred years ago and time repeats itself.  The Civil War started because of this opposition when the Confederates opened fire on Fort Sumpter in South Carolina on April 13, 1861. Lincoln once said, \\"The best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time.\\" <br /> <br />We can be grateful that we live in a more civilized society today.  We have to accept things and situations we don't like and work to make abetter future in the best way we know how.     Walter Beal believed that \\"in the deep unwritten wisdom of life there are many things to be learned that cannot be taught. We never know them by hearing them spoken, but we grow into them by experience and recognize them through understanding. <br /> <br />Understanding is a great experience in itself, but it does not come through instruction.\\"  James Russell Lowell wrote in The Present Crisis\\": <br />\\"Count me o'er the earth's chosen heroes -- they were souls that stood alone, <br />While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone, <br />Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline <br />To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine, <br />By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design.\\" <br /> <br />Many books have been written about the Confederacy, but this is one of the best.

The song WHERE HAVE ALL THE HEROES GONE came to mind. James Russell Lowell wrote in \\"The Present Crisis\\": \\"Count me o'er the earth's chosen heroes -- they were souls that stood alone.\\" <br /> <br />When I was growing up, I had a small, lifelike plaster statuette of General Douglas MacArthur; consequently, he's always been my hero. Recently, when I was loaded down with packages, I found one, a good samaritan named Ehren Manrod, who gave me a helping hand; he was truly a gentleman any mother would be proud to have as a son. <br /> <br />It was a slower time then, but our children need heroes now -- someone to look up to and imitate. A person who enjoys conflict told me several weeks ago I'd never be a general since I retreat at the first sign of danger. Don't get me wrong -- I'm not a coward; I just don't believe in indiscriminate or unneeded violent reactions toward others.   When my youngest son was in the 8th grade, his male teacher who washis soccer coach who taught them to play rough and tough was surprised when he related who my childhood hero was. MacArthur never backed down and was a man of his word. Sure, he bucked the system and was removed from his position for a time; but, he said, \\"I shall return\\" and he did! I admire a man who keeps his promises -- not many do in this age and time. <br /> <br />Do you remember where you were when you heard the news that our president, John Fitgerald Kennedy had been shot and taken to Parkland Hospital in Dallas? That was a fateful day I'll never forget.  As a young mother staying home with her boys, I was doing some freelance secretarial work for an insurance adjuster, an old man we looked on as being part of the family since we'd lived in the same apartment house where he had his office and shared a small apartment with his eccentric wife. Once he asked me if I knew who Betty Boop was -- I didn't at the time!  I'd taken dictation that morning to type at home and was scheduled to return after preparing lunch for my family. Listening to the local news, a daily practice as we ate, to hear the happenings in this small town and who had died. This was a college town, though the radio station had very little news of our school; when I was a student there a few years earlier, however, I had my own \\"News from the Martin campus\\" every Friday afternoon. The mundane news was interrrupted by an announcementconcerning the situation in Dallas, followed by continuing network reporting. The unspeakable had happened, and I could not believe my ears! <br /> <br />Immediately I called to see if we would resume work as scheduled.  He'd seen the television coverage and told me to come on back and \\"we'd see.\\"  The  next two or three days, Mr. & Mrs. Davis and I stayed glued to the t.v.set and consequently saw first hand when Lee Harvey Oswald was fatally shot by Jack Ruby in jail exposed in handcuffs behind his back and unable to defend himself. It was just like a movie you might see today, but these were real people. The names are burned into my mind along with these vivid images from the television coverage. Thank goodness, it wasn't in color! We sat  mesmerized through all the funeral proceedings; I thought I'd never be able to listen to \\"Hail to the Chief\\" again. <br /> <br />Recently, while waiting to see an optomologist, I noticed that he had a diploma from Parkland Hospital, so I asked if that had been the same one where President Kennedy had died. He told me that one of the patients he had there was working in the Emergency Room at the time this event took place.   He had talked with an actual eyewitness to this tragedy and its aftermath. Later, I had another specialist at a regional hospital, a gastroenterologist. He, too, had interned at this famous hospital in Dallas. Thus, I had decided he was from Texas. A sensitive, shy personality but extremely competent in his field, I had much admiration for  his skill. He had performed some minor surgery and tests on me which kept me from needing radical procedures later on. At one of these procedures, however, I had waited past my endurance(the whole time attached to an IV); thus, I asked a nurse to unhook me as I was ready to go home. When she told the doctor that I was wanting to leave, I was  immediately wheeled back to the operating room. He said, \\"So you were going to skip out on me,\\" and I replied, \\"Doctor, I was sure you had gotten on your horse and ridden off into the sunset.\\" He was surprised and amused by this vision and asked, \\"Now, why would I do that?\\" I emphatically stated, \\"Well, you're from Texas and that's what cowboys do, isn't it?\\" He said  (before he promptly put me to sleep so he could perform his task), \\"We have horses in Tennessee,  too.\\" <br />      <br />Later, I learned from one of his nursing assistants there at the hospital that he's a native Tennessean and proud of it. The problem was he hadn't let me tell him that cowboys had always been my heroes. From that day on, this doctor who looked nothing like a cowboy, was one of my heroes. <br /> <br />We all need people to admire. As we go hither and thither in our daily routines, it is good to slow down to a \\"snail's pace\\" to see the beauty of taking time just to be free as a breeze in the most wonderful country in the world. Let's show our pride as Americans in our past and present heroes. <br />  <br />In the song WINNERS recorded by Frank Sinatra, which reminds me a lot of his version of THE HOUSE I LIVE IN (which won an Academy Award), are these important things to consider: <br />\\"Here's to the Heroes, Those who move mountains; <br />Here's to the Miracles; they make us see -- <br />Here's to the Winners All Of Us Can Be!\\" <br />  <br />Heroes come in many shapes and professions.  Cowboys, soldiers, presidents, doctors, singers, rodeo performers, even ordinary people who do good toward others.  We need heroes, not just in the military.  <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-10-01

The hardest memories are the pieces of \\"what might have been.\\"  In Dunderry, Georgia, a drama plays out something like 'West Side Story' with the Southern aspect or 'Fried Green Tomatoes' as an irrestible Southern saga.  It has the violence of youth and abuse which must be stopped at all costs.  This story chronicles a love as innocent as child's as that is what they were when the two grew closely attached by more than friendship, a case of unrequited love. <br /> <br />\\"I would always wait for him to come back.\\"  That's a girl's feeling, but it was Claire wishing to know what had happened to someone important in her life.  She'd been only ten when he left, a rebellious, motherless fifteen-year-old always in trouble.  Claire was from the other side of the tracks and Roan lived in a trailer with his drunken father on the outskirts.  She could not get him out of her mind or thoughts all those years. <br /> <br />She spent twenty years of loneliness and stubborn independence, as she was devoted to the memory of a 'lost' boy she had loved.  She'd thought, \\"I'd be the kind of old Southern lady who wore bright red lipstick.\\"  I knew such a one -- Virginia Barnes, a maiden librarian who always bemoaned the fact that the young man she had loved would not wait for her to go to college and married someone else.  At the local drug store, she always chose the brightest red lipstick they had, Revlon, of course. <br /> <br />This involved family story shows the frustrations and rewards brought by heritage and close family.  The author traced her family history in America to 1761 when John Power arrived from Ireland.  One of her ancestors, Samuel Wesley, served in the Confederate army during the Civil War and survived.  Four years after General William T. Sherman stormed through Powers Ferry on his way to Atlanta, Samuel Adam Power was born.  Her family history is as interesting as that of the Maloneys and Delaneys.  The Old Grannies were Eliza Wallingford and Alice Maloney.  Bothfamilies immigrated from Ireland in 1838. <br /> <br />Deborah Smith (I knew a Debbie Smith whose mother died, father was Kermit) has written other Southern novels, CHARMING GRACE, ON BEAR MOUNTAIN and SILK AND STONE.  She is a Southern writer to admire for her tenacity and ability to tell it like it is.	2005-09-30

An anonymous letter (in my case, e-mail from an obsessive stranger) from a man with a vendetta.  Matthews draws on her career as a clinical social worker to develop the character, Cassidy McCabe.  I'd hope she does not represent \\"everywoman\\" as I am certainly not like her, except for the love of cats.  In the past, I had a mother cat and kittens but, finding loving homes for them for a hard task.  Stat has never had kittens, and they scare her.<br /><br />Cassidy has a live-in lover, Zach, rich enough to own a condo and can co-exist with a houseful of cats.  She's a psychotherapist, he a reporter in Chicago.  The threatening letter arrives hand-delivered and leaves her perplexed  -- until a new client of hers reveals a duplicate of the correspondence sent to her, which warms the two women that \\"torment ... lies ahead\\" for them.  The patient is afraid to go to the police.  Not I -- nor the D.A., but their investigations didn't tell me anything I hadn't already figured out.<br /><br />There is a definite \\"viciousness\\" in 'Cliff's warning as he becomes obsessed with her and starts stalking -- which is a crime worse than threats.  Cassidy and Zach launch their own investigation, only to find themselves pawns in a cat-and-mouse chase.  This, however, is a serious matter, and she has to take matters in her own hands.<br /><br />Cliff turned out to be a genuine lunatic with paranoid delusions, with full-blown obsessiveness and narcissistic personality disorder, among other health problems which will lead to early death.  He has a sadistic urge to hate women and refused to take responsibility for his own reckless behavior.  He also has a split personality to boot: good boy/bad guy.  Shades of SYBIL.

In the 19th century, there were a dozen opera houses in Venice; Knoxville had its share, Pulaski had one.  The 'Fenice' burned to the ground in January, 1996, three days before the intrepid writer, John Berendt, arrived to survey the scene to determine if there could be a crime involved and trial.  Was it arson or like the brick building in Ohio?  Like Knoxville, is a dying town, nothing modern or futuristic looking. <br /> <br />He'd traveled the country on the prowl for a good story, and it took him nine years to locare a comparable site to Savannah, Georgia (USA), located surrounded by marshes and the ocean; then, he went back to Venice which is full of lagoons and mysterious bars.  The true Ventian ambiance is in places off the beaten path.  If you follow direction signs there showing \\"straight ahead,\\" you wind up confused with the twists and turns and \\"forks in the road.\\"  A local columnist tried to explain a similar problem in our downtown and decided that the sign need to be \\"rotated 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise fashion ... to make sense.\\"  Men are bad about following directions anyway and refuse to stop and ask anyone. <br /> <br />One old theatre was significant to Venice's being considered a living entity.  He gradually learned that \\"everyone in Venice plays a role, and the role changes.\\"  Even the tide there changes every six hours.  Bridges are 'transitions' as you go across from one reality to another reality.  He wondered as he mingled with the social group, which included a gay poet who had committed suicide (or was he killed?), \\"What is true?  What is not true?\\"  The truth can change according to who is proclaiming it; that it the Venetian effect.  They actually mean the opposite of what they say -- my sister called that 'reverse psychology.' <br /> <br />According to 66-yr-old Berendt, \\"Venetians never told the truth.\\"  He found his Savannah with gondolas and some pretty eccentric people.  He sees garbage everywhere as he pursues the 'Rat Man of Treviso.'  He learns the city's secrets, a struggle over ownership of Ezra Pound's valuable papers left in his last home there.  He follows wealthy Americans who try to become a part of Venetian society. <br /> <br />He did a lot of research for this book and used real names in this one as opposed to MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, which Clint Eastwood made of good movie around the affair and trial of gay men.  Then, John Berendt returns to his Manhattan townhouse.  He's old enough to settle down, but will he?	2005-09-30

Four women from unusual circumstances, all with health or interpersonal problems, become friends as they learn the age-old craft of knitting.  \\"Knit-one-pearl-two.\\" <br /> <br />Karen Alfke is quoted, \\"The yarn forms the stitches, the knitting forges the friendships, the craft links the generations.\\"  Evelyn crocheted a bed cover for me, though not perfect, I knew it was filled with her effort and love for her kid sister.  I returned the favor by cross-stitching an intricate design of ducks, a quote, and elaborate background for a gift to give to one of her daughters.  I did a dark brown silhouette cross-stitch of hunter, dog, and gun by a pond with the ducks flying over -- before my stroke which damaged my eyesight.  I coun't draw, but I could create beautiful cross-stitch designs -- no more! <br /> <br />\\"Knitting goes with us, it calms us.\\"Viki knitted a special \\"wrap\\" for her son and is always doing her crafts.

If you saw Neil Diamond's movie, 'The Jazz Singer,' a Jewish wedding took place in New York and the other one in California.  YEKL, the 1896 novella by the same author, is included; it was made into the movie, 'Hester Street.'<br /><br />In the late 19th century, Abraham Cahan came to New York City from his native Lithuania in search of the \\"promised land of opportunity.\\"  Instead, he found the sweatshops of America (wasn't only New York -- we had the same here).  He observed the bitterness of life in lower East Side of the city.  He first worked in a cigar factory, joined a union, then became a major influence with his people as editor and columnist of 'The Jewish Daily Forward,' a Yiddish-language newspaper.  He had an \\"advice\\" column for fifty years.  He was the primary political, cultural and educational master through his paper, where he was editor until his death in 1951.<br /><br />He wrote a classical novel in 1917, THE RISE OF DAVID LEVINSKY.

Poor Eleanor, a bright, intelligent British woman from Warwickshire had her heart set on attending Oxford's new women's college.  She'd learned Latin and Greek and wanted to study great literature at the \\"venerable institution\\" (in America, we'd say 'prestigious school') -- and was accepted.  Fate stepped in and her father was killed during WWI in 1914.  Things changed drastically for her.    Her father has foolishly married a woman he hardly knew before leaving for the war front, as men often do, for some reason.  The strange, but fashionable, stepmother and her two daughters (sound familiar) took over the house, making Ellie a \\"stranger in her own home.\\"  After his demise, she was forced to endure a \\"blood\\" ritual during which the little finger on her left hand was cut off.  As a young child, my ring finger was chopped off by a male cousin   (not as a ritual), as we were using a butcher knife on a pumpkin out in the garden.  Miraculously, the doctors at Knoxville General Hospital (where my mother died just a few years later) sewed it back on, as there was a bit of skin intact.  I had trouble learning to type and thought it meant I'd never get married.  It is still crooked but functional.  Ellie was turned into a maid (like Cinderella) under a spell.    People forgot her existence as she was prevented from leaving the house.  The war raged on for years, and poor Ellie felt like she was losing her mind.  That happens to brillian people under great duress.  A family friend, Reggie, had become a pilot and known as \\"an acclaimed air ace\\" and had finished at Oxford.  He had encouraged her all those years ago to apply there, before the start of the war.  He returned home shell-shocked after a tragic air incident.    Together, Reggie and Ellie \\"rose from the ashes\\" of the spells and corrupt \\"Masters, she of Earth, he of Air.  To overcome the black magic used on them, she had found a tutor, the Phoenyx in the fireplace who called her \\"daughter of Eve.\\"  She and Reggie entered into a 'marriage of partners' (like Bill and Hillary Clinton), and poor Ellie became Lady Devlin, intent on unweaving Alison's spell.    Part science fiction, part fantasy; thanks to Stephen Donaldson and Terry Brooks' novels, I was able to intrepret the fantasy -- Harry Potter and science fiction movies helped me to understand the elemental parts.

Terry, a nurse, relocates to the ocenside city of Delray, Florida, where she inherited her mother's house five years earlier.  She mades the decision to rent out small cottage in her back yard (like the place Andy Hoover rented when he came home to Pulaski, only to buy the larger house and renovate it after he was married).  The 'hyper' young woman who rents it takes over her tranquil, sedate life as the nurse at a place for the elderly and disabled.  Knoxville is full of those. <br /> <br />Alison swept in like a 'tropical storm,' but she was hiding a secret past in her euphoria, as she leads Terry on a wild romp and changes her life forever.  She notices that peculiar 'friends' visit the cottage at odd hours.  She'd been led on a beguiling, but false, trail to romance with the son of one of her patients. <br /> <br />Alison's \\"brother\\" appears on the scene and lets slip some unsavory parts of the tenant of her cottage, a bit of her 'closely guarded' past.   The more she learns, the friendship dissolves (the way Sandra dropped me for no good reason, except to protect her job of cheating seniors in hopes of getting some of their medicines free!), and she feels \\"trapped in her mysterious world\\" with its 'lies and whispers.' <br /> <br />\\"When people feel hopeless, they act in hopeless ways.\\" (Rick Warren)  This tale re-instills the innate intuition not to trust strangers and become involved in the lives of people we don't know are 'legit.'

From picture books for toddlers, children's \\"fudge\\" books, middle school girls, young adults (in which she teaches teens about growing up -- sex, God, unrequited love, all of those painful decisions a girl is asked to make), and now adults, Judy Blume has come full circle for her readers.   <br /> <br />She knows how to keep the story moving with the experience of writing for those whose concentration may not be quite developed, and so this provocative novel allows her grown up fans to \\"travel with Blume from their youth to this new opportunity\\" to keep up with the growing stage into adulthood and all that involves.    This is a \\"fictional fountain of youth\\" which takes the reader back to her young days of indecision and wondering what she should or should not do and still be a Christian.  It is called \\"an entertaining adult fairy tale\\" but the premise is so true. <br /> <br />These sisters get together in Santa Fe in the Eighties enduring realistic situations.  They'd met in Martha's Vineyard as teens and became 'summer sisters.'  They'd been estranged for many years when Victoria did not serve as 'maid of honor' at Caitlin's wedding.  The same happened to me, though I never forgave my first choice for my left-arm at the small wedding I had in the chapel of Church Street Methodist Church, a place I became disillusioned with when I returned home to an 'uncaring ministry' unless you were homeless.  The girl who was my 'maid of honor' tried to make connections again after she was divorced, but I was going through too much in my own life to become involved in hers. <br /> <br />My 'summer sister' was my real sister who married when I was only ten and moved to the suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Since I was a motherless little girl, my dad used his train pass to send me off to Evelyn's every summer to be her free babysitter.  For nine years, she had a baby every year.  Then, she is deserted by a wandering husband who hides the children from her; at the divorce, the judge told her that he had 'brainwashed' the older children so she was awarded custody of the three youngest girls.  She did get the house.  So, after I had a family of my own, I'd drive to Maryland with the boys in tow to 'visit' until she became desperate and allowed the town to turn her house into a home for disadvantage women.  Then, I wasn't allowed to visit anymore, as an outsider.  We kept in touch until I needed her one year and she did not come through for me.  I returned her letter \\"Return to Sender\\" and got on with my life.  Summer sisters (even blood sisters) can sometimes break your hearts.   I'd always thought that she and my eldest son would help when I was in need, but they both let me down.  So much for life. <br /> <br />Sometimes, good friends are more family than your actual, biological one.  A harsh, selfish father with a young teenage girl is hard to forget or forgive.  But the 'friends' see nothing wrong in going against the grain, and in so doing cause the other 'sister' deep distress. <br /> <br />This is a book for adults, and not children (full of sex) so I am hoping that teens won't accidentally pick it up and get involved in the passions of an adult.  Other adult books she has written are SMART WOMEN and WIFEY.  This is a learning experience and she is a good teacher.	2005-09-29

The drawings of different types of the accordion throughout the different sections of the book, make it more readable.  Actually, the title is misleading as the accordions don't commit crimes, though some are pepetrated on the owners at the time. <br /> <br />The accordion maker and his eleven-yr-old son arrived in New Orleans where he is killed by an anti-Italian lynching mob (one of a group of eleven).  The boy brings with him a green accordion from Sicily which does a bit of traving back and forth across America.  The people and places along the way make up the stories, which are disjointed. <br /> <br />The green one is traced over a century as it end up with various ethnic groups.  Some of the characters are unsavory.  At the trailer park, Abelardo (who later dies from a poisonous spider bite) makes up this ditty as he played the accordion after watching the black exhaust of twenty buses a day as it billowed in front of the trailer:   <br />\\"O you filthy bus, <br />I was dreaming of love and riches, <br />I was dreaming of happiness <br />When you brrrt! like ten elephants <br />Like a smokestack blowing up, <br />When you gnashed your gears <br />And destroyed my fragile reverie.\\" <br /> <br />I ride the buses and the diesel is still there, not as prevalent as in the Fifties, but still deadly toxic.  The experiment with bio-diesel (soybean waste mixed in with the gas) proved not so attractive as it was damaging the engines of the old buses.  We have a flock of \\"borrowed\\" buses from Worchester, Mass., ancient and hard to ride in, but all of the new buses purchased by TDOT are in the college area getting worn out by pampering the out-of-town (state) students by being available almost around the clock.  This is called subcontracting, and not the intention of the government aid for 'public' transit. <br /> <br />The accordion evolves in many versions.  My dad had one like that played on the Lawrence Welk show (think it was called the piano accordion).  He wouldn'tlet me take piano lessons as a child, as he could not afford a piano, but he bought all kinds of musical instruments for himself until he died. <br /> <br />Welk was a German from the old country and a master player.  There was another accordion player on his show, but I can't remember his name.  My dad was part Cherokee from the mountains of East Tennessee.  He sold his to the son of his sister, Molly, who lived in Heiskell. <br /> <br />You'd think that by passing the green one around and all the back-and-forth constant moving from Louisiana to Maine, from Iowa to Texas and places in between, it would simply wear out.  It was destroyed by being run over by a car after a fast and furious life with all kinds of people who loved music. <br /> <br />She gives the history of the instrument from development and explains beautifully the sound it makes, like no other music except perhaps the modern synthethizer which can sound like a lot of different instruments.  It was never my favorite, as it would have been too heavy for me to carry.  Oh, the old movies had a form of a smaller one, but it was just a toy.  The real accordion was a masterpiece and could be played by anybody with any kind of music in him.  It is loud but, if played right, stirring and invigorating to the listener. <br /> <br />Ms Proulx had a Pulitizer prize winner with her first novel, SHIPPING NEWS, which caused quite a stir.  This one, however, has much to be desired to come up to the standards of first class.	2005-09-29

At the tender age of seventeen, Tess moved from her hometown, Wintergreen, Missouri, to the big city of Nashville, Tennessee, to become a 'big' country star.  After eighteen years of success in the music business, she'd turned her bakc on kinfolk or romance, thus no children to hinder her return to the small town.  Her widowed mother needs more attention than her older sister can accomplish alone, so Tess agrees to 'visit' for a month.  Here, she suddenly finds herself a 'non-person' as her mother expects more than she wants to deliver, and she discovers that her sister is jealous of her tremendous success in Nashville. <br /> <br />I guess you mihgt call me a small town personage, and yet I was born at the Forks Of the River community outside Knoxville, a large town (not a city yet).  The only time I lived in town proper was the last five months of high school after I, too, left home at the age of seventeen.  I loved the downtown area, as it was 'home' to me, not the little corner room where I had a single bed and one small closet with a sink to wash my face -- not much else, but I had a mentor who was only two blocks away and I visited him almost daily for comfort of being a motherless, homeless 'woman.'  It was his grand idea that I move to the YWCA to finish school; then, I had the opportunity to go off to college and become a small town girl. <br /> <br />Tess is attracted to Kenny, someone she had 'noticed' in high school, but she left Wintergreen and he married someone else.  Now, he is a respected member of the community, even though he is divorced (double standard, a woman would be looked down on after the divorce -- I know first hand, with the PTA position taken away from me.) and dotes on his teenage daughter, like Jack used to do.  He won't even give Tess 'the time of day' until she discovers that his daughter has country music talent and she becomes her 'mentor.' <br /> <br />Then, her return turns into \\"anything but dull.\\"  What at first started as thecommon interest in the music business led her into the love of her life -- slightly delayed.  But, then, she had been busy making money and enjoying being a 'super=star.' <br /> <br />This is one of the author's best stories to date; since then, she has written A PROMISE TO CHERISH (2004) and FORSAKING ALL OTHERS (2003) and living her dreams with a real life dreamboat.	2005-09-29

Two major things I learned from this book are 1) James Agee had an obsession with Chaplain's character, Little Tramp, and 2) he was deathly afraid of the Bomb which America had created.  Other supplemental things I may have rather not known is that he drank too much, could down a whole bottle of scotch and still not be drunk and, during the last month of his life, he had a total disregard for personal appearances.  It is said tht he wore the same shirt, and hardly every changed clothes.  He was allowed to basically die alone, like Dean Martin.  Stardom is soon forgotten.    Those 'facts' I could have lived without knowing.  Now, there is a group in Los Angeles called the 'Society of Singers' who help retired and elderly members of the movie world (Agee was part of that in a big way.)-- those destitute and in need.  Chuck Southcott and Wink Martindale are members.  As is fact, Agee died in May of 1955.    In the end, his life \\"was bookended by his admiration of Chaplain.\\"  The Tramp was his inspiration to his art and life from his earliest remembered childhood until the last days of his life.  In the movie, that dad took Rufus to the Roxy theater across the L&N viaduct from the neighborhood where they lived, to see and laugh at Chaplain's \\"Tramp' silent features.    Agee's talent and his love for the poetic art of silent comedy films is shown in Part Two of this book.  His previously unpublished screenplay was untitled when he died that fateful May, but here they call it 'The Tramp's New World.'  He finished it in 1949, but no one ever considered making it.  The premise was that only the innocence of childish adults could survive the Bomb.  The scientists were safe in their underground shelters, but they have no real feelings or common sense. Its \\"timeless message of respect for humanity and the dignity of the individual are needed now more than ever.\\"    Agee claimed to one and all that writing his autobiographical novel \\"was killing him.\\"  Sometimes it is best notto remember, or at least have a selective memory.  It was named after his death and edited quickly, leaving much material on the wayside, to be published in an expedient way so as to use the publicity of his death.  It won the Pulitzer Prize, a well-deserved reward for his work and hardship at the end.    I marvel at how the majority of people tend to think about the sordid or bad things which happened to an important person after they are gone instead of remembering the good they had achieved during their peak years.  The same happened to my friend, Bob Lobertini.  Helen Gee, in her memoir of Limelight, the photraphy gallery she founded and named after the Chaplain film, was one to dwell on the 'unmentionables.'    Agee was a native Knoxvillian, though he did not spend much time here after his mother remarried and moved up Northeast, and there is a marker on Cumberland with his name and history, a park named after him as well as one of the streets on the UT campus.  He is remembered here as a 'native son' who did good out in Hollywood.	2005-09-28

Ten years ago, I read a book about the child sacrifices the Inca civilization carried out at Machu Picchu.  It has stuck with me all these years and, when I saw the Nova program, \\"Ice Mummies\\" all of that disturbing feeling came back.  How could they do that to the children?!    The first known Incas, a noble family who ruled Cuzco and a small surrounding high Andean agricultural state, date back to A.D. 1200. The growth of the empire beyond Cuzco began in 1438 when emperor Pachacuti, which means \\"he who transforms the earth,\\" strode forth from Cuzco to conquer the world around him  and bring the surrounding cultures into the Inca fold. Consolidation of a large empire was to become a continuing struggle for the ruling Inca as their influence reached across many advanced cultures of the Andes. The name \\"Inca\\" refers to the first royal family and the 40,000 descendants who ruled the empire. For centuries historians have used the term in reference to the nearly 100 nations conquered by the Inca. The Inca state's domain was unprecedented, its rule resulting in a universal language - a form of Quechua, a religion worshipping the sun, and a 14,000 mile-long road system criss-crossing high Andean mountain passes and linking the rulers with the ruled.    What remains of the Inca legacy is limited, as the conquistadors plundered what they could of Inca treasures and in so doing, dismantled the many structures painstakingly built by Inca craftsmen to house the precious metals. Remarkably, a last bastion of the Inca empire remained unknown to the Spanish conquerors and was not found until explorer Hiram Bingham discovered it in 1911. He had found Machu Picchu, a citadel atop a mountainous jungle along the Urubamba River in Peru. Grand steps and terraces with fountains, lodgings, and shrines flank the jungle-clad pinnacle peaks surrounding the site. It was a place of worship to the sun god, the greatest deity in the Inca pantheon.    Mummies-named after the bitumen tar, mum, used to coat the linen winding strips around them-have long held an almost magical fascination. The world was titillated by Egypt's elaborate cult of death and by the extreme care devoted to preserving bodies for eternity. It was not uncommon in the 1800s to pick up a box of \\"mummy pills\\" made of ground, compressed mummies; they were thought to impart some measure of the eternal. The mummy of a pharaoh's son stood on the bar of a venerable men's club in Boston until the late 1960s, when he was returned to his homeland.    We have come to understand \\"mummy\\" as meaning a remarkably preserved body, a corpse that has withstood decay and putrefaction. By design or accident, the corpse's dissolution has been arrested, the effects of time slowed, and this human form, with its trappings and ornaments and clothing, becomes the physical representation of another time. A time machine bearing both gifts of knowledge, and prickly questions as to how best to handle the remains.    Similar kinds of questions hold sway whenever a mummy is unearthed. Decay and controversy attended the removal and study of Inca children, even the one found dressed as a commoner.  The girls were killed by a skull fracture, being hit in the head. The more recent the remains, the more controversial they are likely to be. Witness the contentious debate in the United States over the bones of Native Americans, both those uncovered in archeological sites and those already housed in museums. Many people would argue that the dead, whether recent or thousands of years old, should be left to rest in peace, undisturbed.    That would be so if it were a proper burial, but there are those who would destroy the mummified remains to get the Inca treasure trove left with the dead.	2005-09-28

Six weeks before he was assassinated, Lincoln's words (Second Inaugural Addresss), soothed a wounded nation.  As he makes his short talk in 1865, he showed much humility.  The Emancipation Proclamation which took effect on Jan. 1, 1863, which ordered the release of slaves in any state or designated part of a state didn't free a single slave.  It caused the biggest rebellion against a federal governments, the likes of which we will never get over.  That war will never be ended in the minds of Southerners.  It's not easy being the loser in anything. <br /> <br />Since the parts of the country covered by this edict were under the control of the Confederate Army, it made it virtually unenforceable.  He'd exempted from his ordre 'slaves held in parts of the South which were under control of the Union Army.  Excluded were 48 counties of Virginia, later called West Virginia, a new state.   It left enslaved blacks in New Orleans and twelve Louisiana parishes, also those in Portsmouth, Norfolk, Virginia, and seven surrounding counties occupied by the Union forces.   <br /> <br />In 1865, with 620,000 Amreicans killed in four years, he told the country that the war was not a religious crused and that the enemy prays to the same God as they do.  Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other.  Let us judge not, that we be not judged. <br /> <br />Alexander Stephens, Confederate Vice President, acknowledged the central role slavery played in the Civil War.  \\"This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution,\\" he'd said in his 'cornerstone speech' shortly after the Confederacy was formed.  He was talking about 'African' slaves, not American citizens.   <br /> <br />Meither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it attained.  This is your chance to meet the man who spoke so eloquently, yet failed to protect himself from death, who was not stupid or dishonest enough to believe he had a lock on truth.  I've been interested in Lincoln's assassination since the Seventies, and have a good collection of his books.  This is another one to add to your collection if you're a Civil War buff.	2005-09-28

This is about a missing person case, a high profile one of a war photographer, Melanie Jacobs, who vanished in England.  Mike Darling, no relation to Jim, was a professional soldier (member of the Special Forces) and supposedly the 'last person' to see her before she disappeared. <br /> <br />A news investigation at the same network, Robin Ballantyne, is planning a documentary about missing persons and takes matters into her own hands when her boss orders her off this particular case.  After talking with Melanie's mother, she went to Cambodia where Darling is taking cover and keeping mum, appearing to have something to hide.  There, under false pretense to film part of her documentary, she uncovrs secrets her boss did not want her to know.   <br /> <br />Things gets dangerous after she returned to England.  She'd remembered Melanie as a meticulous, hard-working and brave photographer out in the field and she was a stickler for attention to details.  Like Robert Capa, she risked her life daily to \\"record atrocity.\\"  He felt guilt for taking photos of the soldiers who died immediately afterwards, but she wasn't afraid to put the factual record above her own survival.  Capa was killed by doing just that. <br /> <br />Her disappearance was kep uder wraps, for some mysterious reason, with claims from the Head of Corporate Policy, that no one has an idea why's she'd simply vanished.  Was it a coverup or just fate that Melanie had been abandoned by the network?  Robin received threats and endured person violence, like the girl in the movie, 'Red Eye,' but it made her stronger in the end, but she returned home changed.  She faced her demons and won.

Modern Europe has advanced from the fifteen Western countries which formed the European Union in 1996 to meet the needs of high unemployment and to come up with a common currency, they called it 'euro.'  This is a welfare state with high taxes which hurt the average person but is haven to college students who can get their education free and health care is free, also.<br /><br />As we know from the local to the federal, governments always put their own interests ahead of any common interests, always with private deliberations and decisions.  There was a call for a need for equilibrium.  After the falll of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, things moved slowly and it was a \\"Catch-22\\" situation.<br /><br />In a previous review I did of THE UNITED STATES OF EUROPE, I felt that what I was writing was the truth, but I see now that some of it was exaggeration.  EMU, as it was called, would become cohesive and financially strong enough to dwarf the United States of America and our dollar.  That book tried to make evreyone think that they had already overpowered American in economics.  Granted, they do have some of our big factories there now, which is tragic for U.S. A. workers, but they have a far piece to go to be bigger and better.<br /><br />We have fifty states all under one government and one president.  Those countries they now call 'states' keep their individual ruling parties and will alternate every two years with a president from one of the group -- which will no doubt fail.  Even Monte Carlo will have a turn, along with Germany, Spain, France, and the other large 'states.'  It just won't work!<br /><br />Read THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE by Fred Coleman and see what will possibly happed to the United State of Europe.  It's is vainglorious to think it would ever work with so many different nationalities and too many grudges against each other for past events.  France has a history for revolution, so look toward that 'state' to see how things are progressing.  Spain is caught in the middle.  There is a woman here who is from Romania and, when I mentioned the United States of Europe, she had no interest and never a desire to return to Europe.  She was happy to receive a letter from her nephew there.<br /><br />I don't know whose idea it was to make a modren 'empire' as in the old days, Roman, British, French, but whoever -- it just won't work as it was planned, to overtake the U.S.A.  There will be a struggle for power among the differing factions, no way around it.  That's human nature.	2005-09-28

She exposed the Klan death threats and cross-burnings in Mississippi and suffered for her stand against violence, and economic strangulation in the name of \\"telling the people the truth and defending their freedom.\\"    It was considered harmful for females to ride bicycles in case it might harm their reproductive capability.  They adopted trousers (bloomers) so that they could ride them freely.  Through the suffragist press, women reinvented themselves as professional journalists, policy experts and savvy visionaries.  Susan B. Anthony's 'Revolution' and 'Farmer's Wife' publications led the way for the women to demonstrate for the right to vote.  They left a heritage of feisty optimism and stealthy radicalism which forced a nation to live up to its ideals of 'representative democracy.'    More women in the South are becoming involved in politics.  We even had a nominee for Mayor of Knoxville at the last election.  Louisiana has a female Governor.  What's this world coming to?

Family ties are the most important things, and Isabel Allende is masterfully adept at portraying young women in search of their roots.  I no longer want to know mine. She examines the human psyche and character to explain why the character acts the way she does.      This novel concerns loss of memory and family secrets.  It is the sequel to DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE.  For some reason, Aurora cannot remember anything from her first five years.  When my mother died and I was only seven, I too erased about all of my early years, remembering only fleeting glimpses into the past.  I do remember her taking me to my first day at school and I cried when she left me.  As a consequence, I became the teacher's pet.  But that's all I remember of that traumatic year when she was so sick.  So, after her death, I wiped her from my heart and my memory.    Aurora continued to have alluring nightmares caused by some trauma and live with her grandmother in a grand style in the 1860s.  She'd been born in San Francicso during the Civil War and grew up in a privileged environment.  I have a portrait of an old woman who has my eyes, only she is dressed elegantly in a long dress of heavy satin and ruffles and a purple hat.  I have a photo taken of my mother before she died; this, too in sepia.  She was laready sick but was dressed up and had an artificial flower in hre hair.  I have one of her not dressed up.    Aurora became a photographer and reflected \\"through photography and the written word, I try desperately to conquer the transitory nature of my existence, to trap moments... to untangle the confusion of the past.\\"  Maybe that's what I do as I take pictures of places and things (not people) around my hometown, to show me all I missed the long time I was away.    Her great-grandfathre had been Captain John Sommmres on her mother's side.  An English seaman,  he had to make his way through Yankee blockades and Confederate attacks.  He brought elaborate furniture to California for Paulina delValla, her father's mother, and had it assembled before delivreing it to Union Square.  During this time, Yankee and Confederate armies were fighting in the South.  The old lady in my sepia photo is holding a Confederate flag and shows her pride in it with her stature and smile.  The family had made its fortune in transporting fresh produce packed in Antarctic ice from Chile to California.    In Chile, she fell in love but is betrayed.  To cope with the disappointment and pain, she writes and explores the mysteries of hre past.   Some of it was unsavory to say the least. \\"Write with honesty and don't worry about the feelings of others, because no mattet what you say, they'll hate you anyway\\" was the advice of her surrogate parent.  Other books of Isabel Allende include OF LOVE AND SHADOWS, THE INFINITE PLAN, and THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS.  She is a marvel and has a wild imagination.	2005-09-27

He is regarded as one of America's greatest poets.  Among his many honors are four Pulitzer Prizes and an appointment as Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress.    At John F. Kennedy's inauguration on Jan. 20, 1961, he was called the Poet Laurete of U. S. A.  to be acknowledged by such an educated president to take part.  He was such an old man, he fumbled his papers, as he read \\"The Gift Outright.\\"  This was the first time when a poet had been so honored and marked a high point in his long and distinguished career.    When the English poet W. H. Auden wrote an essay in praise of Robert Frost, he made the observation that he was literally in a class by himself: \\"the class of nature poets who have worked with the land and actually know how to milk cows and, in general, can life the life of a Yankee farmer.  In his elder years, in Florida, he planted orange groves and other fruits.    He was more than a poet and man of letters.  He was a public figure and had by the time of his death in 1963 become a nation's symbol.  His most famous poems are \\"Stopping by Wood on a Snowy Evening\\" and \\"Mending Wall.\\"  In his book, NORTH OF BOSTON, you will find a long poem/fable called \\"The Generations of Man.\\"    Since I am a bird fancier, I chose \\"Looking For a Sunset Bird in Winter\\" (as I look for birds year round in this town which hates starlings and pigeons.     The west was getting out of gold,  The breath of air had died of cold,  When shoeing home across the white,  I thought I saw a bird alight.    In summer when I passed the place,  I had to stop and lift my face;  A bird with an angelic gift  Was singing in it sweet and swift.    No bird is singing in it now.  As gilt to gold that wouldn't show,  A brush had left a crooked stroke  Of what was either cloud or smoke --  From north to south across the blue.  A fpercing little star was (shining) thru.    In YOU COME, TOO, Noel Perrin write in his foreword, that Frost was determined to use \\"the ordinary language of ordinary people, and to transmute that plain Yankee speech into shining verse.\\"  President Kennedy is quoted, \\"...has bequeathed his nation a body of imperishable verse from which Americans will forever gain joy and understanding.\\"    NORTH OF BOSTON was written along with all sorts of briefer things in rhyme in a form suggested by the eclogues of Virgil.  He'd tried for years to get his poems published in 'Atlantic Monthly who automatically rejected each and every thing he submitted.  I used to love poetry but could not write it; Tristan, on the other hand, was such a writer, though his dad Zach was more into prose like his old mom, except for the science fiction and sports.  Robert Frost was a true classic.	2005-09-27

Frank Capa (born Endre Friedmann in 1913) was known as the 'Greatest War-Photographer in the World\\" when he died in 1954.  As a teen, he planned a career as a reporter.  Journalsim, he thought, would enable him to combine his loves of politics and literature.  In the spring of 1936, he adopted the name Robert Capa, the name of an alter ego, the imaginary character of a glamorous American photographer. <br /> <br />He photographed five wars from '36 to '54.  The first was the Spanish Civil War.  He'd been sent to Madrid to photograph Juan de la Cierva who, in 1923, had invented a forerunner of the helicopter.  He stayed on in Spain because he felt an affinity with the warmth, exuberance, and generosity of the Spanish people.  He went to Barcelona, (a penpal in the Fifties came from that area, Sabadell, and was a mill worker who learned his English from American sailors and Frank Sinatra records.), Andalucia, and Cordoba. <br /> <br />General Francisco Franco launched a civil war in July, 1936, which changed Spain forever.  He had the courage of his convictions and his photos show a compassionate study of people under extreme stress.  He was a photographer of people, which is the opposite of me, as I choose buildings, things, birs, animals, historic places and such for my amateur picture taking. <br /> <br />Unlike his friend Ernest Hemingway, he never felt he had to prove his courage to himself or to anyone else.  He was intent on making better pictures, at great risk to his safety.  Unlike Hemingway, he was very much a gentleman of the old school, coming from Europe, and \\"gentlemen don't brag.\\"  He believed that one shouldn't tempt fate by bragging.   <br /> <br />On the battlefields of Spain, he learned that soldiers use theri terrible weapons of mass destruction only because they have been brainwashed into the ability to 'conceptualize' their victims not as individuals but as a category -- the 'enemy.' <br /> <br />He died in Indochina when he stepped on aa nati-personnel land mine.  He was buried by his mother in a Quaker cemetery instead of Arlington National Cemetery, which was an offer she refused.	2005-09-27

This is a continuation of THE CELESTINE PROPHECY and THE TENTH INSIGHT.  This volume leads us on a journey in search of the 11th Insight.  He finds Shangri-La near Tibet and learns valuable lessons to help him to further evolve in his mission.  Paul Theroux took some of us along vicariously as he documented his trip from China to Lhasa, formerly the home of the Dahlai Lama.  Lowell Thomas was allowed to broadcast from Kathmandu in the Himalayas.    So this trip by James Redfield is familiar to those of us who were fans of Thomas and Theroux in the past.  When I reviewed his first #1 bestseller to a small group of literary women, a newcomer from California asked, \\"Are those your words?\\"  I had to admit that they came out of the book (his words) but I had (to make more sense of them) to skip around in the book to put them in order of the insights, which were interwoven in this treasure hunt fable.  She was impressed that a Southern woman could do that.  My son was not impressed; he said they were standard Eastern doctrines.  Redfield was then a resident of Alabama.  He's moved around a bit since he won fame for his three motivating adventures about Celestine beliefs and insights.    In THE TENTH INSIGHT,  he gave the history and culture which he found in the Appalachians.  \\"Our thoughts and attitudes count in making our dreams come true.\\"  This book is intended as the next step in awareness to help realize our destinies and purpose in life.  \\"The Eastern religions emphasized the effects on consciousness itself, the experience of lightness, a sense of oneness with the univrese, the release of the ego's desires, and a certain detachment.  Islam emphasized the feeling of unity which came with sharing this experience with others and the power inherent in group action.\\"    Judaism emphasized the importance of tradition based on this connection, of the experience of being chosen, and that each person alive is responsible for pushing forward the evolutin of human spirituality.  \\"Most people are full of energy and enthusiasm in their youth, but then during middle age they lapse into a slow, downhill slide that they pretend not to notice.\\"    The WWII generation fought against tyranny and proved that democracy could not only flourish in the modern world but expand and connect the world's economies.  Then, in the middle of the abundance, \\"the baby boomers arrived to say that there  were problems with this expansion, that we were polluting the natural would and losing touch with nature and a spiritual reality which exists beneath the whims of history.\\"    Where will he find the twelfth?	2005-09-26

Mid-fourth century Roman Empire was divided into an Eastern based in Constantinople and a Western based in Rome.  Christianity was the official religion of these final days of the Roman Empire.  M. Hippomanes was obsessed with the preservation of Roman civilization.    In the 14th Century, Avignon, the papal palace was built as the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between France and England began.  My heritage was traced back to the Black Prince of Enland during this time.  Clement VI was pope for ten years during the time of the Black Death.  The church splits with one pope in Rome and another in Avignon.  Oliver de Noyen was a poet during the 14th century and engaged in the plot to restore the papacy to Rome.    Julien Barneuve was interested in rescuing his own humanity when he joined the Vichy government.  That was the start of the Great Depression in 1929 and the outbreak of WWII in 1939.  The Jews of France were deported and Petain visited Avignon in 1942.    Each of these men in the diverse centuries far apart are linked by Cicero's \\"The Dream of Scipo,\\" which described philosophical questions:  What is the obligation of the individual in a society under seige?  What is the role of learning when civilization itself is threatened whether by acts of man or nature?  and \\"Does virtue lie more in engagement or in neutrality?    Each man dies tragically after getting involved with the wrong woman.  As Julien arranges his death, he makes sure that the work which dominated these men goes up in flames with him at the home of his old mother.  He smokes his last cigarette as he places the things just so and everything is in ashes when the fire is discovered.  This book is compared to THE NAME OF THE ROSE and THE RULE OF FOUR.	2005-09-26

Man's quest to replicate living beings goes back thousands of years.  Today, there is a 21st century robot with a mobile body complete with intricate computer software, making it \\"act\\" rationally.  The \\"thinking android\\" of our century has evolved through many stages.  For years, we've seen robots in movies, science fiction, and on television.  I loved R2D2 and C3PO in the first 'Stars Wars' feature.      Robots don't ever have feelings.  They do what they are programmed for and nothing else.  Only twice, in the movies, have any robots neared human emotions, the \\"star\\" of R.O.B.O.T.S and the 'dear family robot' in the movie, 'Centennial Man' played by Robin Williams.  The clones in the movie, 'The Island,' were programmed to be robots, but some actually became human with needs and feelings of man.    The Planetary Society's second attempt to place a solar sail into Earth orbit failed when the Volna boostre's first stage misfired shortly after launch from a submarine in the Barents Sea.  In a previous attempt in 2001, the Cosmos 1 solar sail did not separate from the booster's third stage.  The Society had hoped to make the first controlled flight of a solar sail, which is probelled by only the faint pressure of photons on its eight reflective triangular blades.  Such vehicles, a type of robot, are predicted to eventually achieve speeds five times as great as those achieved by a chemical-powered rocket.    In Lille, France, the European Capital of Culture, is a 'fetus to man' sculpture.  It has a life-sized metal clock-jack.  The human figure, or jack, are the hands on the clock; fetus in the womb at 6:00, erect as an adult at 12:00, old age at 6:00 as he bends under the weight of the years.  A fantastic thing to see.  The photos in this book are \\"out of this world.\\"    Back in 1993, my year of temp. jobs on computers, I kept promoting my ability to work 'robotics.'  The only talking robot I'd ever seen in person was at Knoxville's 1982 World's Fair, so I know very little about them.  And yet, I constantly spoke of being able to control robots, thinking I could get a better job.  In our small town and the lawnmower/bicycle factory where I had my last job, robotics were primitive and the operator punched a few buttons for them to perform the more intricate jobs the Japanese do by hand.  We're not that technical in America so most every job was done by hand.  I was 'accurate but not fast' at data entry and our boss from Memphis, Steve (whose ancestor was an infamous criminal in the Old West), assured me that my accuracy was more important than the enormous errors made by the faster temp staff.  He said, when the job was completed, \\"When iI return, I expect Betty to own a robot factory.\\"  Actually, he was back in a few months and said he was glad that I was the one sent to help his crew organize a new computer accounting system for that same factory, Gabriel.  I heard him telling others that he was going to hire a full-time person, but he didn't get around to asking me, so I moved on to the fated job in the office at Murray Ohio which did me in.  He'd asked me once, \\"Are we having fun yet?\\" and I had to shake my head.  It was hard work and I lost faith in my ability.    Robotic prosthetics are becoming sophiscated and look and function better than the biological body part.  Several movies have been made about and containing robots in addition to 'Star Wars' and '2001 A Space Oddyssey' (Hal), 'Short Circuit' had Johnny 5, and 'Artificial Intelligence' had David.  In the 1965 t.v. series, 'Lost in Space' had Dr. Zachary Smith as did the 1998 movie of the same name.    Robots are the future, but they will never take the place of humans, as it takes man (or woman) to make them work properly.	2005-09-25

In this melancholy memorir of sorts, he reminates about his life growing up on the Great Plains in small-town Texas, about the vast emptiness of the Texas landscape and it effect it has on the natives.  There is a vast loneliness and he feels he has been born too late so he develops an interest in vanishing breeds.  The Old West has come and gone.  Some time ago, I reviewed his book, THE COLONEL AND LITTLE MISSIE. <br /> <br />He extolls the virtues of the Archer City Dairy Queen (no where else to go back then (we still have some of those places here in Knoxville) in the Eighties where he'd go to read as he drank a strasnge concoction of Dr. Pepper with lime.   Now, you can get a lime Slushie with a real cherry at Sonic, the drive-in of today. <br /> <br />He'd started on a translation of the German philosophre, Walter Benjamin's 'Illuminations,' a group of essays.  He particularly liked \\"The Storyteller,\\" and refers to it often as he thinks back on his life \\"to think about place, his life, literature and his relation to it.\\"  For twenty-five years, he has been telling his stories in book form, some of which were turned into movies, like LONESOME DOVE, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, BUFFALO GIRLS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. <br /> <br />He compares Benjamin's life in Europe with that of his grandparents settling in Texas, \\"while my grandparents were dealing with vast emptiness...Europe was approaching density (absolute and perhaps intolerable.\\"   There is no comparison, as they were on completely opposite polars.  <br /> <br />He'd gone on a lifelong quest to study European literature to learn their culture that spawned his own pioneer family, a quest which comes full circle, with his reminiscences for this book.  He loves to remind folks of the way things used to be and this erudite elegy for the lost paces in American life and of the cowboy\\" comes forefront.  He doesn't care much for Paul Theroux's early mentor, V. S. Pritchett.   <br /> <br />He gives an intelligent assessment of his career and the demise of oral storytelling.  He promotes the need for reading and appreciated the works of Proust.  He comes across as a bitter, cranky old man as he tells about his childhood and feeling 'soul-less' after his heart surgery.    He's had a great career studing life and writing some strange novels.  Some others are THE EVENING STAR, TEXASVILLE, and STREETS OF LOREDO.	2005-09-25

Kari Swenson was abducted  by a mountain man father/son team as she hiked alone on an isolated trail in the thickness of the country growth at Big Sky, Montana, as she trained for the Olympics event she meant to win.  They treated her abusively in the rough mountain way as she pleaded to be released.  The old man, Don Nichols, asked his son, \\"Shall we keep her?\\"  Danny nodded, with \\"Yeah, let's keep her.\\" <br /> <br />This drama played out for five months while the first rescuer was killed on Moonlight Creek in the wild forest, so close to Big Sky.  \\"Remembering a tragedy is always painful.\\"  The long manhunt and eventual capture of the kidnappers ended peaceably due to the expertise of Sheriff Johnny France.  This \\"drama of the confrontation between the Sheriff and the fugitives is as exciting as any fiction\\" and it is \\"a tale of high adventure in real life.\\" <br /> <br />At the first trial in Virginia City where cowboys drink coffee and other liquids at Bettie's Cafe, Danny was not found guilty of murder because his father was the one  who shot Al Goldstein.  The district judge is described as a crusty old Southerner who 'ran a tight court' who felt that the younger man should have been found guilty as well because the murder had occurred during the course of the original felony.  But the jury of rural Montana didn't see it that way.  Dan got the maximum sentence to be served at the hardrock prison at Deerlodge. <br /> <br />A new trial ended with Don Nichols receiving guilty on both counts, murder and kidnapping and also got the maximum sentence under law.  He must serve 42 years before any chance of parole.  For a man his age, that is equivalent to the death sentence. <br /> <br />Life goes on at the Mountain Range with hot dry summers and fiercely cold winters.  Kari went back to full time training for international biathlon competition, but this time in the Green Hills of Vermont -- but never alone.  She was only twenty-three when that happened; today, she would be 44.  By now, it is hoped that she has found the peace after such a grueling experience.	2005-09-24

Blanche White is a woman who knows how it feels to fear for her life.   After working as a domestic at day work for genteel Southerners in North Carolina, she has a \\"so-what-if-I've-got-an-attitude\\" manner.  This is called Southern Gothic, a mystery with a message, but it is he debut of Barbara Neely and we all know that first novels have a lot of truth in them. <br /> <br />She's middle-aged, caustic, plump, street-smart with a nickname of 'Tar Baby' and a feminist.  She's the anthisis of Vivian Sims, a light skinned radical from New York.  And yet they have the same way of getting what they want at other's expense.  As different as night from day, Vivian married a technical school administrator and moved right into his first-wife's artistic home and started making her own wine for friends from the big town.  She and her mother, from Harlem, would go on a yearly trip every year with Mr. Sims who was always the target of attraction because of the hue of his skin.  Since he was paying the bills, they enjoyed watching him being followed as an oddity and bought all the things they'd ever wanted with his money. <br /> <br />Blanche, on the other hand, was a woman who'd fought for her life and won; that woman, no matter how much she had changed, was still capable of negotiating 'enemy territory.'  She was a pro at the old-girl network among domestic workers and felt that she could find a job as easily in Boston as in North Carolina, where she was on the lam for writing a few bad checks.  She had no place else to go, so she took the money she was given and caught the Greyhound to save on traveling costs. <br /> <br />Always around the filthy rich with all their inbred fights and murders, she is ready to be anonymous in a large city.  Ms. Neely followups with BLANCHE AMONG THE TALENTED TENTH, BLANCHE CLEANS UP and BLANCHE PASSES GO.	2005-09-24

For forty years now, Cormac McCarthy has been entertaining men with his complicated fables to feed their inner wish to be tough like his characters.  This is his 'adieu' to the Santa Fe Institute where he's been author-in-residence for four years.  He thanks Amanda. <br /> <br />He writes about the kind of men I'd never want to encounter, rough, uneducated killers of men and animals.  The desert is no place for 'old men.'  He's definitely a man's writer.  Surely no woman would or could read his stuff.  His ALL THE PRETTY HORSES was turned into a lovely movie which I liked, but the love story was 'inserted' for Hollywood, I was told. <br /> <br />I found this disturbing novel less tham mesmerizing and the grammar awful.  I though with a name like Lew Ross, I'd finally found my 'dream man;' alas, he's the typical roudh MacCarthyism all the way.  He lives with his young wife, Loretta (typical) near the Rio Grande. <br /> <br />I've tried to read one or two of his books before as I know a writer here sho met him at a bar on Gay Street and admires him -- just because he wrote SUTTREE aabout Knoxville long ago in the past.  It was considered his 'magnum opus' at the time and the paperback cover shows the old train trestle below Volunteer Landing.  Set in the 1950s he has eccentrics, criminals, squatters, outcasts and such living in physical and human squalor along the waterfront.  His main character Sutree lives in a houseboat on the Tennessee River near Knoxville (actually, it runs right through the middle of the town).  I'd like to say that this town was not like that for the natives in the Fifties; it's a made-up story to downgrade the town. <br /> <br />Recently, I met a 'gentle' man from Minnesota who came here from Texas and told he that he is trying to read McCarthy.  So, I decided that if someone so nice could do it, so could I.  The stereotypical nature of his characters and his use of violence turned me off completely.  The roles fate plays in forming a life ishere as Sherriff Bell laments 'the changing world' as he seeks Anton Chigurh, who had killed his deputy and left a trail of bodies out in the desert.  He feels like narcotics are Satan.  This is, as so many of his books are, a battle between good and evil.  He writes, \\"you have to be willing to die,\\" and \\"It is more more what you are willing to become.\\"  Everybody knows that the eyes are the windows to the soul.  I know a woman who truly has 'devil eyes' even when she tries to smile.  She'd make a perfect character in a Cormac McCarthy novel if he's go modern for a change. <br /> <br />You can't possibly compare to tho ALL THE GOOD MEN.  No Way!	2005-09-24

A. space odyssey is complex due to interdependence.  The American space effort is separated into four sectors:  commercial, civil, defense and security.  He concentrates on the last three which began as a single sector with the military.    Written by a career Air Force official involved in the space program, he stresses national security and military space programs as stand-alone, and that the civil sector was political, for national prestige.  He was able to document the historical interaction of the civil and military space programs due to the released (on the Internet) of previously classified information.      Now the whole story can be told, but is it?  He places emphasis on national security and defense saying that the U.S.A. will go to any length to ensure this country's survival.  Some information has yet to be downgraded because of the terrorists' access to the Internet.  No expose here, either, but he declares that there is ongoing security classification.    The purpose of the earliest space policy in 1948 was to classify space efforts; security and classification are double-edged swords.  Through the Fifties, Seventies, an Eighties, things expanded from technological innovation to adapting to changing technology.  In his field, the military, he says that \\"the nature of war changed radically during the Space Age.\\"  Space programs have enabled the acceleration of time and the volume and quality of information, with the Air Force in control of doctrine, very important in the military.    Things almost fell apart with the loss of the 'Challenger.'  That's been a long time now -- I remember that winter day with the icycles hanging from the fated space shuttle while working at the Giles County Library.  So, now will it go commercial?    There is a new aerospace doctrine of the U.S.A.  In one of the 'quirks of fate,' as America was trying to recover from the 'Challenger' disaster, the Soviet Union collapsed.  Now, a new Commonwealth ofIndependent States have overtaken U.S.A. in prominenece.  I recently reviewed a book about the United States of Europe who are passing us in affluence rapidly.    We no longer need the reconnaissance satallites and that secret SAC Headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, was deactivated during Clinton's administration.  That was a major mistake.  Now, the terrorists have access to our classified information and will keep on until they destroy this country.    The Air Force covert programs were unrecognized and unacknowledged.  But, since the former chairperson of the Space Commission has been confirmed as defense secretary for Bush, it is overt and no longer covert.  God help us!    The author, L. Parker Temple III, earned a PhD in science and technology policy from George Washington University and worked in the military space program since 1976.  This book \\"tracks the evolution of space reconnaissance systems from their seeds in the painful lessons of Pearl Harbor through the challenges of today.\\"  Not an easy book to get through, but worth the effort.	2005-09-23

This is an adequate pictorial biography composed by Colin Escott And Kira Florita of Hiram (Hank) Williams, though he had left very little written context besides his songs.  He was thirteen when his family moved to Montgomery, Alabama.  When he was fifteen, he was tall and had a grown-man's voice.  He was basically uneducated as his handwritten letters to his mother show.  The teenage Hank wore glasses.  His mother, Lillie, went along on some of his early performances.  Her domestic life was troubled.    Hank and Audrey were happy in 1944 when they were in their twenties.  But his mother intruded as she and Audrey did not get along.  They divorced in May, 1948, but reconciled and Hank, Jr. was born exactly one year later.  In Nashville, they had a fancy house on Franklin Road (which I used to drive by in the Seventies) during the time he appeared on the Grand Ole Opry.    The 'Hillbilly Hit Parade' of 1947 showed Eddy Arnold had two in the Top 10, \\"I'll Hold You in My Heart\\" and \\"It's a Sin.\\"  Jo Stafford, a pop singer had a duet of 'Timtayshun' at #6; she later recorded Hank's song, \\"Jambalaya.\\"  His song \\"Move It On Over\\" was recorded first by Cowboy Copus and was in the #2 spot.  In 1947-48, he appeared on WLAC in Nashville; Bob Lobertini were there in various capacities fifteen years later.  He sang on \\"Hillbilly Jamboree\\" on WCKY in Cincinnati, Nick Clooney's station.  I miss him still.    Hank could mesmerize an audience with his personality and the way he sang.  He had a spine operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville in December, 1951 -- a year before his death, requiring stronger and stronger pain medicines to enable him to perform.    In January, 1952, they divorced again and he took up with Bobbie Lett, a former dancer but working as a secretary when she gets pregnant with his child.  She'd been a pretty girl, but was very sedate when he met her there in Nashville.  She'd previously been married to Monte Hale of cowboy movie fame out in California.    In June of that year, he married his second wife, Billie Jean, from Shreveport, Louisiana.  He was back where he started at the 'Louisiana Hayride' from September to December), but this time he was the star attraction.  He was not my type of singer but I did like his \\"Kawliga, the wooden Indian\\" song.      \\"Lost Highway\\" is just one of the enormous amount of songs he recorded.  You can find a discography of all of his records in the book, SING A SAD SONG by Roger M. Williams and Bob Pinson.  A good accompaniment to these two are Bill Koon's SO LONESOME.    Hank didn't really have time to be lonesome, as the pictures show he always had many people around him and many who cared.  He was only twenty-nine, same age as Justin, when he died.  God Bless Him.	2005-09-23

This is the continuing sea-faring heroes' tale as they venture to Ireland after their last assignment to the Gulf of Guinea to suppress the slave trade.  The two central characters are Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon, who uses his resourcefulness as a secret intelligence agent as a second profession.  Alas, his little girl, Brigid, appears to be autistic, incapable of speech or contact, but it could be caused by the disiappearance of her mother -- as was the case of the child in the movie, The Patriot.' <br /> <br />In this one, Jack has been promoted; \\"I shall be a 'first-class' commodore\\" promised by Melville.  This is about early 19th century naval life filled with varied characters on the ships with all the quirks and dialects possible.  This adventure is \\"one of those great fleet actions on which the supremacy of the British Navy was founded.\\"  They have a direct confrontation with the French navy.  It is an imagined world you don't want to leave, like Terry Webber's performance of both Booth and Lincoln in the one-man performance of 'Killing Lincoln,' I told him \\"I didn't want you to stop; I wanted you to go on and on and on.\\" <br /> <br />'New York Times Book Review' calls this series \\"the best historical novel ever written.\\"  That may be stretching it some as I feel that way about Jack Finney's stories.  American Navy had its own Admiral Farragut after whom a building in Knoxville is named, also a suburb which is becoming a town of its own. <br /> <br />John Ferguson calls O'Brian \\"a lyric poet working in epic form\\" which is an adequate comparison with Homer's \\"Odyssey.\\"  James Hamilton wrote in 'New Republic' that Patric O'Brian is 'the Homer of the Napoleonic wars.\\"   He has seventeen sequential novels about these two seamen pals, which are brilliantly written.  I am wondering, will there be a number eighteen?	2005-09-23

This Dolores is nothing like Stephen King's maniacial Delores who held a famous writer as hostage and broke his legs to keep him from escaping her \\"loving care.\\"  A movie was made, but I can't remember how he finally escaped.    Movies have been made of some of Jacqueline Susann's books, most notably VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in which one of the female drug addicts was named Neely.  I saw an ad in the UT Beacon a few years ago with the name Neely Burks, and thought that could not be a real person, but I was told about this character as I had insisted that a girl would not have that name.  Her figure was firm and slim enough to pass for a girl's.    This Dolores had been pampered by an adoring father who indulged her with pretty dresses from an expensive place on Madison Avenue and teas at the Plaza, totally different from King's Dolores who was a crazed delluded person.  There are drugs in this book, as she ran with the \\"in\\" crowd.    After marriage, her life was dreary and she fantasized about the disc jockeys she listened to and stayed up late watching movies on television.  In fact, she became almost suicidal at one time.  She entered into a relationship with her 'dream man,' Barry, and they became a society item: \\"What untouchable glamorous lady is very in touch with the handsome husband of a very rich lady?  Since they both come from political backgrounds, maybe it's just politics they talk about in those late-night get-togethers\\" in the paper's gossip column.  Sounds like Louella Parsons.    After a time, Barry's wife had a stroke and died.  There were many society figures and government officials who attended the funeral, but not Dolores (who sent flowers instead) - she didn't want to be hypocritical.  His wife's Will left him well-off but had a catch:  \\"at age 65, he'd inherit five million dollars if he is unmarried; if he remarries, then he gets nothing.\\"  They decide to be a couple but not marry until his 65th birthday.  I know a man who lost his wife and was left virtually homeless, as her children took all she had, and he remarried right away (to an older woman) -- just for a place to live.  He told me, \\"People don't have to be in love to get married.\\"    Barry flitted around enjoying life in Bermuda, Switzerland, and Paris among other hot spots, while Dolores stayed at home fuming and gained weight. He ends up choosing someone else, but a Baron had his eye on Dolores who said he would marry her, but he likes his women thin; she is to call him after she loses twenty pounds.  What a cad!    When she got down to 107 lbs. (lost a total of twenty-two) and looked pencil-slim dressed in black slacks and black sweater (black is supposed to make you look thinner, but it doesn't work for Cindy Pickle.), she moans, \\"I'm so thin now, nothing fits!\\"  She's now forty years old and he bequeaths her (for losing the weight) a full length sable coat, a 60-carat diamond ring, and turns out to be one of those men who have a mistress.  He spends their wedding night away, and she finds that she had found just an empty dream.  Barry had broken her heart, and she married for revenge.  Any kind of revenge never works; it rebounds on the person who is intent on winning.    Jacqueline Susan had a long writing career, and this is her exit 'gift' to her readers.  She always wrote about rich and glamourous people.  Jeffrey Ventura wrote an Award biography called THE JACQUELINE SUSANN STORY and David Hanna also wrote THE WORLD OF JACQUELINE SUSAN -- both are available on Amazon.com	2005-09-23

The premise of this book is so sad it makes me want to cry.  Hank Williams was an unreliable country singer (like George Jones who came along later), who did things he would not have done had he not been on drugs and a hard drinker.  Before his death, he signed a written contract that a child had been born to a woman in Montgomery.  Actually, he had signed a notarized contract acknowledging his paternity of Bobbie Jett's as yet unborn child on October 15, 1952, three months before her birth.  She was to be \\"wholly and completed supported by him.\\" <br /> <br />He was a lanky, boyish-looking man (not good looking) with eyes much older than his years.  Drugs, liquor, and hard-living caught up with him on New Year's Eve, 1952, in Knoxville, Tennessee, at the Andrew Johnson Hotel -- six days before Jett was born.   Bobbie Jett moved from Montgomery to California after the birth, and Hank's mother adopted her only to die and leave the child unprotected.  She was with a foster home, as a ward of the state, then adopted again at the age of three when she went to live in Mobile, Alabama.   <br /> <br />On her 21st birthday, her mother visited her where she was attending the University of Alabama and presented her with two thousand dollars her grandmother had bequeathed to her to receive at that time.  So the truth is out.  She did have a famous father from whom she had inherited his talent.  \\"My guitar was my best friend growing up,\\" she said; the radio was mine, and I sang along with the pop songs and could mimic them perfectly, and pantomime difficult recordings such as Teresa Brewer who always sang in a hurry.  My dad used to sing the Hank Williams' songs, 'Hey, Good Lookin' and \\"I'm so lonesome I could cry' along with 'Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes' to me as he played his guitar.  His father sang church music and played harmonica.  I did try 'Your Cheatin' Heart' on the Cas Walker Show once, but I was not country enough to suit his high standards and went back to the love of my life, pop music. <br /> <br />She'd wondered where she had gotten her deep love of music, but now knew and also realized that \\"Hard to believe I'd been so wanted after all.\\"  She discovered that her mother had married and had five other children but, when Jett called to speak with her on the phone, she leared that her mother was dead, too.  So, now she is an orphan.  Just knowing she was loved after all was the lifting of a tremendous burden. <br /> <br />You must see the photo sections in the book to realize just how far this woman has come.  Her biological mother was beautiful, could have been my sister, dark eyes and all.  There is a photo of Hank and Aubrey (Hank, Jr.'s mother) with a group called 'The Drifting Cowboys.\\"  Jett made a tour in 1989 with this same group (old men now) and it was called \\"Jett Williams and the Drifting Cowboys.\\"  Life comes full circle.  There is an article in August, 2005, edition of 'Guideposts,' an inspirational publication called \\"Birthright\\" about her present life in Hartsdale, Tennessee.  She looks like her dad.	2005-09-23

She is a courageous young mother to come forth with her account of this kind of depression.  When people hear that word, they automatically consider the sufferer to be mentally deranged, but research has proven otherwise.  One local writer told about her being locked in a mental facility and held as a prisoner because she'd just had a baby and could not cope.  Some radicals told her how brave she was to write a long, detailed account in the weekly alternative paper.  I said she had to be crazy to go public with a private illness.  I proved right, as she relocated to New York a short time later.    Many women go through this trauma.  Marie Osmond actually ran away from her family and ended up confused and lost out in the desert.  But she received treatment and resumed a kind of career, not as grand as before she had admitted to having depression of any kind.  That is considered a stigma first-class.  Barbara Mandrell went through a milder form of postpartum after her last child was born, as she had been in a bad accident and been in a coma for a while before she got pregnant.  The accident had nothing to do with the postpartum.    Brooke, on the other hand, divorced the tennis player and found another love to help care for her child.  Every male loved her in 'The Blue Lagoon' movie, but then she was just adolescent.  In her t.v. show, 'Suddenly Susan,' she formed a special friendship with David Strickland and learned some 'lessons of life' from his inability to cope with his depression.  \\"He was a brilliant but vulnerable actor and an incredibly loyal friend.  It was as if the emotional vulnerability that made him a great actor destroyed him as a person.\\"  In 1999, he committed suicide.    When her bout of depression hit her, she suddenly realized how desperate her friend David must have been and how hard it is to reach out for help.  She learned as a result of this tragedy these four crucial things to do to help a friend in trouble:  1) Be there for them and listen.2) Give them information even if they are not ready to act on it.  3) Be honest with compassion.  Write down every blessing in  your life.  At times you fell you won't susvive depression, but there is help.  Without it, you can spiral out of control.  Someone in crisis can't always make the good choices and negative thoughts take over your mind.  When you are depressed, you need medical care.  4) Pray for others not just when they are in dire straits.  \\"When I felt that there was nothing I could do to help myself, just knowing that I was prayed for was often the only thing that stood between me and despair.\\"  I too have many people praying for me to discover the cause of my inter bleeding and receive the proper treatment so I can stick around a bit longer.  I still have lots to do before I'm gone for good.    When a friend is in trouble, you need to act, even over-react.  There is nothing greater than a friend who is willing to reach out.  That's what friends are for.  The motto, \\"Don't worry, be happy\\" doesn't work if you are deep in depression.  God can help, but we need friends, physicians, therapists, whomever, to listen and follow through to get us on the way to feeling like ourselves again.    Brooke Shields has helped many people with her book about this ordinary illness which affects many women, and some men.  We owe her a debt of gratitude.	2005-09-22

The main characters in this novel are a tough reporter, Christine, who falls in love with the \\"golden boy\\", Greg, there at the Federal Broadcasting Company.  However, he wants the power that he can get only by marrying the daughter of the CEO; thus, betraying Christie for his own selfishness.  She felt hurt but married someone else and continued to climb to the top of her profession only to learn that her profession is like walking a narrow tightrope.<br /><br />It's just that you see possibilities now where they did not previously exist. Remain open to a new road, but don't try to commit to any one path at this time; it is much more likely to get where they want to go through dint of hard work and sheer, never-say-die persistence.<br /><br />At the fair, I saw a small circus group who performed like professionals, and one did indeed walk a tightrope and balanced a chair on the tightrope -- while another, the 'star' was the trapeze performer.  Though the talented tightrope lady was not as attractive as the star, I told her after the show, \\"You are lovely\\" and she appreciated my praise.<br /><br />Network news is a world of bitter rivalries as we saw in the movie which starred Michael Douglas, 'Network.'  Christie returned to her first love after ten years, and she allowed Greg and ambition to rule her life again.  Such is the power of love.  \\"In power and in love, ambition is everything.\\"  I was a regular on 'Your Star Time' as a teen but never felt much like a star until I made it to 'Teen Time\\" on the Tennessee Theatre stage, which also was broadcast on the radio.  I'm not saying I had star-glow, just innocence coupled with a lot of determination to do what I knew how to do.<br /><br />As with high-stakes networks, even t.v. and local talent can be overlooked when someone else came along to take the credit for what we had started.  The newspaper left out the decade of the Fifties, as did the ti.v station in their 50th history (where every local performer was a star.  Money talks in big time and in ordinary life.

The Moon is back in your sign where there is a tendency to over-simplify your emotions.  Landing on the moon was our first global media event, and the various astronauts were the superstars.  From the first man to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong, to the last one to perform that special feat, Gene Cernan, we learn about those in between.  They were Americans who risked everything to hurl out into the unknown universe as explorers of the Space Age.  None of us will forget seeing the first man on the moon and hear his words, \\"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"  He spoke in long pauses and the ordinary content made the  wait seem worth it.  In public speaking, I found that the pauses give the audience a chance to reflect on what you are saying and to understand better than if you just race through your speech.    In 1960 (when Jeff and John, Jr. were born), John F. Kennedy beat Nixon by the slimmest of margins (except for Gore's non-\\"win\\" against Bush), 118,574 vote difference.  He was the immepetus we needed to thrust the United States of America as the 'leaders in Space.'    These specially trained men were expertly trained astronauts who represented this country with pizazz.  In addition to Neil Armstrong, mission commander of Apollo 11, and Gene Cernan, commander of Apollo 17, we have Buzz Aldrin, pilot (reviewed a book about him not long ago), James Irwin, Charlie Duke of Apollo 11, Jack Schmitt, Apollo XVII, Alan Bean also walked on the moon, MIke Collins and Dick Gordon who did not land on the moon but contributed their expertise doing what was expected of them, and John Young, the longest serving astronaut in history.    Many ignorant country people believed that the space walks were 'staged' out in the desert -- because of their distrust of our government officials.  Nixon was one you could not trust, and Lyndon Johnson was too busy with civil rights to take much interest in the space program.  Had it not been for Kennedy, it probably have petered out before anyone ever had a chance to walk on the moon.    They were savvy spacemen prepared for orbiting the earth, performing essential experiments and such, but completely unprepared for fame.  They went from the sense of euphoria and awe in the black sky to ruined personal lives and divorces back on earth.  Buzz said that he'd always wanted to 'stand in' for George Clooney in Las Vegas!  They were put on the 'back burner' and had to deal with \\"the biggest adventure you could possibly have ... (which) became just a memory.\\"      Apollo 12 seemed to be everyone's favorite mission with Commander Pete Conrad and Lunar Module pilot, Alan Bean, who died on July 8, 1998, in a freak motorcycle accident.  Andrew Smith blends myth with the rality these human men had to face.  It is history (facts) and also a memoir of the author.  He captures the \\"bittersweet heroism\\" of these brave men who risked everything.  America needs its heroes to survive.  Don't ever forget what these men gave up for their country.	2005-09-21

NASA experimented with different programs and each mission helpted to determine their research progress in the main mission to be the first to do things in Space.  NASA uses young, ambitious people as guinea pigs.  When my son Jeff had his first NASA job, he told me he was a glorified computer operator. They used his hard-earned experience at the University of Chicago to catagorize the information coming to base at Boulder, Colorado, from the flawed Hubble telescope.  He'd spent years at Kitt Peak in Arizona (his professor getting all the credit) as a grad student in astronomy, and this task was important to him so that he worked for half-salary that year.  Was his work appreciated?  He was kicked out the door as soon as the Hubble was corrected.  So much for job security. <br /> <br />It takes pioneer spirit to have the courage for those experimental 'flights' Scott Carpenter and his colleagues achieved.  He was the 4th American in space and the second to orbit the earth.  In May, 1962, he made history in the tiny spacecraft 'Aurora 7' which malfunctioned in one of its scanners , forcing him to \\"overshoot\\" the expected landing site by 250 miles.   This led to a lifetime of controversy. <br /> <br />This book, written with his daughter, explains in detail this ill-fated flight which made him famous or infamous. He clears up lingering doubts about that flight while telling history 'as he lived it.'  When things don't work out exactly as projected, it is always the main person involved who takes the blame for its 'failure' as in the case of Jeff, who is again on NASA's payroll at a Center of Excellence in Nashville for which he took tours of students to the Pasadena Jet Propulsion Lab several times a year.  Now that phase is over, and it seems that his job is in jeopardy again. <br /> <br />After Project Mercury, Scott went on to take part in Naval Sealabs as an undrewater explorer and researcher.  From high above the earth to deep below the ocean, he has traversed time from one dimension to another.  He is one of our greatest Space hereoes, 'Commander Carpenter and his flying machine.'  He's endured quite a journey and paid dearly in his personal life.  Re remarried in 1988 and had son Zachary. <br /> <br />His fellow \\"Right Stuff\\" astronauts included John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Deke Slayton, Al Shepard, Gordo Cooper, and Wally Schirra. \\"Journeys so perilous that farewells were in fact small prayers.  'Good-bye' is itself an invocation that God attend every step, and with 'audieu' and 'Godspeed' for that matter -- for speedy journeys bring travelers home sooner rather than later.  And home soon is always good.\\"  Keep faith, Geoffrey.	2005-09-21

This debut novel, based on fact, is set in England and packed full of suspense and intrique during the preparations for the invasion of Normandy to end WWII.  This adventure story follows Churchill's hand-picked protectorate of the operation called M15, as he uses phony radio signals and bogus information concerning non-existent airfields and barracks to steer Hitler's forces in the wrong direction.  Churchill declared, \\"In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.\\"    His choice, a brilliant history professor who had been a courier in WWI, a bachelor in the British Isles, is the unlikeliest spy you could picture.  He's reclusive, secretive, and fabricates false reports which he then sends to Germany so they will think that their spy network is functional. <br /> <br />Actually, it is in the guise of a ruthless assassin called Mata Hari but her actual name is Anna Katerina von Steiner, code name Catherine Blake.  She poses as a widow whose RAF pilot husband lost his life in the Battle of Britain.  In fact, there were Nazi spies everywhere in London at that pivotal time of the war effort.  In 1944, Peter Jordon, an American engineer enters the picture, given in evocative detail, and knows the top-secret project for D-Day.  Will Catherine seek him out, or will she concentrate on Alfred Vicary?  Full of romance and glamour, she works as a volunteer at a London hospital while she keeps Abwehr informed of all she sees; that is the espionage agency under the direction of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. <br /> <br />This book has it all but it shows spying at its worst.  Daniel Silva's first novel is compared to those of Ken Follett, Frederick Forsyth, Jack Higgins, John LeCarre and Robert Harris, all who write war thrillers.  He is certainly in good company.  Since this debut, he has written PRINCE OF FIRE, THE CONFESSOR, and A DEATH IN VIENNA.  It is interesting, fun and exciting to read as you ride the buses.  Seems like a combination of two movies I've seen lately, 'The Great Raid' being one of them.	2005-09-21

Mary Eliot lived a double life in Nebraska; she was not beautiful but doubled as her spouse's personna to be the woman behing the throne.  The public adored Randal Eliot's literary novels and he recieved many honors such as rumor of a Pulitzer, tenure at the University, the acclaim and worship from his readers.  For twenty years, Mary wrote his books while he was in and out of mental institutions.  It was a loveless marriage, but it offered an 'out' for Mary's gift of genius with the English language and her unfulfilled dreams of happiness, all expressed in 'his' books.  She was caught in a bind from which there seemed to be no escape, the way I felt before my deliverance in 1980 into a world of poverty. <br /> <br />Mary's lot would have been the same, but she stuck it out believing in the marriage vows \\"for better or worse, in sickness and in health.\\"  She felt trapped with a family who must be provided for, as even loveless marriages do produce children, sad to say.  I have never been a 'night woman' as I think better in the morning hours; when we were inducing a man for PTA president after my term, he used the expression \\"ladies of the night\\", trying to be cute -- but it backfired on him, as our school principal was a tough-as-nails maiden lady. <br /> <br />When Randal did not 'drown in his private anguish and madness,  his car skidded on an icy road leaving Mary a widow who, at last, could relax on her own laurels in a new house of her own.  As with V.C. Andrews continuing sequels after being dead low these many years, she pretends to find some Randal had purportedly written earlier and she continued to write using his name.  She'd been in his shadow for so long that now she longed to be known for the author she really was. <br /> <br />To complicate matters, she is used by Paul Anderson who she married -- the intense younger man who wanted to make a name for himself as the biographer of the beloved Randal Eliot.  She was as yet unpublished but used passion topretend to love her to learn the secrets of her former life.  When she balked, and would not ever reveal that it was she who had written all of the books herself without help, he showed sudden, brutal temper tantrums.  I'd like to say it was caused by the 'age difference,' but that wasn't it at all.  His past had been a violent one, along the lines of her former husband, not as advanced in his obsessions at that age, but he used brutal force to get what he wanted.  His ambition was such that nobody or anything would get in his way, as he pursued Mary to tell him the truth.   <br /> <br />Since Nancy Price had previously written SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY which was turned into a movie starring the Pretty Woman, we can imagine some of the abuse Mary had to live through.  She has written NO ONE KNOWS, A NATURAL DEATH and AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN.  She received hre M.A. degreee from the Univerestiy of Northern Iowa (I had a friend twenty-five years ago, Karen Davis, who had a Masters degree, but would not reveal from where; she said it did not matter which school, and I guess she was right).  Ms. Price was a Rockefeller Foundation resident scholar at Lake Como, Italy.  That must be Heaven on Earth!	2005-09-21

This is the basis for the movie of the same name, an overwhelming preformance in words.  Yes, it is comic because the old woman is in a nursing home ready to celebrate her birthday and anniversary of being the oldest Confederate widow.  Actually, she'd been a young girl (age 15) when she foolishly married the fifty year old Confederate veteran, who was cruel to her.    This long book (five in all, entitled 'Nobody's Perfect,' ' Time Does That,' 'Give Strength, Lord,' ' These Things Happen,' and 'A Treaty with the World.'  It is of monumental length for a first novel.  It won the Sue Kaufman Prize from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.      It is a work of originality about the virtues of Southerners and has a great moral force.  It tells the story of the War Between the States from a woman's point of view and the savage memories she shares of her hard life with a half-crazy Confederate Vet.  Lucy Marsden gives an account of her life before, during, and after the Civil War.  It is an incredible story of her husband, nine children, parents, mother-in-law, and friends along with her nursing home existence.    War makes men crazy and they take it out on the women in their lives.  He couldn't do that to his looney mother who had been burned in her antebellum home which the Union army had destroyed during the war.  He chose young Lucy to be his bride because she was different from the other school girls who were flighty and smart enough to steer clear of him.  Lucy didn't know what she was getting into, and her mother did not prepare her for the marriage night when she was manhandled and abused by a mean man.  She endured many sorrows because of him and yet the oldest widow was 'feisty' as \\"her outspoken opinions crackle with dark humor.\\"     Lucy maintained a relationship with her mother-in-law's slave, Castalia, who'd looked after the old woman and stayed on to help Lucy as a freed black, like in 'Gone With The Wind.'  She symbolized the failure ofReconstruction, meant to show the blacks how to be independent and forge a new life.  Castalia had made the Marsden family her family.    Lucy grew into a strong woman despite her weak parents.  Her memories of hardship and  poverty after the war will remind you of your own hardships (we all have them at one time or another).  It was made into the moving movie, and I could emphathize with her as I'd also married an older man and endured some of the same sexual frustration and abuse she did.  Maybe that's why old men choose innocent virgins, to lord over.  I cried through most of that movie which I watched on DVD recently.    \\"What the American public ... wants is a tragedy with a happy ending\\" was quoted in A BACKWARD GLANCE, W. Dean Howells to Edith Wharton.  That's what they get in this story as Lucy lived to tell it all -- her way. I looked somewhat like her in the portrait holding the Confederate flag made by a professional at the County Fair just last week.    Allan Gurganus went on to write WHITE PEOPLE and THE PRACTICAL HEART.  He also had an Omnibus of short features in one book.	2005-09-21

Set in the days when Horatio Alger preached the gospel of expansion and mobility hand in hand, this book shows the best and worst of American capitalism.  John Calvin once said, \\"If I have not been able to avoid the reputation of being rich during my life, death will at last free me from this stain.\\"  Carneigie was considered \\"the world's richest man\\" back in the gilded age, the father of American industry.    On his death bed in 1919, possibly to have a clear conscience about that fateful steel strike of 1892, he wanted to make things right with Henry Clay Frick.  It had been more than twenty years since their business relationship soured, but Frick would not give in, saying \\"tell him ... I'll see him in hell\\" -- so fierce was their dispute.  He died the same year.    The bloody steelworkers' strike had changed their partnership into a furious rivalry.  Both were propotents of Darwin's treaching about survival of the fittest.  Carnegie was head of the United States Steel Corporation and Frick was a coke magnate who he had entrusted his companies.  The steel industry comprised late 19th century rough-and-tumble \\"big business\\" and,  with their cost control and applied efficiences, they became dominate in the world steel market.    Because of the disastrous way they handled the 1892 strike, their names stand for the worst possible business management to union members everywhere.   Frick, acting on Carnegie's orders, set 300 Pinkerton detectives against the uprising workers, and it was the bloodiest management/labor conflict in the United States of America history.  The blame went to Frick as he was present at the horrific scene.    Success consecrates the most offensive crimes. (Seneca)  This reminds me of Howard Hughes' end; there was just no way Frick could forgive.  Les Standiford has also written LAST TRAIN TO PARADISE, DONE DEAL, BLACK MOUNTAIN and OPENING DAY: OR, THE RETURN OF SATCHEL PAIGE.  Many archival materials pertaining to the business dealing of the characters above can be found at the University of Pittsburgh's Hillman Library.	2005-09-20

Mr. Gary Aldrich was a solid FBI man for thrity years, the last five as Special Agent.  When he was near retirement age, he accepted the White House position in charge of checking background on all White House appointees.  He was privy to an enormous amount of classified information, but he had experience and knew how to keep his mouth shut.  He thought ti would be a gentle, dignified way to close his government career.  This time, he was wrong big time. <br /> <br />When the Clinton administration took over, it shocked him to learn that Hillary was in charge of choosing who worked there; she wanted gay men and 'tough' women (those the President would not touch).  Non-political like me, his biggest concern was for 'national security' not being compromised.  That was the only way Clinton could balance the budget.  He also felt it was an 'honor' to serve the president but was troubled by the 'goings-on' during the first months of the Clintons takeover.  He lists in this book strong and shocking allegations which would hardly be noticed today by the younger generation. <br /> <br />Like the young marine chosen to carry the black box and accompany Pres. Clinton everywhere (he ran 'interference' from the public), his devotion to the office of the presidency changed drastically within a short time.  He decided that the Clintons were not 'fit' to be in the White House.  The corruption he witnessed first-hand made him sick, alarmed, and angry.  His conscience gave him no choice -- he had to leave the FBI in 1995, to be able to live with what was happening. <br /> <br />He witnessed the subterfuge carried on by Hillary (don't vote for her!) and the President who had a great deal to hide.  He was willing to keep it hidden even if it put America at risk -- which it did.  The coverup Hillary conducted when Vincent Foster died must have been a big deal since she carried his files with her at all times; he had been her pawn. <br /> <br />In this account, we learn what was reallygoing on inside the Clinton White House.  \\"The answer is terrifying and demanded congressional hearings.\\"  He was disgusted by their rudeness and left with contempt for both Clintons.  He relates the weird sexual behavior going on within those doors and compared it to the movie, 'Animal House.' <br /> <br />As special agent, he pursued drug dealers and mobsters (the tough guys) and was at the scene in Texas of the shoot-out with the Symbionese Liberation Army.  It's too bad his illustrous career ended on such a sordid tone, as he was just too old to be able to accept those hillbillies from Arkansas.	2005-09-20

On her televison court show, Judge Judy is outrageous, rude and not always fair.  She does not have an open mind and humiliates and verbally abuses some of her hand-picked victims.  Her theatrics area a bit overdone, as she's playing to the camera, and treats those gullible enough to make a fool our of themselves in public with disdain and having a tantrum while calling them names.  But, then, she is a New Yorker! <br /> <br />Her ten rules for family harmony are as follows:  1) If you call this committed, you should be committed to a mental hospital.  2) Ten times measure, one time cut.  3) If life were fair, men would have the stretch marks and the babies.  4) Having a baby is easy (it wasn't for me the three times, I can assure you!) ; being a parent is hard.  5) When things don't work out, move on.  Now that's progressive.  6) Love your kids and honor your parents (who does these days?) 7)  For better (not worse) or forget about it.  8) Where there's a will, there's a way.  9) You're smarter than you look.  10) You're a fool to be on her show and be a guinea pig. <br /> <br />The cartoons by Bob Tore are a cute touch to a silly book.  The one with pregnant woman dressed in a t-shirt dress with \\"Yours\\" over her bulging middle reminded me of a cover-up I wore before my 'love child' was born in 1974; on the pocket, I'd sewed the patch saying \\"I ate the whole thing.\\"  It caused a few laughs.)  <br /> <br />She calls it 'fraud' (now we know why Renee, the actress, used that as an abortion reason to divorce Kenny Chesney, the country singer) if a wife palms off a newborn on an impotent husband by not telling him the truth -- it wasn't his biological child.  The eyes tell the truth and show your soul. <br /> <br />Love doesn't conquer all; you need ground rules, too.  A marriage certificate is just a piece of paper, but you'll need it if you live long enough to apply for Social Security.  She has written BEAUTY FADES, DUMB IS FOREVER, YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER and WIN OR LOSE BY HOW YOU CHOOSE.  She's just like Yankee Mary Jane who talks too much and emphasizes her Yonkers accent.	2005-09-19

This 'flag' book sifts throughthe historical evidence to uncover the truth behind the Betsy Ross myth; she did sew the original flag with cloth she had for her friend, George Washington, but was not the designer.  The amount of stars has varied over the years, as the number of states increasd.  My favorite was that with 48 stars.    How can you do a biography of an object?  It's more a chronological history of the beginning, selecting the design, using Britain's color scheme.  It was honored by the Union soldiers during the Civil War and the marines' raising it on Iwo Jima was a photograhic memory.    Mary Pickergill chose the star-spangled banner.  Samuel Driver gave it the name 'Old Glory.'  Francis Scott Key wrote the national anthem.  Francis Bellamy is father of the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.  School teacher from Wisconsin, B. J. Cigrand, is credited with starting 'Flag Day.'  Austronaut Buzz Aldrin planted it on the moon in June, 1969 during Apollo 11's voyage into outer space.    During a national tragedy, the flag is lowered to half staff.  Politics always display the flag as patriotism and nationalism.  Liberal or conservative, Democrtat or Republican -- we all use the same stars and stripes.  During the Viet Nam War, it was a devisive emblen of a devided nation, almost along the lines of the American Civil War (only the South had their own fighting flag), and was burned as a form of resistance.    Marc Leepson wrote SAVING MONTICELLO and researched his subject well with an Index and Bibliography.  I once had a flag which had flown over the U. S. Capitol back in the Seventies, from the office of my representative, Robin Beard.    The American flag means different things to different people.  Lee Greenwoood paid homage to it in \\"God Bless the U.S.A.\\"  John Wayne did a recitation of that marvelous old flag, and Neil Diamond was most appreciated of it in his song, \\"Coming to America.'  Kate Smith used it as a background (as did Patton) shen she sang \\"God Bless America.\\"  It is our most obvious symbol of freedom.	2005-09-19

This is the classic eternal triangle involving a pretty woman with two suitors, only sad in a way as the combatants for her hand in marriage are brothers.  For twenty years I have been planning to read one of her books, which were highly recommended, but I had thought they might be too mushy for my taste.  The title, THE BLESSING, touched me in a tender spot, as right now I need a miracle and God's blessing to stick around a while longer.  Though I don't know Kentucky very well, it's connected to the north to the state of Tennessee, and I can identify with a one-horse town, as I live in a two-horse bigger town -- not quite on the status of city yet and a small town in Middle Tennessee near Alabama.  Jason is lured to Abernathy, his hometown, by Dr. David Wilding on the pretense that their dad is dying. <br /> <br />It was just a ruse as David had found the woman of his dreams there, a young widow, and he needed some time alone with her.  Jason has been living a high life escorting beautiful women and alwalys gets his picture in the society pages, and yet he has not settled down.  He is a corporate businessman who could use a bit of time away from the pressures of his job and returns to find his dad drinking beer and playing poker.  He has been summoned to be a glorified babysitter for Amy's little boy so that David could take her off on a little excursion with no outside interference. <br /> <br />The doctor fell for this young widow and feels that she is just what he needs to surivive in the backwoods of Kentucky and keep the country people well and happy.  However, Max, the baby, decides otherwise and chooses Jason as the father of his dreams.  Amy and Jason find that they have a mutual attraction but is it strong enough to endure the broken-heart of brother David.  \\"Each small moment is a precious miracle, when seen through the eyes of love.\\"  The love of a child is the most important thing you could imagine, even better than the sexual attraction and love between a man and a woman.  Every child is a miracle unto itself. <br /> <br />I'm glad I chose this one to begin reading her works, as she is certainly prolific.  LOST LADY, MOUNTAIN LAUREL, and A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR are just a sampling of her books.  It will be a treat to get involved in some of the other romances she produces.	2005-09-19

None, however, can compare with these.  It makes your heart glad to look at the lovelies in the different poses and stances.  Cats are highly intelligent and know exactly how to pose under different circumstances.  Recently, I needed a ride to the vet to get Star's yearly shots and checkup.  She heard me say \\"All we need are her shots, so it shouldn't take long.\\"  She hid under the bed until almost time to go, forgoing her tuna lunch, and I had to hytail her out to get ready for the trip.   <br /> <br />Lillian Jackson Braun has made a fortune writing about the cats 'who' and had this quoke, \\"Cats never strike a pose that isn't photogenic.\\"  Some of her enormous supply of these books include THE CAT WHO PLAYED BRAHMS, THE CAT WHO TALKED TO GHOSTS, and THE CAT WHO TALKED TO THE BIRDS (which Amazon did not have listed, so perhaps it was listed in her Cat short stories). <br /> <br />Cats are independent but lovable creatures who love you and make good companions for all ages.

This is a self-help book to help you determine how to make the world a better place for your having been here.  First, you must make a plan and follow through.  Here is a sample and suggestions for success. <br /> <br />Peter Drucker's principles for life include:  1) Find out who you are.  2)Reposition yourself for full effectiveness and fulfillment in life's second half.  3) Find your emotional core.  4) Make your life an endgame.  5) Planning doesn't work by itself. You must follow through.  6) You have to know your values.  7) You have to define what 'finishing well' means to you.  8)  You have to know the difference between the difference between harvesting and planting.  9) Good intentions aren't enough. You have to define the results you're after.  and 10) There's a downside to \\"no longer learning, no longer growing.\\" <br /> <br />In this book, the reader will learn about giving and receiving a blessing, about the power of saying \\"no\\", about redefining what helps you to get up in the morning, about putting yourself at risk (for change), about finding the right fit, about staying the course, and most importantly finishing well.  \\"If people see their best years behind them, they're probably not going to finish very welll, because you can't finish well when you're going backwards.\\"   <br /> <br />Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote in ULYSSES:  \\"'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.  Push off, and sitting well in order smite the sounding furrows; for my purpose hold to sail beyond the sunset, and the baths of all the western stars, until I die.  It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; it may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, and see the great Achilles, whom we knew.   ...That which we are, we are, one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\\" <br /> <br />The author wrote HALFTIME, and praises Peter Drucker as being the leading wisdom figure in his life.  \\"It has been lie a playwright having access to Shakespeare or a physician to Einstein.\\"  He says, \\"I love smart people.\\"  So do I!

Written from the viewpoint of the innocent sons who were mistreated by fathers who had served in WWII, it attempts to explain that the abuse was not personal but generalized.  Those vetrans who survived atrocities, which left internal war wounds, took out their suppressed aggression on their own sons by bullying and browbeating them.  My dad was physically abusive to his two son so much so that the elder got married at the age of seventeen just to get away from home.  He would chase them up the highway in a wild tantrum hitting them with anything he was able to lay his hands on.  The younger took his revenge fifty years later by putting him in a barren room at a nursing home to die. <br /> <br />Dubbed a secret history, it echoes down through the years and generations, from sons to grandsons.  It's a sad history of evolving manhood.  Could be that's why the baby boomers of today still talk like boys instead of men -- their masculine growth was stunted in childhood.   <br /> <br />Men refuse to talk openly about their deepest feelings.  War changes men's lives as combat shapes the soldier to survive at all odds.  After the War, those feelings don't just vanish.  The fear and harshness they endured is taken out on their own sons on the homefront, as they continue to fight their internal devils. <br /> <br />No anonymity here; they believed that candor offers the surest approach to the mystery of their military fathers and why they acted as they did with the guilt they could not dissipate.

He's just the dermotologist I need for total face rejuvenation, as I am facing having a deep 'pre-cancer' caused by the sun to be cut out in a couple of weeks which will leave a scar, which could only be covered with plastic surgery. Being little and slim, the body isn't such a problem for me yet, and I do look a lot like Jessica Tandy in 'Fried Green Tomatoes' though she was 82 and I am not even near that age. So, this book is for me! <br /> <br />\\"Most peole believe that sags, bags, and wrinkles are inevitable on the face and the body.\\" If yo follow this Perricone Prescription with his exercise, diet and skin care program, you can prevent and reverse many signs of aging. That way, you won't need the Botox injections, chemical peels, or laser treatments. I do need that on my birthmark, but hey! I've lived with it this long, what should it matter now? The skin doc who kept my 'pre-cancer' raw for two years with liquid nitrogen and his biopsies told me the only way to get rid of it was to use a plastic surgeon, knowing that no way on earth could I afford one. He even had the audacity to tell me that the liquid nitrogen would get rid of my wrinkles! After leaving a scar and rawness where they put it, I told him in no uncertain terms that the wrinkles don't bother me. I am tired of his making my face look ugly. Thus, I found a dermotologist who will remove the irritating thing once and for all. <br /> <br />Dr. Perricone reveals that inflammation is caused by poor nutrition, irritating skin-care treatments, stress, sunlight, and pollution -- all of which I have endured these six years I've been back in Knoxville. Next to L.A., this town at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains if the most polluted in the United States of America.  <br /> <br />He gives the reader the tools to fight the inflammation \\"from the inside out\\" while at the same timedecreasing the likelihood of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and other degenerative diseases. This program will benefit your entire body and change your life for the better! You'll not only look a bit younger, you will feel younger, too, and won't be afraid to look in the mirror. There are amazing before and after photos included to spur you on and give you the incentive to be the best-looking person around. <br /> <br />He has written THE WRINKLE CURE. That's good, but a part of aging which we all have to endure, so what's a few wrinkles in a happy face.  He's also followed up with THE PERRICONE PROMISE.  <br />	2005-09-19

Peacocks are the most flamboyand and ornamental birds.  The male peacock's tail is an extravanganza: bizarre, and exaggerated, while the white felame is less beautiful and mores 'sensibly dressed.'  For a special occasion, I purchased a bright blue and white whirt with the appearance of peacock feathers.  It was lovely but, after two wearing, I went back to the mall and also purchased the 'dull' brown, yellow and green identical skirt in the muted colors.  Can you imagine, it was appreciated more by the viewers than the brighter one?  Darwin had it right with his theroy that females prefer to mate with the best-ornamental males.  Over evolutionary time, males develop ever-more exaggerated, immoderate flamboyance.  All male birds are the brighter ones, even ducks. <br /> <br />What was the selective force that had brought such fine-tuning of choosing a mate, if not the visual discrimination of birds?  He conceived the idea of the peacock's tail as a product of female choise was 'an awful stretcher.'  But his prediction proved true; thus, a happy ending to the peacock's tale. <br /> <br />One thing about ants are they don't have to worry about appearances.  They aren't very pretty so who can tell the difference; they are busy, hard workers who live in communes, and have multiple partners to propetuate the species. <br /> <br />Ms. Cronin's thesis on humans is that women choose men who can give them handsome sons to propugate the theory of selective evolution.  In my case, it's always been the male who did the choosing, and the beautiful females (no matter how dumb) have the advantage over the not-so-pretty girls.  For some reason, however, the most important men tend to have plainer wifes first, the younger beauties in their old age. <br /> <br />She discusses human altruism by comparing Wallace, Huxley, Spenser and othre with Darwin and his moral views as to natural history.  Nature can be most cruel to the kindest, most compassionate humans and bless the selfish, arrogant maco men as they do the choosing in today's world.  Can you call it really 'mating' or power of lust to allow today's attractive men to make the overtures?   <br /> <br />Young girls are certainly advertising their wares with their middles and belly buttons showing and the see-through camisoles they wear in public is a form of indecency.  At the rodeo, some girls showed their rear sections with the short shorts and midriff tops and didn't have good-looking bodies, but t he men looked anyway.  This in-depth study of Darwinism and its antagonists is done in an intellectual way by Ms. Cronin who has a Ph.D and taught at University of Oxford and the Philosophy Department at the London School of Economics. <br /> <br />The cover picture is \\"Peacock and Peahen with a Red Cardinal in a Classical Landscape\\" by Tobias Stranover which hangs in the London Gallery and the Bridgeman Art Library.	2005-09-19

Ten years ago, Mr. Ward was predicting some of the weather-related occurrences we have seen in the past few months.  He blames it on certain atmospheric disturbances which multiply and may cause another extinction of life on earth. <br /> <br />Ozone is a form of oxygen which blocks the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation.  This thinning of the world's ozone level was first detected in 1985, twenty years ago, and is being destroyed by man-made compounds leaking into the atmosphere.  CFCs were polluting and destroying ozone molecules.  If the ozone continues to be depleted due to the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, increased amounts of ultraviolet radiation will bombard the earth continuously, and cause a higher rate of cancer in humans. <br /> <br />It's because of the changeds of levels of critical gases such as CO2 (carbon dioxide) and water vapor.  Our planet stays warmer in large part known as the greenhouse effect called global warming.  It will increase the spread of deserts and cause droughts and reduce water supplies. <br /> <br />In 1995, Mr. Ward predicted that this global warming is sure to lead to massive environmental changes over much of the earth.  Even if detailed understanding of global warming still defies prediction, generalities emerge.  It will cause the seas to rise to dangerous depths.  The ice caps will melt and increase sea levels.  The rate and extent will decide mankind's fate. <br /> <br />The faster the oceans rise and erode land, the greater incidence for loss of life.  We've seen this already in New Orleans, where most of the occupants were forced to leave this historic town for a time, and Thailand where land lose and deaths were terrifically tragic. <br /> <br />Twice in distant past, catastrophic extinction caused the end of evolution.  Our first mammalian ancestors survived, some 250 million years agao.  The second great mass extinction occurred 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs perished.  It was thought to have been caused by earth's collision with an asteroid. <br /> <br />He declares tht the signs for a third mass extinction have alrady started on our planet.  We need to find some way to save the rich diversity of life and birds now endangered by changes and climate.  We must strive to preserve life as we know it before our own extermination by poisoning from the air we pollute. <br /> <br />Peter D. Ward is a paleontologist in Seattle (where the 'think tank' for intelligent thinking exists) and is associated with the University of Washington.  In 1991, he wrote ON METHUSELAH'S TRAIL: LIVING FOSSILS AND THE GREAT EXTINCTION.  He follows this END OF EVOLUTION  with FUTURE EVOLUTION in 2001).  In 2004, his mastrepiece was GORGONS: PALEONTOLOGY, OBSESSION, AND THE GREATEST CASTROPHE IN EARTH'S HISTORY.  They are all parts of  this book, which is a bit over my head.	2005-09-19

Scientific studies claim certain health benfits for acts of kindness, it affects the immune system of the receipent and the doer as well.  \\"This discovery in combination with what ancient wisdom has to teach us makes for an unbeatable argument.\\"  The Buddhists teach that people who are kind and compassionate tend to sleep better and have pleasant dreams, love themselves and are loved by others, and feel peaceful most of the time. <br /> <br />The most basic of all is the decision we make every day when we awake as to how to approach the day:  feel sorry for ourselves, or take responsibility for our own happiness.  The Governor of Louisiana and the President both took responsiblity for the inability to respond more quickly to the weather crisis.  \\"When we see the rampant unhappiness and victimization in our culture it's clear that most people don't see that we do have a choice\\" in the matter.  It just takes a suble shift in thinking to be the choice maker. <br /> <br />Hope is one of the most powerful forces in our lives.  It's realizing that life can be better than it is right now regardless of the circumstances.  It gives us a reason to go on when times are tough and almost unbearable.  The most remarkable aspect of hope is that it's entirely internal; hope soothes the soul.  None of  us has to worry about changing other people.  Your hope will be contagious and spread to everyone you touch in whatevre way. <br /> <br />In 'A penny for your thoughts,' just one tiny shift in attitude can made the difference between misery and happiness.   In 'turing on a dime,' small changes enable you to adapt and respond appropriately to many of life's twists and turns.  \\"Take five' advised you to take a step back instead of overreacting or reacting out of fear to reduce stress and make your life better daily.  \\"My two bits' showed how to make small changes to affect the world  you live in which in turn makes you feel better about yourself. <br /> <br />Reality is one of the smallest shifts to make in your attitude; recognizing when you're fighting reality spells the difference between 'guaranted misery' and a life filled with 'peace and contentment.'  Resisting concrete reality never helps the situation.  Being aware of the difference between what we can control and what we can't is critical for happiness. <br /> <br />Change from negative to positive as much as possible; it's not easy but very rewarding.  We all have the power to reduce the time we spend focused on what's wrong and concentrate on what's right.  By focusing on blessings,you will become more satisfied, loving, grateful, and appreciative.  And that's what we need in this world which is so full of turmoil and chaos.	2005-09-18

George Bernard Shaw is supposedly the opposite of Shakespeare, who was too pessimistic, being described as a 'serious optimist.'  In Shaw's play \\"Man and Superman\\" creative evolution is the topic in serious dramatic terms, performed in 1903.  He is the precursor of what is now called \\"creative intelligent design\\" as described in the book OF PANDAS AND PEOPLE (1993).  While he had problems with the biological randomness of Darwin, he pretty much eliminated God from the equation of how human life began.      The God-incorporated alternative to Darwinism now being proposed by who else but the President of the United States of America,  Shaw felt that the life force is transmitted by rare men of genius who were selected by nature to carry on the work of building up an intellectual consciousness.  In \\"Man and Superman\\" the Don Juan was an asexual but in a way religious and felt that life could be improved and that meant getting rid of 'imprisoning conventions.'    The intelligent design is a hot topic now among theologians, educators and scientists who want this concept taught in the schools along with Darwin (leaving out the Biblical account).  Shaw left out completedly the thought of God having anything to do whatsoever with the human existence; it was just a 'what-if' story idea which extremely religious people believe to be the truth.      Shaw's \\"Devil's Disciple\\" was his first commercial success with Richard Mansfield as the matinee idol starring in the play set during the American Revoluiton.  His earlier \\"Man and Superman\\" was placed on a restricted list by the libraries so it could not infect young minds with its unorthodox view of God and matrimony.  His play about prostitution, so prevalent in the century he was so prolific with his works, \\"Mrs. Warren's Profession,\\" played to a sold out audience with up to 3,000 people turned away at the door.  This popular sensation was closed down by the police and the entire cast faced charges of 'disorderly conduct.'    Every star wanted to be Henry Higgins in \\"Pygmalion\\" played by Peter O'Toole and Leslie Howard.  Rex Harrison played the part in the movie, \\"My Fair Lady.\\"  Lynn Fontanne and Wendy Hiller, along with Mrs. Partick Campbell on whom the play was based, wanted to play Eliza Doolittle.    He wrote to Mrs. Campbell \\"I can't be sympathetic; these things simply make me furious,\\" when her son was killed in 1918 by the Germans as the war was ended.  He wrote articulate letters throughout his life to many people, \\"some subjects that language cannot accommodate.\\"     He had his place in our world and prophesied what was to come on Broadway, the British stage, and the controversial world of science and biology.  He was the forerunner to beat all!	2005-09-17

Peter and his friend, Phil, in their early twenties decided it was time to spread their wings and see some of the American countryside, and how better to do it than to play \\"cowboy\\" on a scooters called Jenny and Couchette.    They traveled that April through Scranton, Pennsylvania where they huddled in the cold in sleeping bags.  They had a route planned out to take them through Cleveland, Ohio, Ann Arbor, Michigan; then, Indianapolis, St. Louis on to Kansas City.  The street signs along the way help to keep the reader located on the layout of the land.  They met strangers when they took rest stops who became friends, like the elderly couple in Boulder City.    They were awed by the Rockies and the Grand Canyon, overcome a bit by the vast Mojave Desert stretching silently and mysterious as they rode in the dead of night -- to a small-scale diner.  There they met Mary A. and Bryan who no doubt used them on their web site to make fun of them, as they do other un-knowing people; they are the original internet bullies.  This was the trip they had been planning since they were four years old, and along the way the found the cowboy hats they would have worn back then.     The adventures these young men had reminds you of John Steinbeck's TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY.  From the desert, they moved on to Fresno and Menlo Park in San Francisco.  After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh, Peter lived in Paris and traveled in Italy, England and France.  His first novel was A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE.  He had a trio about his favorite animal:  IMMORTAL UNICORN, THE LAST UNICORN and THE UNICORN SONATA.  As a young writer, Peter was described as a 'genuine nonconformist brave enough to venture where others might fear to tread.\\"  Apparently, even in his imagination, he had always been adventurous, to his detriment, if he by chance encountered that old hag in Dallas/Fort Worth whose hobby is to slander others.	2005-09-16

A different thesis concerning evolution called \\"intelligent design\\" is being introduced as fact in biology classes across the nation.  It is a proposition that some aspects of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to Darwin's concept of natural selection.  So much for re-writing history, biological or otherwise.  I think that most of us will continue to believe in Darwin's theory, as it just makes sense.    The headquarters of such thinking is the Center for Science and Culture at a nonpartisan but generally conservative 'think tank' (they're the 'geniuses') called the Discovery Institute, founded in Seattle in 1990.    This book, written in 1993, expresses it this way:  \\"Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact -- fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings.  Some scientists have arrived at this view since fossil forms first appear in the rock record with their primitive features intact, rather than gradually developing.\\"    According to a proponent of this new idea (even thought the people there at the Discovery Insitute want to 'wait until the right time' as they were not ready to proceed), he just wanted to present more than one view on this divisive topic.    The scientists (biologists, oceanographers, chemists) do not feel it is ready for prime time; they have a different timetable in mind.  If you saw the movie, The Island, you can see what they are talking about in a general sense.  No waiting to grow up, identical genes and people, no emotions, no ability to think for themselves.  I don't think this idea will ever be accepted.    Darwin's theory was unveiled 150 years ago in THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.  In 1925, the \\"monkey trial\\" took place in Dayton, Tennessee, after John Scopes went again state law to teach evolution.  Michael Behe wrote DARWIN'S BLACK BOX in 1996 about the evolving intelligent design but he is for the creationist belief from the Bible.  There will always be those who believe in either or but not all three of these diverse theories of how we all began, and from whence we came.    The intelligent design movement is just the latest and most sophisticated attempt to discredit the famous theory most of us consider as truth and nothing but the truth.	2005-09-16

It is called a parable of \\"indivicualism and nationhood,\\" it's a tale of strength, misconceptions, and yearning for a civil society.  We still need one in Knoxville, TN where young stud policemen are allowed to be abusive and intiminating to old and retarded women at the county fair.   <br /> <br />Colum McCann called it \\"part love story, part parable, and part 'eastern' New England western; it reads like a western novel.  This 'ungoverned territory' was called the Indian Stream, \\"a land where the unlucky outlaws come to make a fresh start.\\" <br /> <br />This undeveloped landscape is raw with little pity for human strivings.  Blood (an unfornate name) is a wise man of contradictions, but has a secret past.  He thinks that by moving to a different place it will be okay to have a young 16-yr-old companion he used as Cortes used his harem.  He won Sally in a game of cards; their arrival triggers a series of clashes which eventually led to a second chance at life.  They endured a hardscrabble life and had a mangy dog named Luther.   <br /> <br />We read about the desolation and harsips as Blood becomes the target for hoodlums to place blame for the troubles in the place.  When the two young males, Fletcher and Russell Barrett, cause a confrontation, he's forced to face \\"apparitions\\" of his past and act on them. <br /> <br />Sally has an opening (which she used) for escape, as the reader learns a relentless beat of hope and redeeming capacity for love.  \\"She wondered if he realized he was only a coward...the coward who ran.\\"  Sometimes, retreat saves lives, and that is not cowardly.  It's about the \\"age old dream of becoming a better man by moving to another place\\" and getting a brand-new start, as the homeless now do.   That wasn't so easy in the early 19th century America. <br /> <br />His secret background included coming from New Bedford to New York, then moved on th Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts.  \\"So began seventeen years of cycles and half circles, all radiant from New Bedford as the hub of unseen spokes, the opposing mangetic pole he could neither approach nor leave altogether.  He'd set out for Savannah, which he'd heard was \\"a city of refinement and comfort.\\" or perhaps New Orleans (he could learn the dialect of French spoken there.  He would 'rejuvenate,' which wasn't to be.  He was cornered in the loft of a barn like John Wilkes Booth in 1963, trapped in flames. <br /> <br />In 1896, Sally is still alive at age 74 years but dependent on ogthers -- not helpless.  Her daughter, Estell Warren, married to a doctor who had been a veteran of the Civil War.   Sometimes, there is no justice.	2005-09-15

During the Civil War, a group of protestors to the war was called Copperheads (like the snakes) and, in Lincoln's home state of Illinois there were reports that they were arming and drilling in preparation for resistance.  The peace Democrats had themselves made a special kind of contribution to morale.  By their frankness in revealing their aims they permitted themselves to be made whipping boys on whom supporters of the war could vent the feeling generated by frustration on the battlefield.  Thus they got squarely in the way of one of the most effective epithets in American history -- \\"Copperhead.\\"<br /><br />It had been used as a general term of approbrium long before the war.  Apparently, it grew out of a comparison with the supposed habit of the poisonous copperhead snake of striking without warning from concealment.  It was believed to be actively in sympathy with the Confederates but on other occasions fixed on the Democratic party as a whole.<br /><br />General Burnside, incensed by the strictures of Copperhead leaders against the administration of the war, on April 13,  ordered the arrest of anyone guilty of seditious utterances likely to restrict recruiting.  The Southern people were encouraged by this group to establish their independence.  The Copperheads were hopeful of Confederate success in 1863.<br /><br />Violent clashes between soldiers and Copperheads were, under the circumstances, all but inevitable. With discouragement general, with Horace Greely badgering him through the widely read 'Tribune' to attempt a negotiated peace, and his own party apparently disintegrating into mutually repellant factions, Lincoln had little reason to be in any way hopeful for the future.<br /><br />On June 22, at a conference of the Copperheads and the Southern agents, their plans were redrafted and preparations made to stage a series of hugh demonstrations for peace in Illinois.  There is no justification for assuming that all these expectations were mere daydreams of overexcited Copperheads.<br /><br />Utilizing the revelations of the Sons of Liberty as ammunition, the Republicans found their audience at the convention little interested in anything except emotional denunciations of the Democrats as traitors and Copperheads.  Declarations that the war for reunion was a success and that the Democrats were Copperheads constituted a double-barreled weapon of Republican campaigners.<br /><br />To see the Midwestern Copperhead movement with a wider perspective it should be remembered that there had been kindred or parallel developments in the other sections of the loyal states.  It was in the Midwest that the Copperhead movement had its principal seat.  The Copperhead leaders, like the Klan, lived, for the most part, in careers that seemed strangely unaffected by their wartime activities.<br /><br />Henry Clay Dean would be remembered by Mark Twain in LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI as an antiquated freak, and Dennis Mahoney seems to have dropped into obscurity.  Among the bellweathers of the Copperhead press in the Midwest, the 'Crisis' declined after the death of Samuel Medary.<br /><br />Captain John B. Castleman at 22 was tried as a spy after the war but won a reprieve.  Although few of those who gave aid and comfort to the Confederacy, either through political maneuvering or revolutionary plotting, were ever directly punished for their activities.  The Democratic party suffered severely for the extent to which it permitted itself to be used as an instrument of the Copperheads. The Democrat party as a whole was smeared with the indelible stigma of Copperheadism.  Maybe that's why I almost always side with the Democrats.<br /><br />All things considered, it is hard to find much to say for either side.  Some were willing to connive with the agents of the Confederacy.  The assessment of these men is not simply an effort to pass moral judgment on individuals long dead and almost forgotten.  The great majority of the people were in the endwilling to carry the war through to its close.  Which they did.<br /><br />The Oath the Copperheads used is listed (called Knights of the Golden Circle) as is the Sons of Liberty.  Much has been written about the Civil War, but not many knew of the existence of the group called the Copperheads.ath the Copperheads used is listed (called Knights of the Golden Circle) as is the Sons of Liberty.

Patrick Kennedy immigrated from Ireland to the U.S.A. in 1849 and experienced poverty and humiliation.  The Scots-Irish have backbones of steel and are formidable fighters.  They clawed their way to the top but, along the way, developed a lust for power and dominance over others anyway they could.  Joseph was a powerful influence on the sons, though Rose, with her societal background, ruled the roost with an iron fist.  They lacked humility need to achieve their dreams. <br /> <br />\\"They felt immune to mortal laws...and protected from the ...consequences of their deeds and misdeeds.  They felt 'special' -- omnipotent and worthy of being worshipped and considered as 'superior' beings....\\"  They practiced self-defeating and unethical behavior; as a result, they encounted a collision course with reality.  Thus, the legend of a Kennedy Curse, one of the great mysteries of our time. <br /> <br />Because Jackie had a Caesarean with John, Jr., a few weeks before I had one with my first child, I developed a \\"connection\\" with they young man who failed to reach his destiny.  Jeff looked a lot like John, both with the dark abundant hair, which set their good looks off.   I was quite upset when they left his body at sea and he didn't get a proper funeral and gravesite near his fathre, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. <br /> <br />They had, accord to Edward Klein, a \\"fantasy of omnipotence\\" and failed to realize the hard realities of life, as others experienced it.  The desire to \\"get away\\" with things others cannot created the so-called curse.  You can't bulldoze your way to the top without leaving debris behind.  The Kennedy family wanted to be royalty, but no way is that possible in this country.  No one is above the laws of the land and, soonre or later, they are pushed into a corner from which there is no escape. <br /> <br />Mr. Klein wrote three books about Jackie: ALL TOO HUMAN, JUST JACKIE, and FAREWELL, JACKIE.  He also wrote THE PARACHUTISTS and THE TRUTH ABOUT HILLARY, which I reviewed earlier this year.  He covreed the JFK 1960 presidential campaign for 'Newsweek' magazine.  He was editor of 'The New York Times Magazine' for eleven years.  He writes the 'Parade' column \\"\walter Scott's Personality Parade\\" the first thing I read in that publication on Sundays.	2005-09-15

His 'Florilogium' about his botanical studies in the South Seas is there in the library. <br /> <br />He was a naturalist, a young botanist, in addition to being an explorer.  He was one of Australia's founding fathers.  He accompanied Captain Cook as he circumnavigated the globe to discover that country. <br /> <br />His Last Will & Testament requested no monument, but forty-seven years after his death in 1820 at the age of 77 years, a tablet was erected showing his grave.  He was portrayed as forthright, cheerful and a hospitable man, an intrepid explorer abroad who investigated all he encountered as a genius journalist.  He left all of his possessions to wife, Dorothea, with his library at Kew under the direction of Robert Brown, who would have the leasehold house after her death. <br /> <br />Jason Wilson wrote in 'London Magazine' that \\"this leisurely and witty biography brings the 'genuine' Englishman fully to life.\\"  P.

The chronology of this book spans almost two centuries of American history.  In 1824, John Hall achieved the automatic machining of metal components at the Harpers Ferry arsenal, and Hall's new methods were the ancestors of mass production and scientific management.      By another convenient accident of history, one of the pivotal events in this narrative, the beginnings of mass production at Ford's Highland plant in 1913, stands near the midpoint.  If time travel allowed us to look back from the perspective of 1913, we would see how Henry Ford and Fred Winslow Taylor pulled together the \\"technical and organizational achievements of the 19th century\\" and welded them into a productive machine of commanding power and efficiency.    Looking forward from 1913, and with the advantage of hindsight, we can see how Ford's and Taylor's methods were elaborated by the technologies of the mid- and late 10th century, which will continue to shape today's U. S. A. economy.  From their base in manufacturing, these methods have launched an invasion of the service economy in which eighty percent of Americans work.    After I learned computer training at the Vo-Tech in Pulaski, I agreed that I could effectively work robotic computers.  I never had the chance to show my stuff, but I did have various and sundry computer-entry jobs in different factories.  It was, for me, the Alpha and Omega -- the beginning and the End.    Is it possible for humans to be programmed like machines?  Like in the movie, ROBOTS, and 'The Island,' it is likely that some sort of robotic entity will exist in our near future.  Simon Head puts doubts on our \\"illusions about information technology and argues that everyone loses when corporations try to use technology to conquer human nature.\\"  We all know that machines have no minds (like the two city of Knoxville representatives at yesterday's TPO meeting) and can never have the ability to think and feel on their own.  Computers do as they are told or programmed, which is good.  Humans need to always be in control.	2005-09-14

This is a strange type of memoir in a most mundane, audacious way (A - Z) and chronological 965 (actually 1965 when she was born) to 2005 and many lists of her favorite things and other stuff.  Where she got the idea for such an almanac/history plus encyclopedia of her life is a weird thing.    She doesn't use big or complicated words -- not sure she knows any.  I don't think she ever learned grammar from the types of lists she makes, fragmented meaningless jabber.  She really hasn't lived at all for forty years, imagine!  And she's from Chicago, the land of the brave and brass.  She's not a deep thinker.    One good word in the whole book is \\"euphoric\\" kinda out of her league.  She lost her virginity at the age of 17, is that remarkable or what?  She write books about motherhood -- when did she get married?  I finally figured out it was to someone named Jason though I had thought it was to Charise.    I recommend a word for her empty page (Z):  Zilch!  That's how I feel about all this plain ordinary gibberish.  It is so amateurish.  I thank God my life has been far from ordinary, and yet I have not written a book, would never write a book such as this.  This is the no-nothing-ess-book I've ever seen.  She is promoting herself as a person, but I think her personna got lost along the way.  She does have a big ego, I admit that to tell such intimate, silly things she thought and did as a child.  That child did not grow up to a full-fledged adult who can figure out what's what.  Which is too bad.  As she has fenagled some interesting positions to be so boring and ordinary.  No secrets for Amy.	2005-09-13

She was not just an \\"unconventional\\" woman, she was a completely selfish and crazy wife to just go off that way after thirty years of marital strive.  Why didn't she just get a divorce?  Claiming she had neglected herself while raising four children, how self indulgent can a woman get; like a warrior, she went into \\"retreat\\" to regenerate herself.  No one can do that!    She feels that \\"true learning comes from our own impulses\\" -- please!  When will this person grow up?  This book is her sequel.  \\"Every beginning is always a sequel, after all, and the book of events is always open halfway through.\\"    If her marriage was so bad that she had to go to sea for a year, I wonder what Robin did while she was gone.  He'd be a fool to languish in his new job, wondering where he had gone wrong; could be she was the person responsible for all the mess.  She was like a peregrine falcon who scavenges off others or perhaps a green-winged teal, called a wigeon.  She was not a normal woman, not forgiving and understanding.  A man goes where his job is.  Christine refused to follow Jeff to his job until she got pregnant.  Joan was too old for that ploy.    To her, it was an \\"eye-opening year of self-discovery\\" which would have been fine thirty years earlier before she committed herself to marriage.  Women (nor men) don't just run away during a midlife crisis.  So Robin moves back in with her in the Cape Cod cottage so as not to be alone with his midlife reinvention.  Haven't these people ever heard of marriage counselors or therapists to work out the problems where they are, not where they'd like to be.  If we all just up and moved when we were peeved with the person we chose to live with, through good times and bad, this world would be in total chaos and confusion.    She calls it a new \\"partnership.\\"  That's the modern way of marriage these days, but this woman is almost my age -- this was not the accepted thing to do, and still should not be adapted as normal.  I know a couplewho have been married much longer than she and live in two parts of the country, she in an antebellum home near Alabama while he is making the money to redo her \\"dream\\" out in L. A.  She laughingly joked that they kept the airlines in business, as he was always flying \\"home\\" not she going to him.  When she had cancer, he was there to support her and to rescue her from boring people at the library open houses.  She was not a good wife, and proved to be a not-so-good mother as the younger daughter came down with a serious illness after she went off to college.  God punishes those who disobey his Ten Commandments.    In Cape Cod, Joan and Robin learn first hand the \\"emotional pitfalls and horrors\\" that can befall married couples.  It affects all of us at one point or another but it does not give the wife full authority to just go off and abandon her home for whatever selfish reason.  For the first time, I am hoping the husband of such an self-indulgent \\"queen\\" of a wife finds a new love with a younger woman.  It will serve her right.	2005-09-12

On the way to the Fair on the KAT bus, I saw two ceremonial personages. The man had on a long robe with an elaborate headdress and tall walking stick. The woman, alien like Diane, was barefooted and dressed colorfully with a scarg around hre head, a bright, eye-pleasing blouse with a long skirt (similar to my dull peacock skirt -- I have a bright one also) and her very presence spoke voodoo. They were not a part of the Fair.     Alexander Smith has written fifty books including CHILDREN OF WAX, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, and THE SUNDAY PHILOSOPHY CLUB.  He also wrote THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN and THE FULL CUPBOARD OF LIFE,  among others.

Robert Penn Warren, a noted Southern writer, is certain that our Civil War shaped modern America, the social institutions which had to take care of the freed slaves, domestic policies, and foreign interests.  \\"The Civil War is our only 'felt' history -- history lived in the national imagination and not just on paper. This is not to say that the War is always, and by all men, felt in the same way.  Quite the contrary.  But this fact is an index to the very complexity, depth, and fundamental significance of the event.  It is an overwhelming and vital image of human, and national, experience.\\" <br /> <br />It taking place so long ago and ended so disastrously with the death of Abraham Lincoln, I really don't believe it caused our failing economy, philosophy, and psychology.  Far too many wars, most on foreign lands, have taken place since then to put all the blame on the ressurection of the slaves.  \\"There is no facet of our lives today that does not owe its present character in some measure to the Civil War.\\" <br /> <br />The Confederate Commander in East Tennessee was General James Longstreet.  The siege of Knoxville and Battle of Fort Sanders was disastrous for this area.  Bridge burners to stop the railroad took place across East Tennessee.  The campaign at Strawberry Plains was led by Colonel William P. Sanders, for whom the Fort on the UT campus was named.  Bulls Gap, birthplace of Archie Campbell (HeeHaw fame) was pivotal for the northeast, as was Lick Creek Bridge and Blue Springs.   <br /> <br />In Middle Tennessee, commandered by Braxton Bragg and John Bell Hood, Nathan Bedford Forrest reigned in Columbia, having been born a short distance away in Chapel Hill; Columbia is the birthplace of a U. S. President, James Polk,  Thompson's Station and Fort Donelson on either end of Nashville had important confrontations.  In Pulaski, Sam Davis was hanged as a Confederate spy; there is a statue on the Square and on Capitol Hill in Nashville.  His home at Smyrna is near Murfreesboro. <br /> <br />West Tennessee was under the command of Nathan Bedford Forrest, whom Sherman called, \\"that devil Forrest.\\"  There is a statue of him in Forrest Square on Union Avenue in Memphis.  He started his campaign in Clifton on the Tennessee River where the federal ironclad  held sway, near Jackson, TN.  At Shiloh, one of the nations's oldest and most pristine battlefield parks, General Albert Sidney Johnston led the Southern side and died (buried there 25 miles Northeast of Corinth, Mississippi, near Savannah, Tennessee.  The Sons of Confederate Veterans have established a memorial at Salem Cemetery near Jackson and a small park at Davis Bridge, near Bolivar. <br /> <br />Robert Penn Warren was a Phodes Scholar at Oxford University in London and taught at Yale University, as did Richard Marius.  He wrote JOHN BROWN: THE MAKING OF A MARTYR, THE CAVE, WORLD ENOUGH AND TIME, BAND OF ANGELS (made into a movie), ALL THE KINGS'S MEN which won the Pulitzer prize and made into an Academy award winning movie about Huey Long.  He also wrote PROMISES (poetry, which won the Edna St. Vincent Millay Award of Poetry Society of America), SELECTED ESSAYS, TEXTBOOKS: UNDERSTANDING POETRY and UNDERSTANDING FICTION.  He was truly as much a part of history as the Civil War of which he writes his meditation on the Centennial in this book.	2005-09-11

Highly sensitive people are most often \\"isolated individuals\\" and have trouble interacting with the overactive, highly motivated people.  They're not afraid of being hurt and they generally are not frightened of crowds.  Noise and confusion  are things which do cause some concentration problems and a lack of ability to cope at times.  Having anxiety attacks are very different from being sensitive, getting one's feelings hurt easily and often are the hardest things.  You can see a person's soul in his eyes, and I met a sensitive writer with the gentlest blue eyes and it simply broke my heart.  Luckily for him, his talent in research and transposing it into words everyone can understand has made him a hometown hero and a 'treasure.\\"    E. M. Forester who wrote naval books many years ago said, \\"I believe in aristocracy...Not an aristocracy of power ... but of the sensitive, the considerate.  Its members are to be found in all nations and social classes, and all through the ages.\\"    A few are great names, such as Einstein.  They are sensitive for others as well as themselves; they are considerate and their luck is the power to endure.      Military men, especially, lack sensitivity because of the cruel basic training they must live through.  It was described in a college paper as a Hell on Earth and they were treated as non-humans but more like vermin.  After they retire from their varied fields, they are so proud of themselves for having gone through \\"Ranger\\" school and other special forces training, that they don't have a sensitive bone in their whole body.  They are like the autistic child, cannot put themselves in the other person's shoes or emphathize, as their opinion is definite and \\"always right,\\" not to ever be changed.  They don't know the word \\"compromise\\" as the military don't do that; only the leaders know how to \\"back down\\" in the face of fierce oppositon.    It almost always begins in childhood when an adult says, \\"you are too sensitive for your own good\\" or \\"you are your own worst enemy.\\"  No one wants to be talked down to like that at any stage in life and, especially in childhood, there is no way to retaliate for such unfeeling and uncaring comments.  Being sensitive is not any kind of syndrome.  It is just being and having your feelings on your sleeve for anyone and everyone to step on and cause you severe pain.  Sometimes, you can outgrow it if you find the right mate and have a loving marriage and family.    Being introverted, shy and inhibited does not necessarily mean that the person is highly-sensitive.  We all need to be sensitive to a degree, though men are not supposed to possess that trait. But, do you know what, women love the men who do!  My middle son was artistic, highly-intelligent and talented, but did a lot of crying for some reason on his birthday.  I have looked at his birthday photos and seen those red-rimmed eyes and wonder what did I do wrong.  I did all I could to make his day happy and cooked his favorite foods and always a birthday cake.  But he still was not happy.  He had one good friend was was extroverted, but a big liar and had few ethics as his family had deserted him as a child -- and he felt inferior.  They were in the band together -- Kenny played trumpet while my son had the trombone.  Kenny had an orange Mustang and the two of them enjoyed riding around town and being admired.  The sensitive one and the extroverted fool.  So, what does my artistic son do -- get into sports to compensate, and the not-so-smart students thought he was a 'tough' guy.  He hid his light under a bushel because some poorly-trained teachers had no sensitivity and told him that he was not as smart as his older brother.    I was a talented, pretty motherless girl, but shy.  Put me before the t.v. camera pantomiming Teresa Brewer, and that shyness evaporated and I became a star on Your Startime on Channel 6, WATE.  On other radio and t.v. shows, I was the only child without a pushing mother, but I got onthe air because I believed in myself -- thanks to an understanding grandfather who also sang on the radio, though a different kind of music.  When I sang, the songs came out exactly like they sounded on the Hit Parade, my favorite show after the Eddie Fisher 'Coke Time.'  I was born with music in my soul, a shyness because I was poor, and the feeling that I was as good as anyone in this town.    Hyper-sensitivity is almost the same as hyper-thyroidism only in a different direction.  I've had both and they mingle nicely as you get older to make you able to do things others can't and would never think of doing.  You can become intrepid and people think that you are not sensitive but tough (like Zach).  They may be a little afraid of what might come out of your mouth, but they also admire your courage and ability to get things done.    Elaine Aron graduated from the University of California at Berkley, and became a college teacher, therapist, psychologist, and novelist in that order.  I am always against mental health workers using their clients as scapegoats by putting them in books to be disected.  In Pulaski, on a weekly talk show, the director of the Mental Health Center was a regular who talked about the poor clients (of course, he did not use their names, but he did divulge personal and private information on the air) and made fun of some of them.  He ended up leaving his career dental hygienist for one of the crazies, to live happily ever after in loo-loo land.    Highly sensitive people should never be made fun of or used for the monetary profit of their therapists.  But I do believe that many do such an unethical practice and charge the government excessive amounts for \\"using\\" these folks as guinea pigs.	2005-09-11

A long time ago, I had a son with a sense of humor to match \\"Rowan And Martin's Laugh-In,\\" and the whole family would watch this silly show mainly to hear Goldie's infectious giggle.  One Saturday, the local radio station was doing an open house at a hardware store and offered the recording from a Rowan & Martin show to the next customer who came through the door and asked for it.  My sons and I were in the car, so I parked at the front door and urged Zach to ask for the tape.  The radio host, George Martin, decided to interview me as a 'bad mother,' allowing my children to hear this risque stuff.  He asked, \\"Are you really going to let them listen to this?\\"  I said, \\"Oh, they've already heard and seen it all, so why not?\\"  Of course, I meant the t.v. show -- not that we act that kooky at home or say that kind of thing at home.  No way!    She was never beautiful, but this photo on the cover is simply glamourous, and the lotus flower so graceful and lovely.  Goldie wasn't graceful on that show; in fact, she was usually fumbling around trying to be funny.  She was the dumb blonde.  As she warns in the beginning, \\"be careful what you wish for.\\"  I was told that three years ago by someone I trusted, and it was oh, so true as the person I was corresponding with via email wasn't who I thought it was.    Recently, Kate Hudson was in Knoxville with the band her husband is a part of; don't ask what it's called as it is not my kind of music and so I didn't know they were here at the newly renovated Tennessee Theatre.  Her remarks about our charming dead town to David Letterman made front-page headlines as she told the truth; you have to make your own fun here.  This is a college town, but it's ugly and backward and not progressive at all.  The downtown is like an abandoned mining town after hours and on weekends.    Some of the townsfolks took issue with her truthfulness about nothing to do in Knoxville, Tennessee.  It's too bad she wasn't here during the month of April, asthe town blooms with dogwoods and is actually pretty for a few weeks.  One week of that month the downtown comes alive with activities.  It used to be two weeks six years ago, and the whole month ten years ago.  The town is dying by degrees.  She was right and I sent a Letter to the Editor of The News-Sentinel to support her.  I was born here and I can't find things to do via public transportation at night or on weekends as the buses quit early Sundays evenings and few and far between after 8:15 p.m. weekdays.  Except for the University area, where they give free rides to the students to the drinking holes in a dangerous part of town.  Sometimes, there is music on Market Square, but not of the caliber she is used to, and it isn't my kind of music, either.    The postcards are novel and this one about the lotus special:  \\"How can we count our moments of joy one by one?  Isolated from one another?  They should acummulate and be worn throughout life like a mantle of wealth in which we can drape ourselves, at any given moment.\\"  She was so cute in 'Cactus Flower' and 'Private Benjamin.'  She was a delightful 'flower child' and I was delighted when she married Kurt Russell.	2005-09-11

Rose O'Neal Greenhow was \\"the\\" Civil War spy.  This is a true story of her exploits before and during the Civil War.    In 1857, Rose was described by a jealous Northern woman as \\"she looked fity or seventy.\\" That's me sometimes. She was on trial in San Francisco where her husband, Robert, was a lawyer. She might have passed for thirty-five. She was asked \\"How old are you?\\" She answered with dignified finality -- \\"Of sufficient age to testify.\\"  She was the Ethel Rosenberg of the Civil War on the Southern side, of course.     Her Oriental Hotel on Market Street was a noted gathering place for the Southerners. Among the generals she met there were Johnston of Shiloh fame, Sherman, Scott and McDowell. Some of their graves at at Shiloh in southwest Tennessee. There in San Francisco, there were polka cotillions and the Southerners lived akin to the way they did in Washington, D.C. She made trips back and forth, carrying messages, and became known as a Confederate spy.     Seven years later, in 1864, she looked years younger in looks as she sailed on the 'Condor' from England to the Confederate States.  Rose had often said she would glady die for the Confederacy, and she was drown in the ship wreck during a storm.     In Washington, she had been the fashionable hostess to the likes of John C. Calhoun, James Buchanan, and Dolley Madison.  She and Robert went to California during the height of the Gold Rush.  After his death in a tragic accident, she became notorious for her many love affairs in Washington. D.C.    With the Civil War, things changed rapidly for, overnight Rose became an intrepid spy.  She supplied accurate intelligence against the Union forces, written in code, to General Beauregard, reportedly one of her lovers.  She made the difference in the outcome of Bull Run with her information, but Allan Pinkerton arrested her as a spy.  Indomitable Rose journeyed to Europe during the crisis of the war to plead the Confederate 'cause' to the royal courts of Englandand France.    No woman in the North or South rivaled this Civil War heroine, who risked everything for the cause she valued more than life itself.    She declared, \\"I am a Southern woman, born with revolutionary blood in my veins (she meant Rebel tendencies).\\"    This biography is about an astonishing woman, a book which will stand with the finest of Civil War true stories.  Wild (Rebel) Rose was one to deal with only if you were a Confederate sympathizer.  Ann Blackman wrote THE SPY NEXT DOOR: ROBERT PHILIP HANSSEN and SEASONS OF HER LIFE (about Madeleine Albright).  She was a news reporter with 'Time' magazine and the Associated Press covering American politics and social policy.	2005-09-11

I asked if he played the bagpipes, and explained that I always take pictures of the group blowing and hawing during the parades on Gay Street.  He said that he plays them in his shop, on a CD.  He was clever and had a beautiful variety of items for sale in his book store.

Those strong, courageous pioneers in America cherished and valued the few possessions they had, and cared more for their fellow man as do the newly-rich of today.  When life is simple, the simple things were held onto and must be of lasting value, be it friendships, personal attitudes, spiritual concepts or material possessions.  Since they moved around trying to find just the right spot on this Earth to be happy and prosper, they had very little clutter, and everything had its own true worth or it would be tossed as well.    Love finds us when we least expect it, and never with the one we want but the person intended to be our helpmate.  When it comes softly and gently it is double its value to the lonely woman.  Life was difficult for a single woman in pioneer days, but it was equally hard for a widower with a young daughter to raise.  Many of our forefathers came from this heritage and brought the values and ethics so necessary to a hard life.    It appeared to be a \\"marriage of convenience\\" for both Clark Davis and Marty.  It was especially exciting for Missie to have a mother again.  A little girl growing up without a mother is a lost soul and on her own, as the dad could not possibly understand the yearnings and needs of a growing girl.  She must find her own diversions so as not to dwell on the thought of being half-orphan and thank God instead for allowing her to have a life of any sort.      Marty was a  young, vibrant, independent young woman of nineteen (same age I was when I married) who went West with Clark seeking adventure and some kind of fortune, good, bad or otherwise.  When tragedy happened and she was left all alone, the pain, heartache, frustration and anger were almost more than she could cope with.  But a new family came along just when she was about to give up.  God knows our limitations.    The hardships of living out on the prairie with the enormous amount of chores, hog killing, raising chickens for food,surviving the best she could.  But God blessed her with a child of her own.  This is a tender story of three hearts broken by despair and death, finding wholeness through patience, loyalty, and faith in God.  The courage and beauty of 'true love' is a joy to behold.  In today's busy work world, it is hard to see couples who are truly in love and care about the other person more than about him/herself.   Many are possessive of their young wives, caring only what the other guys may admire and desire, but she is his to take home and do with as he pleases.      Sometimes, - squandering this on all and sundry is simply criminal....grave.   Nothing like being censored.  How did it all come about, this miracle of love?  It had come upon her unawares -- \\"softly.\\"    Janette Oke has a long series of these Love Comes books and other Christian related series of novels.  She is a most prolific author.	2005-09-11

There is reason to believe that every organism on earth today, whether the reader or a microbe in his guts is the the product of continuous descent from a common ancestor of almost four billion years ago (OUT OF CHAOS, 1977).  So all life-on-earth is one, according to Louis J. Halle.  He worries about the causes and consequences; tries to understahd why things happen.   He is part of that guild of writer-naturalists who are masters of elegant and pleasing prose, along the vein of Thoreau.    \\"We see distinctly only what we know  thoroughly\\" wrote Edward A. Wilson.  Mankind's selective breeding, as Darwin noted, for the \\"ostentation of the beauty of birds,\\" which accomplished wonders without improving on the original as one sees it in its native setting.   Today, as I walked to Greenwood Cemetery to put flowers on Al Curtis' grave, I found a dead gray (with black accents) Titmouse, such a small little bird, so I wrapped it in pink plastic which is what I found near the scene of its death, and buried it at the spot where I have just planted a mimosa tree.  The White Spruce which reigned supreme in that place for years was cut down to provide more light for the entrance to the parking lot of an apartment complex.  Thus, my precious find -- the lovely God's creature, will help the mimosa to grow and will include its little spirit with the beautiful flowers of the adult mimosa.    It is curious, but not irrelevant that, although the elephant is the principal \\"beast-of-burden\\" employed by the human population in India, we give that description to the mule in America.  No domestic variety of the elephant exists and the animals to be be domesticated are captured from the wild population.  Where else is anything like that true?  We have African elephants here in the zoos, and a place near Savannah, Tennessee, has an elephant ranch for old circus animals who can no longer carry out their tricks.  In the past, one such elephant went wild and killed a person in the audience andshe was strung up on a high wire equipment out in a field and killed for all to see here in Knoxville, a vainglorious event of the almost-forgotten past.    The most abundant bird of prey is the kite in India where it is a scavenger like the seagulls.  It is like the American symbol, the bald Eagle which Dolly Parton saved and let loose in its natural habitat.   Kites are almost the most representative of bird-life on this planet.  They would have reason to complain of the bad name given them in English literature as they are among the most beautiful birds, the most graceful of flyers.  The American national bird is, of course, the bald eagle.  Tennessee's state bird is the gray and white mockingbird.  I love the Eastern bluebird and doves of all kinds.    Louis Halle wrote SPRINGTIME IN WASHINGTON, when the world there is bathed in the beauty of the cherry trees.  In Knoxville, it is April when our dogwoods all across the county bloom in their splendor.  One month a year, Knoxville is actually beautiful; the rest of the time, it is the ugly, scruffy town a Frenchman called it back in the Fifties.  He has published books in history, natural history, philosophy and international politics.  He had a U. S. Dept. of State career but lives in Geneva, Switzerland.	2005-09-10

This Troisieme Edition works along with the new web site which provides additional practice opportunities.  It is written so that the reader and language student can learn about the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of the French-speaking world and to prepare the average traveller a guide as you traverse a French country or the French Canadian area of North America. <br /> <br />There is a grammatical section so as to make communicating with the foreigners not so difficult.  Now, when I tried to learn Spanish a long time ago, it was the verbs which tripped me up keeping me from writing a letter to my pen pal in Sabadell, Spain.  He knew English well enough to teach it to others there, but I wanted to surprise him by sending just one communique in his native tongue.  This book explains the difference in the \\"-er\\" verbs vs. the \\"-ir\\" verbs; also the regular verbs which end in \\"-re\\"  such as entendre.  There are pronominal or reflexive verbs, reciprocal and idiomatic verbs.  Two kinds of infinitives: past and present.  It explains prepositions with geographical names, like La Nouvelle Orleans (poor place may just not exist anymore or will be moved to higher ground). <br /> <br />This book teaches the student to communicate with French speakers about contemporary issues and helps to develop language skills which will enhance career opportunities.  Foreign languages are not so important in the United States as most of us are not world travelers.  The native tonue in America will soon be Spanish anyway, as so many Latins have taken over the large cities in pupulation growth.   <br /> <br />The cartoons (Little Red Riding Hood in bed with the wolf wearing Grandma's nightcap) and La fleur, lem mir oir et le cheval, about a knight and his lady fair are fun to interpret and the songs add a fun dimension to the text of learning another language.  It seems that many in the U.S. of America have trouble learning their own native English, and the idioms of sections of the countryare meaningless to those of us who don't live there.  Harlem speech is as far from California speech as the man in the moon is from Mars.   <br /> <br />We need to learn to live together, no matter the nationality or demonination (religion) we celebrate, as this Earth is for us all to get along in and live, love and be happy.	2005-09-10

Instead of a poet (pun on her name), she is an artist in many ways.  Ms. Peot teaches at the Tisch School for the Arts at New York University.   She has prepared a guidebook to map out new pathways for \\"your\\" personal, artistic journey.  Looking for ways to nurture your creativity -- you'll find clear explanations and simple instruction with inspiration and encouragement.  \\"Art is about perspective.\\"   <br /> <br />This book has a sheer range of projects which will keep \\"your creative fires\\" burning for a long time to come.  This is perfect for those who love to make arts and crafts from stencils to prints and collages.  This stock-full of 150 illustrations and more will help to expand your creative horizons. <br /> <br />You can make \\"your mark\\" in other fields of life, not just with art.  Being individual is an advantage in getting things done and becoming known for your ideas instead of something to sell.  If you hang with a crowd of like-minded \\"rebels,\\" you'll never make your own distinctive, unique mark on anything.  You're just one of many who are unhappy with the way things are going in the universe but not brave enought to go on a campaign to clean some things up.  My battle with noise pollution is picking up steam, and the old man Whitt thought a single person was not worthy of compromise.  He held tight to his mistake of letting someone put up a noisemaker in a high traffic (walking) area because the work would be done free.  Of course, that left him indebted to that person to give his company government jobs for which they could receive large amounts, this is in the janitorial department which uses lots of supplies and employees.  For only two federal buildings almost catty-cornered from each other, using the same guards (who are fed up with that noisemaker) and custodians, and supervisors who walk the grounds, this person now is making quite a profitable allowance from this GSA department simply because he put up the obnoxious thing free!  Like the busdrivers of KAT, the bus they are driving is \\"theirs\\" not the riders, Whitt feels that building is his and he is paranoid about the birds he says he loves, but actually hates.  They cut down forty or more trees in the Spring and there was such an uproar in the press, they planted dogwoods to replace the oaks and Japanese cherry.  Of course, this is \\"dogwood arts territory\\" each April, but the rest of the time it is \\"beware of birds downtown\\" according to GSA.  Make your mark by being yourself and a person who can think and work on his/her decisions.  There is nothing better than making a mark for posterity, one which will benefit others.  Art is forever and gets more valuable with age.  Life is not forever, but each of us can strive to leave our \\"mark\\" if we will just act on our convictions.  God put us here for a purpose; find yours, and make your mark in a big way.	2005-09-10

The rattlesnake is by far the most dangerous and widely distributed of the venomous varieties in the United States and Canada.  It is aggressive and attacks with little warning.  It has the rattler on the tip of its tail, which shows it has been agitated and will fight to kill.  On the map, it cover half of the country and goes part way down into Mexico.  It does not have to have dry desert surroundings.  They thrive here in the Smoky  Mountains and in the Appalachians.  You can also find them in coastal areas and sand dunes.  They need rock crevices to hide in; they are the most active in attacking people from April through September.   In Calofornia, they are never hibernating and always ready for action. <br /> <br />In Tennessee, some offbeat relgious zealots use rattlesnakes in church services called 'handling them.\\"  There is no way to 'handle' a snake except in a zoo where they are restrained from getting out among the public. <br /> <br />There are more copperheads in this area; could be that is the reason that moniker was given to Southern sympathizers during the American Civil War.  Its head glows in the sun which automatically alerts the victim that it is a copperhead.  It is swift and dangerous when it chooses its prey.  I was taken on a trail in the Smokies by a weird 'friend' to see if I would be afraid of the bears.  A female teacher had been killed on that trail by a bear when her companion went on ahead and she could not defend herself.  All along the trail after we reached the peak and was away from the water, I kept hearing stirrings off in the branches.  Finally, I told her I felt I had gone far enough.  We had not reached the death scene which was on the plateau.  At the beginning of this first trail walking, I had told her that I am very much afraid of snakes.  She swore we would not see one.  Because of my balance problem, I insisted on walking on the left down the hill away from the deep drop off to the water.  I can't swim and I didn't wantany broken bones.  Halfway down the hill, I saw something sliver and shine in the sunlight (and my eyes are not good), and I asked her what that could be.  She scooted out of the way in a hurry and changed places with me after that so that I would be near the water.  She matter-of-factly said that it was a copperhead and would have bit her if I hadn't seen it.  She once said that she is a 'reptile' as it takes her four hours to put her makeup on before she will leave her apartment.  Coming from Hawaii to Florida before finding her 'place' here in the Smoky Mountains, I have often wondered which species.	2005-09-10

After being displaced by a 'trophy wife' (what I call the 'glamour girl of the Fifties all grown up'), Regina  finds her world turned upside down.  No more ladies' luncheons (I miss the literary club the most.) and all-expense-paid trips with the savvy clothes, she moved into her legacy, a Boston townhouse bequeathed to her by an aunt.  He'd had a lemon of a divorce like mine, only she had the foresight and ability to turn it into 'lemonade.'  It takes a very special person to have that sense of humor and good feeling about herself to overcome a devastating change in the quality of living.  Unlike me, she had a place to go to; I malingered in the college town so that my child would at least get child support, and yet the professor ruled our lives and controlled everything we did -- the old man still tries even though I am now hundreds of miles away from the small town, but he still has his claws in the youngest son's life ruining any possibility that he will ever be able to crawl out from under the snakepit his dad has him in.    Regina learns that she has inherited from her aunt not only the 'second sight' psychic's ability but her unofficial consultant position with the Boston police department.  She has the sixth sense but, at times, wishes she could call on the ESP on demand when she finds herself in some scary positions.  \\"They say nightime fog is romantic, but a woman walking alone on dark city sidewalks gets a Jack the Ripper feeling to the marrow of her bones...and footsteps are approaching coming from behind, amplified by the fog.\\"    Thus, we embark on a Sherlock Holmes-type investigation to see if the wrong man has been behind  bars for thirteen years.  He was a politician's son and used as a scapegoat as the D.A. was pushed for a quick arrest.  He is no Randy Nichols.   R.N. is meticious in even letting a person get a warrant, and he won't let his department take on a case they won't win.  Now, that is power.  She received a note with huge letters HELP ME explaining that the bad evidence has the wrong man behind bars languishing his life away in dire circumstances.  She has an optic flash, a burning left side below the rib cage, a fiery sensation of such intensity she wants to cry out, from the prisoner's plea for justice.      There is a mumbling bag lady as one of the clues to what really happened so many years ago.  We have some of those here, one is Japanese with her parasol, shopping cart, jackets on in the hottest part of the summer, hoods pulled up, and out riding the buses.  We have the mumbling, threatening homeless men walking the sidewalks and hanging around at the bus transfer point asking for money, or else.  In her Back Bay house, she hears weird noises and wonders if she is in personal danger from an unknown source.  Her investigation back into the past leads to new dangers for her, but she has the willpower to see the thing through.    Cecelia Tishy wrote EXPOSES AND EXCESS, JEALOUS HEART, CRYING TIME, and FALL TO PIECES along with several nonfiction books and articles.  She is American lit professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and has started her mystery fiction series featuring Kate Banning.  This book will keep you in suspense and find it hard to put down.  The scary parts only make it more exciting, and the end result is worth the time it takes to finish such a saucy book, Arthur.	2005-09-10

This environmental activist and music composer had one of his essays on nature writing included in THE GIFT OF BIRDS.  Not only does he talk and communicate with whales, he also had a relationship with a 'touchy' raven in Northern Canada at the Arctic Circle.  Together they took a hike over the Delta plain of the MacKenzie River, the raven leading half the time and serving as a sentinel at his tent in camp. <br /> <br />One of my favorite writers, Poe, felt far more vindictive about his own raven which he considered as a symbol of Death, going back to the Middle Ages where ravens were companions to witches, like the bird which counseled the evil queen in 'Snow White.'  The Catholic Church maligned the raven because this midnight-black scavenger has a keen intellect.  But talking to one out in the middle of nowhere? <br /> <br />Ravens possess a great variety of calls like parrots, mynahs, and mockingbirds.  They are mechanical, like Whitt, the engineers of the avian world.  Their calls correlate so closely with social behavior that it could be the rudiments of their own type of language.  This underfed one purred like a housecat from a parallel universe down in the baritone range, at half the speed of a normal contented housecat like Star.  They had a cat and mouse game on a treasure hunt for walrus ivory one thousand years old.  I do believe Mr. Nollman has a good imagination. <br /> <br />First, they made eye contact which was difficult as birds have eyes on each side of the head and humans on a flat plane.  He moved his head in concentric bird-like ways, cocking his long beaked face in differing positions.   His long, intimidating scimitar beak which was three inches long and black as coal, started making sounds: croaking, squawking and cooing in a whispery, soothing tone.  Together they made music with Jim using a Japanese Jew's harp (my dad called it a French harp) -- really a harmonica in syncopated four-four time.   <br /> <br />\\"Immanuel Kent wrote that thehuman hand is the most visible aspect of the human sensibility.\\"  He's right, some hands are more slender and sensitive; in 'The Last Supper' the culprit who turned Christ in at the Garden where he prayed, was pictured as having one female hand. <br /> <br />According to raven protocol, there will be no touching.  Human touch is taboo, the kiss of death among wild animals, and showed disrespect' thus, causing a rift. Like E. A. Poe's 'The Raven,' he squawks \\"nevermore\\" in Raven language, then forgave the indecent affront and continued to be the human's 'sentinel,' with his black silhouette stooped in a submissive pose.  \\"Both of us striving to cultivate the novel 'camaraderie' that binds us to a middle ground of our own invention.\\"  Their relationship was elevated to a new level; \\"Let bygones be bygones.\\" <br /> <br />Generic man is the meanest-spirited and most dangerous species in all of creation, a personification of evil.  Some used birds for target practice.  Sometimes a raven makes like a rooster escaped from the coop, sometimes considered a trickster, a comedian of birds.  They were the first shamen, a true grodigy among animals.  He claims that they had a good talk about the meaning of life, and the raven had written a sentence in his journal!  Now, what could a raven write but \\"Nevermore'?! <br /> <br />Jim Nollman has also written SPIRITUAL ECOLOGY, THE BLEUGA CAFE, DOLPHIN DREAMTIME, ANIMAL DREAMING and THE CHARGED BORDER: WHERE WHALES AND HUMANS MEET. This essay is as good as any Brothers Grimm fairy tale, and as believable.  What about ravens?	2005-09-10

Che-Wee is a purple finch who belonged to a writer in New York, her co-author as he perched on the pen she used or on the typewriter and rode there, never flinching as the keys strike up close past his beak.  He thinks he is a person, not a bird.  Just as Star, my cat, steers me in the right direction and is my constant companion, as I listen to Music Of Your Life (that's the only kind of music she has heard in her thirteen years, and she loves Michael Feinstein almost as much as I do.  She especially loves Ken yOung's singing voice.) and talks to me as I write the reviews and answers email. <br /> <br />The writer/owner of Che-Wee was the wife of a naturalist and they found him at their Vermont farm.  He was lost and forlorn that winter he was born (natched), too little to fly, too young to know how to feed himself.  Justin brought home a cat from his grandmother's who was too small to know how to drink milk, so I used a medicine dropper to feed Tosca at first.  She lived nineteen years and was my shaman cat.  I still miss her healing presence. <br /> <br />Che-Wee pretends to be able to read as he perches on the pen his author is using.  He chirps and actually acts like he knows what she is writing.  He has no cage but flies free throughout the New York apartment, and even ventures out onto the branches of trees outside the window.  Thank goodness, no predator has grabbed him.  He's something like the goldfinch, a lovely species of the fowl world.  They have much 'charm' and are small but a delight to hear and amusing to watch.  Their call has a unique tinkling quality.  The male purple finch sings a cheery, rich song, marked by a few harsh notes as his song tumbles brightly down the musical scale.  They have an overall \\"dipped in wine\\" look.  These are intelligent birds. <br /> <br /> <br />Ms. Elswyth Thane wrote YOUNG MR. DISRAELI, ENGLAND WAS AN ISLAND ONCE, THE TUDOR WENCH which was turned into a play).

A retired old man was bored but poor, so he got into a smugggling avocation of sorts.  His favorite booke he told an interested person was THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL about a renegade who saved prisoners from the guillotine during the French Revolution.    When he had lots of spare time, he'd go to the railway station to dream of the places he wished he could visit if he had the money.  There, he saw starving pigeons doomed to a lingering death.  So he started off small on his smuggling a few very ill pigeons in a cardboard box to release them in the country.  \\"Plenty of people object to pigeons flying in their faces and skimming over their heads.\\"  People like Whitt think their excrement is poison to humans.    One day he almost missed the train and was helped on by a young woman who became his confidante.  \\"First, you pick out your pigeon -- the most starved and persecuted.\\"  Handle it gently and pop it in the box.  Get a few and start pretending you are the Pimpernel.  \\"There's an advantage to being small,\\" he explained, \\"who would take me for the Scarlet Pimpernel.\\"  Indeed, most people look the other way when they see an old poor person, man or woman.    He spent the spring months enjoying his adventures smuggling the birds on the rails to freedom in the beechwoods of the villages.  \\"I sprinkle some grain and lift out my bird.  I open my hands and up he soars into the clear air, a country bird instead of a city bird.\\"  The air is healthier and there is natural food for the birds.    A cheerful comradeship developed between the two unlike conspirators for the intrevening weeks; but, one day, he was no longer there.  \\"Now, when I stroll around our village and a silvery-gray cloud of pigeons rises up feasting on beechnuts, I think: \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Central rescued them.  I was not likely to forget him.\\"  Reminds me of Robert Wrisley, wh'd do something similar and tell his big tales about imaginary travels around the world.  Now, he is off to the big happy land in the sky where he can dream to his fullest extent and watch the pigeons flying around free and healthy, thanks to him.	2005-09-09

This book is about winning at all costs in the sports world.  Rampant use of drugs and steroids to enhance performances from Olympics to individual games show the decline in the sports ofr sports sake mentality.  Two of my sons played sports as youngsters and high school athletes.  The other was the best lifeguard in Pulaski, and one used steroids.  I, on the other hand, have had to use them twice for a stubborn ear infection which just won't ever go away.    Winning costs too much in all aspects of life.  When we win, that means that someone else loses.  Fighting for the sake of winning in marriage, work competition, other debates, and just living day-to-day takes its toll on our health.  If we win, we get overly excited putting stress on the heart.  If we lose, it also puts too much stress on the heart and I'm not talking about our heart-strings (romance).  We all want to win at whatever we try.  Here lately, I don't seem to be winning at any of my endeavors and, believe me, that hurts more than having a heart attack,  At least, that's a fast way to go and the pain goes away.    We have brought up this generation to win or don't ever try again.  In earlier eras, it was war which took its toll on our young men who were trained to win at all costs.  War kills indiscriminately.  But so does retaliation, resentment, hate, and being torn apart by strangers who need not inerfere in our lives in the first place.  Today, everyone is a critic and set out to hurt feelings and make ourselves felt.  Who cares whether you actually know the person you are flailing out at and hurting their feelings?  That makes it impersonal.  It makes the critic feel important and gets his venom out of his system onto an unsuspecting victim randomly chosen.    It is rewarding to win ball games, band competitions, debates, disagreements over things which are very important to you; it is hard to always be the loser.  I try so hard, and yet fail to achieve the things I want to do to leave a legacybehind to be a contributing citizen and someone what made a difference in her hometown.  Not having money makes it a hundredfold harder to win at issues, political and otherwise, but important all the same.  We are overlooked because we don't have influence and money for lawyers to fight our battles for us.  We're on our own and have to take responsibility for our stands in all walks of life.    Sure, it is fun and rewarding to be a winner.  But we can't always do it and should never depend on drugs or others to take the blame for our failures.  I failed as a mother, though God knows I tried to protect and teach my sons the way they should act according to Abou Ben Adhem whose legacy was theat God blessed him because he loved his fellowman.  I may not love men per se, and I certainly don't even like women very much, but I strive to be fair and just in all of my dealings with those in power and the poor homeless I see everyday on the public buses and at the public library.  Life is not fair.  But it is what we make it.  Strive for winning without scandal, or unjust criticism.  It can be done, and God willing, I will survive to fight other battles and win a few along the way.	2005-09-09

One of the hardest things you will ever have to do is say \\"goodbye\\" to the one you love.  Nothing is forever.  But things end and we have to go on.  If you don't or refuse to say goodbe, that person will remain trapped inside you for the rest of your days.  Some people think it is easier to just walk away, to get out of that person's life and try to forget they ever existed.  Let me tell you, that does not work -- ever.    When a loved one dies, there is no alternative but to shed tears of regret for all you should have said.  Tristan died in a car acccident and Zach is suffering because he could not remember the last time he told his son \\"I love you.\\"  We get so busy as parents that time slips by and we don't consider the mortality of life and how quickly it can be extinguished.  The best thing for the griever is to remember the good times you had with your loved one and how much you both profited by loving each other.  Love is never a one-way street; it takes two to tango.  But sometimes, love sours and can't be made right again.  A gentle goodbye is better by far than a harsh, bitter one.    The main regret women have as they get older is not saying goodbye to the first love of their lives, romantically.  I don't even have a picture of mine as I felt that he would always be a part of my life.  No one ever is.  He had the cheek bones of the Cherokees whose reservation is just up on the mountain from here.  He had the last name of the Chief of the Cherokees.  But he simply vanished, went away and never came back.  That is the bad part of love.  To lose and keep searching for the elusive dream.  Take time to hug the person you love; if you don't feel comfortable saying the three most important words in the English language, just show it with a loving smile.    On the bus, a baby could not talk to me except with his eyes, and he was chuck full of love.  His mother was amazed that he would communicate with me as he did.  After all, I was a stranger.  It is usually a stranger we fall in love with; only if you get married, do you start looking and acting alike.  Lately, I've been observing the older man/younger wife couples and how different they are from the same-age young couples when they first get married.      It is easy for love to turn to hate.  I've been told that to hate a person, you must love them first.  I find that not necessarily true, but saying goodbye is a requisite to your own mental health.  It is hard, but life must go on -- and there is always someone else to love; it just make take awhile to find the right one.

There were records and carvings of Rock Doves dating from 3,000 B.C.  Even Noah took aboard his Ark two doves.  They are the ancestors of today's pigeons, the lovely, bright gentle birds. <br /> <br />Throughout history, the pigeon had been used by Asian And European civilizations as a speedy and reliable carrier of messages.  They were used during the war by the British.   <br /> <br />When the first marathon runner gained victory in the Olympic Games at Pisa in AD230, he sent the new home via his hen bired (a pigeon), which he had taken with him.   This book is illustrated throughout and the subject of training pigeons, both yound and old, is explained in depth.	2005-09-09

All liveing beings need adequate amounts of food containing a balanced measure of ingredients if they are to function successfully.  As do people.  Pigeons are vegetarians and if ovrefed it reduces their mental alertness.  At the Episcopal Church across from that awful noise maker used to keep the pigeons off one certain building in town, they put out the grain.  I come along and give them my bread and crackers, biscuits when I can and rolls.  Anything to keep these beautiful creatures alive.  After all, they are God's creatures. <br /> <br />Correct feeding is necessary for growth, release of energy so that the body can function properly, and for the production of eggs to reproduce and to replace old tissue with new.  Each year, thousands of eggs fail to hatch and that is due to vitamin deficiency.  The mourning dove, a favorite of mine, so gentle and pretty, has a lovely singing sound, but some mean people use them as skeet targets.  When a neighbor cat ate one which took up residence on my porch, I would throw things at that mean, nasty cat.  And I love cats.  I've owned cats for 27 years consistently but I also love the beautiful birds.    The mournful \\"oooahh, ooh, ooh, ooh\\" sound is the song of the South.  There were some in the attic of an apartment house right over my bedroom and their scurrying around with that sound of theirs had me concerned.  I thought that the old man who lived in the place below mine was wheezing and about to die. <br /> <br />Urban pigeons have highly developed scavenging skills, raiding trrashcans and fast food litter.  However, in Knoxville, we have enough bus riders who feed the pigeons wherever and whenever we can.  The rock pigeon originated in northern Europe, Africa and India, but migrated to cities and towns worldwide some five thousand years ago.  A flock may contain birds in every color from pure white to reddish purple, gray  to solid black.  They are a delight to they eye and heart as they are so appreciative.	2005-09-09

Most of us get all worked up about things which, upon closer examination, aren't really that big a deal.  We focus on little problems and concerns and blow them out of proportion.  One example is a minor problem in traffic when a stranger cuts in front and perhaps causes a near accident.  We convince ourselves that we are justified in our anger.  The other day, Jeff followed my directions to turn right, without looking to his left.  A car was right up on him but, since no one was in the approaching lane, she was able to get over.  Then she forced him off the road.  I told him not to get out of the car as that was road rage.  The woman gave him a good lecture, then cooled down when I said, \\"He's from Nashville.  He didn't know where he was.\\"    Road rage and running through red lights are the things to do in this town.  Do not worry about little things.  Instead of \\"sweating the small stuff,\\" take time to contemplate a solution.  You'll have a lot more energy to be kinder and gentler.    When your mind is clear and peaceful and your stress level is reduced, you'll have more fun.  When your stress is small, it's manageable and easy to control.  We all have high (optimistic about the future and grateful for the past)) and low, negative moods (life is never as bad as it seems at that time).  In a low mood, you feel that your whole life is wrong.  In a good mood, everything seems to go much better.    Life is never fair.  It should be, but it's not and it won't be someday.  We determine our rate by not expecting fairness and feeling sorry for ourselves.  It is our own challenge to overcome personal struggles.  Get out of self-pity by deciding to stop thinking about the injustices of the world.    How many of us can do these simple things without feeling guilty?	2005-09-08

The blue butterfly flew around me twice.  Is that a good sign? <br /> <br />Hitler set out to conquer Austria and Czechoslovakia, then take over parts of Poland and Russia.  He declared \\"to solve Germany's problem of space at the latest by 1943-45.\\"  Instead, he made many mistakes along the way and committed suicide when the Allies won the war in 1945. <br /> <br />The fighting started September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland with sixty divisions containing 1,250,000 men.   Poland is a part of the new United States of Europe, the place to be today.  Knoxville's own Victor Ashe is the United States of America ambassadoe. <br /> <br />A confrontatin took place in Warsaw on a grand scale.  England and France declared war against Germany on September 3, and the French used underground tunnels with double track railways which led to ammunition dumps and elevators serving gun stations.  Hitler and Stalin divided Poladn between their two countries.  The Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithvania lost their freedom on October 10, 1939 to Russia. <br /> <br />On November 30, Stalin bombed Hilsinki and Viipuri; by the end of December, Russians backed off but started again February 1, 1940.  Finland gave up the K. Ishmus and some bases on the Gulf of Finland on March 13.  Finland had lost the war, but the little country had shown the world a displaly of national courage rarely equalled in history.  Germany invaded Denmark and Norway on April 8, 1940 and conquered it in one day.  The king of Norway and his government escaped to England.   <br /> <br />Belgium had a total of 600,000 soldiers organized into twenty-two divisions, but they were poorly trained and equipped.  There was a Dutch army of 400,000 men, even less well prepared for war.  Belgium and Holland were neutral countries, afraid of the German armies.  Dunkirk fell in Belgium, Amsterdam and the Hague in Holland, and Flanders in the northern tip of France and southwestern Belgium.   <br /> <br />Queen Wilhelmina and the Dutch government fled by ship to Britian where they joined the Norwegian govern-in-exile.  The Dutch army surrender on May 14.  On May 10, the British nation had called on Winston Churchill to replace Neville Chamberlain as prime minister.  He told the people, \\"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\\" <br /> <br />The Russian forces were divided into three groups: Baltic States and northwest Russia, Russian-held Poland and White Russia, and Ukraine and south Russia.  Hitler had won his battle at the cost of losing the war.  He had now made his greatest mistake.  He died five days before the Allies won the war. <br /> <br />The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, had no immediate effect on the war in Europe, but it prompted the United States to drop their bombs which put an end to EEII.	2005-09-08

On June 10, 1940, Mussolini, the Fascist dictator of Italy declared war on France and Britain, whose armies had been defeated by Germany in the Battle of Flanders.  Mussolini aimed to seize control of the Mediterrean Sean and the Suez Canal from Britain, which was the \\"lifeline of the British Empire.\\"  He was going to partner Hitler after his \\"victory.\\" <br /> <br />Churchill had just been chosen as Prime Ministr and would not back down.  He was a great motivator and determined to destroy Nazism and Fascism.  England was a small island with a large empire in Asis and the Pacific.  They had America for awhile before the American Revolution.  The German Rommel drove the British out of East Africa, Gremany had success after success into Yugoslavia and Greece in April; by the end of May, the Germans had driven Britain from Crete.  The British had good reason to hate all Germans. <br /> <br />America joined the fray when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, destroying American Pacific Fleet.  Germans were bombing the Allied freighters off the coast of North Africa.All of those road trips movies of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby with various leading ladies were based on these glamorous sounding places in Africa, Morocco, Tripoli, Casablanca and others.  Chuck Southcott's stepfather was the makeup artist for those films. <br /> <br />General Patton commanded 35,000 American troope in the Atlantic.  Rommel thought the Allies were poorly organized and confused.  Hitler made a very serious mistake.  On Valentine's Day, Rommel made a surprise on the American II Corps.  He forced Eisenhower to reorganize and improve the Allied command system. <br /> <br />In NOrth Africa, the Allies took 9,000 German prisoners in a single day.  275,000 Germans and Italians were captured during the last ten days of battle at Tunisia.  Sicily is an island extending from Italy to within ninety miles from the coast of Tunisia.  The U.S. Coast Guard transported men and materials for the invasion of Sicily.<br /> <br />Mt. Etna was under the possession of Germans as a defensive line to hold northeastern portion of the island.  At first, the Allies could not advance past Mt. Etna, but Patton's troops persisted until Hube withdrew. September 8 was important to the Allies and Italians after prime minister Badoglio agreed to surrender.  Mussolini's government lost all popular support with the conquest of Sicily. <br /> <br />The American and British top military commanders -- the Combined Chiefs of Staff -- agreed that the best way to keep pressure on the Axis would be to use Sicily as a steppingstone for an immediate invasion of Italy.  The Allied leaders were certain that the Italians would surrender as soon as they knew their country was to be invaded.  General Eisenhower was order to have his forces invade Italy early in September, 1943.  The troops of General Patton's Seventh Army, who had done so well in Sicily, were ordered to England to prepare for the invasion of northern France in 1944. <br /> <br />Mule pack teams carried supplies to troops fighting in the mountainous regions of Italy because wheeled vehicles could not make it in that terrain.  This is where the \\"Winter Line\\" was located in the mountainous country.  There is a graphic photo of bombed-out Cassino, Italy.  On June 4, Allied troops marched triumphantly into Rome.  In western Italy, the \\"Gothic Line\\" was as strong as the Winter Line. <br /> <br />The Fifteenth Army Group had always had many nationalities in its ranks.  By the beginning of 1945, these units included American, British, New Zealand, Canadian, Newfoundland, South African, Palestinian, Jewish, Brazilian, Gurkha, Indian, Polish, Italian and Japanese American. <br /> <br />On April 27, Mussoline tried to escape from Italy with a German truck convoy.  Berlin was surrounded by Russian armies.  In less than a week, on May 2, Hitler would be dead, and the war in Europe would be over.  Thank God.	2005-09-08

Little known facts about the Presidency:    Prior to the evolution of a clear two-party system and separate election of the President and the Vice-President, there were often three or four contenders for the presidency, often from the same party.  The most famous instance of this came in 1800.  Jefferson, who was unofficially his party's candidate for President, and Burr, both Democratic-Republicans, tied with 73 electoral votes.  The two opposing Federalist candidates, John Adams and Charles C. Pinckney trailed with 65 and 64 respectively.  The election was decided in the House of Representatives in the so-called Revolution of 1800.    In the 1824 election, there were four legitimate candidates for the presidency: John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay and William H. Crawford.  Jackson won the most popular and electoral votes, but lacked the majority of electoral votes needed.  The election was thrown to the House of Representatives, which went for Jon=hn Quincy Adams when Clay as powerful House leader, threw his support to the New Englander in the so-called Corrupt Bargain.  At least, it wasn't decided by a biased Supreme Court Judge, as in the Gore/Bush fiasco.    On Harrison's death of pneumonia a few months after his inauguration, Tyler became the first Vice-President to succeed to the office due to the death of a sitting President.  Tyler kept Harrison's Cabinet, but named no new Vice-President.  There was no constitutional provision for replacing a Vice-President until ratification of the 25th Amendment in 1967.    Abraham Lincoln failed in business 1831 and again in 1833.  In the meantime, he ran for state legislator and lost.  His sweetheart died in 1835, and he had a nervous breakdown the next year.  He lost the nomination to Congress in 1843, was defeated again for Congress in 1848 and 1855 and lost the vice presidency of the United States in 1856.  Then he ran for Senator in 1858 and lost.  In 1860 Abe Lincoln was elected president of the United States.  The rest is history.    In the election of 1888, Cleveland won the popular vote with 448.6 percent of the votes cast, but lost the election in the electoral college, where Harrison won 233-168.  They tried to claim that with Bush, but he was given the election by another Republican.    In 1960 (when Jeff and John, Jr. were born), John F. Kennedy beat Nixon by the slimmest of margins (except for Gore's non-\\"win\\" against Bush), 118,574 vote difference.     After Nixon's V.P had to resign because of tax fraud when he had been the former governor of Maryland, Ford was chosen as Vice-President.  Ford succeeded Nixon following his resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal.  Nelson Rockefeller of New York was appointed V.P. by Ford under the 25th Amendment.	2005-09-06

Like every living things on earth today, our species is a product of physical evollution.  The detail of how or why Man became Man are shadowy and vague despite the concentrated study devoted to the subject during the last hundred years. <br /> <br />Long ago, the remote ancestors of apes and huminids lived in the trees.  Hand feeting and its results led to the development of new areas of the brain.  The homininds moved onto the grasslands and adopted an erect posture as opposed to the apes who stayed in the trees.  Soon the homo habilis learned how to manufacture elementary tools and weapons.  Deliberate as implying planning, thinking ahead, something which apes never learned how to do, <br /> <br />They had become a habitual tool-user and toolmaker; the use of the hands in toolmaking influenced the development of the human brain.  When they developed a truly erect posture, it allowed the head to change its form, becoming less prognathous and gave room for the brain to expand in size.  They learned how to make fire and became hunters of big game. <br /> <br />The cranial capacity of Homo habilis was 680 cc while gorillas run 584cc.  In China, the small people had 950-1050 cc.  Our own species averages 1700 cubic centimeters.  Thus, evolution can be substantiated.	2005-09-06

Louis Nizer wrote:  'Disputes used to be settled by duels on the field of honor.  Even in America, Alexander Hamilton died in such a pistol duel.\\" <br /> <br />The judicial system is a human structure and therefore is not perfect.  However, perfect justice is impossible. <br /> <br />Both the 5th and the 14th amendments prohibit the government from depriivng an individual of \\"life, liberty or property without due process of law.\\"  The promise of due process is a major component of the American ideal of justice.  The challenge is even greater in our federal system.  In 1950, the United States Supreme Court applied the protection of the Bill of Rights to the states.  As citizens, we have a responsibility to learn about and participate in the justice system in order to improve it. <br /> <br />Abraham Lincoln was assassinated five days after the end of the Civil War after he went to Congress and asked for a law to be passed giving the president the authority to suspend the write of habeas corpus in a wartime situation.  The writ of habeas corpus is a legal document demanding the accused be brought to court so that the legality of his imprisonment could be determined.  There was a secret group called 'The Sons of Liberty' in Indiana during the Civil War.  Confederate sympathizers were known as Copperheads; cartoons showed them as snakes who would strike without warning. <br /> <br />In 1919, the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor was prohibited by the 18th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  In the early '20s, several states in the Bible Belt banned the teaching of evolution, preferring school children to learn the Biblical version of the beginnings of man.  Anti-evolution laws -- a retreat from the intellectual and political freedoms gained in the march of scientific and social progress. <br /> <br />In 1925, in Dayton, Tennessee, John Scopes, age 24, was a teacher of biology with a textbook using evolution as the basis of the beginning of mankind.  Butler, a fundamentalist who believed the Bible to be literal), also a state legislator, had introduced a bill prohibiting the teaching of evolutionary theory in all public schools in Tennessee.  Thusk the historic trial with William Jennings Bryan (also a fundamentalist) vs. Clarence Darrow, the 68-yr-old most famous criminal lawyer of his time. <br /> <br />Greenglass was a machinist working in a machine shop at a secret base in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  He involved his sister's husband, Julius Rosenberg, in his conspiracy to pass on secrets of constructing the bomb.  His job had been to assemble certain instruments which would have become part of the atomic bomb.  He 'ratted' on the others, including a Russian agent, giving names and activities in 1945 so that he would not have to go to prison.  As a result, his sister and her husband were made scapegoats and executed in 1953 in SingSing prison. <br /> <br />Famous people like Albert Einstein and Pope Pius XII protested and appealed to President Dwight Eisenhower, one of those old military men who refuse to change his opinion.  I've run into two still getting taxpayer's money to be tyrants about a minor issue. <br /> <br />VietNam had their own Civil War after the French failure to keep communism out of that land in 1954.  Americans entered the gray in 1960 when military advisors were sent into South VietNam to train its army.  Vietnamese are brutal, crazy fighters.  In nine years, there were 542,000 American soldiers there involved in fighting the enemy who hid in tunnels during the nights to avoid U. S. bombs and cannon fire.   At MyLai, one hundred people were killed by U.S. Green Berets (are they the Rangers?) and William Calley, Jr. had to take the blame, after being in teh army for less than two years.  He was imprisonedon war crimes and court-martialed out the hat hellhole.  Eighty percent of Americans disapproved of the guilty verdict which became a political issue, and Nixon entered his crooked nose into things.  Dalley was never in prison and in 1974 paroled and set free,  The memory and shame of MyLai will be a part of America's history forever. <br /> <br />The other trials are just as worthwhile to learn, however, there is no room to tell them all.	2005-09-06

This is the wind-up for the Davis family which has grown too large and scattered that getting them back together for a reunion just wouldn't work; such events were unlikely in those days as the distance was too great and travel too difficult and expensive.      In this conclusion, Bea had moved to Boston where the excitement of being in a city full of activities and historic sights was worse even than her little prairie town.  In the bigger towns, as I've found to my despair, you find yourself restless, lonely with an emptiness inside which seems impossible to fill.  Her choices, as were mine in coming 'home' again, brought harm and discomfort instead of the peace she wanted.  Decisions are sometimes made on the spur of the moment and not well thought out, thus not so rewarding as she'd wish it could be.    She takes on an unexpected responsibility which strikes a responsive chord in my heart.  She is a courageous young woman about to enter another phase in her life because the one person she never expected to see again, the love of her life, surfaces and causes some havoc and much joy to which she is entitled.    Ms. Oke from Canada has written several series of books and devotionals.  She has had a very prolific career in her area of Christian writing.

He fulfilled his destiny to sing God's praises to the convicts in prison and to try to live up to the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.  <br /> <br />The Man in Black was asked if he was \\"going to a funeral\\" when because he started to wear black outfits when he performed, going back to 1954, was called a troubadour, an English balladeer, like Waylon Jennings. His theme song was 'I Walk The Line,' and he sang many styles in many genres. In the '70s, his career had reached international proportions.  <br /> <br />The first J.C. recording I remember liking was 'A Boy Called Sue' and I did love the song 'Shifting, Whispering Sands,' which he also recorded. In 1976, he had a #1 'One Piece At A Time' -- I am wondering if that is the one about putting together a car out of junk parts. His first single recording (not an album) was in 1955. I was told in 2002 that he had made a good recording of 'The Long Black Veil,' one of my favorite ballads. I found it on a Cash CD, taped that song several times and gave the CD to the person who alerted me as to its existence. There is a new movie coming out soon about his life in which he sings 'Ring of Fire.'  <br /> <br />In 1982, he made an album produced by Rodney Crowell, one of my favorite non-stars. I had a tape of some of his road songs, and I loved them all; then, foolishly, I sent it to someone I thought might enjoy it. I wish I had been selfish and kept it.  <br /> <br />He was a reader: THE ROBE, QUO VADIS, THE SILVER CHALICE, and PILLAR OF IRON influenced him to go to Israel in November, 1971, to make a movie. It was a semi-documentary and it was magical to film on Mount Arabel, overlooking Galilee and in the Church of Beatitudes. He promised God that if he could live through all of the abuse he had perpetrated on his body, he would be his \\"Superstar\\" to set a good example for the young. <br /> <br />He tells of a near-death experience after his bypass surgery in 1988, the \\"essence\\" of light as he drifted off but the doctors in Nashville worked diligently to save him. He says he was restored to his \\"senses.\\" \\"I never forgot that light, and it changed me.\\" Life meant more to him, became very moving just to look at mundane, everyday things.  <br /> <br />He felt he'd come \\"full circle\\" at a festival in England, back to the \\"bare bones.\\" pre-stardom, pre-Memphis (SUN records) days. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Florence, Alabama, and the Songwriters' Hall of Fame. He always appeared to be the bad guy, but actually he was very religious despite his long bout with alcoholism. We miss him and June Carter Cash, the mother of his only son, John Carter Cash. <br /> <br />The photo section was nice and we could see both families combined by his marriage into the Carter family.

They know what's best for America's poor and middle class.  I was called a 'liberal' by a man unknown at the local post office because I had a different opinion about a movie than his.  I thought he was calling me a bad name!  I hurriedly said, \\"No, I'm not conservative, either.  I'm not political, not Democrat nor Republican.\\"  It was funny in a way, but most disconcerting.    According to Ms. Charen, liberals are \\"convinced that anyone who disagrees with them isn't just wrong, but morally inferior, cold-hearted\\" and possibly evil.  I was treated by this self-righteous male as if I were all of the aforementioned.    Apparently, all government officicals are liberals because they've messed up schools, crime, welfare (Phil Bredesen), homelessness (Ginny Weatherstone), and race relations (Arthur Friend).  She attacks my favorite news anchor, Dan Rather; commentator, Bill Moyers, even Ted Kennedy, the only surviving brother of the clan.  Her attack on Hillary Clinton is right on the money as she thinks she's something she's not.    \\"Liberals must be called to account, for the havoc they have created in others' lives.\\"  Good intentions just don't work if actions lead to disaster.

This is another of Waller's post-divorce from Francesca to find romance and the ever elusive love she took with her.  Here, we have Carlisle searching for his father, Robert Kincaid.  I thought he had died long ago.  He comes to a quiet little town to rebuild his life while rebuilding an old decrepit house.  Near the Sioux reservation, he listens to an accordion playing tangos, with a single drumbeat.  Usually the Indians use only one drum unless they are in a ceremonial competiton. <br /> <br />The witch Susanna dances naked in the firelight.  He was writing about this kind of fallen woman before wife and daughter departed Texas to go back to Iowa.  He found his Linda, like Greg Macdonald found a young live-in replacement for his wife who returned from the rural area of Tennessee to go back to Boston.  Mid-life crisis is a bore. <br /> <br />The Indian Flute Player, like son Jeff, charms the desert animals around the ceremonial fires.  Carlisle fights city hall (if there be such in the western small towns) and this one is forever changed by one man.  There is a triangle with a waitress in addition to the woman he calls a witch, which makes it decidely uneven.  Carlisle, after all, is college educated, but like all men like to indulge in the lower-class women on occasion. <br /> <br />The Yerkes County War commences, as is my GSA war!  Who will be the winner, the government or the citizen?  He is so poetic and lyrical in the way he phrases things.  I know it is lonely out there in Texas wading branches and fly-fishing but ....\\"to ancietn evenings and distant music\\" ... to the ballads of Madison County.  He never should have left there.	2005-09-05

Greenspan was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for many years and cultivated the money men to influence his thinking. <br />He's called \\"the most powerful man in the world\\" and yet there has always been a sense of mystery which surround his private life. Coming from Washington Heights in New York where he lived wiht his grandparents, to become a power proker of the \\"first Order,\\" he excelled in how to manage money and control economic crises. He was pivotal in America's economic expansion. Now, that he is retiring, the United States of Europe are taking over as the superpower of the wealthy. <br /> <br />Author Justin Martin detaials Greenspan's training as an economist. Using the opinions and knowledge of his peers, Henry Kissinger, Milton Friedman and former U. S. Predsident Gerald Ford, who appointed him to the Federal Reserve. He served under five presidents on the Federal Reserve Board and Chairman. In the photo section, he is shown with former presidents Gore, Clinton, Reagan, Nixon, and Bush, Sr. <br /> <br />Before that heady position, he excelled in academics and music at George Washington High School; in the '43 yearbook, he was listed as taking part in orchestra, dance band, was class president, and labeled as \\"smart as a whip and talented.\\" He was a musician at Julliard, and played clarinet and saxophone as he toured with Henry Jerome's jazz band and in a trio. Learning the strict precision of playing instruments aided him in making complicated decisions as Chief Justice of this august group. <br /> <br />He hobnobbed with the wealthy at the O'Conner parties, including Allen Blumenthal in the mid '50s. Nothing keep him from marrying two beautiful women. Like Prince Charles of England, he had two women in his first marriage, a young beauty and Ann Rand who played a big role in his life. She was his Camilla. An old man never learns, even a smart one -- he married again in 1997 to a 'dead ringer' of his first wife. This time he married up into society. <br /> <br />Just as another super hero of an earlier era, Nathan Bedford Forrest, the greatest Civil War General (according to Robert E. Lee), he was the target of cartoonists (not comics!). In one, he is one of the five \\"enduring national monuments\\" in Washington, D.C. In another, the favorite of Justin Martin's aunt (her contribution to the book), he's shown being \\"tempted\\" by dancing naked women whose large proportions had prominent n....s. holding banners for the dot com groups.  <br /> <br />As a teenager with rolled up jeans, he is talller than his mom, Rose Goldsmith, who held the Bible when he was sworn in as Chairman of Council of Economic Advisers in 1974.  He's shown in the Oval office under the portrait of George Washington (what's more appropriate?) with Bush, Sr. and cronies. <br /> <br />To end with a riddle: How many bankers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? One, Greenspan holds the bulb and the world revolves around him. That's the story of his life. He is certainly an exceptional individual, a marvelous government servant as opposed to the two giving me \\"what-for\\" right now	2005-09-05

Chief Justice Rehnquist was not a quitter, stayed with the high office until his death September 3, 2005, at the age of eighty.  But he was not always fair, either.   He presided over former President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, and concequently over ruled the Florida Supreme Court to appoint Bush as president over Gore.  Gore won that election, had the most votes. <br /> <br />He was appointed to the Supreme Court by then President Nixon in 1982.  That is why he kept Gore out of office, he was Republican!  Reagan elevated him to Chief Justice in 1986.  Some old geezers don't know when to give up.  He would not resign even though he knew he was dying of thyroid cancer.  That is not an easy thing to live through, and I am sorry that he is dead.  However, I will forever feel badly toward him by taking that hard-won election away from Al Gore.  He had no right to do that, no matter how high he was on the Court or what his political inclinations went.  This was a major mistake, and he will be remembered for this indiscretion.  May God have mercy on his soul.	2005-09-05

Eurocentric in the Mediterranean (meaning \\"inner sea\\" in Greek) in the sixth century discovered the human mind.  \\"This discovery was undoubtedly the most fateful of all history...which would one day lead on to Mars.\\"  What Mount Everest and the Moon were to the 20th centruy, Mars will be to the 21st.  John Milton wrote in PARADISE LOST: \\"Their wandering course now high, now low' then hid, Progressive retograde or standing still.\\"  Mercury and Venus are known as the evening and morning stars.   <br /> <br />Mars, on the other hand, uses zig-zagging movements while Jupiter and Saturn are slow creepers across the universe.  Superior planets are those in orbit beyond that of Earth; the Inferior are Mercury and Venus are closer than our to the Sun.  Mars prances with grandeur and grace with its red color (for fire) which makes it stand out.  Mars has a rhythm, a musical harmony, to its flight across the sky. <br /> <br />Mars is the outermost of the inner group and has a substantial orbital distance from the Sun, taking longer than Earth to complete an orbit -- almost two years.  Mars' retrograde \\"loop\\" perplexed ancient astronomers.  Most of the time, it moves eastward; when Earth speeds past on its smaller, shorter orbit and overtakes Mars, it appears to move retrograde (\\"backwards\\") until a distance away and the eastward movement resumes.  Earth knocks it for a loop. <br /> <br />NASA's Mars Exploration Program uses robots to explore the planet, dispatched to sites where water could have been eons ago.  Thick deposits of salt, likely formed when water evaporated from an ancient sea have been found.  There is dry ice at the poles.  Mars has seen ice ages leaving icy polar caps.  Volcanoes have formed deep valleys and large mountain ranges.  They have their own Grand Canyon of enormous size, so vast that it takes up one-sixth of Mars' circumference.  The atmosphere is thin, about one-hundredth of that on Earth. <br /> <br />NASA names prominent landmarks; like the United States postage stamps, the features are not named after living people.  One was named after the former Columbia shuttle commander.  University of Tennessee astronomers who work in conjunction with Cal Tech's Jet Propulsion Lab named a mountain ridge Cumberland Ridge. <br /> <br />Through trials and tribulations, the scientists show strength in the face of criticism and bask in the glories of their successes in this exploration of Mars.  In 1971, the spacecraft Mariner 9 started the deal.  In 1993, there was a failure to reach Mars with the Observer which had a ruptured fuel line.  Four years later, on July 4, 1997, the Pathfinder lander with Sojourner rover made its way to the spot where Viking I lander had explored twenty-one years earlier and sent transmissions for six years back to Earth.  Then came the rover Spirit and Oportunity, robotic explorers to look for samples of rocks, soil and other materials to help us to determine if Mars had indeed been a planet such as ours in many centuries past. <br /> <br />A manned flight is in the not-too-distant future.  In 2007, Mars will be in the Taurus border in the early morning sky, closer to Earth; the United Kingdom will have the best view that winter of 2007 and 2008 around Western Europe.  In November of that year, it will be the brightest object in the late evening sky.  On Christmas Eve, it will be as far north as it can be on the celestial sphere with peak brightness next to a Full Moon.  What a sight!  By February to mid-April, 2008, it will end its spectacular show.  By the end of May, it is muted in the bright sky and, on December 5, 2008, it reaches conjunction beyond the Sun. <br /> <br />Come fly with me to the Heavens and observe all these happenings.  It doesn't take an astronomer or a space ship to enjoy the wonders of the universe.	2005-09-05

It would have been a great day had he stepped out of Clinton's shadow when we learned the truth and not stood by his man. There is such a thing as survival, and Gore was too much of a gentleman to hold Clinton's pecidillios against him. Brought up a Southern Christian, he remembered the Bible teaching that \\"he who is without sin shall cast the first stone.\\"<br /><br />Gore wasn't being exactly tolerant of Clinton's absurd behavior (now we know that Hillary ran the White House, so what did old Bill have to do but 'play around'?), he just distanced himself from the sordid affair and tried to pretend it hadn't happened. That's the Tennessee way. Don't get involved in other's dirty laundry, but keep it clean for yourself. His sqeaky cleanness didn't help even when he tried to act like others and do silly dances in public. That just wasn't the real Gore.<br /><br />Being a private person, as am I, he is introspective and sensitive -- though he didn't show it -- and just not one to turn his back on his 'friends.' Trained by ambitious parents to be a politician, I feel that it would have been better had he been a corporate attorney. Lawyers always exaggerate and fabricate to win their cases, and usually put on a good show. I know, I've worked for some.<br /><br />Chief Justice Rehnquist overruled the Florida Supreme Court to appoint Bush instead of Gore, even though the public had voted him in.  May he roast slowly in hell.  Gore deserved that win but he was too arrogant to come down to the normal Tennessean lifestyle.  He turned his back on us instead of the fallen hero in the White House.  He still acts that way with the press sometimes, so I feel that the job he was prepared for all his life will never accept him.  It takes a dab of humility to be the people's choice.<br /><br />He did go to Viet Nam and that in itself would change an ordinary person profoundly. A V.N. vet told me about the atrocities done to our men out in the field, like the sharpened cane stalks which could gut a person, and the children being used as suicide bombers. Even though Gore wasn't out in the worst of the fighting, he was there, and that matters.<br /><br />Clinton did not serve any military service and almost ruined all of them during his tenure by 'balancing the budget' at their expense. Both Bushes started wars. Gore would have known how to finish it fast to get on with the world's problems. Because of his not being allowed to take the office he won, Europe has formed their own United States and will be the superpower status we could have kept had Gore been able to take over the White House. He and Tipper are an inspiration to all who know them. He worked hard to inform us of the environmental mess we now find ourselves in; he tried to warn us of the calamity we now endure with the changeable weather and its dire consequences.	2005-09-05

In 1608, a \\"spyglass' was invented purportedly by Hans Lipperley, but he couldn't get a Dutch patent, so Galileo is considered the inventor.  This four hundred -year-old instrument changed the way we view the universe.  It helped us to understand our place in the cosmos and the theme of things past and to come.   <br /> <br />It is one of the world's far-reaching inventions.  When I was inquiring of the reference librarian about the new books being released about Mars, Betty said, \\"I think it would be so neat to have a telescope.\\"  I matter-of-factly told her, \\"My son is an astronomer.\\"  She looked at me in awe; after all these years, I was suddenly 'somebody.'  To her, that was much better by far than a silly old movie star.  I promised that when he came to visit, I'd bring him to the library for all to meet.   Alas, he came on Labor Day when the library was closed.  The telescope unlocks the mysteries of the universe to the commoner. <br /> <br />It took a lot of human ingenuity and perserverance to build a working telescope.  Now, they are everywhere.  Jeff worked at Kitt Peak on those huge contraptions as a grad student.  Then, while the Hubble was flawed, he entered the information into the computer for reference so that we could learn how to perform more metictously.  The most famous astronomers mentioned in this book are Isaac Newton, Hohannes Keppler, Cassigrain, and Schmidt.  He left out Burks.  It took a bunch of quirky scientists to make a working telescope and much labor of the heart and mind. <br /> <br />This book is written by an astronomer from Australia in New South Wales.   Well known as a broadcaster and writer ('Astronomy,' 'Sky & Telescope,' 'Sky & Space,' and 'New Scientist'), he was awarded the prestigious David Allen prize for communicating astronomy to the public.  The maps, drawings and pictures help to interpret the complexity of this spyglass 'out of control.'  There are all kinds of telescopes now even those dish kind, radio telescopes,I think they are called.  It is a fascinating book even for the ordinary citizen.	2005-09-05

As we saw in the movie, 'The Brothers Grimm, fairy tales are not about sweetness and light but scary things and the dark side of humanity.  In 1850, the brother were still alive in Vienna where children were abandoned on a steady basis.  Many of the sad stories were about motherless girls who suffer heartache for lact of female guidance, like Madam Bovary, Mary Lennox in 'The Secret Garden,' and Hester Prynne. <br /> <br />There is prevalent in many fairytales the nightmare projection of female fears: an old woman living alone, humpbacked.  The myth of Demeter and Persephone was about the final stage of a woman's life, a spirit in old age.   This book is about women, the metamorphoses at each stage of a woman's life, the changes in biology which propel woman from one level of being to another.  The last stage (old) restores her to the first (young). <br /> <br />There are personal stories in this book about 'Sleeping Beauties' who fell asleep in puberty and awoke ten years later to find themselves married to the wrong man.  That also happens in real life.  After I married an older man, I lost a whole decade, the '60s.   <br /> <br />This books shows the magic of fairtales.  It is a song of praise for life itself.  Myths are falsehoods, complete lies.  There are hidden meanings in beloved stories and what they reveal.  'The Seal Wife' had a demanding husband and a demeaning life.  Wisdom learned from experience in each of the phases women grow through is shown in some of the stories.  In others, it is the opposite.  There is no wisdom.  Choices, demands, and changes a woman must face each day shows recognizable truths about women's lives.   <br /> <br />Some people haven't the ability to articulate for themselves.  In 'The Ash Girl' ('Cinderella') she has the help of turtledoves and pigeons as two guardian doves protect her from the nasty step-sisters.  The pigeons point out the way things are not going well, and the cook chases a goose to prepare for supper.  The pigeons sleep in the gutter as they are now allowed to do their mess on the buildings to corrode the fancy ornamental dogwoods, according to GSA.  Whitt even told me that the excrement from one pigeon, if you touch it and rub your eye, will cause blindness.  How low can you go!? <br /> <br />Your favorite fairy tale conveys a significant something about you, your soul, and your experiences in life.  It shows the public roles each woman must face in her life.  Mine was 'Little Red Riding Hood' as she was concerned about her grandmother enough to follow a scary trail where she encounters a wolf.  Rape is subjecting herself to the man's control.   But innocent Little Red Riding Hood picks flowers on the primrose path where the starveling wolf is hiding.  Children, especially girls, should never talk to strangers.  The conclusion is that the wolf (guess that's why a man sometimes is called a wolf on the make) satisfies both of his appetites: gobbling up little girls and getting them into bed.  The brothers Grimm movie showed the wolf to turn into a tall werewolf (actually the father of the girl) who swallows her whole.  It's strange that the girl screamed for her father rather than her mother, showing the power of the male, but hoped to see her mother again.  So much for fairy tales. <br /> <br />A hawk tore off her cloak.  In Knox, falcons are roaming the downtown skies in search of pigeons and other birds they can consume.  When they finish them off, I guess they will go after human babies and small persons like myself.  All courtesy of GSA.  The women in fairy tales wouldn't have the ending any other way, as they waited too long for what they got.  Maybe, the old adage is true, you get what you deserve.  And, the awful truth of the matter is, fairytales are written for children.	2005-09-05

As a nurse, she found him two years later and spent the next eleven years willing him to live. <br /> <br />The emergency room doctor had told her that fateful day that \\"God must want you for something.\\"  Indeed, He did.  She helped this disabled young child to grow and develop into a human being.  He had celebral palsy and epilipsy, along with other life-threatening illnesses.  There is a person here named David who could have been her Steve. <br /> <br />She adopted him and helped him learn how to cope and get around in this hectic world of ours.  She had an endorsement for this informative and needed book by Patch Adams whose work with all kinds of disability, from physical to mental, as a work of art.  I found a person four years ago dressed as a clown complete with Patch's trademark big red nose who told me that he actually works with Dr. Adams in his travels and work with children.  I wa upset by a scene in the movie, but he told me that was pure Hollywood added to get movie goers, not the truth. <br /> <br />This is a story of miracles of faith, hope and love.  It shows how a group of dedicated professionals work together to accomplish much more than any single individual ever could.  Chrissy has been a nurse for twenty-five years  and is now an expert advocate for human rights.  Stephen's story will inform parents of disabled children and encourage all who go through this kind of stress that it is all worth the effort and strife.   <br /> <br />It is the story of a child's lifelong struggle with serious disabilities; his sweet spirit enrishes all who reads this revealing account in the life of Steve and Crissy.  It can be used as a primer for caregivers of children everywhere.	2005-09-05

Written by a practicing lawyer who was a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago, he has published sever major international bestsellers.  This is another one.  Kindle County, the world of greed and human failing he made immortal in four previous novels, could be Knox County, TN, where corruption in government is rampant and ethics lacking.  All done behind doors away from prying eyes, so that the public won't know what is going on. <br /> <br />This story is about a corrupt lawyer who bribes judges and is apprehended.  He had a purpose to collect the monies because his wife is dying from an illness, such as I am.  He's a successful personal injury attorney, a thriving type of lawsuit these days.  He agrees to conspire with the feds. by wearing a \\"wire\\" in his business of \\"fixing decisions.\\"   <br /> <br />Even though he loves his lovely, dying wife, he has a way with the ladies, as do so many legal people.  I have worked for a few, but won't divulge secrets.  He falls for the FBI female agent assigned to supervise him who has plenty of secrets of her own.  Don't we all!  But, she's lonely, alone and \\"uncomfortable in her skin.\\"  As the net is pulled tighter in the attempts to sucker in others playing this game, the tale evolves into \\"one of enduring love and unexpected heroism.\\"   <br /> <br />This novel has characters who are \\"struggling against all odds\\" in a drama of major proportions.  He's a good writer and expert at writing about aspects of the legal system the normal person would not know.  Personal injuries lawyers usually are crooked, as was Robbie Favor, as so much can be manufactured to get money from insurance companies.  I have my own personal injury but don't know yet what caused it, or who to go after.  It is physical, but also one now causing emotional trauma. <br /> <br />In ALL FOR LOVE, John Dryden wrote \\"Welcome, thous kind deseiver!  Thou best of thieves, who with an easy key dost open life, and unperceived by us, even steals us from ourselves.\\"  Mr. Turow interviewed several Chicago tort lawyers concerning their particular branch of law practice, and learned about technical expertise concerning firearms from his former trial partner.  His using victims of ALS make for a good read.	2005-09-04

After writing many non-fiction, true life stories, Ann Rule's first novel is as scary as any of the real crimes.  It is a tale of \\"psychological suspense\\" coupled with crossed lovers stranded out in the wilderness of the Cascade mountains in Washinton state.  Robert James Waller sings about the Cascades in the song, 'Wabash Cannonball' in his CD, 'The Ballads of Madison County,\\" a marvelous cowboy-singing rendition of ballads and some standards.  I loved 'Golden Apples of the Sun' narration of the poem 'The Song of Wandering Aengus' by W. B. Keats.  No one could do these songs justice, as Waller is not only a marvelous novelist, he is a great roadhouse singer. <br /> <br />Joanne is stranded after a disastrous camping trip with her husband, Danny, who is lost in the savage wilderness.  A tall stranger who said they he is just another camper persuades her to accompany him out of the forest.  He seems to know all the dangers there too well and asks her to trust him totally and he would get her to civilization.  Without him, she has no chance to survive on her own, but her future with him is as unpredictable as the lowering clouds that envelop the mountain.  Shades of Stephen King's DELORES.  She will be his hostage, for for what reason. <br /> <br />This books is an \\"exploration of the dark side of human behavior.\\"  Possession is something we all do to a certain degree.  We possess things, pets, autos, (possessions), but not people.  We can become obsessed with people, even those we don't know.  I have such a person in my life right now and, believe me, it is not pleasant to be pursued by someone of unknown origins and appearance.  Only on the internet is this possible.  Obsession is as bad as possession.  That is by the devil. <br /> <br />Some of the Ann Rule true-crime volumes I have read include YOU BELONG TO ME, IN THE NAME OF LOVE, LAST DANCE, LAST CHANCE, and A RAGE TO KILL among others.  She is the master at this genre, but this novel shows promise to be a good storyteller based on some truth.  Waller's successful BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY was based on truth, but he would not tell me which parts were true and which not.  He has out a new one -- look for it!	2005-09-04

It's always been my belief that whoever catches the wedding bouquet is the next to be married.  Not necessarily so.  Here it symbolizes a hope that love will sail into the life of the person catching it.  At Abby's wedding, her nosegay bouquet gets thrown up into the ceiling fan and is torn apart into four pieces.  They sail far across the throng of husband-hungry women guests and the four chosen by fate to have a piece don't exactly believe in love for themselves, only others.  Love is the last thing they are looking or wishing for; but, who knows where the spirling numbers will fly or where they will land. <br /> <br />Into each life, love of some form does happen.  It may not be the love of your life or the person you could love with all your heart.  Oftimes we have to settle for second best and feel angry and unfulfilled for the rest of our lives.  Sometimes, if fate is good, we will find the real love again before we die, but not usually.  Konnie was a broken hearted widow who had vowed never to love again.  After all, love hurts; and when you lose a loved one by death, it is twice fold.  She didn't think she could ever go through that again.  But fate steps in, and magic occurs. <br /> <br />Geoff is embarrassed when a piece of the bouquet lands in his hand and he quickly gives it to an admiring little girl.  After all, he is the handsomest man at the wedding which is not his, and all glances are his way because of his good looks and charming ways.  The girl who is too small to have a crush on the nice man hands it to her big sister who has loved him from afar for a long time. He has to acquiese since, after all, he did give the magic to her on a platter. <br /> <br />Rosie had baked the wedding cake and a clumsy groomsman, not Geoff, had crushed it to her despair.  It did not damper the love and good wishes in the group of well-wishers for the now wedded couple.  She now has a chance at love, which has eluded her for so long.  She was standing in the right place at the right time.  Lucky Rosie. <br /> <br />Felicity, on the other hand, is the florist who had designed the bouquet of gardenias, babies breath, and white roses and dismayed to see it torn apart and flown to the wind, so to speak.  She is love-worn, watching others get married and she is never the lovely bride.  Is it true that all brides are beautiful?  That's what I was told by Christine when she married my son Geoff.  Felicity finds that she indeed has a chance at love, at last. <br /> <br />Is it true that God can use fragmented flowers to plant seeds of love in 'fallow' hearts?  I have a shirt with the words \\"Come Grow With Me\\" with a blue watering can and tulips with daises.  Another says, \\"Grow Where You Are Planted.\\"   God has a plan for all of us, not to be alone and disspirited by a live without love.  We may not always get the one we love the most, but please don't just love the one you're with.  That is self-defeating.   <br /> <br />This combined book used FLOWERS BY FELICITY by Janet Lee Barton, FLOWERS FOR A FRIEND by Gail Sattler, PETALS OF PROMISE by Diann Hunt, and ROSE IN BLOOM by Sandra Petit -- all combined to make this unusual love story about an unlikely occurrence at any wedding.  Wish it had happened at mine; I had only one person to throw my gardenia to, the bridesmaid, as I had a small wedding.  I lost touch with Colleen, so I don't know whether it worked or not as I had moved far away to Troy, Alabama, for a year after June 4, only to return 40 years later to a strange homeland where no one knows me.  I met a woman on the bus who moved away to Queens, New York, to return and have the same fate -- no one knows or cares about the young you anymore.  It's as if you were in an alien land, and not your hometown. <br /> <br />Fate plays tricks on all of us, whether we want it to or not.  I was sure I would find my first love when I returned.  He had other plans -- never to return, and it simply broke my heart.	2005-09-04

Mind-sets have histories, and the history of genocidal mentality includes struggles with the 20th century emergence of aviation technology, atomic weaponry, and the bomb.  From the American side, that history can be traced in relation to attitudes and policies of the presidential administrations from the time of WWII to the present.  The rhetoric and language of nuclear weapons and the men who use them include harshness and bitterness. <br /> <br />Carol Cohn has pointed out the prominence of male sexual imagery in that rhetoric.  The stress on \\"hardness\\" parallels Nazi practice but has its own additional dimensions.  It can include strategists' pride in \\"hanging tough\\" in the threatening situations, making \\"tough decisions\\" which may entail great human risk.  But there is also the idea of the \\"hardened target,\\" \\"hard data,\\" and a parallel contempt for \\"soft data.\\"  It can be a mixture of the sexual, technical, and obscurantist, as in \\"optimizing penetration dynamics.\\"  The bomb was named \\"Little Boy.\\"  That imagery reached a kind of apotheosis in William Lawrence's equation of the explosion of a hydrogen bom with \\"the first cry of a newborn world.\\"  While this imagery can reflect male appropriateion of the female birth function, its fundamental significance may well lie in the nuclearistic impulse to associate the bomb with a crative capacity and general revitalization. <br /> <br />\\"You can get so good at manipulating words that it almsot feels like the whole thing is under control.\\"  She wrote, \\"the longer I stayed, the more conversations I participated in, the less frightened I was of nuclear war.\\"  Adopting that language, she found herself increasingly unable to express the humane concersn she originally brought with her.  Typical woman in a man's world.  \\"The better I got at engaging in this discourse, the more impossible it became for me to express my own ide3as, my own values.\\"  Men are good are dominating most women in all phases of life by using the sexualapproach. <br /> <br />We have mentioned the relationship between brutalization and numbing, and the silent brutalization that can be associated with weapons of high technology.  Men are good at using the brutalizing tongue-lashing even now.  Concerning the atomic trauma, Edward R. Murrow spoke these words:  \\"Seldom if ever has a war ended leaving the victors with such a sense of uncertainty and fear, with such a realization that the future is obsure and that survival is not assured.\\"  How true he was.  With the weather threats all over the world today, no one is safe. <br /> <br />Concerning the early fear of the power of the first bomb, Ernest Rutherford wrote, \\"Some fool in a laboratory might blow up the universe unawares.\\"  That could have happened right here in Oak Ridge, just a few miles down the road from by hometown; if it had happened in Los Alamos, it would not have been such a great disaster.  But to bring that Manhattan Project to a populated area as Knoxville put all of our lives in great harm and danger.	2005-09-04

Others such as this are A LITTLE MAGIC and FROM THE HEART.  Early in her career, she wrote under the name of J. D. Robb, seventeen with \\"Death\\" in the titles and now REMEMBER WHEN using the old name.  She is most prolific with seven series of three to six novels on a particular topic and/or same characters.  She has twenty-two other novels, two anthologies under the old name and, also available, THE OFFICIAL NORA ROBERTS COMPANION. <br /> <br />In THE WITCHING HOUR, a wizard's spell brings a heroine to the kingdom which has been plagued by tragedy.  She is a lovely woman who must follow her destiny in battle as well as heart in love.  Even the gods can't save this place until the 'lady' arrives on the scene in Twylia.  This reads more like science fiction with the strange fantasy names.  Sometimes, fate is deceiving with its promises of better things to come.  Our fates are decided by a higher power, no matter how we may strive to change it.  We are here for a purpose, for a certain time, and when that is reached, we are needed no more.  \\"We'll be happy.\\"  \\"Yes, until the end of days.\\"  It's just a fairytale to have eternal life. <br /> <br />In WINTER ROSE, Deirdre wearing a red cloak, thinks \\"Men are such odd creatures\\" as she discovers a young wounded soldier lying out in the eternal winter.  He had fought three enemy soldiers and lay bleeding in the snow, which saved him as his strength waned.  He'd give half a kingdom to spend the last hour of his life by a fire's light and heat, he thought.  He reached up to her red hood and realized that she was real and not a rose at all.  The young queen's magic healed his wounds,and he warms her heart with the joys of true love.  Now, that is what I call fate, to almost die and then find someone you can love until the end of time. <br /> <br />IN A WORLD APART is so like THE GIRL OF HIS DREAMS by Stephen Donaldson, which takes place in Medieval times only this time the Demon Slayer is the female and the 20th Century New Yorker is male. She finds a strange new world in America as did the woman librarian of the Donaldson book when she was transported back to Europe during Medieval times, where things were primitive and 'hard.'  These are romances in the vein of Rosemary Rogers with passion, desire and much lovemaking. <br /> <br />Nora Roberts also wrote a similar title LITTLE FATE, A 12-COPY FLOOR.  Magic and love abounds in her stories.  They are great for young housewives whose lives have lost that loving feeling.	2005-09-04

The cover is simply fantastic, Elizabeth Taylor's necklace on a young woman with painted lips and white gown with white fun framing the necklace of emeralds and diamonds.  The novel's characters including the illustrator Colin Beaumont are totally fictional.  But I find that uusually a debut novel is based on real people only false names.    He is a fashion designer himself and takes the reader behind the scenes of New York and Paris into the real world of fashion.  From the wild '60s to the sexy '70s, these three women ruled the world of fashion in Harold Cartlon's world, and fashion ruled them.  In the time of Twiggy (slim as a twig), Richard Avedon and Dr. Feelgood (who ruined Eddie Fisher's voice with his drugs), he weaves a canvas of free love, passion ambition and betrayal.  Just today, I stopped and asked a painter with wet paint doing a street scene why he has chosen that particular spot and building.  He admitted that the pink-marble post office would be a better subject.  But he could show old architecture (however, it is not very old) and the new back in the background so that the various styles would shine.  To each his own, I say.    Coral was an unscrupulous editor-in-chief of 'Divine, a fashion magazine, who ruins her daughter, Mia's chances for love.  She is jealous of her own daughter's success in the world of fashion.  Many today will wear brand names (labels) and pay plenty to look casual.  To them, fashion is comfort at the expense of looking great.    Mia was raised in the sophisticated high fashion but her style and designs make her the scapegoat of the person who should love her the most.  Mackenzie uses the shock appeal, but is sexy in a vague sort of way, always yearning for what she can never have.  She is too intent in making it big in the fashion world so that she abandons friendships and loyalty to those who helped her along the way.  For these three variously different fashion experts, nothing will stop them from fulfilling their visionof fashion with a capital F.    Too often, we label people by what they wear.  This is sometimes a good thing, as on a job intreview or dressed properly for the business world (not sexy apparel), but today's styles for the average woman is for the young to wear underwear out in public.  I've always heard that women dress that way (but not this blatantly before) in times of war.  The young men are gone to serve their country, so the women left behind have to lure men who are not their own and will use any wile to do so.  To see these people wearly such sparse outer garments with nothing on underneath is embarrassing and disgusting.  They are just asking for trouble (that's not the word they would use), as the men even look away.  It's okay in the bedroom with your own mate, but some restraint needs to take place at the malls, walking on the sidewalks of town, especially in bars at night.  They don't plan to go home alone.  Now, is that Godly, or (as Mr. Whitt would say) 'Christian?'    The fashion world is for the rich and they dress as they please to outdo the others at the parties and banquets.  Even in this little ugly, backward town where I live.	2005-09-04

Published by Zebra books, this is \\"a dramatic tale full of emotion\\" and adventure, mystery and suspense.  Lily Harper is not \\"like a lily in bloom\\" as in the Leigh Hunt poem, but a determined mountaineer who ventures into the river country of the deep South to restore an old Natchez Mississippi house (plantation, they were called in the Civil War days).  She builds for herself not only the antebellum home she's always wanted but a life she never would have expected.<br /><br />She finds the man she has always loved, Matt, who disappears without a trace.  Leaving her dream home behind, she \\"embarks on a dangerous journey into unfamiliar territory (having moved from the state of Wyoming), to make sure that Matt has not been a victim of foul play.

He was one of the top Army Generals ever, almost as good as my hero, MacArthur.  Patton had a fiery personality to fit his personna as a legendary warrior.  He was adored by many as the brilliant stratagist he turned out to be, but loathed by some for his dictatorial manner.  There was a movie made about his life.  He might have been pictured as being a harsh taskmaster but, hey! that's what war is.  But not in civilian life toward an old woman, McCrum; this is his personal and candid account of his activities during WWII taken from his diaries.    This series of books was about 'a world on fire.'  Many are eyewitness accounts by the men who fought in a global conflict.  These are the brave men and their gallantry, moving sagas of survital and stark tragedies of untimely death.    Wasn't it Patton who termed the phrase, \\"War is Hell\\"?  On July 28, 1944, General Patton over the Third Army assisted the First Army to drive back the enemy in France.  By the end of August, the Germans were on the run.  Patton wanted to make a rapid advance to cut off the enemy but SHAEF did not concur.  Bradley was very sympathetic.  All gasoline supplies and ammunition went to the First Army leaving Patton's Third Army with no gas and they were stuck with no way to proceed.  He was heartbroken.  His own words: \\"It was my opinion that this was the momentous error of the war.\\"    There are many ways to think about war, even that in Viet Nam where Whitt was one of the elite Rangers.  To comprehend ourselves, \\"we must know the people we once fought against.\\"  Fighting in WWII was the final experience for fifty million soldiers, all heroic men.  We must understand our past as an honor to those dead who can no longer choose.  They exchanged their lives in a hope for this future that we now inhabit, though hardly peaceful.  I know one thing, not a one of thos soldiers would have treated me as harshly without seeing me in person as that dictor McCrum did on the phone.  Though the fight took place many years ago, each of us remains as a living part of it.  I was just a baby, but I am of the Scots-Irish heritage and we are fighters for good causes, not just in war times.	2005-09-04

In his prime, Joseph Greenstein was the world's \\"strongest man\\" physically and billed as 'The Modern Hercules,' 'The Young Sandow,\\" and 'The Ancient Samson' all in one -- The Mighty Atom, though he never did fly out of a canon.  He rose from the ghettos of Poland, in Eastern Europe, to become the most famous of the weightlifter-strongmen ever. <br /> <br />He was a slim 5'4\\" body builder, weighing in at 145 pounds; the photo shows him as a young man showing off his becepts.  In vaudeville at the Apollo Theatre he was billed as Joseph Green.  He looked like a freak in bushy hair and Tarzan outfits complete with matching headband and funny looling shoes which strapped up his leg to the knee. That must have been the style in 1909.  In his act, he straightened out hourshoes, crushed spikes in his hands, even had strong teeth -- bit through iron bars.   <br /> <br />He used Asian techniques of concentration, Jewish mystical writings, and a natural begetarian diet.  Who said it akes eating meat to make one strong?  He later developed a more balanced body physique.  Joseph appeared on Coney Island, the playground of the world, as shown in the movie, 'Inside Daisy Clover.'  At Madison Square Garden he put on a martial arts show. <br /> <br />We all have an inner strength with the potential of a brick-wall.  It doesn't take meditation to surpass hurdles, but a strong-as-iron determination to prove you're right.  When I started out in PTA as a young mother, 5'l\\", 97 lbs., as a local unit president, I was given the honor and silver platter from the female school principal who called me a \\"brick-wall.\\"  Unlike those who preceded me, I did not acquiese to her rein over fund-raising profits.  We paid for necessary items such as a paved area and playgfround at the school but would not finance building repairs -- that was the responsibility of the school board.  I learned my speaking ability by appearing before them (and getting my way through friendly persuasion) on occasion, andconducting the PTA Meetings.  As Regional Director, I visited and informed units throughout thirteen counties, which included the famous Tullahoma, Tennessee -- near Lynchburg. <br /> <br />Joseph was such a sensation that articles about him appeared in 'The Sun,' 'New York Journal,' 'New York American,' 'New York Telegram,' and 'New York Post,' as well as 'Buffalo Evening Times.'  He proved that sometimes little is big and here's great strength in small packages. <br /> <br />Finally acknowledging his Jewish heritage, in 1978, he appeared with his protege, Slim Farman (who towered over him), in a black tunic with a Star of David over the chest.  He was an old man, age 85, with white hair, beard, and mustache.  He had achieved \\"the impossible.\\"	2005-09-03

The author went to med school and has worked as a pathologist for twenty years.  Basing his novels on his second career as a consultant histopathologist, he manufactures the gory deaths of various victims in an unusal manner. <br /> <br />\\"It's just one of those tedious academic things that professors have to do.\\"  He is interrupted in an intimate situation with a chestnut-skinned partner to go out to assist in another of the murders where the dead has been eviscerated.  The police home in on a pair of twins who work in a mortuary, autistic Melkior and his brother Martin. <br /> <br />Melkior is put in prison after the first five murders and is dying as a result of being so mistreated.  Autistic people cannot reason as we do.  Then a different but similar murder takes place and the police change their collective minds to place blame for all of the murders on Martin.  He is let go for a technicality.  \\"So often in crime it seemed that there was no proof either way, and it came down to a question of balance of probabilities.\\"   <br /> <br />What the jury did not know is that Martin always used a double hitch knot at the end of a suture while his autistic brother used only a single hitch.  The first five for which Mwlkior was incarcerated had the double.  Sometimes the final analysis is overlooked, as in my health (what causes internal bleeding).	2005-09-03

God works in mysterious ways but not as mysterious as those of the internet or radio, as you can't see the person behind the voice and email.  I wish you could see the beautiful stained glass window on the cover of this library book.  It is fantastic.  The apostle Paul (formerly called Saul) constanly felt that he was 'weak' and called out to God for guidance.  \\"My strength is shown forth in your weakness.\\"  In the methodist church, a preacher called Paul Allen took most of his sermons from Paul's teachings.  At a local 'big business' baptist church, he senior pastor Sauer used Paul to prove that the Methodist are deal wrong, but used his teachings instead of those of John the Baptist, as a ranting, out-of-contaol diatribute against the methodists. <br /> <br />Joseph Greer was a dynamic Catholic priest in Massachusetts who often confessed that he, too, felt 'weak.'  His was not a weakness of faith or spirit.  His body, at the age of 55, was rife with cancer.  In his position as parish priest, no problem was too small for his attention and intervention, such as as a parking-lot dispute.  A noise problem and ugly artificial owls GSA has over this town is an eyesore and ear-sore, and yet it is too minor to deal with, a \\"harassment\\" charge from the director in Nashville who doesn't have to endure the noise pollution he is emiting over this town. <br /> <br />Ordained at the age of 25, his grave illness thirty years later made him spiritually deeper and more intent on serving his parish will all his strength and ability.  Even with a bone marrow transplant, his cancer returned.  He has to face his own death, as am I, with suffering, humility, and the power of love -- instead of hate.  He was an inspiration to all who knew him. <br /> <br />The author was a visiting writer at the University of Pittsburgh when he wrote this book.  Others include THE GOOD ENOUGH CATHOLIC, COMPANIONS ALONG THE WAY, SIX AMERICAN FAMILIES, and A YEAR IN THE LIFE OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY.	2005-09-03

He's called \\"the most powerful man in the world\\" and yet there has always been a sense of mystery which surround his private life. Coming from Washington Heights in New York where he lived wiht his grandparents, to become a power broker of the \\"first Order,\\" he excelled in how to manage money and control economic crises. He was pivotal in America's economic expansion. Now, that he is retiring, the United States of Europe are taking over as the superpower of the wealthy. <br /> <br />We find outabout Greenspan's training as an economist. Using the opinions and knowledge of his peers, Henry Kissinger, Milton Friedman and former U. S. Predsident Gerald Ford, who appointed him to the Federal Reserve. He served under five presidents on the Federal Reserve Board and Chairman. In the photo section, he is shown with former presidents Gore, Clinton, Reagan, Nixon, and Bush, Sr. <br /> <br />Before that heady position, he excelled in academics and music at George Washington High School; in the '43 yearbook, he was listed as taking part in orchestra, dance band, was class president, and labeled as \\"smart as a whip and talented.\\" He was a musician at Julliard, and played clarinet and saxophone as he toured with Henry Jerome's jazz band and in a trio (photo). <br /> <br />He hobnobbed with the wealthy at the O'Conner parties, including Allen Blumenthal in the mid '50s. Back in 1955, he looked a lot like Estes Keaufaur with the horn-rimmed glasses. That didn't keep him from marrying two beautiful women. Like Prince Charles of England, he had two women in his first marriage, a young beauty and Ann Rand who played a big role in his life. An old man never learns, even a smart one -- he married again in 1997 to a 'dead ringer' of his first wife. This time he married up into society. <br /> <br />Just as another super hero of an earlier era, Nathan Bedford Forrest, the greatest Civil War General (according to Robert E. Lee), he was the target of cartoonists (not comics!). In one, he is one of the five \\"enduring national monuments\\" in Washington, D.C.  <br /> <br />As a teenager with rolled up jeans, he is talller than his mom, Rose Goldsmith, who held the Bible when he was sworn in as Chairman of Council of Economic Advisers in 1974. There he looks like Norman Lynch. Now, he looks more like Larry King. One picture in the photo section tells a story of its own; he's shown in the Oval office under the portrait of George Washington (what's more appropriate?) with Bush, Sr. and cronies. <br /> <br />To end with a riddle: How many central bankers does it take to replace a lightbulb? Only one -- Greenspan holds the bulb and the world revolves around him. That's the story of his life. He is certainly an exceptional individual, a marvelous government servant as opposed to the two giving me \\"what-for\\" right now.	2005-09-03

In 1857, Rose was described by a jealous Northern woman as \\"she looked fity or seventy.\\"  That's me sometimes.  She was on trial in San Francisco where her husband was a lawyer.  She might have passed for thirty-five.  She was asked \\"How old are you?\\"  She answered with dignified finality -- \\"Of sufficient age to testify.\\"  She was the Ethel Rosenberg of the Civil War on the Southern side, of course.    Her Oriental Hotel on Market Street was a noted gathering place for the Southerners.  Among the generals she met there were Johnston, Sherman, Scott and McDowell.  Some of their graves are includedat at Shiloh in southwest Tennessee.  There in San Francisco, there were polka cotillions and the Southerners lived akin to the way they did in Washington, D.C.  She made trips back and forth, carrying messages, and became known as a Confederate spy.   She was ambitious and wend a bit wild after the death of her husband in a tragic accident.  She found her Waterloo on the ocean.    Seven years later, in 1864, she looked years younger in looks as she sailed on the Condor from England to the Confederate States.  Rose had often said she would glady die for the Confederacy, and she drown in the ship wreck in a storm.  Ishbel Ross was no kin to my buddy, William Charles Ross who was in Knoxville from 1956-62.  He was a vast influence on my life.  Ross wrote biographies about many famous people, so I am surprised to see REBEL ROSE as one of them.	2005-09-02

Today's historical books use poetic licence, meaning it is not the facts, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I've been meaning to get around to this book for a long time, but it took the movie, 'The Great Raid' to cause me to put this as priority.<br /><br />I previously reviewed GHOST SOLDIERS on which the movie was made, and done well. It was so realistic that I had to cry (and I don't cry easily) because of the ferocity and lact of humanity the enemy showed. It was the same in WWI only our soldiers were not equipped to fight anyone that animalistic. I see now why Tennessean Alvin York went berserk and killed so many of the approaching enemy in this war, as he was cornered and was fighting for his life.<br /><br />It's not always war where you have to defend you right to live in freedom. I had to use my elbows to get out of a difficult situation which I found myself in this past month. As in WWII, the enemy set out to engage and reduce the other side. This war engulfed Europe in 1914 and we came to their aid; now, in 2005, more than ninety years later, Europe has surpassed U.S.A. as the superpower of the world calling themselves the United State of Europe. Copycats! We should not jump the gun so quickly when the ally you fight for strives to surpass you in everyway. We thought we were helping England against Germany. Well, at least the Confederates who 'lost' the American Civil War took the cause of Britain and France, while the American Yankees took the side of Germany. It was another Civil War only on foreign ground this time. My favorite historian wrote that Lincoln didn't ask for or accept a surrender from the Rebels as that would be acknowledging that the Confederacy had been a sovereing nation and not \\"just a feverish mob,\\" as Sam Houston is credited as saying. I have trouble believing a Tennessee governor would stoop to such stupidity.<br /><br />The machine gun, poison gas, trench warfare and the airplane were used first in this war to beat all wars. \\"As President Teddy Roosevelt rallied the diverse ethnic groups of the nothern state (where he originated from) -- Italians, Mormons, Jews, and Irish -- Confederate President Woodrow Wilson struggled to hold together a nation still beset by ignorance, prejudice, and class divisions.\\" The United States still has all of the listed attributes, especially two professors from other states who tore down one of the Southern Civil War heros with a book full of lies and no truth. That shows ignorance and prejudice is alive and well as the Northerners are still considering Tennessee a hillbilly state and everyone in it \\"white trash.\\"<br /><br />As in WWII, the aim was \\"don't surrender,\\" and \\"never give up whatever the situation.\\" The Americans were bound to give no information to the enemy when captured except name, rank, and serial number. when captured except name, rank, and serial number. There is a government employee here named Whitt who is proud he went through \\"Ranger\\" school and, now sixty, is still using the war tactics he learned there to bully anyone who has a difference of opinion. Sometimes, in severe times of conflict, the soldiers and their leaders had to crawl like a snake to survive. Planes had a pivotal role in rescuing the POWs in the Phillippines and their flying low over the camp was the signal for the troops to move into position for the night maneuvers. It's true that war is hell; and nothing is really accomplished. When you defeat one dictator or generalisimo, there is another to take his place to start another war.<br /><br />Houston went on to the Alamo after fighting at San Joquinto to meet his fate.

Management is worse as the race is for higher stakes and the bakc-biters and back-stabbers are after the job of their superior. I was told of a local incident concerning KAT but not local folks, so nobody cared -- except the manager who was maneuvered out of his job by an underling. The person who took his place worked behind his back to get Mr. Lett fired. Anybody can get fired but, usually, not the bad, devious people and they are kept to pester the customers or, in our situation, the riders of the buses. There are no ethics in the job place anymore. <br /> <br />I tried selling a few times, but this book shows how to get your competition fired. In my first instance, an experienced sales person for Lerner's, full time and well-trained to sell hose to everyone who entered the doors. I, a high school student with no mother, had no idea how to buy hose for myself and went fare legged that winter. When the Jewish manager called me to his office to compare my \\"zero\\" hose sales with hers while I was only parttime, on Monday nights and Saturdays, I didn't get fired. I quit and went down the block to Kress 5 & 10 where I sold a lot of Christmas items, as I was a pretty salesgirl, just inexperienced. <br /> <br />Randy Schwantz proposes \\"busting the relationship and opening the door for you.\\" When I tried to sell World Books to people I knew, my manager would obtain the names of my prospects and offer them a better deal by selling encyclopedias she had \\"earned\\" (not paid for) for a lesser price. I was able to sell enough to \\"earn\\" a set for my children because of many in that town would not buy from her because of her unethical salesmanship and management. A manager should never 'sell over the heads' of her representatives as she gets a commission on what they sell, too. Needless to say, I did not stick with it. <br /> <br />He talks much about \\"wedges.\\" Use a \\"white flag\\" approach saying, \\"What would you like me to do?\\"I was hired for an office job because I put \\"networking\\" as one of my past experiences in sales. I called the Regional office so as to help someone there buy a set from someone else after I had exited the business. This is the garden-variety sales call. The office job didn't last long as the New York owner of the factory just used me to get rid of a bad bookkeeper; her revenge was showing me the wrong way to have the salary checks printed on the computer. She was of a different race, and dispensable. <br /> <br />More than concepts, those in this book are no-nonsense tactics to get rid of competitors in the sales world. Someone I know who is tops in his field told me that he'd been fired; once, he said, he was the first to go. This seems like a bad thing to do. But in perspective it was the right move at the right time. <br /> <br />Read this to learn how not to be fired in this way. I've never been able to get anyone fired; there is no job security anymore no matter how educated or trained you are. Everyone has a boss, and everyone can be replaced. Being prepared for something like this to be tried on you is better than job hunting in a desperate state. He has previously written BREAKING THE SALES BARRIER and other books in this vein.  <br />	2005-09-02

Some people consider WWI as the \\"Great War\\" and, I'm sure, that those of who fought were correct at the time.  This is an 'alternate' history of this war, meaning it is not the facts, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  I've been meaning to get around to this book for a long time, but it took the movie, 'The Great Raid' to cause me to put this as priority. <br /> <br />I previously reviewed GHOST SOLDIERS on which the movie was made, and done well.  It was so realistic that I had to cry (and I don't cry easily) because of the ferocity and lact of humanity the enemy showed.  It was the same in WWI only our soldiers were not equipped to fight anyone that animalistic.  I see now why Tennessean Alvin York went berserk and killed so many of the approaching enemy in this war, as he was cornered and was fighting for his life. <br /> <br />It's not always war where you have to defend you right to live in freedom.  I had to use my elbows to get out of a difficult situation which I found myself in this past month.   As in WWII, the enemy set out to engage and reduce the other side.  This war engulfed Europe in 1914 and we came to their aid; now, in 2005, more than ninety years later, Europe has surpassed U.S.A. as the superpower of the world calling themselves the United State of Europe.  Copycats!  We should not jump the gun so quickly when the ally you fight for strives to surpass you in everyway.  We thought we were helping England against Germany.  Well, at least the Confederates who 'lost' the American Civil War took the cause of Britain and France, while the American Yankees took the side of Germany.  It was another Civil War only on foreign ground this time. <br /> <br />The machine gun, poison gas, trench warfare and the airplane were used first in this war to beat all wars.  \\"As President Teddy Roosevelt rallied the diverse ethnic groups of the nothern state (where he originated from) -- Italians, Mormons, Jews, and Irish -- Confederate President Woodrow Wilson struggled to hold together a nation still beset by ignorance, prejudice, and class divisions.\\"  The United States still has all of the listed attributes, especially two professors from other states who tore down one of the Southern Civil War heros with a book full of lies and no truth.

He has a vast array of war books in his repetroie such as THE GUNS OF THE SOUTH, DAYS OF INFAMY (that was in one of Gen.

What a fascinating book written by an American and, if not for a certain friend, I would not have chosen it to review.  The unified Europe now has more of everything, except people, than the United States of America.    More wealth, trade, and votes on every international body, it is becoming a superpower in its intriguing way to surpass the mundane America, now full of immigrants.  Forewarned is forearmed; do you know why they have all the free 'perks' such as free health care and free college education?  It's because Americans are paying their military bills.  How can that be -- when folks are starving here?    They are a welfare state, living big now on our larguesse.  In Tennessee, where I live, the governor dissolved the state's health care program and everyone qualified for Medicaid (Our national welfare \\"social\\" program) can get only five script medicines per month.  A lot of us will die, a plea to the globe-trotting, wealthy governor falls on deaf ears.  He'd be right at home in Europe.  Now, I see why Victor Ashe was so eager to be United States of America diplomat in Poland.  He's always led a good, rich life.    Europeans are enjoying their good fortune now, but time changes and their time for a fall will come.  It is a welfare state and yet has 40% of the world's wealth.  Eurocrats are everywhere; \\"we do things differently here\\" and yet the taxes are huge, prices high to pay for those aforesaid social services.  While the rest of the world suffers, they live the high life for a change.  What is being taken away from us in Tennessee is free for all there.  Let's move to Europe!    This is Churchill's \\"dream\\"!  Finally!  There are forty-three European countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus, Britain, Ireland, along with the former Yugoslav republic comprise most of the land mass of Europe.  There are small quasi-independent states like the Vatican City (900 occupants), Andorra (175 sq. miles, population 5,000) in the Pyrenees, Alps (Switzerland and Austria), Monaco (population 27,000).  They make money from tourism, coins and stamps for collectors all over the world.  Who knew that Jeff and I added to their wealth by stamp collecting?  Sorry, no money for traveling.  I'd love to see Barcelona, have wanted to for almost fifty years.    Where is Carlos Ubach when I need him, Sabadell, Spain, or gone off to the Great Beyond.  God only knows what I'd be without you.  Many American products have been taken over by the Euroasians; many of the brands have been moved there such as Kentucky Bourbon (we have Jack Daniel's Whiskey in Tennessee).      From Ireland down the coast to Russia, Europe stretches across half the planet from the Pacific to the Atlantic, 6% of earth's total area and home to 12% of global population.  Simplicity, complex, redundant, simplification, \\"common sense\\" (?) Not from the example of Eurasian I am familiar with -- critical, hyfaluting, stiff-necked, hard-headed, unrelenting.  I predict the new governmental system will fail.  Then we will have to rebuild that they are not smart enough to construct.	2005-09-01

Yankee Doodle, doodle doo,  Yankee Doodle dandy,  Aand so to keep his courage up,  He took a drink of brandy.    He was the best Confederate general of the entire Civil War, according to his superior.  Born in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, into a well-to-do family, he was a Southerner born and bred for greatness.  After the war, he had ties in Memphis, (a world away from the values and customs of Middle Tennessee) where a park including a statue of him is in existence.  There is an unusual statue of him outside Nashville on I65; look for the Confederates flags and you'll marvel at this site created and paid for by a prominent lawyer.  This slanderous book (all Myths) was devised by two UTK English professors with false information from Memphis sources.    I can't fanthom why this review was not listed on my site.  It is a sore spot for me as I personally told one of the writers that what they had researched is not true.  After the book was printed anyway, I told the other one on the phone the same thing.  He said the nasty part about Fort Pillow which they based their myth on was in Memphis documentation.  That does not make it right or true.  None of us at the meeting had heard about what happened at that place, and yet they based a slander about what might not have happened.	2005-09-01

The personal account I gave of my son's rebellion might have helped some other mother deal with a similar problem.  Oh well.    Codependency is loving and sharing your life with someone who is an alcoholic.  It can be for other reasons as I pointed out in the other review. Codependents think and feel responsible for other people, especially their children, for their feelings, hurts wants, needs, well-being, and ultimate destiny.    Most of us started doing these things to help others in need out of necessity to protect ourselves and meet out needs.  \\"We performed, felt, and thought these things to survive -- emotionally, mentally, and sometimes physically.\\"  Sometimes, the things we do to protect ourselves turn on us and hurt us as a result of who the person is -- if he is a loved one.  Many professionals say that the first step toward change is awareness.  Detachment is the hardest thing you will ever do, as you feel the other person will drown in his distress and destroy his life without you there to guide him.  Instead, it is your life which becomes destroyed as it was at that time.  But, as in every othre aspect in life, we must \\"move on\\" and 'get over it.'    Her other books are helpful and I have read some of the others when I was going through my co-dependency relationship.  I don't recall whether they really helped or not because, when you are in that kind of impossible quandry you just have to work it out for yourself.  Florence Cheatham with her admission of the alcoholic husband and how it had been to live with him for so many years, and others for standing by to tell me that my life was not over, aided more than any book.  It is life's experiences which teach us how to tolerate pain for 26 years (always complaining, always seeking medical care to alleviate some of it), but the end result canbe disastrous.  And mine was.    Living in hell on earth is worth than dying.  A part of you does die as you suffer remorse for what could have been, but other nasty people decide to pick on you and cause trouble.  God will get them one way or another.   She has written many books including BEYOND CODEPENDENCY and THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO.	2005-08-31

The Civil War was not politically a 'bipartisan' war in anything like the sense what would be true of the two world wars.  It was required to be waged as a party war.  The Republicans became Union to throw people off.  Theoretically, it was a Republican victory.  It is legend that the ruthless quality of Southern reconstruction was the outgrowth of hatreds carried over from wartime and prolonged.  The Northerners did not know how to manage their 'great victory' over the South; thus, it was a disastrophe -- to say the least.  There was a conspiracy to take over and turn the white Southerners into slaves!  Slaves of conscience, slaves to sin, not to Christ.<br /><br />Andrew Johnson was not exactly a Tennessean but we claim his as one of our own.  The Andrew Johnson Hotel on the River here was the tallest building and certainly glamorous (still is inside); that is the place where Hank Williams, Sr., died when his chauffeur stopped there to let him 'dry out.'  Johnson had an impossible duty to the country to fulfill and he performed badly.  Like the other Johnson president some hundred years later, who ascended to the presidency the same way he did ([...] of the real president, Lincoln, Kennedy) also from the South, they chose the wrong programs to push through the public: civil rights.  Both ended disastrously.<br /><br />This 17th president, now two and a half centuries since his time, has his reputation rehabilitated a bit.  He changed parties and, thus, the Democratic nation was founded.  Read STORY OF THE COPPERHEADS, THE HIDDEN CIVIL WAR by Gray Wood.<br /><br />Johnson was almost impeached, but that's nothing special; if you're from the South, the Northerners automatically try to bring the important person down to their size.  Why is it that so many of them moved South?  We are inundated with those harsh-speaking 'know-it-all's who want to change us.  If we are so bad in the South, I can't understand why they came here in the first place.  Another Southern president, Clinton, was almost impeached.  Richard Nixon, from California, was almost impeached.  Blount was, too, when he was Tennessee's Governor.  But impeachment never happens.

He finds the perfect woman but denies his love for her at first.  It took him awhile to begin what to say to her, not knowing that she felt the same way he did.  But he feels that some good would come of doing the right thing.<br /><br />She, too, was having some doubts but admitted: \\"All I could think about was him.\\"  She thinks that she has to trust in something stronger than herself but declares that \\"my future isn't in your hands.\\"  He had been so cruelly abused in prison, how could they still believe in God.  Some things you take on faith but, at instances such as theirs, it might need a little miracle.<br /><br />He is freed by general amnesty but is killed by the masters and by the servants, by the \\"violent and by the indifferent.\\"  This was a book about loneliness of the individual who refuses to \\"be catalogued or categorized by ideologies, societies or power.\\"<br /><br />The author wrote THE USELESS SEX, THE EGOTISTS, IF THE SUN DIES, and LETTERS TO A CHILD NEVER BORN.  This A MAN was a great success in Europe and she was awarded the Premio Viareggio and the Premio Nazionale in Italy.  It was well received in America as well.

From its earliest days, the State of Israel had earned a reputation for success in the field of espionage and covert action.  They declared their independence in May, 1948 commanded by Ben-Gurion.  There was a major motion picture made about this creation and Pat Boone, a singer from Tennessee, composed and sang the title song.      This book names the key figures and dates from 1948-1998.  After 1989, the names of the directors of the Mossad and directors of Shin Bet are forbidden by Israeli law to be disclosed.    The structure of Israeli Intelligence starts with The Cabinet (major authority) to the Prime MInister, Inspector-General on down to the commandos (sayeret).  \\"The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 'Send men that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel.\\"  We also learn in the Bible that \\"the wages of sin are death.\\"    Hussein ordered an invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Augiust 2, 1990.  This caused chaos everywhere.  It was an instant reminder of a simple fact: \\"surprises cause crisis.\\"  They had to turn to the Israeli Intelligence for a way to challenge this transaction.

This book contains the twenty-six front page articles of Malcolm Johnson printed in 'The New York Sun' in 1947 and '48.  Budd Schulberg wrote the introduction and added some articles of his own.  He had previously written THE DISENCHANTED. <br /> <br />Mainly, though, it is almost totally Malcolm Johnson, a reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1949 for these articles which shook the United States as he exposed organized crime on the New York waterfront.  This was the basis of the movie 'On The Watrefront' starring Marlon Brando.    This exposure led to the Tennessee Senator Kefauver hearings and changed labor laws which influenced America.  D. A. Thomas Dewey led the charge and Budd Schulberg followed through by producing the award-winning movie directed by Elia Kazan.  It won five Oscars including best picture, best director and best actor.  It is one of the Top Ten films of the century. <br /> <br />The articles and resulting movie reveals to the world how organized crime had infiltrated the New York Harbor, the world's busiest port. The '40s photo looking down on New York City shows hundreds of piers at the height of the waterfront's extent and power.  The interconnnected piers were the richest in the world. <br /> <br />This book shows America and New York at the pivotal time when shipping ruled the world.  Back then, \\"money was more important than life itself.\\"  It still is sometimes and some places.  Corruption and violence on the waterfront were commonplace, as they were on the street of New York ('The West Side Story').

This book was written when Johnny Cash reached his 65th birthday.  It was a miracle he was still alive as he had abused his body with drugs and had a very hard life.  He gives a geneology of the Cash family.  His great-grandfather, Reuben, fought for the Confederacy in the American Civil War, and lost his Georgia plantation; subsequently he moved his family to Arkansas.  His grandfathers's life was a lot like my paternal grandfather.  His father's was something like my dad's railroad life.    The Man in Black was asked if he was \\"going to a funeral\\" when because he started to wear black outfits when he performed, going back to 1954, was called a troubadour, an English balladeer, like Merle Haggard.  His theme song was 'I Walk The Line,' and he sang many styles in many genres.  In the '70s, his career had reached international proportions.    The first J.C. recording I remember liking was 'A Boy Called Sue' and I did love the song 'Shifting, Whispering Sands,' which he also recorded.  In 1976, he had a #1 'One Piece At A Time' -- I am wondering if that is the one about putting together a car out of junk parts.  His first single recording (not an album) was in 1955.  I was told in 2002 that he had made a good recording of 'The Long Black Veil,' one of my favorite ballads.  I found it on a Cash CD, taped that song several times and gave the CD to the person who alerted me as to its existence.  There is a new movie coming out soon about his life in which he sings 'Ring of Fire.'    In 1982, he made an album produced by Rodney Crowell, one of my favorite non-stars.  I had a tape of some of his road songs, and I loved them all; then, foolishly, I sent it to someone I thought might enjoy it.  I wish I had been selfish and kept it.    He was a reader:   THE ROBE, QUO VADIS, THE SILVER CHALICE, and PILLAR OF IRON influenced him to go to Israel in November, 1971, to make a movie.  It was a semi-documentary and it was magical to film on Mount Arabel, overlooking Galilee and inthe Church of Beatitudes.    He tells of a near-death experience after his bypass surgery in 1988, the \\"essence\\" of light as he drifted off but the doctors in Nashville worked diligently to save him.  He says he was restored to his \\"senses.\\"  \\"I never forgot that light, and it changed me.\\"  Life meant more to him, became very moving just to look at mundane, everyday things.    He felt he'd come \\"full circle\\" at a festival in England, back to the \\"bare bones.\\" pre-stardom, pre-Memphis (SUN records) days.  He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Florence, Alabama, and the Songwriters' Hall of Fame.  He always appeared to be the bad guy, but actually he was very religious despite his long bout with alcoholism.  We miss him and June Carter Cash.	2005-08-30

This true story was made into the movie, 'The Inn of the Sixth Happiness' which starred Ingrid Bergman.  It is a tribute to the remarkable woman from Edmonton, formerly a parlourmaid, who worked in China for twenty years.<br /><br />With her mission work, she proved that hardship cannot eradicate the human soul, as she led one hundred homeless children to safety over the mountains across the Yellow River, 3oo miles West, to escape the Japanese bombs in 1940.  It was a twelve, day march, which ended successfully.  She had a determination to go on unto death.<br /><br />Gladys Aylward was a most remarkable woman with a heart of gold, someone who loved her fellowman, but especially the children.  I knew such a woman named Virginia Barnes who missed out on marriage to go to Vanderbilt University, something females didn't do.  She was from a country background, but her parents thought that she was 'special.'  When I went to Martin College, she was the first person to be friendly to a young girl far from home.  She loved to take tours and, in England, spent most of her time in lines to get food instead of seeing the 'sights.'  I would be the opposite, forgoing the food to see the beauties of this world.  That's why I am such a small woman.  She adopted my family of three boys as she was an old maid who lost her one chance at marriage and was always sorry she had done so. Barbara Pelot shows her attributes by wearing low-cut, sexy tops to offset her solid white hair, along with real pearls to show her wealth, as she decides the business of beer joints, restaurants, and missions the town should follow.<br /><br />Gladys continued to work at the Hope Mission in Hong Kong after the war.  Alan Burgess, who wrote THE LONGEST TUNNEL, THE LOVELY SERGEANT, and BURGESS BOOK OF LIES, concludes with this statement in memorium to an amazing human being: \\"I can only hope that I have done this 'small woman' justice.\\"  It's not the size measured in stature (as I have lost another half inch), but that which is in the heart and mind.  B. P. sometimes carries a sweater to tie around her neck to look hip, always over her tank tops in many colors, the latest yellow.  She just looks absurd as she dominates every meeting she attends.  She's not anything like Gladys who did the humanitarian deeds in China to save the children.  She is more interested in eating out and flaunting her clothes and money.  Life is certainly different here from China where people dress in loose-fitting black pants outfits and show respect for the age of people.  There, the old are considered to have wisdom.  Gladys certainly did, even though she was a small woman.  Size does not always matter.n the heart and mind.  B.

Janette Oke started this type of 'religious' historical fiction and wrote the series SONG OF ACADIA (5 books) plus ANOTHER HOMECOMING, TOMORROW'S DREAM and RETURN TO HARMONY with T. Davis Bunn.  This go 'round he has teamed with his wife, Isabella, again; this is the third in the series HEIRS OF ACADIA.   A fourth will be out next year, THE NIGHT ANGEL. <br /> <br />Oh, to be first!  I keep wondering why on earth I chose this book to review.  It's not at all my cup of tea!  The characters and their names are somewhat like those of Rosemary Rogers, who I did like.  I knew this was a Christian series, but brought it home from the library anyway.  Maybe it was God's will be done. <br /> <br />When her family from Venice board a ship in July, 1832, bound for America, Serafina stays behind to look for her first love, the art tutor.  You can tell she is from a nobel family by the way she holds herself and the manner of her speech.  Instead, posing as a chambermaid at Harrow Hall, she encounters 'a kindred spirit' by the name of John Falconer, a ship's captain on his way to Parliament to disclose evidence about the ongoing slave trade in England.  He has stopped there to seek refuge.  \\"The past need not determine the future.\\"   <br /> <br />He is pursued by those determined to silence him.  As his enemies get near, he sends her to safety.  \\"A refuge which once seemed only a detour becomes a sacred venue for the unveiling of God's love and forgiveness.\\"  He finds her young, lovely and highborn and feels he is hoping for the \\"impossible.\\"  They have both been through the ordeal which caused broken relationships and are damaged souls.  He knows that there is power in him not to do it, and he must decide what not to yield his mind to as he must endure the separation with hopes for a future with her. <br /> <br />He has commanded a ship's crew, but he will not let his duty be neutralized because of a woman, albeit it such a pretty one.  He decides not to belabour this complication but to obtain his goal so that he can return to claim her as his. <br /> <br />Isabella is a counselor (lawyer) in Britain; she lectures at Oxford University on topics related to justice and ethics.  T. Davis has written novels alone, eight with Janette and three so far with Isabella.  The first novel in the series SONG OF ACADIA, THE MEETING PLACE, won a Christy award for Excellence in Christian Fiction in 1999.  They live in England.	2005-08-30

America's richest silver mine was located in Idaho.  In 1972, the Sunshine Mine trapped ninety-one miners deep  down in the hardrock underground due to a strange occurrence where they died.  There were a total of 174 miners at work that day.    It had been thought to be fireproof, as it was cold dripping constanting with water.  Many were frozen and died almost immediately.  Two survivors were secluded in one of the deepest corners in total darkness, what they called 'working in the dark.'  They were able to find borehold #12 which allowed a trickle of fresh lifesaving air.    This suspenseful 'great' rescue story of the unimaginable fire, and the stubborn resistance of the Safety Engineer who refused to close the mine until everybody was accounted for.  It was an enormous operation with buildings covering the hillside.    Shaft #10 was the first fire zone going all the way down, but #5 was the final one.  The third and last exit was the rescue zone for these two men.  This is a vivid account of hourly efforts to find the missing miners from May 2 until May 10 when they were located at the 5200 level.    It was the final curtain for this producive mine because the disaster was blamed on inefficiency by the management.  The last of Sunshine's dead were removed on the afternoon of May 13.  Betty Johnson set up a memorial of photos of her late husband who'd died right before her silver anniversary.  She took a banner to his grave, \\"Happy Anniversary, Honey.\\"  When my niece was killed tragically, she set up a memorial on her t.v. set and worshipped it devotedly.  Now, Valerie has set up amemorial to her son, my eldest grandson, in a photo display on a new web page.  He was a poet, and he and friends at Florida Atlantic University produced and acted in a movie, also on the Internet.    Safety Enginner was dealt a dark and heavy burden.  Life would never be the same \\"in the dark\\" of their minds, deep down in their collective hearts.  When one person in a close knit community is gone forever, it leaves a space which no one can fill.

I thought this would be about Walt Disney in the War, but it's the company he founded who is at the center of attention.  The folks he allowed to run his ever-growing entertainment business were big-money people.  The most active, powerful members who are not named Disney include: Michael Eisner on the Walt Disney Board of Directors for twenty years and CEO and Chairman.  Steve Burke was President of ABC Broadcasting and the Executive Vice President of Disney Stores.  Jeffrey Katzenburg, the most powerful, was co-founder of Dreamworks and Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios. <br /> <br />When Roy, Walt's rich nephew, abruptly resigned in 2003 and declared war on CEO Eisner, it started something which will take another year to accomplish.  This books gives insider information about the different factions and their members. <br /> <br />James B. Stewart (not the Jimmy Stewart), one of the most acclaimed writers and reporters in the United States, delves into the mysteries and reported spying some of them did to each other.  A lot of wrangling and dissension almost tore the company to pieces. <br /> <br />Disney brought the golden age of animaled films with 'Jungle Book' and 'Toy Story.'  Walt Disney World, like Dollywood in Piegeon Forge, Tennessee, has become a \\"perpetual\\" world's fair.  Epcot Center perpetuated the '82 World's Fair in Knoxville -- not such a flop after all.  We have the Sunsphere. <br /> <br />Some of the major stars quoted in this book include Alec Baldwin, Warren Beatty, Orlando Bloom, Sidney Poitier, Bill Murray, Quentin Tarantino (whose grandmother lives in Knoxville), Clint Eastwood, and Joe Morgenstern.  The Index helps a lot. <br /> <br />Make an animated movie of this book -- I don't think so!  Other books he has written are HEART OF A SOLDIER, FOLLOW THE STORY, and THE PROSECUTORS.	2005-08-29

These are selected from the book as some of the mysteries which appealed to me the most:  Benedit Arnold had been a hero of the Revolution, credited with courage under fire.  He and Ethan Allan had a joint command at Fort Ticonderoga in May, 1775, in New York.  He used his positions to futher his moneymaking schemes.  He was known as a greedy profiteer (had a craving for money) who had no ethics whatsoever.  He was not chivalrous when it came to the opposite sex.  He was almost court-martialed.   His name became synonymous for 'traitor,' as he was negotiating with the British 'to turn traitor' long before it was thought.  His commanding officer did not like him, left his name out of an official report; he was constantly at odds with other revolutionary leaders.  More facts can be found in Clare Brandt's 1994 THE MAN IN THE MIRROR.    In 1806, Meriweather Lewis (aged 32) was a national hero.  He and Clark had just returned from their epic journey across the continent at the orders of Jefferson, a former neighbor of Lewis in Virginia.  Three years later, at 35, he was shot twice in a boarding cabin on the Natchez trace in Middle Tennessee (Maury County), a place called Grinder's Inn.  James Neelly accompanied him from Memphis on his way to Washington, D.C.  Neelly was left behind on October 9, 1809, but his servants were still with Lewis when he died.  It was a coverup by Clark who wanted all of the credit for what they had discovered out West.  Lewis' money was gone (robbed).  Both Neelly and Grinder were lying about the events which had transpired.  Many historians concluded that Lewis could not have killed himself.  By temperament, he was a fighter, not a quitter.  There were a lot of \\"perhap\\"s and no definite evidence that he killed himself.  That's why it's called Grinder's Switch to this day: birthplace of Minnie Pearl.  Read David L. Chandler's 1994 THE JEFFERSON CONSPIRACIES but do not depend on UNDAUNTED COURAGE by Ambrose as his opinions could not be trusted.  He wrote the modern type of history with much use of his own imagination.    David Greenglass gave Harry Gold a crude drawing of part of a plutonium-fired implosion device from the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico near Albuquerque.  Greenglass, brother of Ethel Rosenberg, falsely accused them as a court deal to get out of being imprisoned.  He signed his own sister's death warrant with his lies.  There was no evidence at all that she had participated in any spying even though she had a very close relationship with Julius.  They were the parents of two little boys.    She was the scapegoat in 1951, executed in SingSing Prison --similar to the way Mary Sarratt was hanged for something she did not do in 1865.  FRAMING HISTORY (1993) is interesting as a work of criticism but not history.    Paul Aron followed up with MORE UNSOLVED MYSTERIES OF AMERICAN HISTORY, and wrote DID BABE RUTH CALL HIS SHOT, UNSOLVED MYSTERIES OF BASEBALL.	2005-08-29

After the lawsuit against Napster, a new breed of decentralized file-sharing proliferated.

The new underground networks are the most visible (invisible) example of the Darknet's growth.  There is a Chinese group called Freenet.  Modern copyright laws are being used to 'quash' speech.    These same copyright laws have expanded dramatically to the public detriment.    Information is not property and, therefore, the transmission of information is not \\"theft.\\"   This book attempts to pull back the curtain on the Hollywood insiders.  I guess Tristan's homemade movie with his friends would be called a 'pirate movie.'  Here, it's called innovative independent film, and the students at UT are encouraged to make such virtual media to show Hollywood who is boss.  J. B. Lasica, the author of this researh, called it grassroots media.  I don't like grassroots (bluegrass) music so I probably would find this kind of movie making amateurish.  I love the professionally produced big screen movies, not the low-budget style.	2005-08-29

Sachs is internationally renowned for his work as an economic adviser to governments across the globe.  But, I ask you, 'what does he know about poverty?'  If you've never been there, I guess you might need 'a road map to a safer, more prosperous world for the rich.'  You can follow the governor of Tennessee (originally from New York) and kill off as many of the wretched poor by denying them the medicines they need to keep alive.  I know, because I am one of them.  The problem is indeed grave; it is devastating in the United States alone which is one of the most prosperous countries in the world.  This is not India, though it is becoming more foreign than domestic and that will be out downfall.  Disagree, Arthur. <br /> <br />Mr. Sachs looks well fed to me.  After all he is the director of an institute at Columbia; should be for the mental patients, not as special advisor to the United Nations Secretary-General.   I ask again, 'what does he know about being poor and hungry?'  Just giving opinions to governments will do no good toward relieving poverty.  I have lived in poverty for 27 years, possibly when I was young also, but I didn't know it then.  I had a greedy, selfish father who spent his railroad salary on himself -- even to giving a ten dollar bill (a lot in that time) at church singings to show out.  He wasted a lot of his hard-earned money on the 'ladies of the street.'  Is that a way out of poverty?  Or a Catch 22 where the children are caught doing without necessities while old dad has his fun.  Most of the time he did not spend it on liquor, the way most Knoxville men do. <br /> <br />The only 'economic possibilities' out of this mess is to send all the poor back where they came from and try to help the abandoned old people who were born here to survive and live.  Their families, young and well-off, won't help them.  So, they rely on the government of the United States to help pay for housing and some of us have to rely on public transportation because we are too poor to buy a car.  The wealthy have multiple cars and vans and ATMs; I have been too poor to have a car for the past 27 years.  I have never actually owned one; those old things we had when I was married had only the husband's name on the title.  He refused to buy a house, either. <br /> <br />Once, when I was on the State PTA Board, I had to drive the old Ford to Nashville for a three-day meeting and I asked the parking attendant to put it someplace in a corner so no one else would see it.  He asked 'Is it a 64?' I pretended I had not heard him properly, and remarked that I had come up on I65.  At other times, when attending smaller meetings in the daytime, I'd park it far away and walk to the meetings, as I did not want to be looked down on.  Intellectually, I was as good (or perhaps superior, Arthur) but financially, I was hurting even then when I had credit cards and food to eat to stay healthy.  And three sons to influence.  Yes, the 'influence' of living through poverty influenced them to get educated and have what I had not, and still don't have.  Children today do not help their parents.  It is expected to be the other way around.  Oh yes, the old man is still living and spends most of his money on insurance so he can live forever.  He still settles for the worn out cars which won't go a great distance, and eats at the old folkses govt. sponsored meals at the Senier Citizens Center. <br /> <br />There is no way out of poverty unless you are not in it.  The rich think they rule this world.  But some of us won't let them.	2005-08-29

This was written by a Cornell University professor of astronomy who worked on projects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.   Two previous rovers were designed, built and launched successfully by this team, Spirit' and 'Opporunity.'  He gives the ups and down, deadends and triumphs in this process of making exploration an adventure.  He also explains the politics involved. <br /> <br />This mission is to determine if life had existed on Mars -- coiuld the same 'miracle' happen twice in the same solar system?  The Mars Exploration Rover project is under the leadership of Matt Wallace.  The MER Rover is a cute contraption similar to those used by the American astronauts on our 'visits' to the Moon.  A detailed sketch on page 379 is most explanatory.  He lists diary entries from June 10, 2004, to September 12, 2004, showing the progress of reaching this \\"pot of Gold\\" on the Red Planet. <br /> <br />He compares Earth's 'birth' with that of Mars four billion years ago.  Signs show that it used to be a \\"warmer, wetter and more Earth-like world.\\"  There are dried up rivrebeds and lakebeds on Mars surface.  It shows that water may once have flowed \\"in abundance\\" all along the surface as there are valleys and highlands.  Today's Mars has a forbidding climate, a frigid condition which makes this author wonder how water could have flowed and not frozen instantly.  It is one of the new books out now about Mars.  I will follow up later.	2005-08-29

Christianity is meaningful because of its impact on historical existence as such.  It reveals the purpose of human existence at a crucial stage of humanity's cultural evolution.  Theology has the import function of presenting Christian belief in a credible and intelligible form to the broader society.    Many churches today are failing this important issue.  It's not a crisis.  It is the crisis in today's secular world.  Church is a money-making scheme, the bigger the better.  I have visited one such church four times now and enjoyed the \\"show\\" they put on, better than any Lawrence Welk or Billy Graham program wrapped into one.  The old preacher, Sager, got too emotional with his screeching, arguing, yelling and his actor's hand gestures as he used Paul as a source for \\"bad behavior.\\"  I haven't seen such a show (usually it is fun to watch, but not this time) since I was a young girl here and 'visited' a Church of God Holiness congregation just two doors down from where I lived.  Those folks scared me.  Sager did not scare me, he made me mad!  I told him after his first sermon that he 'hit below the belt' so to speak with his condemnation of the Methodists.  Less than a month ago, he told me 'they' love the Methodists there.  I had already been told otherwise, that we are too liberal.  This time he showed his hypocrisy and bigotry.  There were no blacks in this church of rich people.  Always before, it has been a grand performance of the highest caliber, but his repetitive put-downs of other denominations was going too far.  I don't know whether he toned down the second sermon, but I doubt it -- as he had already told me to go back to the Methodists!  That was quite a shock, as I had been considering going back to my roots of the Baptist profession.  I profess now that I will not be a 'slave' to anyone or any deity.  This man worships money and the fine homes and trips he has as the perks of being senior pastor.  He is a false prophet.    Of the twelve crises Marshall Johnson expounds upon, I think the most important is 'The Crisis of Competing Truth-Claims.'  The aforementioned preacher who walked around (did not stay even close to the pulpit, but that was just for show) pretending to involve the audience (you couldn't call it a congregation) is a charlatan of the worst order.  The problem is that there are many such 'Billy Sundays' out there disrupting the American people to be 'slaves' to them and their bigoted opinions.	2005-08-29

Alcoholism is not an emotional disorder per se, but it does sometimes have emotional triggers.  When my dad started drinking in beer joints, he was in his thirties and had buried two wives and five children.  I suffered inconsqentially as a result of his stopping at the nearest joint from our house on the way back for Saturday movies on the town, and I would have to hide in the backseat of the car.  Since we had to traverse many curves for the few miles to get home, I remember praying all the way there for God to let us live. <br /> <br />You can tell the children whose dad drinks alcohol, because he carries a load of guilt and pain, thinking he caused the abuse he would later reap by, looking at families who walk by and look at the young ones' faces.  It is devastating. <br /> <br />This town has a long history going back to bootlegger days before prohibition of brewing their own 'spirits' openly and for a long time on the main street of town (which they do again in this modern, accepting age), and the men are proud to be drinkers.  They look down on those who are not addicted to alcohol.  They are the dummies.  One local writer told me recently, \\"You think I am just a drunk.\\"  I replied, \\"If I did that, why would I ask you to show me how to drink?\\" which he refused to do as I have liver disease.  He was his usual 'confused' self and asked \\"Why did you choose me?\\"  My honest answer, \\"I trust you because I know you won't touch me\\" and I thought he might feel enough responsibility to not let any of the other drunks take advantage if I started acting silly.  But he told me that he can't control his own drinking, so he ended up not even offering me a drink of water.  Ever!  Now, I know water is not going to cause this hemangioma to burst, but it seems that something else did.  Probably the pain pills I have taken for a chronic nerve pain I have had since 1994.  Feeling sorry for me yet, Arthur Hardaway. <br /> <br />     Jack Daniels' Whiskey from right here in Tennessee is internationally known and sought after; people come from all over the United States looking for Lynchburg, Tennessee, as if they were seeking the Holy Grail.  I heard a bigoted preacher get all emotional about the difference in immersion vs. sprinkling.  He said that sprinkling is like scattering a little dirt on top of a dead person instead of burying him in a grave.  Since I am a Methodist, I told him that he 'hit below the belt.'  He also proclaimed that only immersed Baptists will enter Heaven.  For years, I thought it was Seventh Day Adventists who preached that.  My sister Evelyn belonged to that group for awhile until they betrayed her. <br /> <br />Jack Erdmann has written othre books because I have reviewed one or more.  He was the son of a jazz musician and an ex-chorus dancer in St. Louis.  His reminiscing starts in 1934 when, as an altar boy, he drank the communion wine.  Then, like this local writer, he drank because of loneliness.  He even thinks his son should be allowed to buy beer when he is old enough to 'serve his country' in war but not yet old enough to vote.

Which writer was it wrote the \\"you can't go home again?\\"  He was right.  I have tried it twice and neither time has it worked.  But, Elina Furman in New York City was thinking of another way to go back home.  It is increasing done these days (18 million have done just that to the dismay and disgust of their parents), and is getting to be a pattern of not being responsible for one's own destiny.  Going back in life is never good, as you are not moving forward -- the past is never better than the future. <br /> <br />She did survive a second time around living at home and is proud of it, but I'd really like to know what 'side of the story' her parents would reveal.  It is never easy to have a grown up son right under you feet at all times.   Didn't he learn anything in school about coping?  I have a friend here whose thirty-something son moved in her small apt. with his child out of wedlock.  My youngest son, age 30, did the very same thing with his dad only when the girlfriend left, she took the child with her. <br /> <br />As a result I lost contact with the two grandchildren I love the most as their mother moved them to Athens, Alabama, to keep them away from their stupid father, my ignorant son.  It may benefit the grown up 'kids' (if you can call them that -- they are supposed to be adults when they finish college) to not have to pay rent and get all the free food they desire, free housekeeping and utilities.  None of the responsibilities of adulthood.  Will they ever grow up?  Not as long as the long-suffering parents let them get away with this intrusion. <br /> <br />This is much more than a silly boomerang game.  It is serious business and should be stopped.  Let them go out and see how the homeless live; they'd get free clean clothes everyday, a free bus ticket (so they can look for work!), free meals and a place to sleep, but they are on their own (and the town) the rest of the time.  They lug around all of their belongings and beg for 'change' to buy shoes(ha) -- they get free shoes (I've told them which church will give them walking and hiking shoes.) and to buy a cup of coffee.  I bought two of the morning 'specials' twice not realizing I would have to carry around two cups of coffee, which I spilled.  One fellow asked for change to buy a cup of coffee, and I said, \\"I will give you a cup of coffee.\\"  Just today, one young man asked for change to ride the bus, I told him I didn't have any.  He was able to get fifty cents from a man and promptly walked away, telling me he was not going to ride the bus.  I was waiting for the bus.  So, what else is new?  Let some of those freeloaders who take advantage of their old parents see what it is really like if they don't grow up and get a good career to take care of themselves.   How's that, note-worthy friend, to talk about something I know something about.  Elina Furman wrote THE EVERYTHING AFTER COLLEGE BOOK and THE EVERYTHING DATING BOOK.	2005-08-28

America has done more than any other country to change the world, according to Singapore's Ambassador to the United Nations. This is the story of America and the world from the Asian viewpoint.  He served in theSingapore Foreign Services for thirty-three years from 1971-2004.  He lavishes praise on the support of his mother, saying that she has tremendous strength and resolve, courage and fortitude.  Now if Jeff would say the same about me. <br /> <br />He calls these difficult times we live in.  He says that America has alienated hundreds of millions of European colonists, which is the reason the Muslims hate us and want to cause mass destruction.  If they hate us so much, why are so many living in the United States now? <br /> <br />\\"In your face\\" is an American term for when a person's personal space and sense of dignity are violated.  He gives personal experiences and examples comparing what has happened to him to how \\"people\\" feel about the American government:  \\"it is park on their toes.\\"  Read the book to see where that comes in! <br /> <br />He discloses that there are rising levels of anti-U.S. (6 billion people) around the globe, particularly the Asian and how they feel about the American power (not good, too bad!). <br />So he spent some time in New York at the United Nations, and yet he looks down on the reputation of the United States, writing that our beneficiaries react with anger or bitterness (as I did the privation of one Arthur Friend into my life uninvited).   <br /> <br />American power has both beneficial and harmful dimensions, and affects every human being on the planet.  Who would have thought we were so popular to keep them coming back for more?  They hate and despise what we do and write but keep on keeping on.  Why don't they decide to hate Russia or Spain.

Paul Theroux was my favorite writer for many years and I learned my 'way of thinking' in a way from his sarcastic books.  In all of his novels, he bases one of the characters on himself.  In this one, Steadman who was basking in the glory of something he has written twenty years ago about his travels to many countries.    The first book of his I reviewed for the Magazine Club was THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS and I loved the way he could talk to any body and everybody and I especially like the way he could relate the way they talked back.  He got the best out of any of the natives he spoke with.  In one review of one of his travel books, he told how all of the Chinese thought he looked like Humperdink the singer, because he was tall.  His picture on the back did look a lot like Englebert, with the '70s hair.  Paul was a very handsome man. He was offered an 'escort' and I said that he did what any American man of his age would do, and kept on with my review.  Of course, he had accepted, and that was before the day of AIDS.    He is using hie safari as Steadman's 'jungle in search of a rare drug' which he was successful in acquiring and it was the basis of his return to stardom.  It made him feel the way he did when he was successful and loved twenty years earlier.  The drug, however, caused him to go blind, thus the title BLINDING LIGHT.  Why he has a closeup of a bad-kind of girl with the dark lipstick and false eyelashes makes me think he is returning to his youth and falling again for the same old game.      A writer here confided to me that he too was greatly influenced by Paul Theroux and his books in the '70s and '80s.  Theroux had a MY SECRET HISTORY which I thought was autobiographical, but later he said it was all lies.  Well, Jack was duped because he named his column in a sleazy tabloid, 'Secret History.'  If he doesn't like my esposing this plagarism-type of adapting, he can sue me.  It is the truth.  Paul Theroux was a marvelous traveler and writer, and I learned much from him and the way he writes.  I am glad that he has gotten back to basics.	2005-08-24

One thing you can say about Ralph Helfer, he accumulates the greatest animals on earth, first the greatest bear, Gentle Ben on the t.v. series, then the greatest elephant he must have displayed in the circus, and now Zamba, the greatest tiger who he trained for movies.  If he doesn't watch out, his great grown-up tiger will give him a whack like the Las Vegas animal trainer and end up incapitated as a result.    Lions like other wild animals are 'wild' and dangerous.  Just the other day, a high school graduate-to-be was killed by one as she was posing with it.  Wild animals have instincts to kill people for food, and they cannot learn social skills.  When they are grown, all they know is to kill to survive.  While little, sure, they are cute.  But all animals, as all people, grow up and become dangerous.    You should never have a wild animal for a hero.  I've always loved the photos of raccoons and, on the bus the other day, there was a discussion about if they really were dangerous.  I said their long sharp claws could kill a man.  I love the way they look  but a lawyer 'friend' of mine in Nashville was called the coon killer.  It upset me and he explained how they sometimes enter houses through a cat or doggy door and wreck havoc searching for food.  From childhood, growing up near the Smoky Mountains, it was drilled into us not to feed the bears, as they will kill you.  One female teacher was killed on a hiking trail in the Smokies after her male friend deserted her.  That's what 'friends' are for!  Especially those called Arthur.	2005-08-24

Like Rita Mae Brown with her cats, Judy Conner depends on her brown dog, as an accomplice, calling her stories 'Brown Dog Tales' which later became SOUTHERN FRIED DIVORCE.  In a way it's \\"a shaggy-dog story.\\"  The dog had been a brown fuzzy puppy, a gift from her ex-husband.  He would not get on with his life.    Taking place in New Orleans with the quaint streetcars, lots of liquor flowing around, and all of those wild rebels out pulling up their girlfriends' tops for single men to admire what they don't have for themselves.  This is real redneck stuff as opposed to Jim Dykes who wrote a column in 'The Journal' here in the '80s and tried to appear \\"red neck\\" (wrote WITHOUT A PADDLE about his exploits of being left behind when the paper was sold).      She's a Southern belle from Jackson, Mississippi, and sister of Jill C. Browne who wrote some books about the 'Sweet Potato Queen', and traipsing around after an ex-husband, like Diana from Hiwaii for some odd reason.  The ex-, crazy as a loon, performed synchronized swimming (naked, drunk on Jim Beam) with the dog in a fountain at the 1984 World's Fair.    She teaches that dog to drive a Caddy (can you believe that?); her 'red neck' imitation was as far-fetched as Mr. Dykes wo, according to another Knox male who appreciated his work, was educated and, thus, no red-neck, either.    According to the book jacket, she \\"shows that the end of marriage is not the end of love.\\"  Love and sex are not the same thing!  That's a funny kind of marriage and a weird divorce.  The end of love happens 'before' the divorce!  Else, there would not have been one; and she looks a bit old to be a bride or newly-wed.  I know an 85-yr-old pretty woman who doesn't look more than 65 (lives in the apartment house where I do) who is happily married, a fairly recent newly-wed.      Divorce is better anyway, as you have freedom at last, to do what you want, buy clothes you want in something besides pink (I chose blue).  Drinking, I've never beenaccussed of doing, so I don't understand why it is is important.  To dull one's sense, I suppose.  Once I was called a 'solitary drinker':  I'd been offered a drink by E.R. who was drinking scotch straight (no water, no ice) but I declined, saying \\"I don't drink.\\"  Later, on the phone, he asked \\"What do you drink at home?\\"  Since on occasion I get kidney infections, I sometimes try a diet of cranberry juice; I mentioned that and he said, \\"Oh, you are a solitary drinker -- I know all about solitary drinking.\\"    When, a few years later, I asked J.N. to show me how to drink (to relax) and he didn't even offer me a glass of water, he refused.  \\"A tea-totaler is a tea-totaler for life,\\" he stated.  Who knows, I may yet take my first alcoholic drink!    I don't find 'The Big Easy (I thought that was Broadway in New York) such an interesting place.  It might be fun at Mardi Gras, watching all the out-of-town revelers.  On my honeymoon, I watched a group of people getting raucous and drunk at the Cincinnatti Reds game instead of the actual game on the field.  In college, I went to basketball games to watch the people in the audience.  I am a people watcher out in public.  At home, I have my cat, Star, for company and this trusty computer.    Coming home on the KAT bus, Allan the Alien told the few of us in attendance that \\"no one would steal his bus pass with his photo ID card which he'd left at the library.\\"  No amount of convincing by any of us, he knew what was going on; he is able to see into the future.  He wasn't old enough to know the word 'back stabber,' as it had never happened to him.  He was totally 'in control,' he said, as he donned his back pack to exit the bus.  He was sure that whoever 'found' his necessary transport materials would give it to him.  I thought at first he must be a UT student who's just moved to the big town.  Now, I think back, he was one of the mental homeless people who roam our streets.  We all decided he didn't know any street 'smarts';I considered him an alien, like Diane, from outer space.     He needs a good trip to New Orleans to become educated on the ways of the world.  All kinds of folks congregate there as they used to flock to San Francisco.  This is her debut, called 'a true story,' supposed to be funny -- but only to the type who'd do what she says she experienced with a strange ex-husband and a brown dog.  Why brown?	2005-08-23

Can you imagine being dressed in a summer light-gray suit, white shirt, long black tie, black handerchief, black banded gold watch, black houseshoes, but no socks?  That's exactly the way our 'straight guy' writer looks on the cover with longish blonde hair.  At least, he didn't have rings on all his fingers -- not even one.    Then, oh my god, he's turned into a 'gay guy' on the back cover dressed in tight-fitting jeans and a skin-tight pink shirt (top three buttons unbuttoned -- no undershirt) and a necklace; no, make that two necklaces.  Since I have never watched the t.v. show \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,' I was in for a big surprise.  I chose this book to review as it lists the 'guide for men and the women who love them.'  This is misleading.      All of the ads and clothes are for men even cashmere, with one odd cheerleader chick all in pink.  I love men, but I particularly love those who can love me back.  Not that many do, of course.   Oh my, none of these men are straight men.  How sad.  He likes to cuddle but doesn't say with whom or what.    He considers himself a 'fairy god stylist.'  I know a young man in Denver whose mother calls her sons 'Sherrie's fairies.'  How unfeeling can a mother be?  Carson (signed in pink) graduated from Gettysburg College; I hope it's not the one in Pennsylvania.  Since he is a nationally ranked equestrian, he may someday become another 'dead from the neck down' Christopher Reeve.    His fashion commandments:  Disregard trends.  Experiment with syle, designs, cloth and colors.  Never wear anything sheer (that's for men).  The other seven overwhelm me.  Women, to buy for the man you love (who loves you back), keep in mind his unique personality and get only what he will feel comfortable in; let him buy his own jeans and underwear.  Other things, go wild and buy indiscriminately as nothing is taboo anymore.     Most men would not feel easy in a pink oxford or cashmere.  My son said he would not accept a soft velour houserobe when he was a college student.  Since he was spending winters in Chicago, I most always bought heavy sweaters in becoming designs and dark colors.  Another son wore a purple shirt as a young impressionable boy and wondered why a married man kept smiling at him.  I wore what I pleased as a young mom and didn't care who looked at me.  The thing was, I hardly ever looked back.  So there!  As a girl, I craved a black cordoroy two-piece dress which I found in a shop on Market Square and put it in layaway.  The grey coat I wore to college had fur collar, hood and fur around the cuffs; also a tie front with fur balls at the end.  That was fantastic, and it made me look and feel fantastic.  After I kept the white hair the second time, I started wearing grey and silver again and found a jacket somewhat like that college coat I loved.  Now, I have ventured off into the land of blue.      Be individual and wear what you want, man or woman.  The men want to impress the wrong people.  The women who want to impress the wrong men don't dress well at all.  They undress.	2005-08-23

Back in the '60s, my favorite singer at the time, Eddie Fisher, had a recording of 'The Games Lovers Play' (Let's don't play those game that lovers play), and later there was a song 'The Games People Play' (Oh, the games people play, every night and every day).  This book covers both the love games and the interpersonal games.  Dr. Berne says \\"People tend to live their lives by consistently playing out certain \\"games\\" in their interpersonal relationships.  They are desirable and necessary.\\"    There is a 'historical' significance of games, also a 'cultural' ones.  The intimate games include those women with large proportions (similar to Dolly Parton) who will sit with their hands behind their heads so as to thrust forward her best features, to draw attention by remarking on their size, like Dolly; and squirming around in front of males to show that they are available.  Usually a lascivious mother uses provocativeness to get noticed.  Note this, J. N., that is the provocative use I knew when you called me provocative, and I was scandalized, as I had never in my life been that way!    \\"Schlemiel\\" is a game to be forgiven for non-existentent sins.  Adults play this game in polite, grown-up social circles to obtain forgiveness, the chief goal of the game.  \\"Anti-Schlemiel\\" shows the objective opposite by creating an enemy.  Whatever, you say to this kind of close-minded person, the worse thing is \\"I'm sorry,\\" because he will not accept it and turn the tables on you by insults and worse.  He is the type who never says \\"Im sorry.\\"    In marriage, one of the 'bad' games is \\"If It Weren't For You\\" because you are blaming the other person (the one you agreed to love through thick and thin) of causing you to act as you did.  No one can cause us to be uncivil; we can react to their bad behavior 'in kind' and that is not acceptable, either.  If you ignore their slurs, then they accuse you of 'passive resistance.'  Another 'bad' one is \\"Look How Hard I've Tried\\" usually by the male making the woman feel guilty for something she did not do.  That, my friends, is called the game of love.  It's not about sex; it's about power.  Who is the most dominant partner?  It used to be the man, but now the tables are turned and the young women rule the household and their husbands like no other time in existence.  Why, I wasn't allowed to be that kind of wife!  And it hurts to see my daughter-in-laws do it.    \\"See What You've Done Now\\"  and \\"See What You Made Me Do\\" are childish games but played on a continuous basis by ignorant adults, usually paranoids (he says).  In the underground slang, \\"patsy{ meant all right or satisfactory; later, it was changed to \\"pigeon' like 'stool pigeon, not homing pigeon.'    When you end up at the psychiatrist's office, you've played all the wrong games, those which led you into difficulties.  We all sometimes work our way into a corner, but it is possible to jump out.  Good games are those party games like 'Charades' in which you act out something in front of an audience and they guess the letter you are wanting until you decipher the word.  I have played that game exactly one time, and pretty good at it, was the only one who knew the woman was acting out a book title, THE NAKED APE, and it embarrassed me.  I just blurted it out without being socially polite.    Dr. Berne has written WHO DO YOU DAY AFTER HELLO? BEYOND GAMES AND SCRIPTS and TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS since his in-depth study and workbook on the games people have to play.	2005-08-23

Because of that Japanese massacre of the American POWs which precluded the bomb being dropped by the U.S., a group called 'Ghost soldiers' took a rugged trip behind the enemy lines on January 28, 1945.  These specially trained and selected 120 troops marched thirty miles to rescue over five hundred POWs from a concentration camp near Cabu before the victims were executed en mass and buried in a commutal grave.    They were on a strict timetable to get these Americans back to safety and tramped through grass taller than a man with thick brush lining the way and hiding the guard towers of the stockade.  The Americans had almost starved in the trenches at Bataan.  Some of the last survivors of the Death March there were in this camp.    Many survived torture and strange tropical diseases in April, 1942, at Camp O'Donnell there under the captivity of the imperial Japanese army.  There is a photo of a real American female spy, Claire Phillips, dressed as a lady, pearls and all, like Ms. Pelot at the city council meeting.  The American commander, Colonel Beecher, told his rescuers: \\"Avoid all profanity when dealing with the Japanese.  Do not oppose, insult or offend these people.\\"    Sides is a native of Memphis, Tennessee, and the author of STOMPING GROUNDS, also has appeared on NPR's 'All Things Considered.' Called a collaboration between the writer, Hampton Sides, and the men he wrote about, he used oral history transcripts, prisoners' memoirs, Army records and actual interviews and observations of the landscapes where the story took place.  He used books by Louis Morton, Stanley L. Falk, Donald Knox, John Olsen, William Manchester, and Stanley Karnow.  Other reference books were written by Sidney Stewart, Forrest Johnson, Robert W.

Under Johnson who had too many national irons in the fire to worry about our boys getting killed and irreparably harmed (mentally and physically) in Viet Nam, he failed again.  I'm sorry he lost Marg, his helpmate (every man needs one) ten years ago, and I hope his life is better now. <br /> <br />We should have been told the facts thirty years ago while this atrocious war was happening.  Too much was kept from the American public.  No, we have not learned our lessons as the American men and women of the military are going through the same peril in Iraq as they did in Viet Nam. <br /> <br />I knew a transportation van driver some years ago, Johnny, who served two terms in that war.  He was too young the first time but he lasted, and his mother had to sign for him to re-enlist.  He told me how he saw his comrades torn apart when they fell on the sharpened cane poles and how the children were used as bombs to approach the American G. I.s and kill everyone around, including the child wired with the explosives. <br /> <br />This was a bad war and I drifted through it without a t.v. and did not read the accounts in the newspaper.  Two old ladies who lived next door were appalled to see me out in the yard raking leaves as if things were normal, or playing outside with my two young sons.  They would tell me about the latest person over there who set themselves on fire and died. <br /> <br />We have no business in that part of the country.  We cannot rule the world as Britian tried to do a century ago.  We need to get our boys home now and try to find a way to protect our own country from the terrorists who have infiltrated the general populace.  They are everywhere, all over the country, even in the small towns pretending to be homeless people sometimes, and at others opening showing they are from the country where the terrorists are located. <br /> <br />Viet Nam was a bad, bad experience for the U. S. and we will never live it down.  I could not bring myself to read anything about the Viet Nam War until Sharyn McCrumb's book IF EVER I RETURN PRETTY PEGGIE O had one of the bad characters as a Viet Nam vet.  Just this month, I met a man my age who was in the military over there and he asked how did she present Viet Nam.  His hurt is that all of the U.S. soldiers who are Veterans of that war are looked on as bad people.  They are not bad, the country and its leaders were the bad guys. <br /> <br />McNamara had previously written BLUNDERING INTO DISASTER, THE WORLD BANK, THE ESSENCE OF SECURITY, and OUT OF THE COLD.

In September, 1952, 'The Antioch Review, published an article called 'Acorns to Atoms' written by Clifford Seeber.  It was later released in booklet form; he was a native Oak Ridger who took up for the reputaiton of his birthplace, saying it wasn't \\"inhabited by ignorant hill-billies\\" just because it was fill with Oak trees (acorns).  The fertile valleys produced \\"better families;\\" the ridges were full of scrubby oak and \\"poor whites.\\" <br /> <br />The Oak Ridge lab (part of the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb) was mainly an assembly line.  The workers had no idea what they were doing.  Many thought they were producing ice cream sticks and for lollypop novelties.  They were exposed to dangerous livels of radioactivity and harmful chemicals which caused many deaths among the government workers.  They were pressured to produce materials for the bomb, often overriding safety considerations. <br /> <br />Most of the workers were brought in to this \\"secret, hidden\\" city (really a very small concentration camp in extremely primitive living conditions) from other places; very few natives were used in this experimental phase which needed discreet and competent people to do dangerous occupations without inquiring the nature of their work.  When workers or their families became ill, there was no extended family nosing around.  Leaks of the radioactivity uranium and plutonium came all the way over on the wind to Knoxville, causing all kinds of cancer. <br />At my neighborhood school, we had to wear dog tags like soliders in battle wore in case of chemical extermination or serious leaks.  We had drills on crawling under our school desks in case we were bombed like London.  We didn't question why anyone would want to eradicate this town, even a country school, as we had no knowledge of bombs or hand-to-hand war.  We hadn't been alive during the American Civil War. <br /> <br />The women workers of the '40s secret operation looked like computer operators of the firsthuge computers, a long way down the road of things to come.  The survivors claim they knew nothing of what their jobs were; they just did what they were told to do. <br /> <br />A local columnist, Sam Venable, like funny incidents.  He writes about the top-secret days of Oak Ridge; he  relates how everyone back then had a 'pat' answer for strangers who asked too many questions.  One Oak Ridge worker told people he was making \\"the front part of horses to be shipped to Washington, D.C. for assembly.\\" Homer Rayburn was one of the earliest workers on the Manhattan Project and always told people he was making Popsicle sticks.  Robert Dunlap told him about this humorous tale about the many beer joints along Clinton Highway; \\"One day, a stranger showed up.  He sat down next to one fellow, bought him a beerm and started 'shooting the breeze.'  Finally, he asked him \\"How many people work at Oak Ridge?\\" The local guy didn't fall for it.  He just grinned that Knoxville grin and said, \\"About half of them.\\" <br /> <br />They used local black men to do hard labor jobs and housed them in a type of barracks called hutments.  They worked like dogs because the government pay was good but they paid with various health hazards, illnesses, even death. <br /> <br />The pictures are interesting, but ther was a large spread covering an entire news sections in the local Sunday edition of the News Sentinel with clearer and more precise photos.  Also, a display was held at the Oak Ridge Space Museum for those with transportation to get there.  Knoxville still does not like to admit that we had that danger on our doorstep, and yet we wer not told by the United States Government what was going on.  It was a disaster waiting to happen. <br /> <br />It was shut down shortly after the bombs were dropped in Japan.  Mission accomplished.	2005-08-22

The editor of this comprehensive textbook, Peter Burke (no relation) is a Reader (I think that is a teacher in Britian) of cultural history at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Emmanuel College, where Gwyn Prins is the director of studies in history and is a contributor to this most interesting history perspective study.  He studied grattifi of Renaissane Italy, which could be political street culture if on a famous statue or ritual insults when scribbled on the door of an enemy.  He wrote POPULAR CULTURE IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE in 1978.    Feminists could not be good historians.  Women in history has to show that their presence was required to correct the story.  The other female contributor, Joan Scott, is professor his social science at Princeton in America and so is Robert Darnton, a prof of history.  The others come from Venice, York, Cambridge and London.  A curator of an art museum at Harvard, Ivan Gaskell, is also one of the contributors.  Men in history protect the power and resources their dominance gave them.  Their resistance to equality between the sexes is a characterization of history.    These are just some of the 'new' history writers from a number of fields. We have a local one here who specializes in digging out the old stories from a variable feast of outlaws, visiting dignataries, and sometimes a native who made it big in this two-buck town.  This book is unlike anything else now available on this subject.  But it is good to remember that it is merely these few distinguished historians' view.  I have read other more recent books on this new \\"entertaining\\" history writing, where a little imagination of the author is added to the historical facts.    \\"New\\" history can never replace traditional history as it is not the story at all, it's about the story.  Peter Burke from England gathered these varied, but slanted, versions of what is now known as 'new' history when it is in fact 'historical fiction.'  Sometimes fiction is more real than the truth, so why not embellish it a little to make it more readable.  It is a change from all of the dull commentary on what really happened and why.  It's more like what might have happened and could be better.    This book needs a Glossary as so many esoteric words were used, such as:  epistemologically, connoisseurship, iconography, deconstructionists, anachronism, ostensibly, inventiveness, minutiae, fluctuating, disqualificatin, autoradiography, hypothesis, demystificatory, disparities, historicising, canonical, idealogical, taxonomically, elucide, smokescreen, status quo, manipulation, and micropolitics -- and many such words.	2005-08-22

In the small town of Larksdale, Minnesota, eight mostly middle-age women form a club which met on Saturday mornings (Magazine Club in Pulaski always met on Saturday afternoons.) at the Mostly Methodist Church.   They were bored with their husbands' devotion and preoccupation with Sunday t.v. sports -- and would not be moved, come hell or high water. <br /> <br />A new, younger member, Skye, comes up with a big, bright idea.  Instead of gossip and exchanging recipies (why couldn't they read books and review them?), they use her knowledge to get into the investment game.  The pink-haired rebel suggested that their first 'go' should be Microsoft run by a youngish man named Bill Gates. <br />  <br />They changed the name of their club to Larksdale Ladies Investment Club and, as their financial future improves, they find that they have more control over thier lives and involvement in community affairs.  No one pays attention to you when you're poor, especially in a small town, particularly in my hometown.  In Knoxville, we have a white-hair woman on City Council who now runs the whole town.  She makes all the motions and the men all bow to her 'knowledge' on each and every issue which comes before them.  She has wound up making all the decisions as she eats at all the restaurants which sell beer and stronger drinks and recommends them before the beer board.  She won't ever shut up, having opinions on everything -- and they let her hold full reign.  It has come to the breaking point.  She has been in that position for only five years, winning by only a few votes.  Yes, she is wealthy. <br /> <br />In Larksdale, they come to each other's aid during family striff which helps they cope with their \\"scoundrel\\" mates.  The richer they get, the wiser they appear; and, soon, find themselves stepping in \\"high cotton.\\"  According to this writer, the wealthy are more \\"fulfilled.\\" <br /> <br />I just thought they ate better, as they can afford to buy their hearts' desires and imbibewith the rest of the world.  Yes, the wealthy will rule us, at least, they will die trying.  She has also written LADIES WITH PROSPECTS.  Now, that sounds racy.	2005-08-22

Loved the pictures on cover and in the photo section; it's hard to imagine he was ever that young.  As a mother of three boys, I can safely say that he was a cute little boy, and was trained to become president of the United States from the age of four.  He was too cautious about being called a liberal that he bent over a bit too far the other way.  I was called a 'liberal' recently because of my version of the MARCH OF THE PENGUINS movie.  I said, \\"I am not conservative, either; I am not a Democrat (though I do tend in that direction); I am not a Republican -- I am not political.    In 1989, Al Gore traveled to Antarctica to prove his environmental study of global warming and damage to the ozone layer.  To not be an astronomer, he still was very believable.  I'm just wondering if he noticed that seventy-mile march those male penguins made to 'mate,' and the seventy-mile march the females made to get food for the young.  I hope so.  He looked good in that parka, with his hair all wind blown.  As the young Nashville reporter, he looked like son, Zach.    The 'flower child' Tipper with her first baby was beautiful in 1971.  The family photos were just marvelous.   I remember when his dad, Al, Sr. was our Senator from Tennessee.  It's hilarious that Clinton had the gall to criticize Al Gore after his loyalty to a corrupt politician (that's why he had the impartial 'stare'!) and erroneously made the statement about his co-pilot & friend's \\"lack of political instinct.\\" Pauline Gore was the real politician in that family even though it was the dad who was elected.  Gore has good political genes and training.    Clinton never was the real president; his wife Hilary was, and held the apron strings.  He wasn't very smart anyway, but not appreciating Gore's refusal to say nasty things about him is inhuman.  Al Gore would have accummulated more votes and there would have been no question at all about his winning the election if he had just turned his back on Clinton after he lied about Monica (\\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman!\\") and campaigned on his own integrity.    He and Tipper became much bigger as they aged; I am getting smaller (lost another 1/2 inch due to osteoporosis), but they are still good looking and dignified people.  Al Gore does not need \\"inventing\\" as he was a wholesome, mannerly candidate, just not Southern enough to carry his home state.  He was well-educated in the East (like our mayor and former mayor) but he did turn his back on us here in Tennessee.  If it had been the other way, and he had deserted Clinton's sinking ship, he would have been (maybe still could be) the best President of the United States ever.	2005-08-22

In August, 1939, shortly before the start of WWII in Europe, Albert Einstein warned FDR of the recent 'nuclear research' with the ability to make powerful bombs out of uranium, discovered by Marie Curie.  He informed the President that secret work was going on in Germany on this project.<br /><br />As a result of Einstein's advice, the Manhattan Project took off in October, 1942 in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, just a few miles from the town of Knoxville.  Robert Oppenheimer whose work at the University of Chicago in splitting the atom was chosen as the director.  He used the knowledge he has amassed from Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller to develop the atom bomb out of uranium and plutonium.  More about this in the review about Oak Ridge, coming up.<br /><br />It was the plane 'Enola Gay' which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima  and the pilot reportedly went insane out of remorse for what he had been forced to do.  It was in retaliation for the burning of a hotel in Japan by them full of our American POWs who were trapped and burned to death in the inferno.  Truman made the decision to drop the bomb, which infuriated me no end until, just a few years, Naomi Blanco did a review for the Magazine Club about the hotel diaster.  She is from Cuba.  The co-authors of this book obey one edict:  \\"get both sides\\" for all stories.  They have written RUIN FROM THE AIR, THE DAY THE BUBBLE BURST, PONTIFF and THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED.

Some people consider him the best-selling Christian author in history.  I'd say that at least half of his stories and writing is non-religious.  He will be best known for THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, soon to be out as a scary movie.  I like scary movies, so I took out the children's classic to prepare myself for w world of  his wildest imagaination. <br /> <br />He was an Oxford Don and Cambridge Professor when a young divorced woman with a son entered his life and changed it forever.  He'd been considered an \\"intellectual prig\\" but he fell in love and wrote his own \\"Ode to Joy\\" called SURPRISED BY JOY, and A GRIEF OBSERVED after she died and he felt that he would, too.  He also wrote C.S. LEWIS ON LOVE; he was doubting his Christian beliefs when Joy and her son entered his world and changed it for the better.  It made him human.  A good biography is JACK: A LIFE OF C.S. LEWIS by George Sayer. <br /> <br />During the war, he broadcasts on BBC his imaginative Christian truth and influenced the listeners with his use of Medieval and Renaissance English.  These became his internationally known book, MERE CHRISTIANITY.  I'd say he was a genius who needed a woman to bring him down to earth. <br /> <br />He'd written THE SPACE TRILOGY (early Science Fiction), devotionals, inspirational writngs like 'JOY'FUL CHRISITAN and MIRACLES.  He became known for THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS and played with A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS; his book was called THE PILGRIM'S REGRESS. <br /> <br />Besides the bulk of his religious work, he also wrote such things as THE ABOLITION OF MAN, THE GREAT DIVORCE, VIRTUE AND VICE AND PRESENT CONCERNS.  His physical ails and Joy's debilitating illness which took her form him left him doubting God.  He has many concerns and questions of the faith which had let him down.  We all have \\"present concerns\\" mine are looming large at present. <br /> <br />For children, he WROTE THE HORSE AND HIS BOY, THE DARK TOWER, and many others including the marvelous NARNIA series, notjust THE LIAN, WITCH AND WARDROBE.  He left quite a legacy in words.  \\"His life is beacon for all who struggle with doubt and faith in Christ.\\" <br /> <br />Derick Bingham lives in the county where Lewis did his writing and shows how the environment of Belfast and the County Down influenced Lewis' imagination.  He has written THE WILD-BIRD CHILD and twenty-two other books.  He is a teaching pastor with ChristChurch in Belfast.  Who knows, he may become the next C. S. Lewis for Christians everywhere.	2005-08-22

In 1888, at New York's Academy of Music, Maggie Fox announced to the packed audience that all of her previous forty years of practicing spiritualism was all a hoax.  At the age of fifteen, she and her sister Katy rapped out messages they claimed came to them from the spirit world.  They created 'raps' by manipulating their toe joints.<br /><br />They became overnight celebrities with this novelty and some of the most prominent people of that era were entranced with the Fox sisters and their performances.  Among these were Horace Greely ('Go West, Young Man'), Elisha Kent Kane, William James, and others.<br /><br />She became disenchanted with hoaxing the world after her husband died and she chose the time and place to make her scandalous confession,  And yet, her spirit lives on.

I once went to a fortune teller (with my sister-in-law in Maryland) who looked at the lines in my hands and asked if I had three children.  I told her, \\"No, I have two sons.\\"  Within the year, another son was born.  And I am not a believer in tea-leaf readings, hand fortune telling, nor the possiblility of spirits who have gone on to the Great Beyond lingering to cause such an uproar as the Fox sisters did with their mischief, which got out of hand.<br /><br />Nancy Stuart, after whom Geoffrey was named, used letters  as the primary source for this memoir of Maggie Fox, a Victorian girl who rocked the religious, social and spiritual world of her time.

Franklin Graham is carrying on the ministry of his father (Billy Graham) to reach out to the poor and downtrodden in today's world and show them that God wants us to live life to the fullest.  He focuses on principles and promises essential to a full life if we are to be in 'sync' with God's design for us.  We each are put here on earth for a purpose and, sometimes, it takes almost the entire lifespan to determine our purpose, but it is there waiting to be discovered, so that we can live a life of peace, joy, excitement, and fulfillment before we die.    These real-life stories of people who survived under \\"the most challenging circumstances imaginable\\" are amazing and inspiring.  Franklin was a rebel for awhile before realizing that his role in today's world is to teach the rest of us what his dad has been doing for nearly fifty years.  His autobiography was called REBEL WITH A CAUSE.  He has written other books about miracles and religiousity and lives in Boone, North Carolina.    The photo section tells a story with each picture.  It is true that one picture is worth a thousand words.  They add interest to any book, especially those about real people and not figments of someone's imagination.

This is another government project gone bad.  To harm an innocent child in this  debilitating way (forcing dangerous chemicals in his little body and all he can do is cry, then lose his ability to talk, act like other kids, and will always be looked down on as 'backward') calls for a lot of compensation from the harming department, as the human being who was innoculated with the tainted serum has been basically turned into a mute.    I see the grown up autistic 'workers' on the bus every day and I talk to them as if they were normal, and yet I can not understand half they want to tell me.  My grandson, Eric Mather, is one of the victims of this mercury poisoning which affected his brainwave connections, and he will be maimed for the rest of his life.  He will never be normal, and he is such a lovely child.  On the phone, I heard his first words to me, \\"Thank you for the toys.\\"  When I said, \\"Oh, you CAN talk.  I would love to see you.\\"  He used his brain when he said \\"I would like to see you today.\\"  That's thinking for himself, the loveable bright-eyed son of Jeff.  The Jewish grown up with the mind of a child and such bright dark brown eyes who rides the bus has a more severe case of autisism, and mostly I don't understand him but try to respond anyway.  He gets frustrated trying to get out all of the words he wants to say.  I don't want Eric to grow up and be in that condition.    No preservatives should ever be injected into a human being.  We all know that they are not safe in foods; who'd willingly have them put straight into the bloodstream knowing the danger they pass on, creating a disabled person for the rest of his or her life.  Those I talk with on the buses can't relate to others and their feelings.  One woman of forty with the mind of a child told me that her dad died.  To her, it was just a fact, nothing to be emotional about.  When I told her than my oldest grandson had died in a car accident, it made no difference to her as she could not relate.I hope that David Kirby will follow through on his research and become an activist for the disabled who can't speak for themselves and for the financial advantages they have lost because of this faulty vaccine.  They will never be able to work at high paying jobs or be educated as fully as they would have had this not happened to them.  He can do more than any parent as he has access to the press, and he is someone the government will listen to.  Now that he has started this project, he owes it to the parents of these children maimed in such a way by the inefficiency of our own government to use his power to report what is going on, in all of its illegal and inhumane ways.	2005-08-22

In 1970, I knew such a man who was into the thing called 'free love.'  His last name was almost the same as hers, Meier, and he was from Indiana.  He was in a play at the college in which my youngest child was a minor character.  He was the musical & youth director at our church and supervised the 'Youth House.'  I would not allow my teenage sons to take part in any activities there.  When I questioned him about his idea of 'free love,' I inquired about the young girls.  He told me, 'they are jail bait.'  I wasn't aware that he had just got out of jail when he came to our town as a prospective Methodist minister with a wife and three daughters.  That seemed normal enough until he fondled the wrong boy and ended up in jail again, was even caught bringing drugs into the jail after a visit home.  He was personable and had a 'good life' before him if he could have just left the young males alone.  He died as far away from that town as his wife could find, so that we would not know that he died of AIDS.  A sad story all started with his Hoosier idea of 'free love' transferred to a small Tennessee town where mothers watch their children.  No one ever suspected him of wrong doing and we were all stunned he had served time in an Indiana prison for burglary. <br /> <br />Olivia Brown is a woman alone, having lost both of the men in her life to death.  She becomes attached to a private detective hwo lives in her apartment house and is soon flaunting Prohibition at a speakeasy (club) called Chumley's.  She finds a dead woman who is the exact double of her, and must find the murderer before everyone laments the fate of one with so much promise -- like Bob Meier -- who died too young. <br /> <br />It is a good Twenties style mystery and the lifestyle of that era with so much denied the ordinary person, but life in the fast lane was plentiful and dangerous.  Even the movie stars of that time lived a scandlous and tormented L. A. party scene with drugs, liquor and loose morals.	2005-08-21

Jeff Davis, beloved by many in the South and known as the president of the Confederacy during the Civil War died from heartbreak and mistreatment and looked old in his coffin on Dec. 5, 1889.  His funeral train was as popular as Lincoln's removal to his home state of Illinois and much later FDR's train trip back from Georgia to Washington, D. C.    When his body was laid in state in New Orleans, the prominence of the U. S. flags illustrated his burial as an officer in the American Army prior to his notoriety during the Civil War.  He was first buried in a tomb of the Army of Northern Virginia in Metairie Cemetery.    In May 28-31, 1893, after it has been displayed in the rotunda of the state capital in Raleigh, North Carolina, it was sent on to Richmond, Virginia.  The route of the Jefferson Davis funeral train left New Orleans, stopped in Beavoir, Mobile, Montgomery, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, Greensboro, also stopped in Danville, Virginia.  The funeral carriage was a remodeled artillery caisson  with the U. S. flag prominently displayed.  His remains were transferred to Hollywood Cemetery, The Third National Flag of the Confederacy decorated the head of his final resting place, with the Battle Flag at the foot.  There is a bronze statute on his grave in the Davis Circle family plot at the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.    Much maligned after the South lost the war, he was imprisoned in shackles and chains at Fort Monroe.  His life and reputation has sunk to a seemingly unredeemable low.  During the first three years after his death, his public image was ressurrected to a state of near adulation, and his fellow Southerners recognized him as one of their most important sons.  He remains so today.    The reburial three and a half years after his death demonstrated that Southerners increasingly were growing more overtly proud of the Confederacy.  On June 3, 1907, a remarkable monument designed by Valentine and Noland was unveiled on what would have been his 99th birthday.  It still stands in the park named in his honor in Memphis.  It included the Confederate flags and symbols.  Let by a group of University of Tennessee professors from the North, they are trying to have his memorial park renamed and the statue removed.    It was a great American and did what he thought was best for the South, his beloved countryside.  It's too bad that his life following the Civil War was so harmful to his health and what he had stood for.  The flag has been removed from South Carolina's state flag, and Maryville College here in Tennessee can't keep their Rebel flag.  What on earth is going on?  Do those Northerners want another Civil War?  It is best to leave dead dogs buried and the prejudices along with them.  We natives of the South will always love Jeff Davis and what he stood for; the flag will never die.  Resurrection is at hand.    This historian has also written WAR CRIME OR INJUSTICE? GENERAL GEORGE PICKETT AND THE MASS EXECUTION OF DESERTERS IN CIVIL WAR KINSTON, NORTH CAROLINA and AN UNQUIET TIME: ALABAMA AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, 1950-68, among many other Southern history.	2005-08-21

In her first book, Nancy Good explains that 'a difficult man is any man: how to love him, and why bother.'  Well, I tell you when the heart says this is the one for me, you just can't help but bother,  It's worth all the bother, hardship, and hurt just to know the person you adore -- even if he hurts you with his anger.  I tell people that 'everyone needs someone to fight with' and they listen and wonder, \\"Is this woman crazy?\\"  But I go on to explain that if he won't love you but will contine after four + years to 'fight' with you, that means 'something.' <br /> <br />The difficult man puts up walls and is afraid to uncover his emotional side, unless it is in 'putting you down.'  When you value such a person, no matter how critical he may be.  Difficult men come in all shapes and sizes.  He said I had an 'identity' problem, but I recognized him recently just as soon as the got off the bus I was getting on; I told him 'If I know you from the rear, I certainly know you in the face.'  He has the most fantastic (gentle) blue eyes, and I have told him when he didn't want to hear, \\"I'd know those eyes anywhere.\\" <br /> <br />Men have a hold over the woman who cares deeply for him, but can a woman ever get what she wants from the man in her life.  She has to remember that her feeling do count; express them anyway you can to let him know he does not have the upper hand over you.  When he remembers something which may have happened (men do have selective memories!) two and a half years ago -- maybe it was four and a half, but who's counting -- tell him to stop holding a grudge, real or imaginary.  How can you go back in time to say \\"I'm sorry.\\"   Well, I tell you, that's not what he wants -- he wants something to 'hold over you' and make you cringe and under his will.  That's not a good place to be anywhere, anytime. <br /> <br />Mainly, men don't like complainers; I've learned that the hard way as they simply say you are being 'negative' and they want you to be happy and pessimistic even when you don't feel like it.  Don't fake it.  All of us have low days and high days, and if he really cares, you wants to know how you are really feeling. <br /> <br />Most married women today would say that the husband is a difficult person.  She must made an effort to understand the problems and begin to work at making the relationship a rewarding one, and we're not talking sex here.  If you want to stay married, you have to work at it.  Life is hard.  Marriage is a continuing learning experience, and if you don't keep up with the times, that husband will find him a younger woman.  They most always do, sooner or later.  Now, marrying her is a completely different matter to go into later.   <br /> <br />Nancy Good is a psychotherapist and followed up with this book with LOVING A DIFFICULT MAN.  I think we all do, man or woman.	2005-08-21

Hayden thinks he's on his last days and decides not to take his own dying lying down.  Like a strange neighbor I had in Pulaski, Evelyn Medley, he starts attending funerals as a hobby.  He decides to get things in order before the big day by finding the perfect husband for his daughter Diana who can help her raise sweet, little Joey.  He chooses Hank who is contemplating entering the priesthood.    While he is involved in tying strings on his package deal of having his family taken care of, he finds a love of his own at a ballgame, Rosamund, whose heavy silver cross hit him in the face.  He sees stars and feels young again.  Young enough to teach a nun how to love, and live in his world peppered with odd-ball characters.    He is Scottish and his bagpipe-playing friends belong to the Greyfriars Gang.  Rosamund's life in the convent hasn't prepared her to deal with such complicated people.  A lot like Jan Karon's old pastor who finds love and a totally different outlook on life when he counsels an ill parishioner.      Hayden decides to go out with a bang and postpone his final call.  Hope I can do the same.  In 'Brigadoon, one of my favorite musicals, Mr. Lundie wisely advised the young lovers, \\"If you love somebody, anything is possible, even miracles.\\"  In this book, \\"sometimes the heart want 'one more for the road.\\"    She has written HEART'S DESIRE, BEGINNER'S LUCK and GOING AWAY PARTY.  If she continues as she has started, she will be a full fledged romance author in no time at all.	2005-08-21

Why is it ... to struggle for compassion with old Glory?	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Long May It Wave, Mr. Cameron!	Many People Love This Flag!  It is a banner of Freedom from oppression by a vile government who had no right to divide the country.  James Cameron should know better: in Tennessee, we've had some stubborn retaliations about the original flag. According to this book, the first flag was the one used in the Civil War which the Nathan Bedford Forrest    restored Klan  adopted, the Confederate fighting flag. I had read and related how Betsy Ross had not designed the American Stars and Stripes but merely sewed it for her friend, George Washington. It seems that many primary school teachers were instructing the young minds that Betsy Ross had indeed made it from her own design. She used her own material, true, as she was a seamstress and used what she had on hand with this request for a national flag with no preparation. <br /> <br />Thank God for the South being first again! Even after the American Revolution in which we were granted our freedom from the British, we continued to use the (red,white&blue) color combination (Spain has yellow and red) as no one was in a hurry to be original. They came up with something in 1777, a year after the Constitution was signed in Philadelphia. <br /> <br />A nearby high school has had their Rebel flag taken from them after all of the heritage and history of the school. In Nashville, a crude silver & gold statute of Nathan Bedford Forrest, as designed and welded by a local attorney, was installed out by I65 with several Rebel flags in a semi-circle. Much was made of this desecreation to a united nation, and they were told to remove them promptly. Years later, they are still in place where they can be seen by all of the travelers going South of Nashville and the locals as they use the Interstate to work. <br /> <br />A flag is a flag is a flag. In the review I did about Civil War poems and songs, there were some about the Stars & Stripes as important to all of the soldiers. In Knoxville, the families were split and all I knew about thisdat-blame war was that it was 'brother against brother.' That's how it was in this town and the counties surrounding the Smoky Mountains as shown so clearly in the movie, 'Cold Mountain.' <br /> <br />We paid for a U. S. flag which had hung over the Capital building in Washington, D.C. at the urging of Robin Beard, later an ambassador to Korea. He was our district representative and I had chased him down the halls with my red, white and blue hat flapping.  <br /> <br />The flag is a symbol of this country and decorates the caskets of all veterans. It is a venerable treasure, but I let my brother take the one off my dad's, as he already had the one from his son's coffin earlier. Neither died in any war, but had been a member of the armed forces of this country. The flag is for all of us to revere and every family should own one. I know someone who said he would hang the Confederate flag out of his office window if he could get away with it, and yet his family were for the North. He is not a Rebel, nor ever would be, so I was proud of his claims, which proved to be false. He just likes to write controversial things to create some kind of action. This is such a boring, old town. The flag perks up any rally, picnic or gathering (political or non-political). Everyone in America loves that glorious old flag which stands for freedom.	2005-08-20

I find THE DIALOGUE OF EARTH AND SKY (2004) more interesting than this earlier story of the Aztecs beliefs by this same writer. It's a more in-depth study of the modern Aztec underworld in Mexico and the dreams which may heal and cure souls removed by these witches.    In this real-life mystery, he tried to be a healer to restore a child's soul (tonal).  The thing to make me want this book was his 'dedication' \\"For the white-haired woman who insisted I embrace her tradition,\\"as it shows how some educated people respect and honor white-haired women.  In the Indian culture, the woman is the head of the tribe, not the chief.  We have a \\"sculpture\\" bust of a Cherokee woman in the courtyard of the old Whittle complex, now a federal court system.    It proves that a white-haired woman has more wisdome than a 48-yr-old male who has maybe two years more of college education than she.  Liife is an education, and reading will educate a person more than any teacher.  I know, because I was married to a college professor and have two sons who are college professors, one a PhD, two wives of those sons with PhDs.    It does not take a degree, though I do have one, to make an educated person and certainly not one to write short columns.  Now that last, extra long (with some duplication -- after all, it was written over a period of three weeks) article was scholarly and I asked him, \\"When did you get so good?\\"  Four years ago, it was too many \\"that's\\" which caused me to start criticising my favorite writer.  How on earth could he go from that state to one of scholarly discourse with very few \\"that's\\"?  Did he listen to this white-haired woman and study a bit of grammar on the side?  I doubt it as he is too busy following local bands along on the Amtrack as a groupie and writing weird things about New Orleans where his son is in school.      The Mother Mary stature is showed on the title page of this book with other religious symbols.  Yet, this book is not about religion, but aboutthe devil's work.  It would take an actual devil to steal a child's soul.  Children are born with a purity we lose only in adolescence.  I had thought at one time that my youngest son was a 'bad seed.' and sometimes still wonder how he got to be so bad.  He was, after all, brought up in the United Methodist Church.    Timothy Knab is an Amreican anthropologist who has become an expert on the Aztecs and regales us about the dark past of San Martin.  Since I graduated from Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tennessee, perhaps some of San Martin's devilishness entered my body (not the soul) as I've had to deal with voodoo at the last place I lived here, and the devil incarnate followed me from there to here.  God works in mysterious ways and will protect the innocent and pure at heart.  Devils are here to test our beliefs and to transform some into bad, bad people who become non-human.  You can see it in their eyes.	2005-08-20

This was an optimistic 'dream' when they ousted Clinton and the Democrats.  Bush did not win that election.  The state of Florida conspired so that the Governor's brother would take over even though Tennessean Al Gore had the most votes.  That is hypocrisy.  That is anarchy.   <br /> <br />All of these thing they hyped as their agenda didn't matreialize:  Strengthen the family (Ha), Balance the Budget (Clinton already had it balanced -- it is far in the red now and two wars taking place with no end in sight), and Replace the Welfare State.  They didn't replace it, they almost demolished it.  After all, both Bushes are wealthy and don't know what it is to be needy.  Now, TennCare which Clinton's administration started in 1994 as an example to all of America has failed big time.  We can't get any of the medicines we need, nor the medical care.  Many of us will die as a result. <br /> <br />Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey either had big ideas for the House of Representatives, but it didn't work either.  The Senate is over the House, so why all the hype about something they could not possibly do.  2002 has come and gone and the budget is 100% worse than it was in 1994; that's because of the military costs and now the cost of gasoline is skyrocketing here -- because we put those oil wells out of business in the Persian Gulf and now Iran and Iraq.  What do they expect -- that we will all stand up and cheer for their failures. <br /> <br />Had Clinton not been such a randy fellow and ignored the demands of the country's future, the Republicans would not have had the chance to foul up royally.  I picked this book because of the flag on the cover.	2005-08-20

Caleb was a man of tenancios action who she had designated at 'The Warrior.'  According to the Bible, Joshua secceeded Moses (both of whom we are familiar) as the Jewish nation's leader.  It was Caleb who pushed the people to put their faith into action.  His example of courage saved men's lives during the wars of Biblical times.  Always there have been wars and talks of wars, since the beginning of man. <br /> <br />After writing three of her series (Five Incredible Women in the Bible who changed eternity) about Tamar, Ruth, and Bathsheba -- here, she turns to her new series (Sons of Encouragement).  She'd already finished THE PRIEST, with THE WARRIOR (Caleb) as the second in a series of five. <br /> <br />These were real men who lived on the edge but had the courage to take risks.  They were not perfect; no one is, and sometimes made big mistakes.  The books are termed historical fiction as she created dialogue, internal motivations, action which were not listed in the accounts of these men in the Bible; in some case, she created additional characters.  Our local historian does the same, but don't tell him I revealed the secret of his popularity; he knows how I feel. <br /> <br />I have read some of Francine Rivers' novels prior to 1985, which she calls for 'the general market.'  She has another series out about Enduring Grace.  In her books the past ten years, she has preached and used a lot of Bible verses.  But the audience she is appealing to at this point will bypass these books without more promotion.  The others are not listed in the titles available on Amazon.com, so I can't remember which I have read without a bibliography.  A person who aims at nothing has a target he can't miss.

Ms Williamson bases this book on ten simple changes which aid in growth and rebirth. She calls them \\"key bridges on transformation: \\"forgetting who we are, to remembering who we are, negative thinking to positive love, anxiety to atonement, living in the past and future, to living in the present, separation to relationship, focus on guilt to focus on innocence, asking for spiritual help to change the world, to praying that He will change us, your plan to His plan, spiritual death to rebirth, and who we were, to who we are becoming. <br /> <br />We need to concentrate on these things that don't change and, by doing so, we can transform our world into a place of grater love and peace. In a world such as ours, the key is learning to slow down. The world we desire and should stive for emanates from a spiritual stillness which takes root in our souls. <br /> <br />The real failure in life is not growing from what we go through, the good and the bad. We grow as a person with the changes we go through. I have grown as a writer the past three years through embiosis by reading others, specifically this last year. She believes in miracles, and I need one right about now. She is a bright star in God's firmament.	2005-08-19

She is a radio talk show psychologist who had been threatened by a person who tried to abuse her in her own apartment in New York and, it seems, is playing tricks with her mind and heart.  She observed the real programming on WOR 710 am in New York City so as to be able to appear authentic in the way one of those unique individuals handle difficult callers.    She proves what I've often advocated, that most novels are factual.  She admits that she \\"strives to convey every nuance and detail as authentically as possible\\" and uses knowledgeable authorities in all of the subject matter in qustion.  She advers that \\"any departure from reality is 'my responsibility' -- a literary license she avails of only when it's absolutely necessary.\\"      Some of the action has nautical settings which she researched to make it appear as real-like as possible.  \\"Radio is the theater of the mind.\\"  As Eddy Roy once said to me, 'the mystrey of radio' as you can't see what's happening, so you must use your imagination.  It's better that way, as t.v. has sated us with reality shows which are ad infinatum.      She says she is incredibly lucky to have such a family who offers creative input, enthusiastic support, and a reason to believe.  They put her in touch with the right people at the right time.    The e-mail threatens, \\"I'll be watching you.\\"  The man who tried to assault her was killed in a yacht incident, or was he?  Could it be his twin brother who is intent on scaring the wits out of her and keep her living in fear.    Ms. Kane has written numerous romances and suspense thrillers including her first RUN FOR YOUR LIFE (in 2000, main character, Zach Hamilton), WISHES IN THE WIND, MY HEARTS DESIRE, and WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME.

If all families were like this one, there would be no more 'Miss America' pageants or winners or contestants.  There would be nothing but chaos.  Pixie had been in the 1970 Miss America pagaent representing the small state of New Jersey.  Now, it is 1987 in Greenville, Delaware, as she remembers things from times past and her sixteen-year-old son, Eric, devises his own set of rules.    This is a most dysfunctional mother/son (absentee dad) and a very ill grandmother.  The cover showing the long pink silk dress is reminiscent of Sandra Bullock in the movie, 'Miss Congeniality.'  Most of Pixie's remembrances are prosaic, and some less than desirable.  The twin-spin (Eric's rules and Pixie's faulty memory) shows the dark side of the American family.  She had wanted to be Miss America so that she could have the perfect family.    Pixie's mother, after a debilitating stroke, discloses some skeletons in the family closet.  The consequences prove disastrous to Eric when he discovers his biological father is gay.  Here are Eric's rules:  (l) Have a set of rules to live by like a monk or an army general, or a debutante so that you always know just what to do and say. (2) Always agree with women, no matter what they're saying, even if you don't understand them. (3) If you can't play the guitar, or if you do but don't have a guitar handy, the next-best thing with women is to do what you're told, to follow directions. (4) Eventually, things come undone.

When I saw this old-fashioned-looking paperback at the library, I thought it meant all \\"mom's\\" not just those inexperienced yuppies who had no idea how to raise children.  I thought it was for all of us.  But I was mistaken.  Just as I was mistaken that I could wait downstairs where the movie, 'Neverland,' would be shown in the meeting room in the place where I had attended the bus meetings for two years.  Foolish old lady, got there 40 minutes early, and I was told by a young library clerk in no uncertain terms that I COULD NOT wait where there was lots of light (to see the Metro Pulse) and a comfortable chair. I would have to return upstairs where so much distraction takes place, and no comfort whatsoever.  I could not even enter the children's section unless I had a child with me!  What about that!  And I am not a 'dirty old man.'    With this book, I've located a real 'liberal'-- something I was accused of being by a stranger at the downtown p.o. which locks the doors at 5 p.m.  The homeless are so prolific here one con man had plastic bags on his feet and asked if I had some change to buy him some shoes.  I'd already been approached by another such with good tennis shoes on one of the buses who wanted change to buy some hiking boots!  Marg Stark's father was a liberal Presbyterian minister; she got her M.A. degree in journalism at Northwestern U.  Being from a good background and a college education did not prepare her for coping with a child on a daily basis.    It would be nice if colleges would offer a basic training on how to take care of baby or baby and bigger brother to unsophisticated would-be parents.  That way, there would be less postpartum depression and desperation, as the young dad does not know anymore than the young mom.  My first two sons were less than two years apart, and the hardest thing for me was washing the diapers in the kitchen sink. Wives don't have to do that any more.  I grew with my children, but I was not 33 and college-educated,yet my husband was -- he knew nothing about babies or women as his mother was sick all the time, and his father had started a new family with a new wife in Georgia.    I coped because I had to cope.  I grew up without a mother, so I played ball and built snowmen (threw snow balls) and generally could associate with the boys more than their college professor father.  I was able to explain things on a child's level with simple words, and he could not.  I was late starting reading to the first, when he was two, as no one had said that was the thing to do.  A young girl, whose parents were educators and they lived in a nice house next to the apartment house where we were, asked if she could give some of her outgrown books to my child.  I said, \\"he is too young, honey,\\" and she educated me, \\"No ma'm, you can read to him now.\\"    This woman still has sex on her mind and wonders how to do it with the little ones around.  What you do is wait for their naps and then do what you did before they were born, and nine months later a brother or sister will join the group.  She previously wrote a book about sex after the honeymoon.  It used to be that generally that is why you married, to have sex legally whenever you wanted to. Just wait until you get older.  I am not told anything important, like where they will be or significant events in their lives, not even when my oldest grandson was killed in a car accident.      Motherhood is not all it is made up to be.  It's different now than when I was born at home.  It's a lot more complicated than it was when I was a young mom.  When I started working in PTA as room mother, local president, regional director, etc., I was one of the youngest and prettiest moms.  It made my two older sons happy to have such a nice and important mom.  Then, the baby was 13 yrs. younger than the second, and when he brought home a pal from school, I heard his visitor ask, \\"Is she your grandma?\\"    Life is not better when you get old.  Enjoy those youngsters while they are young, as they will be grown and gone before you know it.  Or, like Tristan, dead in a car wreck.  The early years of parenthood are not the best.  That, I think, would be the middle years.  Each cycle is different and has its own challenges.	2005-08-18

Politics is considered as a means to an end that lies outside itself.  When force is used to create freedom, political principles vanish.  She wonders if politics do have any meaning at all anymore.      She finds politics to be the never-ending endeavor of the plurality of humans to live together and share in mutually guaranted freedom.  This is 'the promise of politics.'  She questions the relation of politics to human freedom.  I think that her understanding of politics is worldwide and not American.  I know only the U. S. version, and it is back-stabbing with constant lies about the opponent (a negative effect on the candidates and the voters), promises of things which will never happen (and the politician knows it when he makes the false promises).  Politics is dirty business.    Today's politics is nothing like that of the Greeks (beginning), Romans (founding) nor the Christian (forgiving).  Here we believe in the division between church and state, thereby keeping these two entities separate.  They are completely different in precept and beliefs and deeds which seem to be foreign as Spain is from Japan.    This is an intellectual thesis written in the '50s (and my! have things changed since then -- no more Kennedys in power, no Krushchev who had a hole in his shoe, no more totalitarianism or corrupt Jews.  She bases her political thoughts on philisophy.  She has written EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM, THE JEW AS PARIAH, THE HUMAN CONDITION, THE LIFE OF THE MIND, and RESPONSIBILITY AND JUDGEMENT.  She is a deep thinker on the subjects of 'revolution,' 'violence,' 'political philosophy,' 'Jewish identity,' 'understanding,' and 'love.'    She was born in Germany and migrated to the U. S. after WWII where she has taught at Berkeley, Princeton, University of Chicago, and the New School for Social Research.  She died thirty years ago.	2005-08-17

This book is about conservatism, radical politics, liberals, and Soviet espionage (like a spy novel).  This was the 'same old, same old' personal attacks on innocent people back in 1954, called just another Communist Hunt.  McCarren was called a 'force of nature' in American politics,' and Lyndon Johnson called him 'an earth shaker.'    Because of this powerhouse Democrat (worse than McCarthy tenfold), many distinguished diplomats in the United States State Department and those in the movie business lost their careers, including Alger Hiss.  This is like history but there's too much ancient history ad infidunum. Truman said, \\"the McCarran Committee became more of an inquisition than an investigation.\\"    McCarran was a mere sheepherder from Nevada, the son of illiterate immigrants from where?  Who cares where he's from?  He was a danger in this regard, having taught himself to become a feared defense attorney and challenged McCarthy even.    Written by Michael J. Ybarra, it is like a 800-page Russian novel.  He graduated from Berkeley and received a grad degree there in political science.  My daughter-in-law Valerie also has one from Vanderbilt.

In the workplace, 'ethics' is nothing more than a substitute for morals.  Corporate leaders must set forth fundamental principles, values and rules of behavior.  Ethics is a detergent word, used time and time again to cleanse consciences without scrubbing.  They use words like 'corportae social responsibility' and 'sustained development.'  Ethics proves that business can ale abound profitable with ethics at the top of the list.    In theory, everyone can say what he or she thinks.  You're free to talk but there's the catch: you can talk as much as you like and nothing will ever change.  Talk is cheap and costs the company nothing.  I run into that non-cooperating at the bus meetings as no matter who has been hurt, and you know the supervisor or driver who did the abusing, nothing is ever done.  They are still there day after day continuing to be nasty and mean to the riders.  I've quit calling in complaints, but get up at public forum to inform the few people there about some of the things which are happening.  None of the committee members ride the buses, so it is empty talk -- nothing is ever done.    Sometimes you have to jump in order to climb.  There are many rungs on the corporate latter, and to reach a higher one you need to be motivated and not lazy. Laziness will get you nowhere, at home, at work, or in the car.	2005-08-17

Written by the author of BEYOND BELIEF, who went too far in criticizing a fellow writer in 1993, culminating in a trial for which she had to pay dearly.  In her book, DENYING THE HOLOCAUST, she called David Irving, a respected writer, 'one of the most dangerous spokesmen of the denial movement' and he sued her for slander.  That was his right according to the Constitution of the United States.  This is about that trial. <br /> <br />She should have known there'd be repercussions.  No surprize about that!  Some people the freedom of speech and expression too far.  Some women just don't learn and make the same mistakes over and over.  I am one of them, and I do vocalize my strong opinions.  But, in the past three years, I've learned how to say \\"I'm sorry\\" -- too late.   <br /> <br />She had to raise 1.5 million dollars for her defense.  You'd think that would make her think twice of learn to keep some opinions to herself, no matter how strong they are.  Actually, they don't mean anything to others, as they are simply 'opinions' and not facts.  I have some family members who will 'win at any cost.'  I've learned to go back and apologize if I have offended someone, but it was a hard lesson -- not easily learned or accomplished.  She paid big bucks to secure the services of Princess Diana's divorce lawyer, Anthony Julius.  The case was that big.  I'd say the woman was pretty scared to go to those extremes.  She looks more like Sarah Ferguson than Diana. <br /> <br />A lot (too much really) has been written about the holocaust and Auschwitz because of Anne Frank's diary.  To uncover new evidence at this late date just won't happen.   It was a tragedy, but it's over; it's in the past.  Some people won't 'let dead dogs lie' -- a local perservationist group (mostly UT people) stir up trouble all the time.  They couldn't save a local 'historical' house  a far piece out from downtown (the historic area) located on a golf course.  But they are still badgering the city council,for the publicity! <br /> <br />Gas chambers were not unique to Germany.  We had them in our prisons, after the gallows.  Ethel Rosenberg was the first woman in America to be legally 'gased.\\"  Now, they use a more 'humane' type of execution (is there such a thing?) by legal injection. <br /> <br />It has been proven that Hitler's genocide of the Jewish people is just that.  He wanted a 'pure' race.  He is the precursor of the modern KKK, who believes in white power.  There is no way to exonerate Hitler.  He was not misguided -- he was evil, and that's why he chose to commit suicide when he was caught. <br /> <br />We all have 'fighting words' especially rednecks, billbilly, white trash, polok, ignoramus, niggers, etc.  A Jester's costume is for a fool.  I hope Deborah Lipstadt has learned a hard lesson about fairness for the other guy no matter how strongly you feel that he is in the wrong.	2005-08-17
107374:US	35985708	R941V9C6A6SKA	0399151605	67097076	Divining Women (Gibbons, Kaye)	Books	3	1	4	N	N	God Divined Women To Be The Strong Ones, Bearing Children.	This is the first novel Kaye Gibbons has written in the last seven years.  Her prior six books were about strong women and the compelling wisdom of varied women.  Joseph Campbell wrote: \\"Wherever you are -- if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.\\"    The strong woman in this dark novel of emotional abuse by a husband is Maureen Ross.  This was the time(August, 1918) during the Great Flu Epidemic and Maureen was expecting a child.  Her husband, Troop, was not just a bully; he had mental problems as well.  Throughout their marriage (loveless, though it turned out to be), he had battered her spirit into despair by so much verbal abuse, just like my husband did to me.  Older men tend to take out all of their inadequacies on a young wife.  I was given notice prior to the marriage, but I was promised a 4-yr. college education if I would marry him.      Maureen felt that she would die in childbirth and not from the influenza.  Eurora Welty remembers the Great Epidemic of 1918 thusly: \\"We had a bird whose name was Inza.  I opened a window, and in-flew-Inza.\\"  That was the way they explained death to little children back then.    Troop became more and more demanding as the baby's birth approached and his actions against his wife worsened.  He tormented her by constantly taunting her for her 'low birth.'  Men like him choose those he feels he can tower over and can 'educate' (change to his liking.) Things roll along (though not very smoothly) as long as the wife is docile, but we all know that Kaye Gibbons creates 'strong' women.  Maureen, however, has convinced herself that she will die in childbirth.  Her niece is brought in to help her through the last weeks before the baby mades its appearance, and takes up for Maureen against Troop.  He goes 'over the edge' as Maureen succumbs to the flu.    This story is like the phoenix in many ways, resurrecting love and hope from its very ashes.  After her death, Troop realizes that with his memories of the good times, she is unbound and unloosened with her flight.  \\"Some will tell you to endure.  You tell them you had rather prevail.\\"    So often, these pairs happened more in the early nineteenth century when 'arranged' marriages were the norm.  After America 'grew up' and we could choose to marry the person we love, things seemed to be better on the surface.  Most men, however, won't accept a stubborn, hard-willed wife and do all in their power to make the woman suffer.  Thus it was with me as I glided through all the emotional abuse and learned not to show emotion.  My husband even declared, \\"Betty's religion is logical; she won't let her emotions show.\\"    A young girl growing into womanhood with children soon learns survival skills the man would never dream of.  Mainly they do it to secure the future for their children.  The 'last living Confederate widow' was one such much too young for the man who chose her, and was loaded down with many children to care for and raise, almost single-handedly.  Men can hide their mental illnesses from young girls and, with the proper medication, hide it from the world at large.      She wrote A CURE FOR DREAMS, A VIRTUOUS WOMAN and SIGHTS UNSEEN amond others.  This is such a sad story in a way, and uplifting in other ways.  It is triumph over death.  A woman in love will risk dying in childbirth as she needs to produce someone to carry on when she can't; Maureen wasn't in love with Troop, which was a large part of the problem, as she could not show falseness and kindness toward a monster.  When she lost her grip through the flu, he hah no one to torment or fight with, and he came apart.  Times haven't changed all that much.  That kind of man is still around.	2005-08-17

George Armstrong Custer met his fate at the Battle of Little Bighorn.  The Indians were there in masse waiting for 'this good day' to kill their enemy.  It is neve a good day to die.  But we have have to sometimes.  Some sooner, some later.         Wilma Mankiller is a former principal chief of the Cherokee Ntion out in Oklahoma; whe has previously written an account of her chiefdom. I thought the lovely Indian woman on the front cover of her, but it is the head chief woman of the Northern Cheyenne, Gail Small. It was Audrey Shenandoah who said, \\"The main difference between our people and the world around us is the thankfulness and respect for the Earth, our environment, and the natural world. In our way, every day is a good day.\\"    I think we are all thankful to be alive on the earth at this time. Some don't show respect for the natural world, having spent all of their growing up years (and adult, as well) in the inner cities. Al Gore must be part Indian, as am I, because he wrote books about the environment and championed the cause in his campaign for President of the United States.     It is indeed a good day every day we live.  A few years ago, I did my first creative writing for an online Senior Newsletter. I did not know that it was edited and mostly supported by the Native Americans until I wrote an article about being part-Indian. My mailman, a Cherokee, was most respectful to me after that; I don't know how he knew about it as he is not a senior. It was fun, but I was used and abused, let down in a big way by this group. Were I not part Cherokee, I might have ended up resenting the way I was deceived by Valerie who'd promised me a free lunch, but not once made herself known to me.    I do much better with the \\"every day is a good day\\" on Amazon.com. Who needs those who use others, for whatever reason! They are no wiser than the white folks. My mother's family were from Union County (Irish, I think) and they are more honorable country people than any NativeAmericans.    I've attended several of their PowWows here in this town and taken photos of the same costumes, year after year, Their dancing is just shuffling feet as they go round and round in a circle. The men preen as the women show their pride, especially the two white women married to the beautiful males of the Indian Nation. My son looks more Indian than the young one from the Cherokee reservation who talked with me about the red-headed, blue-eyed faux Indian at one of the PowWow.	2005-08-16

This was an inspired name for a small bookstore located in Salt Lake City near the Mormon Tabernacle from 1977.   Betsy Burton had two other co-owners at varied times, but she is the one who perservered and grew along with her unique store.  Oh, I know they are not so unique now and you can find them everywhere, as a novelty (mostly, they tend to move on from town to town, never lasting anywhere long), but she stuck with it and made a grand success out of luring top name writers to 'The King's English' out in Utah.  Quite a feat!    For some odd reason, I had the 'Mother Tongue\\" (British English) confused with the King's English, and was in for a shock to find this book is about one bookstore and not our native tongue.  She had accumulated a large collection of photos of those weird looking writers back in the '70s and '80s (how could John Irving ever be that young?!); many famous writers came to her shop for book signings.  She even had Sir John Mortimer there when he was in this country as professor at Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee.  That was a coup!  Isabel Allende looked fantastic with so many false eyelashes, like a 75-yr-old woman I know here named Diane Boxx.  They are not so becoming on the local person.    We had a marvelous little book shop owned by Bob (now moved on) on Market Square.  He made it a thing to wish to enter with so many beautiful things and any book you wanted; if he did not have it, he could get it -- and did for me a couple of times.  His novelty last year was to wear a Scottish kilt every day of the week except when his four had to be drycleaned, he said.  I asked him the first time I talked with him if he played the bagpipes, as I always take their pictures in every parade I see here.  He said \\"I play them in my shop, a CD.\\" Clever!  I related how I had grown up here thinking that my dead mother had been Irish.  Since he was claiming Scottish ancestry, he said \\"that's close enough.\\"  He was a funny and likeable man.  He had our local celebrity writer to sign books at his store, and when I told him how much I like the historian, he admitted, \\"I like his writings, but not his person very much.\\"  How can anybody not like this person I think is so fabulous.    There are independent bookstores all across the country; in her lists of the best, most are in the west, a few in the northeast, and one from the South (Oxford, Mississippi).  That means she doesn't travel much and has never been to Tennessee, or Georgia.    This memoir, full of lists of every kind, goes from 1980-2003 in her life there at the King's English.  It has been a masterful success.  More power to her.	2005-08-16

We've always heard that if you can't 'beat them' to join them.  This book has the opposite approach -- do not join in with these weird troublemakers.  These authors started their own management  aides with the systematic approach to getting what you want: Neutralize your emotions, Identify type, Control the encounter, Explore options.  In fact, they wrote a book called THE POWER OF NICE.    From grade school on, we have been exposed to bullies, usually the bigger, richer and fatter kids who bully the smaller ones on the playground.  I know someone who was called \\"Carrot Head\\" to make fun of his red hair; he asked me, \\"What were you called on the playground?\\"  I told him I was not singled out to be called anything.  I was active, atlethic for someone so small (a regular little tomboy who could play ball and run with the best of them).  However, my boys were sometimes bullied twenty-five years later.  The older black kids picked on Jeff because he was so much smarter than they, and almost caused him to be hit by a car when he was trying to get away from them on his bicycle.    Zach was sensitive, so he was of the kind who would join so as not to be bullied, and he excelled in sports (for his size) and earned their support and respect.  They thought he was a tough guy and so 'cool' with his swagger -- and he was not ashamed of his musical and artistic talents.    Justin became one of the bullies, as he got in with the bigger boys from the wrong side of the tracks.  He blended in and became one of them, abandoning his music and the arts for the juvenile antics which get one in big trouble.  He will never be a substantial adult as a result.    Tyrants come in all forms and places, not just bosses.  I see some of the bus drivers as tyrants as they rant and rave and take out their frustrations on the riders who are their 'bread and butter;' they know that nothing will be done about it, and they will 'get away' with the verbal abuse.  We don't have to be a Hitler to be a tyrant.  Even a Sunday School teacher can be a tyrant.    About 'impossible people,' I am the expert -- as I sometimes come across to those who don't agree with me as one of those bad, bad stubborn people who won't back down.  They see me as one who is not resistant and will do something about the situation.  They don't see me as I talk about their antics and bad attitudes and abusive ways to City Council and KTA meetings.  Those people don't see me as an 'impossible' person but a concerned citizen.  I sat by a nice woman in Sunday School who said \\"Oh, I have heard your name; you are political.\\"  I replied, \\"No, I am not a Democrat or Republican; I am just verbal and vocal.\\"  I stand up for those who can't and don't know how.  Whether or not I shall continue is in God's hands.    You learn in this book that if you don't rule your emotions, they will rule you.  Know who you're dealing with or you'll never know how to deal with them.  What you don't control often runs amok.  Ultimatums without options lead to impasses.  Fight, Flight or Focus.  There are three different kinds of Difficult: Situationally, strategically and simply.  Knowing which you have in front of you at the moment makes all the difference in how to deal with them and what the outcome will be.  Whether it can be negotiated or simply ignored.      They also teach us how to turn dead ends into detours, why and how options work, \\"how to engage the other side in exploring options,\\" and ending without escalating.  In the beginning, they tell us a grim fairy tale with a happy ending.  They tell us about the 'boss from Hell' but not about the husband or son from hell.  They use colorful stories from all walks of life, from the 'scum' of the earth to the rich and famous.  The authors bring lessons from business life to family life.  That's all, folks!	2005-08-16

He is a naturalist so it was a commonplace thing to do, just grab a backpack and go home.    For me, it was completely different. The Smoky Mountains are just up the road a piece from the place where I was bornas my ancestors came from Cherokee where the reservation has been since antiquity and the native people are still there.  I came back 'home' to a town which still looked the same downtown, but it was as if I were in a foreign country.  No one knew me and, since I have a different accent, considered me as \\"Northern.\\"  Not knowing any of the inhabitants, I was lost the first two years, got sick and went back 'home' to Pulaski to die.    Eight months later, I trekked via Greyhound back to my hometown and met the most wonderful person, God put me in his life.  He was here when I was earlier, but no way on earth could I ever dream I'd actually meet him.  I loved his history lessons on the old Knox. as, growing up here, we were not told any of the things which had occurred here in this two-buck town.  It has stayed backward until now but we have a new, young mayor who hopes to lead his hometown to a future worth the effort.    This was reminiscent of Bill Bryson's A WALK IN THE WOODS, only this Bill was way up East where Bryson had settled after so many years in England; his book was of following the Applachian Trail from the South to the North.  He skipped the Smokies and made a side trip down to the ugliness of Knoxville, Tennessee.    Young Mr. McKibben has previously written THE END OF NATURE, HOPE, HUMAN AND WILD, LONG DISTANCE, WHY WE NEED A GENETIC BILL OF RIGHTS and THE AGE OF MISSING INFORMATION.  He is so bright for his age, as is the person here who helped me get to this point, and will continue to educate the public of the need for more humane treatment for all of the earth's inhabitants.	2005-08-16

Maybe you think that is a little young to enjoy Europe, but not in dog years.  Ella is a very special pet and also one who goes into the hospitals to comfort those who hurt.  Ella takes their hurt away.  I once had a cat which did that for me; I called her my medicine cat.  Just last year, Tosca made a trip of her own to cat heaven; she was nineteen years old in people years.  I saw her rarely the past six years as I had moved some two hundred miles away.  But she was always there for me and spent a lot of time 'comforting' me.  Tosca had arthritis and many ailments, and yet she held on as long as I needed her.  Now, her granddaughter, Star (yes, cats do have generations in families who love them), is doing the same thing.  We take care of each other.    Ella dressed for the occasions as she traveled in style.  In Vienna, she proudly wore her American flag scarf on July 4.  I love the photo of her 'bonjour' to the denizens (bovine) in Belgium.  Michael Konik, her human, had a grand time escorting Ella to places you and I have only dreamed of: the Danube, Monte Carlo, Paris (where she posed in front of the Effeil Tower), Italy, Austria, Prague, Amsterdam, even Berlin.    This was a treat verbally and visually as we travel along vicariously with two handsome people, one canine.  On Saturday, I unexpectedly came across a trio of real Greyhound dogs.  The male, they said was not in good condition, but as I petted him and told him how pretty he was, the shy white girl dog decided maybe she could trust me after all, and let me pet her.  In between was the lovliest of all, a tan sleek Greyhound with tan eyes.  They were all precious.  They are a part of the local Greyhound Rescue Foundation, and have rescued people in perilous places.  We are near the mountains, The Great Smoky Mtns. on one side and the Cumberlands on the other.  Inexperienced hikers are always getting lost.  These canine (so fragile-looking) can make the difference between life and death.    Ella had the time of her life!  Good girl.	2005-08-15

Long ago, when Rosemary Rogers wrote her first Steve & Ginny love story, SWEET SAVAGE LIFE, I wrote to her to tell her how much I got out of it and how much I loved those two characters. Amazingly, she wrote back, and I have that letter stuffed somewhere in my copy of TEA PLANTER'S BRIDE. <br /> <br />After her debut (she must have recived lots of letters such as mine) and two novels in between, she wrote DARK FIRES (part 2 of the Ginny and Steve story). Now, this one SAVAGE DESIRE was released so many years later, how on earth can she still have the ability to have these two lovers so much as they were in the beginning? Now in London 1876 instead of out on the praire where their love began and the parents of twins, they still carry on a temptuous love affair. <br /> <br />The book mark I have in this book is \\"Your Love Is A Treasure.\\" There are twenty-two of her novels available on Amazon.com. I have no idea how many she wrote because I became a sedate married woman who read only non-fiction for some time to become self educated. No self-respecting Southern lady would be caught dead with such a torrid, trashy novel. I also enjoyed AN HONORABLE MAN. <br /> <br />I belonged to a literary club for 36 years and spent time reading other more respectable authors, but I always came back to Rosemary Rogers. She started me out feeling like a woman and now that I am older, helps me to continue those deep feelings, even if they can't be consummated. The one I love belongs to someone else, and really he's too young for me anyway.	2005-08-15

Although I have not read any of her books previously, something about this one seemed so familiar.  Like the Avengers or a movie I saw a couple of years ago. At the age of thirteen, Nick had seen his father (a policeman) killed in a botched robbery and it had always been his great plan to someday find that serial killer and perform his own kind of justice.<br /><br />Finally, he has a lead and he leaves the new wife, Maddy, to pursue it to the bitter end.  They are victims of a hit-and-run driver in front of a convenience store; the other car came directly at them through a red light and if she had not pushed him and they both had fallen over a rock wall, they would have been killed.  The car came up onto the sidewalk and skimmed the wall itself.<br /><br />Maddy starts to worry about exactly who is this man she has married -- a stranger she desires, but discovering the truth is more than any woman would ever want to know.  One day a handsome stranger approached her and asked questions about Nick, then suddenly Nick just disappears.  Just what is going on?<br /><br />Ms. Chittenden has written several novels but, for some reason, she thinks that stuff like upstream and downstream, north, south, east and west are esoteric.  Come on, can any woman be that dumb!  Other published books include SNAP SHOT (and yet she can't even take her own pictures), AS YEARS GO BY, and a series with DYING TO SEE YOU, DYING TO SING etc.	2005-08-14

This is a psychological tool in the vein of C. G. Jung's later insights.  The translators, Rudolph Ritsema is an orientalist and President of a foundation famed for its seminars on Jungian psychology and Stephen Karcher (Ph.D) is co-director of this project.  The oracular symbols and core of this book interact with the reader's mind the way dream images do.  This is the language of I Ching, an active sourcebook for the care of the soul.<br /><br />It is a classic Chinese oracle of change.  The book may change the way you see things and it works wonders on fears, anxieties, desires, with hidden energies which transform you to think in a different way.  It was developed over three thousand years ago in China as a wisdom system.  The good thing about Chinese is that they revere their old people as they are supposed to have gained wisdom with age.  It doesn't necessarily happen that way and, in America, when you are old, you're just old and useless.<br /><br />This books shows how to connect with the inner and outer worlds to seek the wisdom you need for your soul.  The soul is what makes the man, not the physical body.  If a man's soul is dark, it does not matter how handsome he may be, or if he has blue eyes.  They usually are the ones you can't trust anyway.<br /><br />As in India, the Chinese people all have dark eyes and dark hair.  In a computer class at a vo-tech school, a female student from India asked me why they were making fun of a dumb girl whose boyfriend had given her a 'black eye.'  She was concerned as she said that all the Indian people have black eyes.  I told her the tormentors of the girl were not talking about that kind of 'black eye.'  Since I was the oldest student, 42, she thought that I had the wisdom to explain about the color of eyes.<br /><br />This vast translation with concordance is a good reference book for those interested in Eastern philosophy and psychology (study of the mind).  It is mixed together nicely in this large book.	2005-08-14

The Brothers Grimm were not nice little tales of sweetness and light like Hans Christian Andersen.  They used raunchy humor, sexual and physical violence, and gender inequity as a standard--far above the heads of most childrne.  As were the sex scenes in the movie, 'The Parade of the Penguins.'  Thank God. <br /> <br />Fairy tales have always been transmitted orally from the Middle Ages through antiquity.  That is the way our Appalachian ballads and tales ae being done today, and much is lost by not being written down.  They've consisently been about good and evil, rich and poor, heroic and helpless, and humanity and inhumanity.   <br /> <br />Their first published fairy tale was THE FROG PRINCE.  One we will always remember.  From the beginning the tales were too vulgar and violent for young minds.  They used their first published book CHILDREN'S AND HOUSEHOLD FAIRY TALES in 1812 as a literary privilege, to see what they could get away with, and do so with much aplomb.  This was the age of German Romanticism and the Napoleonic Wars.  Goethe was at his peak and 'men of letters' were interested in reviving old sagas from earlier times.  Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were intent on preserving the German past.  They set out to unearth every folk story ever told in the German tongue, and their first book became a modern classic, coming in second only to the Bible in those days.   <br /> <br />A history of their heritage and lives is presented here as proof positive that they did indeed change the literary world.  Interspersed with some of their tales is the story behind them and why the brothers felt as they did.  That makes this a 'classic' of a classic.	2005-08-14

Jack is looking for his lost father, Bill Burns, a former church organist, who just suddenly disappeared when he was a child.  A deep sadness engulfs Jack as his mother Alice, similar in a lot of ways to my mother-in-law, Alice Baxter, wabders frin port to port, lost, tattoing whoever can pay her price. <br /> <br />In a way, she was an artist, eccentric and pretty weird, but educated young Jack with the glorious church music in Europe; later he attended schools in Canada and New England.  That was the location for his Academy Award-winning movie of his book, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.  He played the train conductor in this movie which starred one of my favorites, Tobey McGuire.  I have loved Tobey since he did that Fifties movie and have seen both 'Spiderman' movies.  He was exquisite as the young doctor there at that unusual clinic in New England when the apples got ripe.   <br /> <br />I reviewed his memoir, MY MOVIE BUSINESS, (he looked good in that conductor's uniform) and kept the book as it is just loaded with color pictures from the movie and behind the scenes.  Tobey must have been the actor he patterned Jack after.  Since he was in the movie and watched (worked closely with) the director, he is basing Jack's acting career on this one -- in my opinion. <br /> <br />\\"Our childhood is stolen from us\\" in mnay ways and Jack was no exception.  I'm forever grateful I accidentally (fate played a role, I'm sure) found him, and almost found his namesake -- but that was a fraud.  Bill might have been a fraud, who knows; he was certainly mentally defective to abandon a child such as Jack -- lovely, sensitive, an exceptional human being. <br /> <br />He'd inherited his father's talent and his mother's love of beauty.  Poor Jack could never fully grow up as he was always in a quest for the impossible -- and searching, searching continually for a phantom father.  Jack of Spades. <br /> <br />The mother could not adequately cope wiht Bill's desertion (or disappearance) and, by osmosis, transferred her inadequacy onto the shoulders of her son.  A mother (even a bad one) never intentionally harms or neglects her child, just human nature to want a man to love her at the expense of children -- anyone's and everyone's, even her own.  We all need to feel loved.  We are not like animals to push the young out of the nest to fend for themselves.  We do our best to raise a child to be self-sufficient; if we fail, we're only human.  And all humans make mistakes.  This is a sad story. <br /> <br />When he wrote THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP, I was a young mother and told my sister, Evelyn, that it was pretty weird and I didn't understand much of it.  That novel, and THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE, starring Jodie Foster, have been made into movies also.  Other books include A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY, TRYING TO SAVE PEGGY SNEED, and A SON OF THE CIRCUS.  He is prolific and such a good wordsmith. <br />	2005-08-14

Magic is a central theme and voodoo figures into the plot.  I've always loved David Copperfield's brand of magic and kept asking \\"How did he make the Statue of Liberty vanish?\\"  A person who's a bit more sophisticated than I said \\"It's all illusion.\\"  Thank you, Cathy at the Giles County Library, for explaining the obvious and for telling me the proper way to say facade.  There is a movie just out, 'The Skeleton Key,' which uses voodoo to make a scary plot.    At the Renaissance festival, the twin brothers disappear as if by magic.  The cicadas roar, in the summer heat.  I heard some here downton just yesterday and saw a dead June bug with the beautiful irredescent green shell.  One white shoe is found near the barn where the animals are kept.    They'd arrived at 2:18 p.m. (according to the receipt of her Visa charge) and, after dark, a search party convenes to cover the wild, woodsy area with thick vine undergrowth.  Exhaustion causes mistakes and the search is called off.  The mother is put on 'personal trial' as the investigator pretends not to believe anything she says.  She takes the investigation into her own hands and finds her boys.    It was a wild and magical trip to trace the clues, but a persistent mother, determined at any cost to find her young, cannot be deterred.  She saw sordidness and the low life of clubs and magicians, but the end result was startling and good.    This was based on an incident when Mr. Case (duo) attended a real event similar to the one in the novel and their two children went missing for fifteen minutes.  All's well that ends well.  I plan to read more books by this couple.  One young mother (also with two sons) arrived at the doctor's office Thursday all harassed because the older one had wandered off (on registration day) with some of his friends at the Middle School to visit with last year's teachers, and she had several minutes of worry by not knowing where they were.  She explained to me that it was a small school, so there was very little danger, and yet she was very distraught by the actions of her older son.    John Case is not one person but a husband/wife team who who have now collaborated on five books.  She has previously written three novels on her own, and he three non-fiction books.  She chose the name of her grandfather, just as the Nashville writer Cathie Pellitier chose K. C. McKinnon, her grandmother's name, for two special books.  I loved DANCING AT THE HARVEST MOON.    The other John Case novels are THE FIRST HORSEMAN, THE EIGHTH DAY, THE SYNDROME and GHOST DANCE (2005).	2005-08-13

This is the prequel to Dan Brown's THE DA VINCi CODE soon to be a movie -- can't wait to see it.  I know someone who read the DaVinci book and recommended it.  However, I was not really interested to get so involved in something the naysayers were putting down as so much deception.  After I see the movie, I may be compelled to try out the riddles, codes and symbols in that complicated provocative book.  People thought it was nonfiction, which made things worse.    This one starts in the Vatican City before the visit to the Louvre.  The same main character, Robert Langdon is hunting through sealed crypts, catacombs of deserted cathedrals, and the Illuninati (a Catholic underground organization) vault.  It sounds just like the movie, NATIONAL TREASURE, only that took place mostly here and involved the Masons.    The Harvard researcher joins mysterious scientist Vittoria Vetra in this adventure and endures much hardship with angels and demons along the way.  This is fiction, folks!  Nothing to worry about.  Yes, we all read that Brutus became a demon after Christ was crucified on the cross.  He hanged himself.  The archangel Gabriel was a demon of major proportions.  Even the anti-Christ was a demon to tempt humans into evil ways.    And there have always been angels.  I have had my own and she was as beautiful as Ligeia, who appeared when I was in the depths of a high fever as a child.  I searched far and wide for my angel, but she had vanished as they tend to do.  Some humans appear to be angels, but they are angels in disguise.  The devil works through these 'angels' of darkness.    Dan Brown has written DECEPTION POINT and DIGITAL FORTRESS in addition to the two mentioned above.  THE DA VINCI CODE DECODED has also been released to the general public and can be found in the public library.	2005-08-12

As she adapted to this change in circumstances, she finds a young pregnant girl, Lauren, there and decides that by taking her in and adopting the baby, she will have at last received a bit of her dream, albeit it without Conlan. <br /> <br />\\"She got in the car, heading north on Driftwood and found Lauren with red and swollen eyes at the bus stop.\\"   She changed what would have been her child's room into an oasis for Lauren.  \\"The leftovers of her marriage were all here.\\"  She reminises  as her life took a sharp right hand turn.  Conlan comes on a visit and sees the baby things; \\"I brought everything to the cottage for Lauren.\\"  She'd entered into a Faustian bargan and it would take them all on a terrible journey; at the end of it, broken hearts would be on the side of the road. <br /> <br />Her lost dreams may at last come true, but at what expense.  This story is written with compassion and conviction.  I wish I could have found an Angie in 1975 and I might have had my 'little girl' to help me in my older years.  The boys won't. <br /> <br />For sensitive women, no matter what age, the things they will do for love of a particular man is beyond description.  She needed a baby to get her life back in gear with the man she loved.  Lauren had an alcoholic mother and a boyfriend who had insisted on abortion.  Once you have had one, you will be forever guilty of killing someone you might have loved. <br /> <br />Adoptive families like Angie's and Lauren's can find plenty of practical information in books, magazines, and on the Web.  Charles Dickens wrote about Little Em'ly who was adopted in DAVID COPPERFIELD.  Barbara Kinsolver, Jacquelyn Mitchard, Joanna Trollope, Gretchen Moran Laskas, and William Kowalski have written novels about adoption of unwanted chidren.  The author, Kristin Hannah, is married and has a son -- but, like me, she must have always wanted a daughter.  She was born in Southern California the same year as Jeff and now lives in Washington state.	2005-08-12

This expose is about an international sex trade in the underworld of Cambodia in which children were abused by 'sex tourists' from America; most of the girls were Vietnamese.  There was an article in the 'Newsweek' magazine, but this book gives more details and ways to help stop this horrid crime. <br /> <br />They were caught in a \\"Catch-22\\" of being forced into a place by brutal adults and then arrested by other adults for being there.  Some were deported back to Vietnam after their dramatic rescue. <br /> <br />As a global force, Americans are able to generate wealth, exert governmental powers, and impact the world 'in a way that's unprecented in the history of nation states.'  And yet, here we have profound poverty, injustice, oppression and suffering.  And a special kind of abuse.  You can help to save these youth from enslavement and bondage to freedom, from a place of darkness, fear and bondage to places of hope, rescue, relief, courage and justice. <br /> <br />Some ways to get involved to help seek justice and fight against injustice are to pray, prepare, volunteer, make financial gifts, and tell others.  Be advocates for justice in an unjust world.   <br /> <br />\\"It is possible to change the world\\" so \\"that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.\\" (Psalm 10:18) Written by Gregg Hunter who formerly served on the President's Cabinet of Young Life, with the help of Gary Haugen, president of International Justice Mission, which investigates such injustices in this world.	2005-08-12

A good quote at the beginning of this four day romp is from Isaac Bashevis Singer, \\"No doubt the world is entirely an imaginary world, but it is only once removed from the true world.\\"  Sometimes, it is hard to know what is real and what is only a fanciful idea in your mind.      The stock market crashed on the Thursday before Easter, and its the 'worst day of Phil's life.'  He drowns his sorrow with a double gin martini instead of his usual white wine.  At a time like this, the stronger drink is needed just to sustain some kind of acceptance of your fate.  From here on in, you're on your own, and tht's had to do in a crisis.    On April 5, he's 'just back from Timbuktu, when the ball drops out of the basket.  The next day, he decides 'the dream ain't over till the White Dearf Sings' as  he gets more soused and more into a fantasy world.  But, by the 9th, it's 'just another day in the life of a fool' as he returns to Timbuktu.    I have a stubborn skin cancer on my forehead above the browline between the eyes caused by the sun, I am told, but nothing helps and it hurts and stays looking ugly.  So a friend named Linda gave me a semi-hat to wear in my favorite color blue with the I LOVE FROGS in bright colors on the front and a baby frog on the back.  I feel silly wearing hats, or carrying parasols, which is the reason I have the skin cancer in the first place.  But I especially try not to wear something which will draw attention to that area of my face.  The other day, I ventured out without makeup to Walgreen's to buy some Revlon with sunscreen in it for a special occasion; when I cross over Cumberland to Macdonald's, the girl working there said \\"You look precious.\\"  I was shocked to say the least.  She loved the hat, and said that God had sent me there that day for her to witness his love for me, to touch that place every day and talk to God.   Well, I haven't done that yet, but I have found a more competent dermatologist who can remove this blasted thing so that the scar won't show.  God sent me another 'angel' who'd had the same problem and gave me the name of the doctor who worked miracles on her.  Monday I go to see if he can do a minor one on me as well.      I think I'd rather be 'half asleep in frog pajamas' than still wearing the 'frogs' hat.  The brothers Grimm's first published fairy tale was THE FROG PRINCE.     I'd rather it be a cat or a bird or even a rose.  She made my day by her greeting and now I may get the help I need to look good again.  I'll know on the 15th.	2005-08-12

SURGIR is a Swiss activist group which works with the families of abused Eastern-culture women.  Subjected do criminal traditions like Souad, whose account this book uncovers in all its vagrities.  She was horribly burned over 90% of her body (torched by her own brother-in-law) because she'd 'dishonored' hre race and family by having sex before marriage. <br /> <br />Only seventeen, she could haved died as a martyr and to their Palestinian Territory community there on the West Bank, he was looked up to as a hero -- for this dastardly deed.  He even had the full support of her parents, believe it or not.  This is a real story! <br /> <br />Twenty-five years later, she had the courage to re-live the tragic consequences of what she felt to be 'true love.'  She had been rescued by some of the women in that village, who patted the flames out.  Her parents attempted to find an assassin to 'finish the job' as she recuperated in a clinic.  As a result, she went into permanent exile from her homeland, and this book reveals the barity of a practice which continues. <br /> <br />Five thousand such 'honor killings' are reported every year.  With this public accounting of what happened, she has resolved to survive and build a new life.  A European aid worker came to her assistance to escape this barbarous practice.  SURGIR fights against the injustice of the customs used to victimize women and this is a \\"call to action\\" to end a heinous tradition.  Souad was born in 1958 in that Arabic village and received no schooling as girls were not allowed to be educated.  Souad had to do the family's laundry where she was caught and burned. <br /> <br />Her mother dressed all in black.  We have a continguent goup herw who picket at the federal building, all dressed in black.  Her father wore a white sarousal with a red and white head scarf.  We've all seen pictures of the Arabs dressed just so, but usually they are the rich owners of oil wells. <br /> <br />There mothers suffocate baby girls at birth, not all, but the majority.  In China, each couple is allowed only one child.  If it is a girl, most times she is left out to starve.  In America, the Chinese can have real families -- boys and girls.  What freedom! <br /> <br />Twenty-five years later, she remembers vividly the pain and \\"In my mind, I'm still running with fire all over me,\\" and wished to be dead.  She now lives in Europe and has three children.	2005-08-12

Joe Scarborough of Pensacola, Florida, knows this subject from the get-go, as he served in Congress for seven years.  He confirms what the young aide to Clinton explained in DERELICTION IN OFFICE that golf was the only thing he knew how to do well, with the exception of entertaining young women in the Oval Office.      He writes, \\"Instead of sexual tricks or epicurean delights, it is usually the male ego that drives most political and policy trains in Washington.\\"   I have news for him, it's that way all over the world, Knoxville, Podunk, even Rome.  No, Rome wasn't built in a day, but could have been burnt in half a day -- had the need surfaced.    Clinton was able to balance the budget with a massive 1993 tax hike and the tremendous cut back of the military.  That is the main reason so many American men are dying right now in Iraq -- the lack of competent military equipment.  In the latest TIME magazine, the most recent fatalities were shown and seven were in that beautiful Marine uniform.  They are dead; they did not get to enjoy being dressed to kill, as they were killed.  Why deceive these young men into being guinea pigs in a political war over oil rights and money.    The \\"Fat White Pink Boys\\" are a certain class of political hacks who checked their manhood at Washington's city limits.  Some even migrated down here to Knoxville, Tennessee.  We have a plentiful supply of that kind of politician.  In fact, that's about the only kind of politician we have here.  Since our former mayor (14 years) was a college classmate of Bush's and was relagated ambassador to Poland, I guess those pink boys all stick together to hang onto their money while making the populace suffer.  The men here can't even talk like men, have high voices and sound like kids.  The short ones even look like dressed up children on their way to church.    He relates what happened to him on 9-11-01.  We will all remember where we were when we heard.  I was in the emergency room of Hillcrest Hospital watching it on the television set and asking \\"do we have suicide bombers here?\\" not really aware of the vastness of the dire acts of terrorism.  The day all of those innocent people died in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, I learned that the hemangioma on my liver would not kill me right away.  They died while I had a reprieve.  What a coincidence.  What timing!  Now my anemia is causing me to have a yellow tint -- has the liver caught up with me just four years later?  I will never willingly die.  I shall haunt the KAT buses and the Tennessee Theatre when my time comes; in the meantime, I plan to live forever.  And I hope Scarborough Country does, too.  More power to you, Joe.

In this tale, there are disposable duplicated bodies like the clone doubles in the movie, The Island, en masse.  It is a scary possibility that his process could happen in some future world, but not in America,  These 'ditto\\"s are used in perilous activities.    \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"  That was written to me two years ago and I've had to deal with the probability of my wish actually happening, but not the way I wanted.  Things didn't get better; they got increasing worse.      \\"Whose fault is it if the Universal Kilns mainframe gets two of us mixed up, confusing this me with a completely different me?\\"  To find a public phone jack to check one's email was a matter of necessity. Having a double of oneself is something people do believe in.  Coming back to an alien land compared to the thriving town I'd left, I was told that two or three other women here look like me.  I've located one of them, and I could see no similarities.    There is a person here I actually did know the times I saw him up close, as I asked, \\"Are you...?\\"  But, from afar was a different thing: I'd see him in locations he swore he wasn't there, how could I be so sure?  Recently, he got off a van on which I rode from town and the two drivers confirmed he was who I named.  I'd called to him and he did not turn around.  He told me later that he was late for a meeting.    In this book, in a futuristic world, doubles exist more than not.  Sometimes it was hard to tell the real person.  In Chicago, my son's double was a model of menswear in advertising.  He'd told me that he had purchased a top coat and the ad I received had a handsome double modeling one.  Alas, it was not Jeff, or Jack.    \\"But when I am consumed in the Fire, give me new Phoenix wings fo fly at my desire.\\" John Keats.    David Brin wrote six volumes in the UPLIFT saga; he is becoming a master of this genre as indispensable as  his 'shamans by the campfire': Poul Anderson, Greg Bear, and Gregory Benford.  Mr. Brin worked at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and at Cal Space Institute in L. A. He studied spacecraft design and physics of comets and the universe.  Like all astronomers and space scientists, he believes there is the likelihood of life somewhere out there.    He wrote THE POSTMAN, basis of Kevin Costner's movie of the same name.

GRITS stands for \\"Girls Raised in the South\\" namely Birmingham, Alabama.  Well, I wasn't just raised here, I was born here in Tennessee.  The first year of my marriage took place in Troy, Alabama, where I attended Troy State College (now University) and the art teacher wanted me to pose for his class, but wouldn't ask me himself.  That's not the way they do things in the South; first, he sent a young woman teacher to 'visit' me; then, he has some female art students to approach me in the halls on my way to Bio-Scio classes.  You want to know why I didn't -- I didn't have anything to wear!  Now, that's funny! <br /> <br />We all saw Southern manners and Hospitality at its best in the Auntie Mame movie in which Lucille Ball starred. She was the best Auntie Mame and perfect as a Southern belle.  Happy birthday to Bill Ross (8-11-32) wherever you are.  Friends and family are the center of life in the South, or used to be -- in the old days.  Now, you have to be the elite to enjoy that commodity.  The poor are ever there, but they do no entertaining. <br /> <br />In Knoxville, it is the liquor they all go for at any event.  Food can come as they have the time, but you won't catch those men and young women without a glass in their pretty hands.  If you want to be 'the belle of the ball,' be sure to have plenty of 'spirits' of all kinds for your party.  Elegance and wit is not what it is propounded to be; the women here are as dumb as those in the North with their noses in the air.  I enjoyed the drawings in this little book and especially the pink pages. <br /> <br />Who but a gal from Birmingham would have been able to get away with that.   In this town of my birth, purple is the color of choice, which perturbs me no end.  Pink is girlish and easy on the eyes.  I love to wear blue, but do get more attention in pink.

Long ago, I heard about the Alaska Pipeline, but I had no idea that it involved a Wildlife Refuge which contains sixteen billion barrels of crude oil.  That is a sin if they go in and disturb the penguins, eskimoes and caribou.  Across the Brooks Range from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska into Canada, these wilderness areas need to be left alone for the good of the country.  They can use corn to make alcohol additive and leave the crude oil alone.    The photo sections show the glorious mountains (unnamed) but I would have enjoyed them more in color.  I watched the majesty of the penguins in the movie 'The March of the Penguins.'  I know it was supposedly located in Antarctica, but most movies these days are filmed in Canada.  We saw those determined fowl make their seventy-mile march to an area to propagate their species.  If this wildlife area is disturbed, the majestic penguins will be lost, no place to go to find a mate, and the species of large birds will be lost.  Why, they need that yearly ritual to go back to the place they were born.    Prince William Sound is full of oil in abundance; this book shows how the hunt for that valuable source of fuel for the many cars Americans own is destroying Alaska's wilderness and people.  I know two people who lived in Alaska, one worked in the fish industry and has moved from Knoxville on to Texas.  The other is still here but has made a trip back to Alaska in the past two months.  If these folks from other places who lived and worked there have that dedication, then the natives should be considered and left to their own wishes (remain at home).  Home is where you were born, and being displaced is, or should be, un-American.  The Eskimoes love their land even in the long, dark winters and the savage windstorms with resulting ice/snow everywhere.    It will not benefit the world to have this area destroyed to satisfy the rich who can afford many autos and vans.  Let them ride the buses like I do.  We should not encourage the use of gas and oil at the expense of destruction of our lovely Penguins and Caribou.  Remember what happened to the buffalo here in the Western part of America!    Robert Service wrote in \\"The Spell of the Yukon,' there's a land where the mountains are nameless...there are hardships that nobody reckons...and I want to go back -- and I will.\\"  I applaud this spirit of the American west.  Jonathan Waterman is such a devoted advocate for the far North taking eighteen trips and trekking cross-country in that vast wilderness.    He has written A MOST HOSTILE MOUNTAIN, HIGH ALASKA, ARCTIC CROSSING and KAYAKING THE VERMILION SEA.  He is a Paul Theroux of Alaska and should be heeded in this endeavor to save a Wildlife Refuge from the greedy hands of politicians.	2005-08-11

Ms. Applegate has written over one hundred books such as this one for young adults in two or three series. You might think it is science fiction, but it is more like fantasy mixed in to make it more believeable.<br /><br />If one can believe the animal characters C. S. Lewis devised in THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (a movie out this Christmas), then this alien humanoid species might make it in a child's or young person's imagination.  Visser is the mother of a human son before she is infested by Edriss 562, and her love as Eva could perhaps counteract the evil of the Yeerks.  She explains that she wanted to suggest the possibility that the evil of aliens could only flourish when it met with human weakness.<br /><br />The human woman named Eva, \\"the husk, the human shell I lived in,\\" would cease to exist as far as any human knew.  She, as Visser One, had written the book on infestation while completing the knowledge of humans.  She was promoted to take a powerful position on the Council of Thirteen.<br /><br />Visser turned into an ugly man with horns with the body of a horse and tail like a whip.  He would spearhead the invasion of Earth and become the leader of the Yeerk military hierarchy.  Sailing was one of the best things about being part human.  She purloined the sail boat to meet a Bug fighter which would take her to the other land and capsize the boat.  Eva's body would never be found.<br /><br />Visser's arch rival, Visser Three, was successful in getting him charged with treason.  Should she/he be found guilty, he would lose his human host.  K. A. Applegate journeyed to the dark side with this endeavor to learn the minds and hearts of a race 'determined to survive and conquer at any cost.'  She uses her own photograph to show how she would look as a male lion and we see the four stages of transformation.  That's interesting.	2005-08-10

A swell isn't perfect; the main thing is not to be bored.  Put a little action in your life.  SWELL is a guide to 'navigating the world with a little swagger and a lot of grace.'  It doesn't hurt to use a little flash, too, in your own little world.  I have a web site, \\"Welcome to My World.\\"  It is for all races, and the pictures are all of young women, so keep your cool and you will learn how to 'be cool.'      A swell can be any age, it's not a state of mind for the young  up-and-coming gals.  It is also us 'been there' women who're not ready to give up on the 'good life' just yet.  When it comes to luck, a swell leaves nothing to chance.  Famously lucky people have selective memories; that's what allows you to be upbeat when things are not moving so smoothly.  'This, too, shall pass' is a good motto.    Swellness is 'wellness with an \\"s\\" in the front' (that's for the 'sweetness' in life with a lot of 'spirit' and a little 'style') and is as much our fantasy as reality; it's a fun idea of cruising through life in the fast lane, thinking big thoughts.  You can do that at any age, also.  Swell is the place where spirit and style meet.  Dress up, dress down -- there's always a time for each and both, and you can do it with your own style.    This is a cute little book written by a fashion designer and a style designer, Ilene Rosenzweig and Cynthia Rowley, for the young and young-at-heart to get them motivated to enjoy life.  They give personal histories of where they fouled up beautifully so that the reader, especially if she is young, won't feel so bad about her silly mistakes.  And it helps the older reader to think, \\"Why, I didn't do anything that stupid!\\"    What a find in an unexpected place.  Those are the most fulfilling, more so that the latest editions I get at the public library.  Sometimes, using an offhand message allows the reviewer to inspire others to do the same.  It's the enjoyment of doing what is best for you and, hopefully, along the way someone will benefit for your advice and experiences.	2005-08-10

And brought joy to life once more.\\"  Sweet Heaven, he's in love again (Barry Manilow). <br /> <br />This is a followup to THE MATARESE CIRCLE in which, like a phoenix from the ashes, the terror has returned involving evil assassins and stone-cold-blooded killers.  It incorporates the world of global finance and corruption in governments, on the trail of blood money.   <br /> <br />In Soviet Union, far from Moscow, a nuclear physicist had been assassinated (by a wounded bear!) actually by the Matarese, according to his widow many years later; to the Russian Orthodox priest, she appears as if she has dementia as she remembers the day the \\"Americans\\" murdered her husband with the dying words, \\"The Matarese ... the consummate evil.\\"  They were noted for eliminating all who stand in their way. <br /> <br />From the hills of Corsica, Monte Carlo, London's Belgrave Square, the oil fields of the Persian Gulf, boardrooms in New York City (Manhattan), to the halls of power in Washington, D.C. this exciting tale unfolds.  In Spain, one victim's dying words were \\"Find Beowulf Agate\\", the code name for American agent Scofield, now retired.   <br /> <br />If his other books are this involved, the reader would be exhausted trying to keep up with the killers as they globe-trot all over the world.  Some of his multitudous thrillers these titles spoke to me: THE GEMINI CONTENDERS, THE SCORPIO ILLUSION, THE APOCALYPSE WATCH, TREVAYNE, THE ROAD TO OMAHA, and THE TRISTAN BETRAYAL (2004).  This trio series was recently made into a movie, THE BOURNE IDENTITY, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, and THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM.  I once knew an educated person who read all of this writer's books with an extensive home library.  I thought nothing of it until I see how involved and complex his riddles are and the intelligence it takes to figure out what is going on.  Sorry, Eddy, I misjudged you.

Triumph of the American consumers over Europe?  Never in a million years!  What we need is a little of the European culture to rub off on us crude Americans, especially those with all the money who flaunt their wealth and power.  It is only temporary.  Any disaster could wipe them out and they'd be as poor as some of us and have no power of persuasion to the king pins.  Today, in America, money is all that matters.  If you have none, then you are a nobody.    I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but sometimes an unusual cover can grab a reader's attention when another more drab would not.  The girl on the airplane engine dressed in a '60s outfit complete with flowered cowgirl hat looks like a young Jackie Kennedy, the closest thing we ever had to royalty in America.  She was the style maven back then (with her Marilyn Monroe voice), but she was always a lady and,  like Diana, loved the colorful hats.  They could make or break the outfit!    This was more like a romp through Europe than an \\"advance.\\"  After all, we're not talking war here.  How about the movies?  The 'Brave New World of Manhattan\\" of the Twenties was the model for the super-modernistic film, METROPOLIS, which was filmed in Berlin in 1926.  See THE ISLAND for a post-modernistic plan for life in America.  'Metropolis' was a \\"technical marvel with feet of clay\\" -- three years in the making saw the end of illusions; no interface between European and American filmmaking.    From the Dresden file:  \\"Nobody was made to go it alone.  Either they marry or a club they join...  Club life is as old as mankind itself  Club life, the dance around the golden calf.    The times have not changed.  People have.  They still kneel down to the golden calf, and wish they had all the money in the world.  But they would not be any happier.  They might get a 'high' spending all of that ill-begotten cash, but then when it is gone, they are back to the old 'do-nothing' attitude.  Attitudes need to change.  Church can help if you will keep your independent spirit and not be led around by the nose.    Chain stores have demolished the art of buying and supplied us and the world with cheap goods, there is no fun in shopping anymore.  Where is the glamour of all the beauty in merchandising and the desire to look beautiful.  To be beautiful in today's world, besides using lots and lots of makeup (men and women) and dressing in expensive, tasteful clothes, you must have the money for reconstructive surgery to always appear \\"young.\\"  The real young women wear nightware out in public, and have no desire to look glorious and glamorous.  They just want to attract the opposite sex.  Waiting for the bus at the Mall, I observed some of the young males preening before the half-dressed girls:  there was a tatoo man (too many on his arms and legs to count), an ape man (all bent over with a drooling gaping mouth) and a Tarzan (with the long flowing hair in the style of the Tarzan movies.)  It was quite a show.    Now sex is a big deal in today's society.  You don't have to fall in love and get married to be 'active' and have a family.  It is not looked down on in today's society (except for church, perhaps) for this type of bad behavior to constantly be flaunted in today's world.  It is the world of America.  To be respected for a well-brought-up family is passe.  Today, anything goes.    Victoria is a professor of history at Columbia University in New York.   She has the European mind set about how things should be and might have been.  America will always be different from Europe as we have no royalty here, no special personage to admire and try to emulate.  The Pope in in the Vatican.  The Queen is in England.  Jesus is at the right hand of God.  What on earth can we aspire to in a country so full of sin and greed -- not much for the average folks.  The rich enjoy their big houses and cars (and vans), vacations, cruises, trips overseas; while the rest of us are struggling just to get through oneday at a time.  The vastness of different lifestyles here will be our undoing.  Europe has the edge there.  Everyone knows his or her place in the society in which they live.	2005-08-09

I have the third edition of HOW TO USE THE EXCHANGE SYSTEM FOR HEALTHY AND CREATIVE FOOD CHOICES.  I've never had to worry much about diet as I am petite and never overweight.  However, now that I find that I have a bad case of \\"anemia\\" I decided I needed some help on the nutrition side of the meal instead of just having things which taste good.    The exchange program was initially developed to help those who need to control calories or people who have diabetes.  As active as I am, riding the buses every day and running here and yonder all over town, I need as many calories as I can get.  Of course, I don't overdo pastas.      The base of the Food Guide Pyramid, which has replaced the basic four food groups, contains breads, cereals, rice, and pasta -- all food from grains.  Because of a severe bout with diverticulosis in 1980, I was told to eat only whole grain breads, no nuts, no popcorn, and a few other restrictions.  I soon grew to like the taste of the wheat bread and have preferred it to the white for 25 years.  However, in the past two or three years, I have discovered that I can include sunflower seeds in my salad, and actually eat popcorn at the movies.  Pasta, I like only variously, not as a steady diet, and I don't like rice anymore at all.    Veggies and fruits make up the next rung on the Pyramid, which I do enjoy, and the milk and meat further up are something I don't use enough, as I do have oesteoporosis (need the calcium) and now the anemia (need meats).  About the only fats I eat are in the cooked foods I get at restaurants, which is not excessive.  I hardly ever use margarine or butter, and usually the Best Blend of Veg. & Canola Oil for frying (which I don't do very often).  The Olive stuff I just can live without.    So it is apparent that I am deficient in all of the things I need to be healthy.  Now, if I ate all of that stuff, I wouldn't weigh 99 or 100 pounds ever again.  And that's not good.  Too many people are so huge they can hardly walk.  I walk every day and run sometimes to get the bus I need.    I had decided that all of those fat people ate french fries and junk food all of the time, and that is why they are so big around.  Not so, they are eating what they are supposed to, but in excess.  I spend so much time sitting at the computer when I am at home, after running around catching the buses, that I often forget to eat.  'Course I do go to the movies and eat popcorn with lots of butter as often as I can, which isn't half enough to keep me occupied.    The recipes listed in the separate sections and the guidelines for food purchasing and special occasions is interesting, but since I am not much of a cook, I can manage what I need on a simple plan.  I've learned over the years about fiber, less salt in the diet, pouring off the liquid of canned vegetables and using my own water (gets rid of the sodium) and snacks which I can have and those which cause me gastric disturbance and pain.    This book is a valuable resource to use in place of recipe books and name-brand cookbooks.  I especially like the index as it shows everything in alphabetical order so that you can look up what you need at the moment, and the recommended references for each section to do further reading if need be.	2005-08-09

The stories in this Grant book include vignettes about James Garfield, Whittaker Chambers (crossovered from Communism?), and the biblical prophets, Nehemiah and Daniel (in the Lions Den).   George Grant has written more than 25 books in the areas of history, biography, politics, literature and social criticism.      One of his most famous was CARRY A BIG STICK (about Teddy Roosevelt) and THE MICAH MANDATE.  In the Flash Gordon serials of the '30s, one episode showed off the space vehicle; \\"It's a rocket ship of my own design.\\"  To see the future of space vehicles, see the movie STEALTH.  Like the clones in THE ISLAND, this plane developed a conscience and could feel and defend his cause with his own demise.    The \\"greatest presumption of men and nations is the idea that we judge things aright by our own clever initiative.\\"   He writes about the sins of commission, the sins of ommision, compromise(?), and the standard of excellence.  The Center of Excellence is no more as it proved not to be so excellent.    This book was published in 1995 and his promotion of the churches' taking in the elderly, lonely, homeless, and poor to give them something to live for in an uncaring world has actually happened.  At least, in some of the local churches, there is a vast variety of congregation makeup, and the social care the others need is there on a counseling basis.  Everything he 'wished for' has happened on a small scale.  If this thing could be nationalized and the welfare system falls by the wayside, then we will know that his preaching worked wonders here in America.      His discovery is that a true 'changing of the Guard' (a meaningful shift in the way our country is governed) depends on more than mere politics.  Old time politics are still alive and kicking here in this backward town and failing, as the churches and faith of the Christian people will do the changing for them.  Politicians are on the whole not so wholesome and telling lies is their mantra.   As our future becomes more conscience directed, the politicians will fall on their faces and... perhaps, wake up and smell the roses.    They cannot govern without our votes.  We can always vote for someone else.  And to get the things for the populace, sometimes we have to look for leaders who are benevolent and not greedy.	2005-08-09

Using classic literary sources as well as real trial histories, from Adam & Eve (on the cover in all their naked glory) to O. J. Simpson (travesty of justice) who got away with murder, this book has many instances in between the beginning and end.  Written by a Professor of The University of Chicago Law School where he and my son Jeff got all of their degrees from Bachelors to Ph.D.  Both learned men and both antagonists.    He explores Christopher Marlowe's DOCTOR FAUSTUS, in all its negativity with the conflicting good and evil themes.  As opposed to Goethe's masterpiece, FAUST, whose hero is saved at the last moment from the dreadful fate he had bargained for with the devil.  Parts of the Marlowe play (he was murdered at the age of 29) were censored as theologically, also politically questionable.  Bill played the lead in a performance at Martin College of Death in 'Death Takes A Holiday' as Faust surrenders his soul to the devil and curses his parents and his very existence.  He seeks fame, seeks out the help of the Devil, which was not considered wicked.  Both Lucifer and Mephistophilis are painfully ugly.  Frederick March was a handsome devil in the movie.    Sophocles' ANTIGONE, Thomas More, the Rosenbergs (Ethel and Julius), Dillinger, Joan of Arc, Jesus of Nazareth, were considered in the same vein as Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.  Strange.  Goethe wrote, \\"We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.\\"    Dr. Anastaplo has previously written PLATO'S MENO, THINKER AS ARTIST, THE CONSTITUTIONALIST, and LIBERTY, EQUALITY & mODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM.  He also teaches at Loyola and Dominican Universities in Chicago and has written numerous other books.	2005-08-08

S. citizen to know what is going on.  However, it is written by a former intelligence officer with inside knowledge of what has been happening and how it could be improved to insure our saftety both here in America and abroad.    He is a retired CIA officer who now teaches in Boston but he brings his insider's viewpoint to the updated research of the U. S. intelligence community as a reformer about intelligence (spy) reform.  He wants to make us feel safe without denying our documented freedoms according to the Constitution of the United States in his liberty and security section.  He calls this the ever-changing world of intelligence and seeks ways to break down the barriers between intelligence agencies and law enforcement.  He is of the mind to restructure the intelligence game.    We sometimes need to be protected from the homeland security which is supposed to protect us.  A guard at the metal detection center at the front door of the govt. building insisted on seeing my I.D.!!!! When I willingly showed him my Tennessee drivers licence with my photo, he confiscated it and would not return it (even though I am a native of this town, small in stature, white, female, of no danger to anyone); he held onto it until it was confirmed by the local police (perhaps he called the FBI, who knows?) that I have NOTHING, no record of criminal activity of any kind.  A Clean Record, but he refused to believe it!  I was treated as a criminal and denied my rights to my property -- the only I.D. I had which he kept hostage as I stood there crying.    Mr. Hulnick calls the Iraqis \\"a clever unknown enemy\\" and non-state actors (terrorists, spies, and criminals) emphasizing that \\"we need to understand the enemy, who he is and all about espionage.\\"  He gives a long list of acronyms we use in the States; some of the most unusual are:    CREEP -- Committee to Reelect the President (sounds about right!)  ELF -- Earth Liberation Front (what's that got to do with U.S.?)  ICE -- Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they need some heat to get them going, I think -- a pun)  CATIC -- Chinces National Aerotechnology Import and Export Corp.  JETRO -- Japanese External Trade Organization  SARS -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (we'll all have it if a real alert sounds)  WAV -- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (like in the movie STEALTH)  WMD -- Seapons of Mass Destruction  HUMINT -- Human Intelligence    Previously, he wrote a book in 1999, FIXING THE SPY MACHINE.  He has an index and pages of notes on each chapter.  He thought long and hard about this problem and presents here his solution to what we are doing wrong.	2005-08-08

It's hard being old and set out to pasture.  Some folks just give in and accept their lot of being pushed into a corner to live out some twenty or more years doing nothing, just existing.  Why retire when you are not ready?  There is no set age now for retirement.  Keep on doing what you enjoy and make that money as long as you can!  You will have time to enjoy it when you are ready!    If you haven't had any social life or spiritual training before the age of 65, it's a little late to start now.  Oh, it is good to go to dances and church, but alone -- that is as bad as not going at all.  Who wants an old, decrepit man to take you places and to tell you what to do?  No one needs that!    If you don't know yourself by now, it's just plain too late to start finding your inner self through workbook studies or seminars telling you how you should think and live.  No one can live your life for you.  Only the losers go to Florida!  Stay where you know the terrain and enjoy being yourself.  Now is the time!  With the white or gray hair, you are invisible to most of the populace anyway, so get out there and have fun!  Raise a little hell!  You will find that finally after all these years, you CAN  be yourself.  Perhaps young, inexperienced males will look on you as 'over the hill,' but hey!  what do they really know -- they haven't been there yet and cannot judge the elderly.  Their time will come sooner than they wish and they, too, will be invisible and on their own in a hostile world.    Don't hide away and wither!  And, for God's sake, don't waste time volunteering.  We have only a limited time to enjoy being who we are and who God created, a unique individual.  If you like traveling and have the money, by all means, do so.  It is never too late to learn.  What we see will be temporary as there will be no one to share the experience with, so why buy postcards.  That is a waste of money.  Take your own pictures!    Hobbies are time-consuming and who has the time now.  Getout and live. And the world will be rosier and you will be happier and more fulfilled for the day when you go to the Great Beyond.  There are no 'caregivers' especially family, as they tend to desert and abandon you when you are a drag on them.  So, don't be a drag!  Be independent.  Go places, and be yourself, warts and all.  No one really cares about the old unless you have a fortune to leave them.  Don't be so stupid.  Spend it on enjoying life, as they will not thank you after you are dead.    Move where you want to when you want to.  You have to suvive where you find yourself and if the place is bad and a prison to you, move on.  Save a little money to pay the young men to move your things and life will go on as normal, more or less.  It is always a challenge to move from one town to another, but it can be done.  Just be sure you know someone there, or the town itself so that you won't feel lost and alone.  You are never alone as long as you have God in your heart.  No one can harm you when your spirit is strong.  Don't let someone make you feel weak when you're not.    Retirement is a drag.  It is a retirement from life not work.  Don't ever give up.  Always keep your chin up and look forward.  Every cloud has a silver lining, and you can find your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, if you just believe.	2005-08-07

Gregory Maguire has made a career now with taking established characters and writing his 'take' on what might have been.  Not what was presented by the orginial authors, but an embellished 'history' of an allegorical figure in history and fantasy.    Elphaba (poor thing) was born with green skin, so how could she possibly by a normal being.  She wasn't green with envy, but with the genes passed down from her unfortunate ancestors.  In THE WIZARD OF OZ she is a grown 'person' who becomes the 'Wicked Witch of the West' (why West?) who is mean and uncouth to young Dorothy and follows her to the land of Oz.  My, what an adventure and what a way to end, with a house fallen on top of you!    I hope he had permission from the Baum family trust to redo the Wizard's 'meanie' into a human being who could not help what she was doing.  It was bred into her very being.  As Shakespeare wrote, \\"Things base and vile, holding no quantity, love can transpose to form and dignity; love looks not with the eyes but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\\"    Poor Elphaba had never been loved but had been cast aside to wither and hate the normal, young girl Dorothy there in Kansas. Alexander Pope proclaimed, \\"To err is human; to forgive, divine.\\"  How things would have been different for the nasty old witch had someone (just one person) had shown some niceness and treated her decently.  She was not exactly AFTER Dorothy and Toto but trying to prove that she was worthy, too.    This delightful, though a carbon copy of the real one, fantasy was turned into a funny musical by composer Stephen Schwartz.  It received ten Tony award nominations for the songs, 'No one Mourns the Wicked,' 'I'm Not that Girl,' 'Popular,' and 'Defying Gravity.\\"    Gregory Maguire went on to write SON OF A WITCH, LOST, CONFESSIONS OF AN UGLY STEPSISTER, and his latest, MIRROR MIRROR.  He is not original in his storylines but uses others' works to make his own stance.  Any of us could do that,  But could we get published, that is the big question.	2005-08-07

Zach King (no relation to Mark) is involved in a car accident with his best friend Rael who is killed and Zach relatively unscathed, except for a bit of blood in his urine.  He's engaged to gorgeous Hope, a socialite way out of his league, and thinks perhaps he should be devoted to Tamara, the widow of Rael.      The front cover is a bit erotic showing a well-formed unclothed female form with a tight high wire on which a man holding a red umbrella is trying to walk across not very successfully.  Zach, age 32, has decided that his life is changing much too fast and quickly getting out of his control.  He thinks that the devastating health problem will put him out of commission in the field of love, but it turns out to be arthritis which aggravates his love life and contentment with his job, but no big deal.      At his wits' end, he decides he needs a major life change (Oh, to be so young!) and must face the perils of a well-planned mundane life with some complications.  His dad with whom he has a history of bad blood for the past twenty years appears on his doorstep and expects to move right in and continue in his sordid oversexed playing around games.  He doesn't seem to have changed, but tricks Zach into believing that he wants to transform his life.  Norm's hijinks leaves Zach's love triangle in shatters.   That's what wayward fathers are for, to mess up one's love life.      Everything appears to be simply changing but is seriously out of control for Zach.  Actually, things are changing for the better to a more normal way of life.  Zach will survive, but will his love life?  Who will he choose to spend his life with forever and a day?    Jonathan Tropper does tend to put a little too much involved sexual situations in his books.  BOOK OF JOB (2004) is a coming-of-age at 34 which is currently in the process of becoming a sit- com movie.  EVERYTHING CHANGES  will soon be a Sony motion picture.  Plan B (2000) may be picked up if these two are boxoffice hits.  Thisguy seems to have it all going for him, but I fear it is all happening too close together and may backfire.  My son Zach is a writer but, thank goodness, he sticks with science fiction as a rule -- not all this sex stuff.	2005-08-07

Hannah Joyner lost the hearing function of one ear in 1993 during surgery for a non-cancerous brain tumor at which time her acoustic-vertibular nerve was accidentally cut.  She explains how that complicated the Ph.D. exams as she could not hear and her balance was badly impaired.    My balance has been off kilter since 1995 after a year of ear infections doctored only with ear drops by a country doctor in Clifton, Tennessee, until he was involved in a car accident and one of his nurses said to me at a routine office visit, \\"It is time you saw a specialist.\\"  The young doctor in Nashville used steroids and real radium in a test on my brain, from which I have never recovered. I can hear, but my walking is like a drunk person's.    In 2000, I thought that Eric could not hear as he was never aware of my presence any time I was around him.  He would not look at me, which distressed me a great deal, and I exclaimed, \\"This child can not hear.\\"  As time went on, it turned into something much worse, autisium from which he may never fully recover.  Poor Eric, so pretty with bright, sparkly eyes, but to him I (his grandmother) am and has always been a non-entity.  That is a sad situation all around.    Ms. Joyner gives the stories and accounts of various other Southerners who were deaf.  Helen Keller was by far the most famous, and her loss happened during her early years due to a high fever caused by a disease.  It is not shameful to be deaf here in the South.    On the contrary, there is a School for the Deaf in South Knoxville where the patients are taught self-sufficiency skills and sign language.  In the old days, the poor children were objects of pity because they were not normal.  Can you imagine having to go through life and never hearing beautiful music?  If I had missed Michael Feinstein my life would have been grim indeed.      When the person loses the use of one of his/her senses, the others will make up for it in many ways.  Eyes can be the ears by touch and watching the hands speak to and for you.  They are indeed 'prisoners of silence,' even though they have good minds.  It is better to be this type of prisoner than one who is deprived of his/her freedom for a matter of hours when nothing is wrong but a depraved ER physician.    Back in the Glory Days of the South, they were considered the victims of a terrible 'misfortune,' and only the rich could find a way to overcome the deficiency.  This was a permanent liability and they were tagged as deaf and dumb.  Young Eric has a future perhaps not as bright as a mere mute, but I feel that he will 'overcome' to be a product of his environment.  He can and hopefully will become a productive citizen.   Ms. Joyner is a historian who researched this in depth after her tragic surgery which went wrong.  She lives in Takoma Park, Maryland in the U.S.	2005-08-07

This book is as far from 'innocence' as if it were a biology textbook.  This story follows 18-yr-old Evie from Ohio who moves into a bohemian New York theater lifesyle when Robbie is killed by a hit-and-run driver and she migrates to Londodn to study drama with Imogene.  Evie's new world is one of glamour and stuff that dreams are made of.    Or is it?  Everything changes, as we saw in the Zach book.  It appeared to young Evie that anything was possible until Robbie's unexpected death put an end to the eccentric lifestyle of the young and famous.      Fifteen years have passed, and Evie is again in New York with her child doing the best she can to forget the past, and Robbie with all the dreams they both had shared as young virgins.  She finds that she must live with Robbie's ghost and an old 'friend' from the past who will haunt 'her comings and goings.'  She has a house which she shares with renters of the arts persuasion and she attempts to teach drama to night students.      When she thinks that life can be content and she can get in the groove of being an older single mother like Kim, everything is about to change again.  Can she adapt?  Some dreams never die.    Kathleen Terraro wrote a previous lively debut of similar characters, ELEGANCE, shades of Bridget Jones's Diary.  She was born in Pennsylvania where she studied drama at Carnegie-Mellon University.

Dolly had a hard life growing up in the wilds of East Tennessee; she started out poor and indeed did have a 'coat of many colors' as her children's book explained.  She wore hand-me-downs in the backwoods of Sevier County where my paternal grandfather's people lived.  She's funny.  Coming from the country, it took some doing and lots of help to get where she is today.  She has re-invented her personality through the years from the young lovesick girl who write 'I Will Always Love You' to Porter Wagoner.  After all, she was a young country bumpkin from the Knoxville area, and we inexperienced girls fall hard for the first person we can admire.  He gave her the first 'big' break, singing on his show in Nashville.    She had been on local talent shows in Knox County, Cas Walker's for country music.  She migrated to Middle Tennessee to sing on the Grand Ole Opry where she met my friend, Hal Durham, who was manager of that fabulous old show on radio, television and live.  I once attended at the Ryman and he gave Zachary and me a backstage tour.      In Nashville and in the movies, she had a good life but suffered some setbacks and depression.  The two photo secitons show how little Dolly the girl was transformed into Dolly the bombshell blonde.  She is the richest person in this area as she owns Dollywood, the major attraction for people from all the states who visit the Great Smoky Mountains and from other countries.      In her 'thanks' section, she included her favorite makeup, Revlon staff, and favorite lingerie shop, Frederick's of Hollywood.  She includes Terry Morrow, local entertainment columnist for the News Sentinel daily Knoxville newspaper, and Ligiea Saveanu (whoever she is -- I was going to name my daughter Ligeia).  From the Grand Ole Opry performers, she includes Archie Campbell from the famous Civil War area in EAst Tennessee, Bull's Gap, Grant Turner, and Bud Wendell, WSM announcer.  Game show hosts were Bob Eubanks and Huell Howser; how could she leaveout Wink Martindale and Pat Sajacks, both Tennesseans?  For some reason, she included the Knoxville Democrat Party chairman, Jim Gray, Al Gore, Jim Sasser, and Sandra Fulton (wife of Dick Fulton of Nashville).  Movie stars included Kevin Costner, Jane Fonda, and Delta Burke, while singers were Mac Davis, Billy Ray Syrus, Whitney Houtston and Reba McEntire.  She has Johnny Carson, Eddie Hill, and many many others -- too many to mention.    Like most successful people, she has humility when it comes to feeling indebted to others for her success.  She showed he CBS anchor a thing or two when he enterviewed her ans commented on her most obvious attraction.  She has talent galore, and I wish Dolly could live forever.  She will in the figure on Sevier County Courthouse Lawn, as a young country girl.  Dolly is everything to everybody.	2005-08-05

He gave her the first 'big' break, singing on his show in Nashville.     Dolly had been on local talent shows in Knox County, Cas Walker's for country music. She migrated to Middle Tennessee to sing on the Grand Ole Opry where she met my friend, Hal Durham, who was manager of that fabulous old show on radio, television and live. I once attended at the Ryman and he gave Zachary and me a backstage tour.    In Nashville and in the movies, she had a good life but suffered some setbacks and depression. The two photo secitons show how little Dolly the girl was transformed into Dolly the bombshell blonde. She is the richest person in this area as she owns Dollywood, the major attraction for people from all the states who visit the Great Smoky Mountains and from other countries.     In her 'thanks' section, she included her favorite makeup, Revlon staff, and favorite lingerie shop, Frederick's of Hollywood. She includes Terry Morrow, local entertainment columnist for the News Sentinel daily Knoxville newspaper, and Ligiea Saveanu (whoever she is -- I was going to name my daughter Ligeia). From the Grand Ole Opry, she includes Archie Campbell from the famous Civil War area in East Tennessee, Bull's Gap, Grant Turner, and Bud Wendell, WSM announcer. Game show hosts were Bob Eubanks and Huell Howser; how could she leave out Wink Martindale and Pat Sajacks, both Tennesseans? For some reason, she included the Knoxville Democrat Party chairman, Jim Gray, Al Gore, Jim Sasser, and Sandra Fulton (wife of Dick Fulton of Nashville).     Movie stars included Kevin Costner, Jane Fonda, and Delta Burke, while singers were Mac Davis, Billy Ray Syrus, Whitney Houtston and Reba McEntire. She has Johnny Carson, Eddie Hill, and many many others -- too many to mention.    Like most successful people, she has humility when it comes to feeling indebted to others for her success. She has talent galore, and I wish Dolly could live forever. She will -- in the figure on Sevier County Courthouse Lawn, as a young country girl. Dolly is everything to everybody.	2005-08-05

This valuable reference book explains the \\"in's and outs\\" of office politics, which are the most single factor in getting ahead in the career of your choice.  This book is full of commonsense wisdom on how to get along with others and get ahead in life.  Dr. Reardon is the author of THE SECRET HANDSHAKE about business psychology.  She's great!      Talent alone does not insure success; you must have those important relationships with the people who can best reward your creativity and intelligence.  You are encouraged to 'pick your battles wisely' to deal with a difficult co-worker.    When we think about politicians, automatically the words 'unethical' and 'devious' (sometimes flat-out 'lies') come to mind.  In the workplace, \\"knowing what to say, to whom, and how and when to say it.\\"  Most of all, you will need to be able to convert enemies into your allies to win crucial support for your ideas.    The only way to avoid politics at work is to avoid people.  \\"For every locked entrance, there is a back door, window, even a chimney;\\" always be sure there is a way out before you crawl into a corner.  It is important to remember that there is more than one way to handle any situation: good, bad or indifferent.    Intuition is needed, but just as necessary is the power of persuasion.Power is a critical part of career politics.  People remember those they perceive to be powerful.  Power, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder.    A good read, wonderful instruction in the ways of life at work and at home, and packed full of good advice.  It behooves us to try to follow her instructions as close to the letter as possible.  She knows what she is talking about; you can, too.	2005-08-03

Jargon is not just about using big words to make small points.  Oft times it's about using big words to make no point at all.  When you have nothing to say, jargon is the best way to say it.  When there is bad news to deliver, jargon is a business \\"idiot's\\" biggest ally.    The first deadly sin is pride, and jargon is an all too ready accomplice.  You should give the truth a chance to come out and be seen.  Jargon is the foundation of obscurity.  It's only part of the long slide into \\"idiocy.\\"  Word choice is a good place to start to connect with your audience.      Jargon is everywhere, and it shows disrespect for your audience.  Jargon is used mainly as a shortcut, as it's easy to lapse into vagary and verbosity so you won't have to work the way through to clarity and crispness.    Jargon, wordiness and evasiveness are the active ingredients of modern business speak.  When obscurity pollutes someone's communications, it's because the author's goal is to impress and not inform.  The 'low road' to impressing an audience is to make them feel inferior, by using words they won't understand.    Some I heard at the latest City Council are:  'submit it to your discretion,' ' trapazoid,' 'decisive,' 'streetscape,' 'act of acknowledgment,' 'apparition,' ' impressive,' 'clarity.'    It took three writers to put this little manual together, Chelsea Hardaway, Brian Fugere, and Jon Warshawsky who all love grammar as I do and hate the way people speak these days to say nothing.  I especially dislike the overuse of the word 'that.'	2005-08-03

This is a memoir like no other, so much detail which makes one wonder if he actually did experience all that, it has so much sordidness he outdoes even Eddie Fisher's BEEN THERE DONE THAT.  But he's still a kid comparatively.    Poor child.  How could a mother be so bad to send him off to four boarding schools (she's worst by far as a mother than Joan Crawford) when the boy absolutely idolizes the ground she walks on.  How could that awful rich father go and marry his mother's best friend?  I know of something similar taking place to someone I value, and it hurts my heart.    I wish he had included a photo section so I could compare that blonde, bombshell mother to the irrepressible Dede who took her place.  I doubt that she was more beautiful, but had more time to devote to poor Alfred Spalding Wilsey with all his wealth -- the rich shall not inherit the earth.    Sean was a sensitive little boy like my son Zachary and not fully appreciated for his talent.  Of course, there is  a vast difference.  We were not rich.  To think he would dedicate this book: \\"For my mother\\" makes me feel queasy.    He had a cosmopolitan life jetting around the globe and meeting real leaders and important people.  After the reform school experience in Italy, he becomes the average dope-head for awhile.  That's what a bad mother causes.  He still has a mixed-up mindset on actuality, and I hope that his wife is nothing like his mother -- for his sake.  She did not love him or the boarding schools would not have had to raise him; that was her duty which she abscounded from to be society's bright star.  Unless you are a star in the sky, the day will come when that star dims and fades away.    I'm amazed that he is as normal as he appears.  Writing this 482-page memoir should help as he got all of that baggage out of his system, and should now be able to be himself, an adult with his own son.  I hope he didn't inherit his dad's gene to take up with the wife's best friend.  That's the greatesttragedy of life.	2005-08-03

A naked woman on the cover enthralled with a corpse stands for the 'Black Death.'  The generation which lived through it was called 'the great mortality.'  In this book, John Kelly traces the medieval plagues from the cities of Europe, Sicily, Portugal, along the China Sea and Central Asia, England, to Greenland.    Thought to have been spread by flea-infested rats from the ships and flooding by polluted waters in the 1300s, it killed a third of the population.  There were two kinds: bubonic plague with boils and swollen lymph nodes, and pneumonic plague with spitting blood and lung infection.    As opposed to our modern plague, AIDS, the victims of the medieval types died fairly quickly.  It was thought to be a punishment from God, as was the plague of locusts.  They thought it was 'the end of the world.'  Such pandemic diseases destroy worlds, not just individuals.      [...]	2005-08-03

This extensive history of the famed white horses of Austria is quite interesting.  I became fascinated with them long ago when I read Mary Stewart's AIRS ABOVE THE GROUND in which she describes the dancing they do on their hind legs, like a ballet.  It made me want to see these special horses which were near extinction in the fatal days of WWII.<br /><br />In Vienna, the lovely white stallions receive their unique training at the Spanish Court Riding School.  The Lipizzaners put on quite a show which keeps the viewers enchanted.  They are the tops in equestrian history, more so than the thoroughbreds of Kentucky -- known for the horseracing and blue-grass state in the United States.  In Tennessee, we have the Tennessee Walking Horses which are a delight to watch, but they are not as lovely as the Austrian equines in any way.  Most of them, I think, are black.<br /><br />The photo section of actual events makes this book valuable.  For entertainment, read Mary Stewart's book; if you like information more, get this one.  The horses now go on world tours so that common people like you and me can see them.	2005-08-02

This is a sad account of a betrayal which could and does happen to anyone who puts her faith in another.  It shows the dangers of baring your soul to anyone, even a professional.  Jennifer had been born in Topeka, Kansas, to a couple of psychiatrists  who moved around a lot.    \\"I'd actually come to L.A. to be an actress.  Nine years earlier I'd arrived from Kansas, via London, Michigan, New York and Chicago.\\"  You'd say that she'd been around and seen a lot in her short life.  She was ininiated into the world of show biz by doing stand-up comedy.  The first step for many Jewish girls unless their dads are in the business.  She had written a play, 'Prisoner of Love,' and went into depression when her agent let her down.  Coming from the mental background, you might think she'd be the last to fall victim to that illness.    Her story reads like a novel full of betrayal, intrigue and trust in the wrong person.  Dr. David Cohen was a con man in addition to being certified to practice counseling.  He deceived  her and when he was found dead, she felt guilty.    She has also written INHERITING THE HOLY LAND:An American's Search for Hope in the Middle East, and DEAR NEIGHBOR in 2004.   She appears to be a wonderful person who let her life get out of control.  And, of course, she found the 'wrong' person to turn to for help.  She has learned the hard way not to trust those she doesn't know.    I always tend to trust the wrong person.  I too went missing for a day plus, when I came back to Knoxville on the Greyhound to search for an apartment after going to Pulaski \\"to die\\" and finding a Hell on earth.  I was reported to the local police as a 'missing person' even though my son in Nashville knew exactly where I was.  No one had helped me to survive there, so I had to set out on my own to get my life in gear again.  It happened after 9-11-2001, the day I knew I wasn't dying.  Then, I was ready to get back in the groove and live life to its fullest.  When I got back here, I was \\"high\\" on just being alive.  And one person in particular made it worthwhile.    I hope that Jennifer Miller has found her spot on this earth; Heaven knows she deserves it.  I had some friends named Cohen in the literary club, and Fanny had a son named David.  I hope he wasn't this girl's devil.	2005-08-02

Written by an evangelical Christian and editor of the Sojourner magazine, this is a thought-provoking thesis -- and endorsed by Bill Moyers, one of my favorites on Public Television.  Answer me this, can politics and religion work together?  I don't think so.  God is personal, but never private.  I was invited to attend a beautiful Baptist church, which I did and enjoyed it tremendously, but I said \\"I am a Methodist\\" which was dismissed as \\"they are too liberal.\\"  At the end of the service, I told the preacher, \\"I am Methodist\\" and he replied \\"We love the Methodists here, so be sure to come back.\\"    In this book, you will find \\"progressive causes paired with spiritual guidance for the betterment\\" of America and Mr. Wallis' beliefs that \\"true faith transcends political categorization.\\"  I have studied the Bible from the beginning to the end in college and know that anybody can use a verse from it to prove his/her point.    He is relating it to the Middle East war (throughout the Bible there are talks of wars, the Holy Land area has always been 'at war' over one thing or another), to his opinions on abortion and capital punishment, politics, and family/community values.    He calls the race issue America's original sin -- I don't think so, race has nothing to do with religion but does have an impact on politics.  In 'Good Old Days Remembers: BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES,' full of beautiful pictures and paintings of the old days, there are hymns included, such as 'Amazing Grace' which I never did like and 'The Old Rugged Cross' which we hear only at Easter.  Others I remember from my youth as a Southern Baptist are 'Whispering Hope,' 'Blessed Assurance,' and 'What A Friend We Have In Jesus.\\"  My neighbor, Mrs. Owens, showed me a hymn which her son had written but she is greedy and did not want to share it with others.    This book, GOD'S POLITICS, will make you glad you read it or mad and wish you could talk back.  It is good to remember that this is only one man's opinion.  I don't believe in judging others and refuse to have anyone tell me how to vote.  In the '80s, I visited a Baptist church in Pulaski and adored the young minister, and yet when he got in the pulpit and told the congregation who they must vote for in the National election, I did not go back.  When a friend of mine (an old lady) died, he conducted her funeral and said that \\"You are judged by the friends you have\\" and looked at me -- in a nice way.     You will either love what Mr. Wallis has to say or highly disagree with him.  He has previously written THE SOUL OF POLITICS, THE RISE OF CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE, PEACEMAKERS, and FAITH WORKS.	2005-08-02

Henrik Ibsen wrote a play, A DOLL HOUSE in which the central character, Nora, rejects a marriage and life in \\"a doll's house.\\"  He wrote masterfully about women's rights; HEDDA GABLER was another of his strong-willed female characters.  Did she or did she not shoot her husband?  Or did he kill himself?  It's all in the game.    Evelyn Anthony of England calls her novel about international terrorism THE DOLL'S HOUSE.  \\"They call it the Doll's House, this idyllic country estate, acres of lawn, fine dining, and -- at the top of a sweeping staircase -- an antique child's playhouse built into the wall.  But something is wrong at the Doll's House what with odd acres being off-limits to guests of the manor. Is the Doll's House the swank hotel it seems, or is it something very different, even sinister?\\"    Harry Oakham has been put out to pasture in the spy business so he sets up a school to train terrorists in a lovely old hotel called the Doll's House Manor.  There Rosa finds former Polish, German, and Russian spies teaching others how to be assassins.  There she finds the love of her life -- for one day and night-- Mr. Harry Oakham.    Evelyn Anthony also wrote SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY which was made into a movie starring the 'Pretty Woman' Julia Roberts.  It was about spies and cruelty, too.	2005-08-02

This humbling book can actually change you from a non-believer into an enthusiastic born again Christian.  Reading of his transformation (in the guise of short essays) and learning of the hardships he endured before he found what he needed can encourage the person not ready to decide on a profound belief which will change him forever.    The topics are varied such as faith, belief, confession, church and grace.  Also he delves into romance, magic, and money from the Christian viewpoint.  These are things we all need to be a happy individual.  God works in His own time.  We don't always get what we want (not need) right away as it may not be to our best interests to persue what we can't have.  We often have to settle for second best.    From the Midrash  -- \\"the heart sees, hears, speaks, walks, falls, rejoices, cries out, comforts, suffers, surrenders, trembles, and often errs.  Live simply. Love  generously. Care deeply.  Speak kindly. Leave the rest to God.\\"	2005-08-01

This author asks the the reader: What if the great driving force of our evolution were actually \\"survival of the kindest?'  Now, that is a provacative beginning if I ever heard one.  Each of us was born with a blank slate, and our environment and family life can make or break kindness.  We are all capable of being nice and kind or mean and obnoxious.    He calls shame 'a wound to the very sense of self.'  If a child grows up being ashamed, it is the parents' fault by taking out their frustrations and aggressive manners onto their child.  I've seen many instances.  Today at the First Baptist Concord church, a little tyke just learning to walk was being self-sufficent and refused his mother's hand.  When I praised him, he showed his approval.  He was a big boy, getting bigger all of the time.  Another child was gregarious and very talkative to be so young.  His mother was so proud of her child as she should be and said that he is always like that.  I told her it's because he has a good mother.  This pleased her no end.    \\"There is a lasting form of shame associated with having been vulnerable and victimized.\\"  Usually this is something children learn to grown out of; while the elderly cannot seem to beat it at all.  Humiliation happens to everyone of us at one time or another.    On the other hand, humility (from the Latin humus, meaning the root of human and humiliate), as when we come back to the earth with a crash, 'the ego is one big purple bruise.'  I know someone in a high position who has almost no humility and fights rough on the internet.  In person, he is the most gentle person I have ever met.  I know another person who really does have humility.  I mentioned it to him once and he said that he had a lot to be humble about.  He too is a very successful person in his field.  Two different people (both very nice) in high positions, but oh! how different in the way they treat people.  One has a negative dispositon and the other a positive outlook on life.  Well, the good-hearted one is almost twenty years older than the other and, as we age, we do try to be kind and nice to people we don't know.  The other fights dirty to prove his point, and it upset me at first, but I learned sooner or later that he was right.    You need to read this book from the intellectual perspective to absorb some of its wisdom.  But you also need to read it 'from your heart.'  I have reviewed another of his instructive books, HEALING DREAMS from which I was able to follow his advice to help in my grief over my dead grandson's tragic accident.  He has also written THE HEALING PATH and REMARKABLE RECOVERY.  He is influenced by the Buddhist monks way of living and their devotion to their God.  That is the section of the Chicago Art Museum which I missed on purpose, as I told Geoffrey that I don't care about buddhas.      And those sceptical neuro-scientists with their Hell & brimstone philosophy are nothing new.  When Jeff went to school in Chicago, he said that was the first time he had seen an actual atheist.  He said that all scientists of any persuation tend to be atheists.  He did not, thank goodness.    Marc Barasch believes \\"that a single shift in consciousness can have a lasting impact on our psyches, our relationships, out health -- and the very fate of the Earth.\\"  That is a pretty hard thing to achieve, but we can work with others in \\"a search for the soul of kindness.'  It doesn't take much effort and you don't have to know a lot of big words; a \\"thank you\\" and \\"you're welcome\\" can make another person feel good and really shows that you are a compassionate human being.  Let's all strive to be kind at least once a day to begin with and work up to a month, a year, and before you know it, you are a different person who people respect and maybe can love.  He lives in Colorado near where Ken Young is located.  That is beautiful countryside and just breathing that clean, clear air can turn you around to be the kindest person anyone has evermet.    The hardest part about any kind of change is forgiveness for wrongs of the past.  We carry that hurt and humiliation around in our subscious, and can never be happy until it is resolved.	2005-08-01

Of the fifteen women she chooses to use as her subjects as women of the Bible, I liked the one about Sarah the best.  She calls her the 'founding mother' as she was married at the age of 65 to Abraham, then 75.  Abraham is considered to be the father of the Jewish Nation.  He was ninety-nine when he was cirumsized; a year later, Sarah (who had been barren all of her life) was delivered of a fine baby boy, Isaac.  Zach played Isaac in one of his dad's plays, the section about the sacrifice of an only son.    In the Jewish faith, most boy children are circumsized nine days after birth, some wait until the age of 13, but Abraham had to wait until his life should have been over.  This child brought them both back to life, and Issac lived up to their expectations.    Of the fifteen, she chose Jezebel and Bathsheba as the women who lusted after men.  Bathsheba's fate went from lust to love.  She was lucky.  Then, as now, there are three men to every woman, so some had to use subterfuge to get the man of their choice.  In modern times, I was under the impression that it was the man who did the choosing.  Some backward men of today still feel that way.    Eve was the first rebel, a woman after my own heart.  I've been a rebel since my mother died and left me behind to fend for myself.  I'm still a rebel.  Eve tempted Adam with the apple and the serpent aided her in this deception.  Things were never the same.    Deliah also used her wiles to get the man of her dreams, as did the Queen of Sheba.  There is a good section on David's wives: Michal, Abigail, and Bathsheba.  He had many wives like the father of ben Laden.    The Song of Solomon which depicts the longing to know and to 'be known,' also called the Song of Songs goes thusly:  \\"Oh, give me of the kisses of your mouth, for your love is sweeter than wine.  Your ointments yield a sweet fragance, your name is like finest oil -- Therefore do maidens love you.   Draw me after you, let us run!  O you who linger in the garden, a lover is listening;  Let me hear your voice.  \\"Hurry, my beloved, swift as a gazelle or a young stag, to the hills of spices!\\"  How beautiful you are, my love, my friend!    The doves of your eyes looking out from the thicket of your hair.    Your hair, like a flock of goats, bounding down Mt. Gilead...  His head is burnished gold, the mane of his hair black as the raven.  His mouth is sweet wine, he is all delight.

In this book, the pope opined a message of peace and hope in the salvation of humankind.  Today I attended (as a visitor -- I am Methodist) Concord First Baptist Church, and they not only preach it, they live it.  Here I was thinking that Knoxville, my hometown, was so bad and that wonderful ministry is just to the west of us near Farragut.    John Paul II reigned as the leader of the Catholic church for more than 25 years.  He has counseled political leaders on a philosophical level, and yet his books have stuck with the religious realm.  He was welcomed and revered everywhere he went, and is sorely missed.  He became one of the most influential political figures in the world, traveling to each and every country preaching the gospel, using this mantra:  Live simply. Love  generously. Care deeply.  Speak kindly. Leave the rest to God.     He was a deeply compassionate man of God and not only spoke 'kindly' but lovingly.   This, the last book he finished before his death, is a historical meditation about freedom and its limits.   He has warned the leaders of all denoninations of the dangers of the growing trend in atheism.      It was conducted in the form of a question-and-answer discussion.  He not only delved into consumerism and materialism, he speaks about the ideas of homeland and nation and gives his views on our democracy system in America.  He and the Dahlai Lama have consistently tried to instill in us commoners who read books the reason we are on this earth, to help each other and to grow in Christ.    The title of this book, MEMORY AND IDENTITY, appealed to me as a person I know declared that I have an identity problem.  He had me convinced that I must have Alheimer's disease until the problem was cleared up in a minor miracle with two bus drivers as witnesses.  Then I knew that he was just leading me on.    This book will help anyone who is struggling with his/her faith.	2005-07-31

This book is interesting in that Kanmandu used to be closed to the western world.  Their culture is so special, being at the foot of Tibet, that we could not appreciate it.  But the first I heard of it was in Paul Theroux's RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER as that was the starting point for his adventurous, almost fatal, car trip up that treacheous, spectacular mountain to see the Dahlai Lama.  He distributed 8X10 glossys of the one we all revere.  And made it to Shangrila. <br /> <br />Before that my favorite news reporter in the Fifties, think it was for CBS, was invited to do a broadcast from there and he took had an accident, only his was more serious -- on the way down the mountain when his mule took a misstep and fell.  Paul's was on the way up to Tibet. <br /> <br />Ever since I read his book and reviewed it for my literary club, I have done much searching for the truth of Tibet and its major problems even today.  These essays show just how special Kathmandu is and how they struggle to keep their impenetrable jungle just that.  It is beauty personaified.  We need to know more about the Asian culture and beliefs so that we can all live in harmony.	2005-07-30

We see it all the time on T.V. news.  This one tends to live dangerously; he wrote about American Illegal Aliens in 1987 -- I wish he would do a followup as so much has changed in that regard in the past twenty years or so. <br /> <br />In this book, Ted Conover worked for a yar at the Sing Sing prison (where they held the Rosenbergs back in the '50s) in upstate New York.  Next to Alcatraz out in the ocean off California, this possibly is the most dangerous place to encounter hard criminals.  Not that I am saying that the Rosenbergs were criminals; perhaps the husband was, but Ethel was not -- and it was a travesty of justice to take her away from her two sons.  I've done some research in that case, and I know for a fact that she was not involved, but her brother was.  They went to Los Alamos to gather information for the Russians; that made them considered 'spies.'  Ethel never would have been capable of that, just as Alger Hiss was not! <br /> <br />We have a local investigative reporter who goes places for background of articles but he goes where he will be simply an unknown and have a good time while he is snooping out the info he needs for a good article.  He is good and improving every year.  He might some day catch up to Ted Conover. <br /> <br />He takes such risks in his endeavor to keep the public informed of the bad side of life.  Those men and women incarcerated, for the most part, committed horendous crimes and will again -- even on the guards if possible.  Not all are that way.  Some are there because they were framed, like Ethel Rosenberg.  He went through prison guard training, though from the prison movies I've seen they aren't particularly smart, just mean. <br /> <br />This book was a touch of Hell as they know it and experience it every day.  That's why I am against the death penalty; keeping folks locked up away from the people they love (and hate) is a much worse fate than a quick death.	2005-07-30

If you want to be 'well-read' and don't know where to begin, this little guide can give you some pointers in getting started.  As he suggests, it is not always a good idea to start with the 'classics' as they were written so long ago that their idiom is not what we are used to or the way we talk.  I had the advantage of being married to a college lit teacher who insisted I take English Lit (because it was harder) even though I would have enjoyed the American Lit so much better. <br /> <br />You know the way I learned most of the American literature is by typing his exams for that class.  Later, I tried to read 'The House Of Seven Gables,' and couldn't understand any of it after seeing the movie.  I loved Edgar Allen Poe.  But I went through a non-fiction period when I refused to take the time to even look at novels, as I considered them a waste of time.  Novels are easier to read generally, and the 'first novel' (debuts of a new writer) include much of the real experience of the author and I enjoy them more than non=fiction -- which I have gotten into again. <br /> <br />Fiction is turned out so fast by prolific writers it is the same old thing with different names by some of them.  But I found that I could learn something from every book I read, fiction or non-fiction.  You don't have to start in a big way.  Find a writer you like and just enjoy for awhile.  I read most of Paul Theroux's non-fiction and learned to think and feel like him, but his novels were another thing.  I once wrote to him that his first novel was so weird I don't see how it ever got published. <br /> <br />Sharyn McCrumb is great for folk tales turned into novels and her continuing characters from book to book makes you feel you are family with those folks in Hamblen County, Tennessee.  She's great!  Terry Brooks and Stephen Donaldson are my favorite fantasy writers as they know the English language (grammar) so well and that was my specialty.  I can't read Carmac McCarty as he used too many curse words.  I was reading a book by a well-known writer about Chicago students who robbed a Wells Fargo after it left a store to get the money without causing the store to go bankrupt, but the language got in the way. I took it back to the library but it stayed in my mind so that I had to go and get it months later to see if they got caught or not.  Good literature can come in many forms. <br /> <br />I do not agree with this writer about audio books.  I have many and I was getting them as \\"Books on Tape\\" from a government-funded program in Nashville, but they all put me to sleep.  That is not good reading.  If you never know what happened at the end of the cassette, you might as well not hear the beginning.  I am too busy during the day to sit down to listen, like a bored half-blind person, so I prefer the large print when it is available.  I have serious retina problems now on both eyes as they don't want to accept the silicone implants from three years ago after cataract removal (when the doctor removed the lense also).  But that doesn't keep me from keeping up my reports.  It's better to have hurting, itching red eyes than to lose one's vision. <br /> <br />I have a large collection of the classics, what I call my 'pretty books' because of the bindings.  I have read some but the print is too small in most of them to bother.  Read what you are comfortable with in the beginning, then begin to branch out.  I belonged to a literary club for 36 years and we chose our own books, and learned from each other.  When I started in 1967, we would never tell the ending as the reason for our reviews was to entice the listener to want to read the book.  So I won't tell you what to read.  The main thing is to read something and start with children's books if you have to. <br /> <br />Every book is a learning experience and sometimes an adventure.	2005-07-30

The nomadic life of these children reminded me of my sister's large faimly, moving around all for the sake of religion.  They, too, went to New York City from Westminster, Maryland, to church convention-type meetings.  Jeannnette's mother, father, and three kids spent a month in Las Vages in one motel room.  From ther they ventured out to a West Virginia mining town, nothing as poor as that area unless you are stranded out in the desert somewhere out West.    As they wandered around like nomads, her mother bought a cut crystal vase on layaway because \\"she felt like th surest way to feel rich was to invest in quality 'nonessentials.'\\"  It's sad to be that poor.  Jeannette rode the Greyhound to New York City and describes her first impression: \\"a huge island jammed tip to tip with skyscrapers.\\"    She grew up thinking of herself as a tall, gangly girl from Appalachia, 'all elbows and knees and jutting teeth.'  Her dad had convinced her to believe in her inner beauty.  \\"I hoped when the New Yorkers looked at me, they would see whatever it was that Dad saw.\\"  Like all men, he was a liar.  She described herself thusly, \\"I was six feet all, pale as a frog's underbelly, and had bright red hair.\\"    It seems she had an inferiority complex from the beginning, hated the way her teeth stuck straight out, and decided she would make her own braces.  At my dad's funeral, Elsie's teeth did the same, so I asked her son \\"What is wrong with your mother's mouth?\\"  He said she had put on too much poli-grip.  Her new dentures were too loose.  If you get the cheap ones (none are free) at the Health Department, they never fit.  Those volunteer dentists don't make impressions,  and the dentures are all a modified (small, medium and large) size so you have to use lots of poli-grip.  She looked like a rabbit.    Out in Welch, Arizona, Cindy Thompson tried to recruit Jeannette to join the junior KKK.  At one of their marches around the public square of Pulaski, a nice-looking man carrying a baby leading his wife and small children stopped and asked me shere the fire hall was located.  I said, \\"Right down that hill,\\" pointing to the right, \\"but the police have it blocked off and they can't come up here (to the Square).  It turned out that he was the one chosen to lead that year's parade, so they came up Jefferson instead of Madison.  The place was so full of outside police, state and various counties, it looked like we were in Nazi Germany or a police state, with the helicopters hovering over the scene.    \\"My mom will talk to anyone,\\" remarked Justin to his friends.  I'd just taken a picture of the design on the back of a skinhead's black leather jacket (with permission).  Those weird fellows told me they were all Vet Nam vets.   One had the audacity to say he'd been in the Persian Gulf war.  Apparently, they thought small town people would believe anything if they had the courage (or stupidity) to be watching as the Klans from Arkansas, Chicago and places far away paraded around carrying the Rebel flag.  I took photos of their colorful outfits: purple, green and various shades, not all white.    Jeannette had a very sad life on the road and always held her hand over her mouth when she laughed.  There are lots of Jeannette's out there, with no one to help and no dental work to make them look as good as the rich kid on the block.  Her family increased when a brother was born before she was able to convince her mother to leave her dad who stayed away more and more and spent all of the family income on gambling and drinking.    She now lives in New York and is one of the regulars on MSNBC (where John Seigenhalter from Nashville, Tennessee reigns supreme).  Good for you, John.  She is married to John Taylor, a writer.  I'm grateful for her fighting spirit and willingness to broadcast far and wide how sordid life can be in the United States for poor children.	2005-07-29

It concerned a despondent genius who became tired of living -- and just gave up.  He and wife Laura moved into a cabin in the mountains of Vermont in 1971.  It was not an easy life, nor was it an easy move for Guy.  In a speech he wrote for the G. E. president, \\"We are each inevitably and terribly and forever personally responsible for everything we do.\\"    For almost thirty years they braved the elements living in a primitive manner, but he was running from the deaths of his two sons and could not come to terms with the guilt phase.  John Milton wrote in 'Paradise Lost,' ...'How gladly would I meet mortality, my sentence, and be earth insensible!   how glad I lay me down as in my mother's lap!\\"  He was wrong and his writing influenced a senstive man to take his own life.    On February 6, 2000, Guy climbed to the summit of Mount Lafayette in the White Mountains in New Hampshire and sat down to die.  Boris Pasternak wrote \\"A man who decides to commit suicide puts a full stop to his being, he burns his back on the past, he declares himself a bankrupt, and his memories to be unreal.\\"  That is a fallacy.  Death puts an end to all life and can never be undone, so we should try to delay it as best we can and for as long as we can.  I gave up once, I won't again.    I hope Mark Donaldson won't miss his rural small town in Minnesota and that he starts a garden of his choice out in my neck of the woods.  Life can be a veritable garden of Eden, and I believe he can fulfill that reality if he sticks around long enough.      They were a lovely couple in the photo taken at their wedding.  She was the classically beautiful bride.  As Christine told me on her wedding day, \\"Mrs. Burks, all brides are beautiful.\\"  But in this case, she was the essence of beauty.  Together, she and Guy wrote WILDERNESS ETHICS, BACKWOODS ETHICS, and FOREST AND CRAG.  I wish the ending had been less difficult and that he had sought help for his depression.Some things are beyond our ability to change, but that is a sad state to be in.  It is better sometimes to leave things as they are and not change drastically as Mr. Donaldson wishes to do to the city of my birth.  If he tries too hard, he may become depressed.  But hopefully, if this be the case, he will seek help and live at least ten years here to keep his bet with me.    Guy Waterman was a fascinating figure, but he had a lovely wife at his side who can now teach us all a bit about ethics, wherever you happen to be.	2005-07-28

This is a Gothic novel about a crime spree in the Soviet Union after it collapsed in December, 1991.  To the author, it was a labor of love, he says, as he loves everything Russian.  Yet, he lives in London.    An American Alice Liddell was in Russia to privitized the Red October Vodka to make it more easily available in the U.S.  With the glaring title and those beautiful onion-top buildings (I have a copy out of a magazine on my wall), I automatically thought that it was about the drink. I'd had a bad experience with that strong liquor so I was interested to find out something about it -- since I am a lifelong tee-totaler.    At a cookout in Chicago on June 9, 1990, Mr. Mather (father of the bride) kept leaning over me for a kiss on his cheek.  After all, I was a pretty Southern belle (mother of the groom) but, after awhile, it got on my nerves.  The man was never satiated.  I told my son about it, saying the old man must be drunk.  He'd said, \\"Oh, Mom, he drinks vodka, which has no smell.\\"    Russian folklore has a bogeyman named Myertovjec, a brute with a purple face.  I'm surprised he would show his face as he was a vampire.  \\"If a vampire was going to strike anywhere, Russia was as good a place as any.\\"  There was a gang of child killings in Russia while Alice Liddell was there.  She wondered, \\"Why children?\\"  Could their blood rejuvenate or reinvent the vampire.    There is a tale about a Transylvania countess E. Bathory who'd killed 650 young women and bathed in their blood; she'd mistakenly it would keep her forever young.  She died three years after being incarcerated in a windowless prison for the murders.    Vodka will not keep the drinker young; on the other hand, it makes one older than he really is.  But tell that to a drinker.  The books gets involved in the Russian beliefs and degradation, dwelling on the murderous side.  Who ever heard of people in Russia killing each other!	2005-07-27

This is a memoir of love, loss and recovery.  It is filled with pictures throughout, which made the book, along with the glossy color prints in the photo section.  As a young man, John Shaw looked like my son Zach, Roman nose and all.  As the older one with silvery white hair, he looked marvelous.    She used this quote in the book, somewhere toward the middle:  (from Albert Camus on the Spanish Civil War) \\"Men learnt that we can be right and still be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit, that there are times when courage is not its own reward.\\"  John fought with depression all of his life, along with being a workaholic.    He appeared in many plays and movies in England.  She was a sexy actress.  They appeared together in Michael Frayn's \\"The Two Of Us' which was a failure, but their marriage survived through thick and thin.  \\"Ours was not a conventional love affair, but whose is?  We made up our own rules as we went along.  It consumed us for twenty-eight years.    In 1955, she married Alec Ross who died in 1961 of cancer.  They had a daughter, Joanne.  In 1964, she married John Shaw and, at the age of 38, gave birth to her second daughter, Abby.  There is a picture of her in the dyed (orange) fox longcoat and fur hat she was wearing when she met John.  After his death on February 21, 2002, she says \\"Life goes on -- and on and on.\\"  They had a blessed life one with big cars (a Morgan) and big Gothic Victorian style homes; they had successful careers both before and during the marriage.    Now, she is lovely with her white hair.  Who knows, she may find yet another memorable love.  That would be great!	2005-07-27

I'd heard of this book when it came out and discarded the idea of another gossip-about-the-princess escapade through memory lane.  Others claimed affairs, the chauffeur, playboys, anyone and everyone; if she'd done all they said she had, she'd never have been so frustrated.  With so many partners, she definitely could have let Charles go his way without getting on British telly and whine and moan about how badly she was being trated.  Actually, her treatment was of the best but without consideration for her age and position.    She wasn't circumspect when it came to choosing her lovers, even claimed  a one-night stand with John Kennedy, Jr.  Of course, we'll never know as both are dead.  She should never had put her life in danger, but that shows frustration and not only sexually.    With Charles out galivanting around openly with a married woman and ignoring the young girl he used to produce heirs, you'd think the queen would have assigned a female companion or maid to the Spenser offspring she detested, instead of a butler.  Those are menservants for gentlemen to help them dress and groom and be sure their clothes were in good order.  But, it was foolish, to say the least, to assign a man to look after her.  She was used by the royal family as window dressing for personal appearances.      It was fun watching her grow from a shy, gangly \\"step-child\\" into the model of beauty which faded so fast.  The color photos are lovely when she was dressed up for an appearance, informally in sweatshirt and shorts, as an average person (at Bristol Zoo), and casual at the birthday party.  Now, that's what I call dressing up in modern America.    His family pictures were not necessary as, after all, he was writing about his life working for the royals.  He was nothing more than a servant inside and Diana's security guard out on treks wherever she decided to go.  She may have had a rotten marriage, but she had the money to go anywhere and everywhere, and freedom from a demanding husband.  It was clear from the first that he did not love her.  After all, he did wed his mistress with the queen's blessing.    She looked for love and personal commitment from all the wrong people.  She was much too young to have been married off to Charles in the first place.  Her sense of style does look a bit dated now, but she looked fantastic at the time.  Sometimes the hats were a little bit overwhelming, but she pulled it off with class.    I hope that her son William will be the next king of England and not Charles.  He is a poor specimen of a man, even halfway human.  He was monstrous to the young wife and not once showed her real love and affection.  Diana (no woman) should never have been put through all that turmoil.    She was always seeking the elusive love destiny would not allow her to find.  She served her purpose, as far as the royal family is concerned, and they'd prefer to forget she ever existed.  William looks so much like his Mum, it hurts me to see how he and Harry have to be disgraced by their royal dad.    We never know when we will be gone.  It's over in minutes as with Diana's internal injuries or sometimes prolonged over years of pain and suffering.  One thing for sure, life is too short for most of us and we should strive for a happy and loving relationship with at least one person.	2005-07-26

Using deceit, John obtained a positon of editing some diaries which belong to an eminent bishop's family at Illaton Manor.  Surround by lovely family gardens, like Longwood Gardens in NE Pennsylvania, he finds the botanical papers preserved by generations.  Also in the country home there is a cache of private letters which John decides to use for his own profit and benefit.   The Bishop's father had inherited the estae in 1911. <br /> <br />\\"In the midst of their completely ruthless and amoral ives, th Jon Corbins of this world felt compelled to make the occasional oblations to the gods of chance.\\"  His charming character is like that of a con man, amoral, and a thief to which he puts to use. <br /> <br />He had written a book, GREEN PLEASURES, about his love of growing things, making him the perfedt choice as editor of the botanical papers.  His unscrupulous tendencies which he keeps hidden make him the worst to deal with the diaries and letters. <br /> <br />\\"He lived in the Garden of Eden, but fate could at any time change.  'Religion' has now come into the market place and must raise its voice unashamedly with the other hustlers and pedlars.\\" <br /> <br />John attempted to sell some of the Bishop's letters to the highest bidder.  \\"He could at times be rough, crude, and draconian to those hwo cross his will or served him badly.\\"  Everything in life for him was a game -- dangerous, challenging, and amusing.  Frustrated and anger were built up in him and 'the only instinct which he could follow was a desire to wound another to ease his own wounds.'  Like somebody I know.  This time, however, he challenged the wrong person and lost.

This novel is about Leo who left Poland to come to America and finds himself alone and lonely in an apartment he hates, similar to mine here, and reminisces to sixty years earlier when he fell in love and wrote a book.  Another similarity; I too wrote a romantic 'novel' four years ago, though I am older than he was then.  Love comes in all forms and flavors, from the good to the bad and lots in between.  Believe me, I could write the real history of love! <br /> <br />In Leo's book, a character named Alma has survived in a human (a 14-yr-old) who is writing her own book.  She receives a mysterious letter and seeks her namesake in Poland.  Poor Leo feels that life has passed him by, and wonders who will be the last person to find him alive -- could it be the delivery boy from the Chinese take-out, the pizza man, or will ti be the attendant at the nearby Starbucks.  He has been a deserted soul now for some time and decides that maybe life just ain't worth living. <br /> <br />\\"Leopold Gursky started dying on August 18, 1920; he finally did die all alone because he was too embarrassed to call anyone.\\" It could be that he died thinking of Alma, or when he chose not to.  Love does that to one, even an old man, as he remembers how good it was to love and be loved.  When he fell in love, that was the beginning of his demise. <br /> <br />Nicole Krauss was born in New York in 1974, same year Justin was born on December 4.  He will be the death of me; sometimes, you can love your son too much.  And sometimes you can love another son not enough.  The only one to stand by in your elder years is the one you did not love at all.  He just wants to watch you die.  Her first novel is called MAN WALKS INTO A ROOM.  That title reminds me of a book I loved, A MAN WALKS THROUGH a mirror from the medieval world to carry off a N. Y. librarian to another life, but she chose to leave him behind and return to a loveless life.  That is the tragedy of life, we don't love the person who needsus the most.  And the person you want the most to love you won't.  That, my friends, is the story of love.	2005-07-25

A ghostwriter is usually paid be be quiet about his/her authorship, as in the V.C. Andrews novels which have become more popular since her death, as more qualified people are doing the coomposing. Jennie Erdal of Scotland worked for twenty years as a non-deplume for a man, even writing his love letters. Where have we run into that before? A play, I think; certainly a movie! <br /> <br />I've often wondered if our local history writer does not write his own columns, as I've asked him for more details of something he wrote but did not remember any of it. Strange, gets stranger. This non-hip person is writing about things he would never notice in his lifetime, and you have to wonder if he is just the 'front', the frosting on the cake. Once I called him to task about writing something about the KKK, of which he knew nothing; thus, I went to the small library where the Klan was started after the Civil War and copied the short history as written by the wife of a newspaper editor. It meant nothing to him, and he contributed it to the local historical society.  He is a Presbyterian like Jennie Erdal.

Sometimes, when first beginning, women writers have taken false names until they become well-known in their own personna. Then they re-release the early writings.  <br /> <br />Not being able to acknowledge your own compositons is hard and not as lucrative as it would have been, after a successful and well-advertised campaign turns out to make it famous and much sought after.  That's where the money comes in.  She agreed to do one book, but it evolved into a full career of deceit. <br /> <br />There is a handbook on ghostwriting.

This true story is about identity theft of the worst kind, by an alleged murderer who chose the name of his favorite journalist, Michael Finkel.  How in a million years could he choose that name out of a hat? <br /> <br />Alastair Reid wrote, \\"What is true lies between you and the idea of you -- a friciton, restless, between the fact and the fiction\\" in his book WHERE TRUTH LIES.  We can all take what we want to believe and make it 'truth' as we see it.  It may be a fantasy or, as in this case, a coverup for something bad. <br /> <br />Sometime in 2001, the Longo family (wife and three children) are found murdered; the father, Christian, is captured in Mexico using the alias of Micahel Finkel of the 'New York Times.'  The real M. F. is indeed a writer for the 'Times magazine.'   After the capture of the 'false' M. F., the real one is fired for \\"falsifying part of an investigative article.\\" <br /> <br />He now has the time to dig and discover why this particular individual wanted to be him.  The two men exchange nearly 1,000 letters, talk on the phone about his upcoming trial, and talk face-to-face in the prison visiting area.  He becomes emotionally involved in the case and sets out to prove the innocence of his new friend (in a slightly unusual way).  It seems that Longo had lived a life of deception and lies, and the truth is never as he tries to make it.   <br /> <br />This reads more like a novel with the two protaganists on the same side of the law, and yet at times, they are disbelieving of each other and the reasons they are communicating.  Of course, the journalist gets a book out of the process.  But what does the theif of his identity receive as a consequence.  The author lives in Bozeman, Montana.	2005-07-25

Alas, this book is about a man who left Poland to come to America and finds himself alone and lonely in an apartment he hates, similar to mine here, and reminisces to sixty years earlier when he fell in love and wrote a book. Another similarity; I too wrote a romantic 'novel' four years ago, though I am older than he was then. Love comes in all forms and flavors, from the good to the bad and lots in between. Believe me, I could write the real history of love! <br /> <br />In this book, a character named Alma has survived in a human (a 14-yr-old) who is writing her own book. She receives a mysterious letter and seeks her namesake in Poland. He feels that life has passed him by, and wonders who will be the last person to find him alive -- could it be the delivery boy from the Chinese take-out, the pizza man, or will ti be the attendant at the nearby Starbucks. He has been a 'deserted soul' now for some time and decides that maybe life just ain't worth living. <br /> <br />He really started dying in 1920; he finally did die all alone because he was too embarrassed to call anyone. It could be that he died thinking of Alma, or when he chose not to. Love does that to one, even an old man, as he remembers how good it was to love and be loved. When he fell in love, that was the beginning of his demise. <br /> <br />That title reminds me of a book I loved, A MAN WALKS THROUGH a mirror from the medieval world to carry off a N. Y. librarian to another life, but she chose to leave him behind and return to a loveless life. That is the tragedy of life, we don't love the person who needs us the most. And the person you want the most to love you won't. That, my friends, is the story of love!	2005-07-25

A few months ago, I reviewed DELECTION OF DUTY about the young Marine who called around then-President Clinton's little black box and accompanied him everywhere.  He broke the case on the excesses some presidents make while in the White House. <br /> <br />This is a totally different cup of tea.  Joseph Petro was one of the secret service who protected then-President Reagan (though he did wind up being shot, though not fatally).  He served as a major person and is shown on the cover accompanying Reagan from a speech into the Oval Office.  He had privy to private information and on one occasion sneaked the president and his wife out on a personal outing.  Now that Reagan suffered from Alheimer's and lost every memory of his eventful life, I have more respect for his intervention in Russia to end the Cold War. <br /> <br />At the post office recently, I commented on his being the worst we'd had as I looked at a display honoring him, and said to a man there, \\"All I remember that is did is tell Gorbachev to 'tear down that wall.'  That was a momenteous event in U. S. history.  Then, I decided that Lyndon Johnson was the worst -- but that's another story for another book. <br /> <br />Young Mr. Petro protected Pope John Paul during one of his visits to the U. S.  He explains that the idea for this book began when his college chum, Jeffrey Robinson, suggested that they work together on such a book as this which is just out.  A mutual friend, Steve Young, Ken's father, arranged the luncheon at which the basis of the book was hammered out.  Jeffrey who lives in London has written eighteen prior books.  And Joseph went on to become head of gloval security and investigations for Citigroup, the company Steve works for in London. <br /> <br />It was good to read about a decent president as those who followed him in office had many shortcomings.  It is good to know nice things to remember him for; Chuck Southcott out in California has much respect for Nancy Reagan.  She stood byher man to the end, through thick and thin.  She is the admirable force behind the throne; oh, I forget, we have no throne in America.  But she would have made a wonderful queen!	2005-07-25

A ghostwriter is usually paid be be quiet about her authorship, as in the V.C. Andrews novels which have become more popular since her death, as more qualified people are doing the composing.  Jennie Erdal of Scotland worked for twenty years as a non-deplume for a man, even writing his love letters.  Where have we run into that before?  A play, I think; certainly a movie!    He was hired initially to help him to write a complicated non-fiction book on women.  Who but a woman would know how to do that; indeed, the work was so successful she completed two novels using his name.  Then she ended up writing a multitude of newspaper columns under the false name.  I've often wondered if our local history writer does not write his own columns, as I've asked him for more details of something he wrote but did not remember any of it.  Strange, gets stranger.  This non-hip person is writing about things he would never notice in his lifetime, and you have to wonder if he is just the 'front', the frosting on the cake.  Once I called him to task about writing something about the KKK, of which he knew nothing; thus, I went to the small library where the Klan was started after the Civil War and copied the short history as written by the wife of a newspaper editor.  It meant nothing to him, and he contributed it to the local historical society.    Jennie was caught in a web of deceit.  Ghostwriters don't usually reveal themselves, wrote Joyce JOhnson, on the back cover of this book.

Michael Berg was only fifteen when a woman twice his age, Hanna Schmitz, initiates him into an early adulthood.  In a small town of postwar Germany, she takes him into her house and he becomes her lover.  Suddenly, she disappears and the poor boy is frustrated as she searches far and wide for her, asking neighbors if they know where she has gone.  He is heartbroken.    But life goes on and he become a law student and eventually finds her again in an unexpected place in court on trial for war crimes.  As he observes the trial as a learning experience, with a type of pleasure and feeling of retribution, he watched as she was unjustly treated, slandered and attacked verbally.  He is bitter to be reminded how she had used him and thought about the birthmark on her shoulder.    We all have secrets and events we'd like to keep hidden, forgotten in the past.  After a while, one's past has a tendency to surface to our shame; it is not always a happy remembrance, one we cannot face again.  All families have skeletons in the closet which are best left unexposed and kept hidden.  Hidden from those we love who may judge us harshly.  If we've endured trauma or emotional pain, it is twice as bad when the memory resurfaces.    He learns in court that she had been a young guard in a concentration camp. I can identify with Hanna as she was falsely accused time after time.  She faced down the trial judge as I did the Mayor.    They were able to cast reasonable doubt about her conduct at the camps and how she had used the young, delicate girls as \\"readers\\" because they were too weak to do the hard labor on the building site.  A church had caught on fire by the bombing and many POWs died as a result.  Hanna was supposed to have a key, but so did the other guards, but none fit the front door.    This is a dramatic and sad war story and a bittersweet story of forbidden love.  Mr. Schlink has also written FLIGHTS OF LOVE and SELF'S PUNISHMENT.  Not a book I shall soon forget.	2005-07-25

I was taken with this blurb on the book jacket:  \\"Let's face it: LIfe is something we all make up as we go along.  No matter how carefully we formulate a 'script' it is bound to change when we interact with people who have scripts of their own.\\"  I've never acted in a play but I have seen many as the wife of a college play director.  Some were awful, others grand, all a learning process.  Watching a play take form from just a script, with all three of my children appearing in their dad's plays at one time or another, and seeing the final outcome is a joy to behold.    The best improv actor I've seen in all these many years and from all of the plays of all types (amateur to professional), it would have to be Terry Webber here at UT who has formed a group of Christian Word Players with his wife.   I understand that she is as talented as he, though I have yet to meet her.    Mrs. Madson went from Richmond, Virginia, to California.  That's a big step up, I do say.  She shows that there are two kinds of intelligence -- one acquired, the other within you, moving out.  It doesn't take much pulling to get that inner self on stage and improv all you want.  Of her thirteen maxims, I like these best:  Start anywhere.  Face the facts,  Make mistakes.  Act Now.  Enjoy the Ride.    I have a few to add:  Listen to your heart.  Go with the Flow.  Lighten Up.  Look Around You.  Love Yourself.  Think on Your Feet, not Contrived Logic.  Don't be Afraid to Love Others or to be judged by the way you dress.  You can be a mod woman with the thigh high skirts with very little to cover what needs covering.  You can wear pants, who cares?  I was one of the last females to start wearing them, and now it is hard to get me in a skirt.  But I do have party clothes and pretty dresses and skirts.  Riding the buses and always being alone, I have to generally dress down instead of up.  But it would be fun to dress up every once in a while to show that I am still a woman.    The main thing is to enjoy life and enjoy what you are doing.  The more you improvise, the better things will turn out -- not always as you might expect, but the way they should.  We never know who will be around the next corner or the main ingredient in our personal lives, but it is good to be prepared.  Let go -- don't hold grudges.  If someone hurt you 2.5 to 4 years ago, forget it and decide you did learn something from it.  It's not easy being mature, but life is not a bowl of cherries.  It is what we make it, and it can be good.  Most of all, Keep Smiling!	2005-07-24

This is an example of the Nineteenth Century literary imagination coupled with the new style of writing 'history' which doesn't have to stick with the facts but can create a few for entertainment effects.  Mrs. Hitchcock used letters to show the human Mary Lamb.  She suffered a madness similar to Mary Lincoln.  Only through the intervention on the part of her brother who helped her to write TALES FROM SHAKESPEARE, she was not confined to a mental institution for the long years of her life.  It was the literary redemption and the 'power of the written word' which save her sanity and her life.    It is the compelling story of the English Lizzie Borden.  If her brother had not been the famous Charles Lamb, we would never have known about this tragic life and death and the circumstances which compelled her to kill her own mother with a big knife in 1796.  Lizzie, on the other hand, used an ax to chop her father to death because of a supposed indiscretion (his or hers?) and a nasty step-mother.  Perhaps he had it coming, to sequester an old-maid daughter to watch him faun over and fondle that woman in her mother's house.    You don't have to be in the throes of a mental illness to kill someone.  There is a popular song called 'Killing Me Softly With His Song.'  There are numerous incidences in ballads and folk tales about murders due to unrequited love and perceived slights.  Even extensive and unwarranted criticism can induce the killing instinct of self-preservation.    I'm not saying that any of these caused her to kill her mother.  She alone knew the deep reason for such drastic actions.  Sometimes, people are just driven too far and their minds 'snap.'  It is a type of temporary madness due to circumstances; it is a compulsion beyond their control.  When the young boys in Chicago killed a neighbor boy as explained in the book COMPULSION and a more recent killing of a partly-autistic boy by two neighbor boys happened, no one really knows what makes children kill children.  Kids are mean until they are taught by the adults in their families that you cannot always act on your wants and desires of the moment.    Mary would have surely lost her mind except for the loving care of her brother and his literary friends.  Charles died in 1835 at the age of sixty, and she lived to be past eighty.  They'd lived a sheltered life prior to a few years before the murder.  The move may have brought on Mary's inclinations to hit back.    Photographs of the luminaries of that time and some drawings enhance the narrative.  It is interesting, but not unusual.	2005-07-24

This is a cute, little handdrawn and handwritten book which belongs in the children's section instead of upstairs with the nonfiction.  Perhaps it is real life, but not as we all experience it.  Depression comes in many forms, and hers was out-of-this-world, I admit.  But I have yet to meet anyone else who suffer the same way with depression.  Most of the time it is temporary, and this book would appeal to the pre-teens who would learn the most from it.    You can tell that she is a children's book writer, as the explanations are so simple none of it would be over the head of the average child reader.  Children are more advanced these days and understand what this old world is doing to all of us.  They are perceptive and, those being blessed with having books read to them from an early age, will be able to tackle this book.    The pictures will get their attention right off and they would profit much more than adults.  For most of us when we have a depresssion, we need deep, instructive, workbooks to get back on track.  Not children, as they are resilient and can bounce right back without being doped up.  Adults don't need antidepressants, either, as they are poison to some of us and hurt more than help.    Having someone to listen to our successes and failures is all we really need.  It need not be a doctor, therapist, or professional -- just someone who cares and will listen.  When my grandson died in April, I had such a person willing to listen, thank God, and you know, he said very little.  But, being there and available to hear me talk about the past helped.  More than any medicine, we need people to cry with, laugh at, lash out sometimes to get the stress we all feel  out of our system, and then still speak to us -- even if it is just to criticize.  He told me that I have not changed, the same old Betty Burks, but I am very grateful to be back to myself again and not be hurt by such a remark.      The drawings in this volume are primitive but cute and could hold the attention of a teen or pre-teen who needs a little comforting.  You may think that this is not a comforting book, as at times we all hurt through emotional crises, but it is a teaching vehicle in a primitive state.  School libraries should make this book available to the youth, as they are the future of this nation.  And we certainly don't want them to be overmedicated, as so many old people are these days.	2005-07-23

Electronic communication has reached global proportions with the satellities in space and the domes hidden there in the English countryside, watching and reporting on any- and everything.  Big Brother is everywhere and can no longer be hidden from the public, snooping on the least of us.  Cameras are now on the interstates (they say for our safety, but I don't think so; we were much safer twenty-five years ago out on the roads.) Sending spy satellites into orbit to keep track of people who aren't spies or a danger to this country has turned 'chatter' into informant information.  Even your best friend will reveal what you tell him or her.  There is no privacy, even behind closed doors.    There is a government program called Echelon which has been interfering in and invading the lives of ordinary people by using satellites to listen in on voice communications.  It used to be called easedropping (done on the sly) and it still is.  Our rights are being violated constantly in the guise of preventing terrorism.    Before 9/11/2001, it wasn't very effective as the terrorists used public computers for communicating with each other.  With this satellite snooping ability, it did not prevent this calamity from happening.  They were here in this country (legally); many others are here today.  But they invaded our space and destroyed the false sense of safety we had by their determination to destroy our country.      Lives of others don't mean a thing to them.  They are here for a purpose, and we welcomed them with open arms.  The 'chatter' did not prevent this from happening as Internet chatter is the thing these days.  The sophisticated orbiting satellites didn't do a thing to prevent or monitor that.    Mr. Keefe, a law student, uncovers the faults and limits of Echelon which is directed toward individuals deemed dangerous to the United States, but who determines the possible enemies to monitor?  We are now overrun by many nationalities.  They travel in groups by vans and are everywhere planning and accessing -- in the malls, in the movie theaters, even on the buses.  And they looks so much like us, most people ignore the danger as we were not warned that this could happen in America.    Now we know and need to be on guard, or we all may be blown off the face of the earth.  Then the aliens will take over and build a super race of beings.  It is up to us to stay calm but to keep our place here and rid the danger by being aware and informed.  This book is a great service to Americans if they will only heed the knowledge and exposure of this detriment to our well being.	2005-07-21

Jack Parsons caused controversy during the '30s and '40s because of his interest in magic and the occult, but he is best known for his work with rocket fuel after working in an explosions factory.  He was born in 1914 in Los Angeles, California and became an avid science fiction fan and knew some of the most famous writers of that genre.    He was a rocket scientist even without a college grad degree.  He had experimented with chemistry and developed solid fuel for jet planes and went on to invent a solid fuel for use in rockets and missles.  He was the co-founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab in California.    He was a devotee of magician Andrew Crowley and practiced black magic, after reading the writings of the controversial occult prince of darkness.  He became known as the anti-Christ before his death in 1952 after he was burned in a chemical explosion in his garage, which proved fatal.    I wouldn't call him an angel exactly, nor the Anti-Christ, as he and L. Ron Hubbard were involved in a sex case against each other over a shared lover.  It's a strange existence and, as Alice in Wonderland proved, gets stranger and stranger.  But, not much of the sordid details can be substantiated, so a lot of this book is circumstantial -- or no way to prove his sexual activites one way or the other.  His 'friends' have died, but there is a later book (March) about his scandalous life, written by John Carter, SEX & ROCKETS: THE OCCULT WORLD OF JACK PARSONS.    This book was released in January by the author who has written several books about the countries of Latin America.	2005-07-21

After spending the majority of my life in the shadow of Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Alabama, and attending plays in the von Braun Center for the Arts, I was glad to learn more about the man himself.  He was the first director of the Marshall Space Flight Center there.  I had never heard of his moniker, Dr. Space, but had read that he went on to Los Alamos to aid in perfecting the atom bomb.  He worked at the Fermi Institute in Chicago and taught them a thing or two, and in Massachusetts with other nuclear scientists.    I wasn't aware of his expertise with the V-2 missiles which damaged London during WWII but I know first hand that the program he launched at Redstone Arsenal worked divinely during the Persian Gulf War which we all witnessed on CNN, day and night.  I know someone who actually worked there to develop the anti-missile missiles used in that confrontation.  I house sat his dogs for a whole week on the outskirts of Huntsville one summer while my son Zach and his growing family accompanied them on a beach vacation in Florida.    Living only thirty miles from Huntsville, Alabama, I was always aware that it could be a target for terrorists and bombs, and the fallout would have eradicated our little Pulaski and its occupants.  Now, I'm back where I grew up, about the same distance from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the threat is about the same.  If they get bombed, we will get the fall out as well.  Just can't win either way, always in danger of being rubbed out by nuclear particles wherever I live.  The first eighteen years, I was not aware of the dangers as Oak Ridge was always dubbed the 'Secret City.'    It's true he's of German nationality, but he taught us how to live with what we had developed.  The main thing is to remember that it was the United States who dropped the first bomb.  Without him and his German colleagues, we'd still be backward and not the 'leader in Space.'      He has been an exemplary citizen (I wonder, did he cuss in German or American?) and it's time his memory was honored for the vast contributions he made to this country.  It is to his credit that we even have a Space Program.  We need to get it back 'on track.'  The photos are nice and add to the research compiled by B. Ward who worked as a reporter for the Huntsville, Alabama, 'News.'  He observed some of von Braun's worthy service to Huntsville as a citizen and as a leader in his science.  He was an amateur astronomer, which says a lot for such a giant icon in this country and perhaps in his own.	2005-07-20

Rudyard Kipling was the master of deception back in 1899 with books like KIM and other pieces of fiction.  There is a followup a century later with someone calling himself Neely.  First, he self-published a book of news columns purportedly by him but now he is giving credit to others as follows: #1 was Knoxville's Secret History by Jack Neely, Aaron Jay, and Lisa Horstman (Paperback - Nov 1, 1995), #2 was Secret History II: Stories About Knoxville, Tennessee by Jack Neely, Ed Richardson, and Lisa Horstman (Paperback - Nov 20, 1998).  Lisa Horstman must be the maiden name of Karen, but who is Ed Richardson.  That's a new one on me. <br /> <br />What was supposedly history of old happenings in this town he admits to me is pure fiction based on the book, Sutree.  Sordid and scandalous events which never happened except in his imagination.  He is no Kipling but \\"borrowed\\" Paul Theroux's Secret History book as the title of the tabloid columns since 1995.  He has created a sordid and scathing \\"past\\" which didn't happen.  He has been on a sex craze from times gone by also which didn't happen as he wrote.  He even promoted a fictional account of a prominent person who helped to write Harbrace Handbook for English.  He is merely the office boy and others do the writing for which he gets credit.  When he tries to talk to literary groups, he hems and haws and never says anything substantial.  He tricked me, as he has tricked the newcomers to this sordid town.  It is turning into a drug culture in the downtown area.  One of them (actually two counting the wife) are now in prison for marjuiana sales and the properties they managed to pull over the officials as legitimate.  People like them have ruined this town.  And they have used the services of one Neely who is a pretender.  Rudyard Kipling would turn over in his grave if he knew what this person has done to appear as someone from a century ago who existed only in Kipling's imagination.	2005-07-20

The Broadway theater was in a decline in the Thirties due to the Depression, and there were not big standouts, but many movie stars learned their trade during this decade on Broadway. His title, 'Sing For Your Supper' written by Rodgers and Hart came from a minor show, 'The Boys from Syracuse' which ran for 235 performances; the hit of the show was 'Falling in Love With Love.'  <br /> <br />Porky and Bess was the biggest thing to come out of musical theater during that time (1935), though no memorable songs -- it was a black musical. However, it was the first American-made show to be recorded during its original run (four days after the opening) by the nation's main classical-record label, Victor Red Seal by RCA Victor. This was not an original cast recording but used Metropolitan Opera singers for the album.  <br /> <br />In the photo section, there are two from this musical, five from 'Jubilee' and one from 'The Band Wagon.' Some of the stars of the Thirties Broadway musicals included Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Ethel Merman, Sophie Tucker, Jimmy Durante, and Gene Kelly as one of five 'chorus boys' in 'Leave It to Me.'  <br /> <br />In the musicals such big bands as Glenn Miller, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Gene Krupa were in the pit. Memorable songs to make a lasting impression were 'But Not For Me,' which came from Gershwin's score of 'Girl Crazy'; 'Will You Remember Me?' from 'Knickerbocker's Holiday' (Michael Feinstein has a marvelous version on one of his CDs); 'I Can Dream, Can't I?' and 'I'll Be Seeing You' from 'Right This Way' (1938); and 'It's De-Lovely' by Cole Porter in 'Red, Hot and Blue!'	2005-07-19

Written by an authority on the American musical, he has followed up with different decades on the Broadway stage. This rich decade of the Fifties now entered its most revolutionary phase of redefining itself and forging a new kind of musical storytelling.  <br /> <br />This great era contained a flurry of revivals in the early '50s and almost all of the top musicals were made into movies for those of us in smaller towns who could not go to New York City. In fact, the stars of the movies were more to our taste anyway.  <br /> <br />In 1951, PAINT YOUR WAGON and THE KING AND I had many lovely songs for us to sing in local talent shows or pantomime as need be. PAL JOEY was revived in 1952 from the 1940 version and went on to star Frank Sinatra in the movie, \\"Bewitched\\" was the best song. CAN CAN surfaced in 1953, as did Mary Martin in PETER PAN. OKLAHOMA! (some call the best musical of all -- had the most hits), based on 'Green Grow the Lilacs,' was on stage in 1955 as was DAMN YANKEES (from which the song '(You Gotta Have) Heart' came. In 1956, we discover Sammy Davis, Jr. as MR WONDERFUL, and Judy Holliday in BELLS ARE RINGING. MY FAIR LADY with Julie Andrews as Eliza made a big splash in 1956. WEST SIDE STORY was a big hit in 1957 with Carol Lawrence.  <br /> <br />In 1956, every radio station in America was playing the \\"My Fair Lady\\" record album. She later starred in the biggest musical of that time, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and starred in the movie as well. She was the original Queen Guivenere in CAMELOT on Broadway.  <br /> <br />GYPSY was Ethel Merman's biggest success. Television was loaded with musical revues full of star talent, for free. Eddie Fisher's COKE TIME, led the way and one of the songs he sang so well, 'Fanny,' came from the Broadway play of the same name which starred Ezio Pinza.  <br /> <br />Other wonderful musicals from that decade include KISMET with Howard Keel and Vic Damone, THE PAJAMA GAME with John Raitt, THE MUSIC MAN, GUYS & DOLLS, FLOWER DRUM SONG, CAROUSEL, SOUTH PACIFIC, BRIGADOON, AND SHOWBOAT (revised from the '20s). Some previously unknown singers made their debuts during the Fifties, Harry Belafonte, Ethel Waters, Eartha Kitt, among others.  <br /> <br />CARMEN JONES was 'Aida' in Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1860s and THE GOLDEN APPLE was resetting 'Iliad and Odyssey' in America in the early 1900s about the Trojan War, and Helen was played by Kaye Ballard.  <br /> <br />\\"The musical play's dramatic possibilities not only led them to major work but encouraged them to revise the science of craftsmanship as they went along.\\" Some talents in Broadway's history have been essentially musical play talents such as Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein, Agnes de Mille, and Hal Prince. Some have been musical comedy talents, like Lorenz Hart, George Abbott, Carol Channing, Harold Rome, Bob Merrill, and Gwen Verdon. Some moved freely between the two worlds, most specifically George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Jerome Robbins, and Alfred Drake. One was the essential musical comedy talent -- Bob Fosse.  <br /> <br />This was a glorious coming-of-age time for lots of us and the best of the musical world for the whole world.	2005-07-19

At that time, there was no America; and we Christians took our name after him and his teachings.<br /><br />In the Methodist church, one of the pastors was named Paul, and thus he based most of his sermons on Acts written by the apostle Saul who was changed to Paul after he converted to Christ's teachings and started his own.  But sometimes it is good to go back to the Old Testament (everyone loves Psalms, no matter what his belief): \\"Seek the Lord, and strength: seek his face evermore.\\"  Paul offers some reassuring words for the journey: \\"Be at peace among yourselves...always seek to do good to one another and to all...hold fast to what is good and abstain from every form of evil.  See that none of you repays evil for evil.\\"  When a person wrongs us, we carry on as best we can and show by example the way Christ would have.

There is an endless supply of this type of English bashing.  It is not fractured per se, only verbs could be that.

It makes the speaker sound ignorant to use too many of that word.  Yet, he claims that you can't use too many.  I beg to differ. <br /> <br />He is not an expert on English in spite of what that total may presume. Maybe he is educated though it does not show through puns, which is his specialty.  He has made it his life's dream to do put-downs on our English.  He still has a lot to learn. <br /> <br />This book is just a continuation of the first one, of which me made as many cast-offs as he could to generate more income.  Too much of anything can be bad, and this continuing series is not what it could be.  If he'd leave off the crude bathroom humor, sleaze, profanity, making fun of literature icons, and berating our wonderful language skills, it might be tolerable.  As is, it is for a certain small audience of unschooled people who want to be titilated and share the ugly stuff with like-minded people.  There are some of us who revere the use of English, grammatical correctness and vocabulary of which is lacking in these books.	2005-07-18

There was a movie about this premise in the past few months, called 'The Forgotten,' about a woman who remembers having two children but everyone (even her husband) tells her there were no children.  There were, of course, and it was some kind of memory experiment.  Since I saw only the previews, I am not sure how she found the children and how she knew that she was not going crazy. <br /> <br />This story about Abby is quite similar in the fact that nothing is the same after she 'goes home' and everything has been destroyed.  Why, was it a cover up of some kind.  She is a brave woman to go back to the place where she was held in bondage.  I would never dare.  I was held against my wishes six years ago and barely got away alive, but nothing was ever done to the perpetrater even though I gave them his name, the name of his mother, the location of his house where he kept me captive and how I had to run to the neighbors for help.  Any of that could be verified, and yet the local police did nothing. <br /> <br />Another strange happening a few months after that was when a man tried to lure me to his 'apartment' on Magnolia Avenue here in Knox. and I gave the police the code to get in the front door, his phone number, his name and the name of his grandmother where he was when he called me.  A 'friend' had given him my unlisted phone number.  So, I have experienced some of the plot in person and, if the chief of the detectives had not walked me through the whole night (except for a few instances I did not remember), I would have had to go for therapy. <br /> <br />Many novels are based on personal experiences, usually the debut but Ms. French has already written KILLING ME SOFTLY and BENEATH THE SKIN.

He must have been a difficult child, or abused in some way, to keep him from growing into maturity. <br /> <br />One day he decided to stop drinking, afraid he already was an alcoholic.

He makes a life-changing decision to catch the later train for awhile to become acquainted with the fascinating creature.  Wrong decision.    Drawn into a relationship he should have resisted, he discovers that she isn't the nice person he thought at first she might be.  He is led on a string like a dog on a leash, panting after what he can't have.  One of her associates blackmails him for two thousand, then demands more or he may kidnap the child.    It turns into a nightmare for him, as he delves into his daughter's healthcare fund in his effort to extract himself from the mess he has found himself in like a fly in a spider's web.  But his plan becomes 'derailed' when he hires a hit man who become the victim.  Now, he has to do coverups and use deception to get 'back on track.'  He doesn't want his wife to learn about the extramarital affair; his family life would be 'finis' and the child would be hurt more than she already is.    It's a journey into the wild part of Long Island and the streets of corruption.  He has to deal with bad cops and their 'girls on the street.'  He has to ditch the car the hit man had rented in a farm pond.  All over one missed train on his way to work and the black widow who entrapped him.

This well-researched and well-written book reminds us of the crises in healthcare and alerts some readers to the side effects of many prescription drugs.  The elderly patients are the biggest drug addicts in America.  They are overdosed with the wrong medicines, sometimes the blame of pharmacists.  At Walgreen's, they will substitute the cheaper medicine instead of that your doctor feels you need.  I refuse to take substituted drugs, as I value my life too much.  A child was given Methodone at a local CVS drugstore instead of Ritalin.<br /><br />In Knoxville, there are no \\"family doctors\\" unless you are rich.  Hospital tests are made only on the rich for the most part.  I have been refused tests I asked for because I was on TennCare.  Medical care in this town depends solely on the patient's income.  It is nonexistent for poor people especially those on TennCare which has made a radical change.  Instead of the fifteen per month pills I needed, I was given only 14, as that is all \\"your insurance\\" will pay.  What do they mean -- I have no insurance!<br /><br />The primary doctors think they are all 'specialists' and should charge accordingly.  My PCP won't get referrals I need as he admits he doesn't know the right words to use (and he is listed in Blue Care directory as being \\"Internal Medicine\\"); he told me all he knows how to do is the basic fundamentals of a checkup.  The doctors are not honest, as they won't see you when you need to be seen but much schedule you for four or five months so they can charge more to the government, then double what they are worth.<br /><br />The elderly (and soon the baby boomers will reach the age of 65) will be two-thirds of the population -- within the next ten years.  This will be a burden on healthcare and insurance costs, as they take so many different pills.  They will take anything and everything the doctor orders without question.  I know someone personally who spends over $500 a month out-of-pocket for the drugs which keephim alive.  Most of his income goes for enormous insurance payments and medicines.  Is this any way to live?<br /><br />Obesity has reach epidemic proportions for all age groups in this country.  I don't know why.  A lot of those are on government subsidized programs and cannot afford to eat in restaurants.  Some of the well-to-do eat well and it shows on their middle and hips.  What to do for these obese patients is a perplexing problem, and it won't be implemented anytime soon.  There are too many of them.  It is taxing on their hearts.	2005-07-14

Lyndon Johnson wasn't a very bright president.  He tried to change too many things for no real reason except to take the credit for doing so, and he took advantage to play old-time politics.  He almost ruined the country with his \\"domestic reforms\\" which caused devisiveness; as a consequence, we almost had another civil war all over again, only not on a battlefield.<br />He came close to instigating a race war.<br /><br />George Wallace was campaigning in Maryland and crippled after an attack to keep him out of the office of President.  He might have torn our country apart had he been elected, but he couldn't have caused more distress than LBJ and Nixon combined.  Nixon showed that he was a crook after fooling the whole country for a long time; nevertheless, he was forced to leave office in disgrace.  He was instrumental in a travesty of justice when Alger Hiss was put in jail for perjury.  Nixon became nationally recognized as a result, as Howard Baker of East Tennessee did with Watergate.<br /><br />Regarding the Viet Nam War, these presidents had made the life-and-death 'bet' that they could somehow commit the American people to a long war against a ferocious foe we never could understand nor cope with; the presidents lost, and both disappeared in disgrace.  As with the American Civil War, only the \\"ghosts survived.\\"  The Viet Nam War was the nation's longest war and prompted student activism on college campuses.<br /><br />The photos scattered throughout helped alleviate boredom.  For those of us who lived through that time, it is just a reminder -- not a discovery.  This is one of a series by Cornell University professors.  It is the third volume published so far.  LaFeber has written a book about the Cold War and the new global capitalism from a different perspective.	2005-07-14

I remember the Rexall stores in the late Fifties, not here in Knoxville, but doted around in the small towns of Middle Tennessee.  Louis Liggett started the company in Boston in 1903 and they compounded drugs back then, as aspirin was almost the only thing available in pill form.  When I was in my young teen years, the only thing I could swallow was Carter's Little Liver Pills.  I still can't get the generic Calcium down!    The Rexall products were all high quality and inexpensive.  Then the drug manufacturing companies came along and, after 75 years, put them out of business.  That's why prescription medicines are so expensive today, and why we have to depend on them.  The generics are worthless as far as I'm concerned as they are not regulated and not the same as brand names -- no way!  If they were, they would cost more.  Everyone knows you get what you pay for.    On radio in 1937 there was a Rexall Magic Hour.  In 1949, they presented the 'Phil Harris/Alice Faye Show.'  It included a full cast with two young girl singers and ten men doing sundry things in addition to the two stars.  Something like Garrison Keilor's 'Prairie Home Companion' show.    In early television, NBC sponsored the half-hour program, 'The Rexall Theatre' on Sunday nights during the summer months which starred Pat O'Brian as your corner drug store pharmacist.  The had a 'talking penny' in some of their ads.  Comedian Louis Nye advertised their products on t.v. with the motto: \\"All for One and One for All.\\"  Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, appeared on the cover of 'The Rexall Magazine.'    The streamlined Rexall Train criscrossed the United States from Boston to L.A. and served most states (exceptions were Nevada and West Virginia) but skipped Knoxville for a route going from Chattanooga to Nashville to Memphis.  We had the Southern and L&N railways for this area; the ticket shown was similar to mine every summer to Washington, D.C. on Southern Railway.  We still have an active freight railroad in Knoxville, locally owned and making noise day and night.  Sometimes, it wake me up as I sleep with my window open as I did in the old days.  It works out of the old L&N terminal renovated for the 1982 World's Fair.    In place of Rexall, we now have Walgreen's; the thing I dislike the most about this firm is the problem of \\"substituting\\" for the medicines your doctor prescribes -- not generic, but something totally different with unnecessary ingredients added.  This could cause harm to a person's health.  There are a handful of small locally owned drug stores, Long's in west side of town being the most popular.  In Pulaski, Reeves's on the Square will still sell a nickel coke.  Gregory Macdonald wrote about it in one of his books, A WORLD TOO WIDE.   Check it out.	2005-07-13

When I read this, Sam is reeling from a divorce after twelve years of marriage and has an eleven-yr-old son to provide for.  Open House is a love story about what can blossom between a man and a woman, and within a woman herself.  She endures the loneliness of being without a man, then takes in boarders -- none of whom fit exactly.  So, as happens, she finds another man only he demands too much.<br /><br />Sam has a mother who wants her married again, instead of helping raise the boy.  It is the classic picture of being left in the lurch on your own, only this time you have baggage you can't discard.  Divorce is never pretty, but the feeling of love the second time around is worth it and more!	2005-07-13

He'd had a vision of a snowflake which prompted the poem (\\"the large snowflakes floating so elegantly through the air\\") and, in turn, unlocked the meaning of his life.    Several years ago, I read another book simply entitled SNOW written by a young female playwright and wrote to tell her I had bought her book.  I can't remember now exactly what it was, but my niece had been in her play of the same name and she had fond memories of working with her off-Broadway; she wrote that she was happy I had enjoyed her work of art.    Ka had spent some years of lonely political exile in Western Europe but discovered that his 'first love' was now divorced and he seeks her out in a far-off town near Russia.  In the snowstorm, he comes to terms with his youth, his cultured, middle-class life, and the death of his mother in Istabul.    Looking for love, he creates poem after poem in flashes of inspiration, as he searches for his elusive idol.  Finding her is his last chance for happiness, but he must wait until  the snow has melted.  We all need love, but not necessarily from the person we first loved.  He/she was there for a purpose at the time and got us through a crisis and thus we fell in love.  That is the past, and we cannot relive the past.  A different kind of love will surface, a more mature love which will be twice as good.    Previously, Mr. Pamuk wrote THE NEW LIFE, THE BLACK BOOK and THE WHITE CASTLE.	2005-07-12

This biography is about the author of the 1948 CYBERNETICS.  He was called \\"the father of the information age\\" and yet these authors call him the \\"dark hero who has fallen through the cracks.\\"  Norbert Wiener, born in 1895, was a child prodigy who entered college in 1906 and earned his PhD from Harvard seven years later (it took my smart son ten years to get his from University of Chicago!)  In 1919 he became a teacher at MIT in Cambridge, Massachuettes but, after two years he left for Cambridge, England, on a graduate fellowship.<br /><br />At Trinity College, he studied under Bertrand Russell.  Because of his heredity and structured upbringing by strict parents, he became manic-depressive and led a life full of eccentricity and social activism.  That caused the FBI to investigate him during the Cold War.<br /><br />He invented \\"feedback\\" -- human communication in a technical world.  He was a visionary in electronic and biological technologies.  In the Twenties, he worked on a new design for the first modern computer.  He died in 1964 at the age of 69.<br /><br />His grandson, Michael Weiner is carrying on his \\"doomsaying\\" on Talk Radio using an assumed name.  Just as the Rosenberg boys had to grow up using false last names.  I don't use my maiden name any longer; sometimes, it is best to just be a separate entity from your ancestors and stand on your own two feet.  But not to the extent of forsaking the laurels of a forgotten grandfather whose genius turned out to be mental illness.<br /><br />The writer-duo have previously written SNAPPING (America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change) and HOLY TERROR.	2005-07-12

This is a \\"rewrite\\" of his first book, PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, published in 1998.  He is the founder of QBQ Inc. in Denver.  In 1995, he began speaking about this concept in workshops.    People change, one at a time, through his/her own choices.  Personal accountability (which he uses incessantly throughout this little book) is the power of one.  It changes the world one choice at a time.  Stress is sometimes the result of our choices.    Communication is not just being understood but also understanding the other person.  You need to discipline your thoughts and make better choices (another word he uses a lot!).  When we are faced with frustration or a challenge, our first reaction is usually negative and defensive.  Only through action is anything accomplished.  Action requires courage and leads toward solutions.  It builds confidence and brings learning and growth at all ages.    Humility is the cornerstone of leadership.  \\"Wisdom is what we learn after we know it all.\\"  By the type of questions we ask others and ourselves, the world may become a far better place, without blame and negativity.    I'm sure John Miller is a great workshop leader, like the one one from Chicago who taught me the difference between agression and submission at a PTA training session when I was still young (I have never been one for submission!), but this book is so simple.  He is a graduate of Cornell University while my Alma Mater is Martin Methodist College in Middle Tennessee.  What a vast difference, but I doubt his major was English.  Mine wasn't either -- liberal arts.  And it is getting a workout par excellence.	2005-07-12

This unique history of a unique war 'necessity'  includes photos and remembrances of a war correspondent, Barrett McGurn, who covered the Western Pacific for fourteen months in 1943-44, and his associates as they put together YANK for the soldiers out on the field.<br /><br />This was written for the combatants in all the different services in the War.  It was free to the troops in combat and considered an official War Department publication.  The five-cent price for all others was a token rate because 'the theory was that no one would read what he received for free.'  Many things were censored, but it is the record of the enlisted men as they recorded the true happenings in their own way in a week-by-week diary.  Some wrote poems to express their despair and loneliness away from their families 'back home.'<br /><br />It went on sale for the first time June 17, 1942 and was dreamed up by Colonel White.  Designed by President FDR and Secretary of War Stimson as a way to let the military at the lowest levels 'blow off steam' and also read what others were thinking, the circulation exceeded 2.5 million in forty-one countries and the readership topped four million.<br /><br />George Baker created the \\"Sad Sack\\" cartoon which made him popular after the war ended.  Mr. McGurn, at the age of 25, in 1939 had gone abroad as a foreign correspondent for the 'Tribune.'  He had started out as a cub reporter in the late '30s on the 'New York Herald Tribune.'  He wrote \\"The United Nations was about to be founded in San Francisco.  It would put an end to wars!\\"  Don't we wish?!<br /><br />After Joe McCarthy (no relation to the senator from Wisconsin) took over as editor of YANK, the paper included a weekly pinup of women \\"to boost morale.\\"  Betty Grable was by far the most popular.  Others included Dinah Shore, Jane Russell, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow, Gypsy Rose Lee, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ingrid Bergman (shown in the book on the cover as a farm girl).<br /><br />There were 150 editions total during the War.  The last cover showed a copy of an Army 'Honorable Discharge' certificate \\"as a testimonial of honest and faithful service to this country\\" signed by Dwight W. Eisenhower.  This was a one of a kind publication, never to be repeated.

This is the time of 'running with the bulls' through the streets of Pamplona, Spain.  This year there were only two bulls but they went separate ways after cornered and gored many of the young men in their yearly ritual to prove they have reached manhood.    Ernest Hemingway did not try to run with the bulls as he was too old to prove a point and an American writer, not ever an athlete, but he did write about it in 'The Sun Also Rises,' which was translated into a movie starring Ava Gardner.  He had gone to Spain in the Twenties so he was quite old when the Irish reporter, Valerie Smith, went first to Madrid (staying with Joe & Nancy Basque) and then on to Pamploma where she met for an interview with Mr. Hemingway and stayed on as his personal secretary.  Joe was production manager on the film, 'Solomon and Sheba,' starring Yul Brunner (after Tyrone Power's fatal heart attack).    She didn't look so young in the black and white photos, but the cover shows an older Ernest with a 30ish dark haired woman and that on the inside back shows a woman my age.  I came of age in the late 50s, so possibly she is even older.  He was married to Mary when they met, but she stayed on with Mary after he comitted suicide.      It was at his funeral she met Gregory and they married three years later.  Their marriage lasted as long as mine (21 yrs.) before it came apart.  She nows lives in Montana.  Needless to say, she is trying to profit from the images and name of Hemingway.  She should have written this memoir long ago if she wanted to honor the great man.    But, after all, it is the time for RUNNING WITH THE BULLS in Spain.  That's a grand and glorious time for everyone except the bulls destined to be killed in the bullfights.	2005-07-11

During the Rebellion, Flora MacDonald rose to fame after leading Bonnie Prince Charlie, son of James Stuart, through the Highlands of the Hebrides at the age of 24 in 1746, and slipped past the Hanoverians in a costume dressed as an Irish girl named Betty Burke, as Flora's maid.  To Ms. Vining, she was \\"the Highland lass who helped the prince to escape as he was being hunted through the island with a price of thirty thousand pounds on his head.\\"    She was tending cows when the prince and two traveling companions came across her hovel and persuaded her to help him back to Scotland.   She received the necessary passes for herself, a manservant, and a woman, Betty Burke.  There were several different versions of all of the events of that time.  She was captured but, 44 years later, wrote her own account of those venturesome days and how it impacted her life.    Her grandfather was Rev. Angus MacDonald of South Uist of the Hebrides.  At the time of her birth in 1722, Europe was temporarily at peace.  She had no formal education, but she had learned to speak well without a Scottish accent.    It's sad to compare the photos of the young Charles Edward Stuart with the old one.  Gravity does indeed bring us all down, and that's bad as the 'glory of youth' leaves all of us if we live long enough.  The worst part is the nose.  How I wished I could follow Dr. Rist's off-hand remark that I should go to a plastic surgeon, not for the nose so much as for the damage his office has done to my forehead above the nose.  He even had the audacity to tell me that the liquid nitrogen which did the damage could get rid of wrinkles; maybe so, but a scar would take their place.  So, which is better.    I'm glad I found FLORA A Biography in an unexpected place and, especially glad to be named after the Bonnie Prince's 'adopted' name, even though it was for only five days and 'she' was supposed to be a maid.  Oh well, my first son's middle name is Stuart.  So the circle comes round.    Florareturned to Scotland in April, 1748, and on November 6, 1750, married Allan MacDonald and lived in a cottage below the Ross Mountains in Scotland.  She had seven children from this marriage, Charles, Anne, Ranald, John, Alexander, James and Fanny.  In 1774, she and her husband sailed on the 'Bristol' and arrived in Brunswick in Eastern North Carolina (America)  in August with their two youngest sons and eight servants.  Later, they moved to a plantation in Anson County, near the border with South Carolina.    During the American Revolution, Allan was one of the commanders on the British side at the historic battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, fought four months before our Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776.    She died on March 4, 1790 (famous and much loved by her countrymen).  The 'Scots Magazine' described her as the \\"young lady who aided the escape of the young Chevalier\\" in the death notice.  She was buried in Kilmiur.  Allan died two and a half years later on September 20, 1792.    On her gravestone was engraved these words: \\"Her name will be mentioned in history and, if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honors.\\"  She was an unknown hero at home and in America, though something of a rebel at heart.	2005-07-10

NASA has a plan to send an unmarked craft (a possible robotic probe) to the Centari triple-star system.  Because of the distance and inability to transmit back and forth messages, if the craft reaches its destination, which will take 40 years, the 4 yr. wait between messages is a long time to wait.  Yet, those working on this project are optimistic about the importance and eventual success of their work.  So far, it is only in the imagining and planning stages.    You can see these stars in the morning sky at the autumn equinox.  Centuri A comes the closest to appearing like our sun, more than three times brighter than B, which is loosely connected to A.  Alpha Centuri C (Proxima) is a small red dwarf which has periodic flares; it could very easily be just a passing star, not bound to the other two.    Astronomers have yet to make a valid claim that it is 'triple.'  Recent studies show that Prosima is younger and independent -- a star just passing near A & B.  The installation of a new device in March, 2002, called ACS (Advanced Camera for Surveys) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope can perhaps show whether Alpha Centuri has planets.      What we are searching for is to find another Earth-like planet 'somewhere out there' in space.  Will we ever stop wondering \\"Is anyone intelligent (besides ET) out there for us to communicate with?\\"  If so, they will be so far ahead of us intellectually that they won't be able to understand us, and vice versa.  A new James E. Webb Space Telescope will be launched in 2011 to replace the Hubble which wasn't exactly what they had expected it to be even after the correction of the lens.	2005-07-10

This memoir (loosely-termed as such) is an account of an adventure in 2000 when these two young actors left Manhattan in a rented car to travel across the United States on a quest.  They drove from Chicago to Florida and stopped at places in between, from Oregon to L. A. to interview some of those exonerated of murder charges.    Jessica had been in a movie for Court TV called 'The Exonerated' about prisoners falsely accused and who spent time on death row in prisons.  It is the result of her friend, Erik Jensen from Minnessota,who agreed to make the trip and they nose dived into the darker side of our justice (or injustice) system and were told stories of gross conditions which were repulsive and overwhelming to the victims, before they could win their freedom after such a long interval between being accussed and released.    \\"The desire for revenge is powerful\\" on all levels.  I've been against the death penalty for many years now because of the innocent \\"criminals\\" who are due to die for some crime someone else perpetrated.  They discovered that 74% of Americans support capital punishment.  If it doesn't happen here in East Tennessee, some decide to take matters in their own hands.    This book entails the creation of the play they wrote using actual cases they uncovered.  It is 'a fascinating chronicle of political consciousness.'  Instead of dwelling on statistics and legalese, they put a human face on stage so every person in the audience could can and understand what was at stake.   This is the story of real people who had lost so much; they used the interviews they did with those abused by the inequities of the system to make a social comment in the form of a play.  It took them three years to work through and it changed them forever.  They called it a \\"crazy journey\\" but in the end discovered a common bonding.  Involved in off-Broadway theater, they were drawn together by a chance meeting in a bar.    It is foolish to think that the system (any government service) functions in reality the way it does on paper.  It is the propoganda and self praise on forms which win the awards, not what happens in real life.  They discovered what I've known now for a long time (from personal experience) that mayors, lawyers, judges and the police are all human and make mistakes, act carelessly, and think of 'self' first and foremost.      It's not enough to pray that the leaders will do what's right and fair to all; we have to take action and speak up, ask questions and seek the truth. Relationships now prove to be more trouble than usual, but don't let this prevent you from staying emotionally present. Even if you are somewhat uncomfortable with holding your ground today, remember that this is truly one of your strengths. The source of your uneasiness may be guilt that is stirred up, whether or not it applies to the current situation. Speak the truth gently and be open to the possibility of positive transformation.      Mainly the leaders in whatever capacity should act ethically.  Freedom isn't something which occurs simply because our leaders promise it; they will promise the sky if you foolishly believe them.  Politicians never keep promises, but some younger ones will listen.  Reach out to them.	2005-07-09

By 1954, when McCarthy was censored by the Senate, many government officials, authors, artists, film makers, even teachers, had been damaged and, in some cases, their reputations were destroyed.

This was her first novel, and I am partial to debuts as usually they include personal happenings.  However, India Edghill has decided to write fiction about Biblical characters, which seems a little sacreligious. We've all heard tell of David and Bethseba, but are you familiar with Jonathan and Michal? <br /> <br />David and Jonathan were great friends when they were twenty, and Michal only fourteen.  She'd be allowed to listen in on their conversations and David would sing to her.  She fell deeply in love with him, but like so many Kings and such, he seemed to prefer the males of the species.  Of course, he used women as is their practice in that unholy land. <br /> <br />Michal was the daughter of a King, Saul, who bargained for her status as a married woman; the bride price was quite unusual.  That husband died, and when David was thirty (ten years later), he made Michal his Queen.  She had lost her desire for him and his flamboyant ways, so when Bathsheba entered into the concubines, she encouraged  her to bear David's son, Solomon. <br /> <br />The Biblical names are so similar and unusual in spellings that I won't get into the other characters.  Michal took an interest in the women he used and let Bathsheba act in her stead.  Ms. Edghill lives in upstate New York and has written about Solomon and Sheba.  Maybe it will be a geneological study from David's progeny as a series.  I just can't get into a made up story about Biblical icons.	2005-07-09

He has  had a grand and glorious acting career, as the beautiful photo section proves.  His five page repertoire proves his value to the acting profession.  He appeared in plays from 1945 to 2000, and the cinema from 1956 to 2004.  This was a most interesting remembrance of his life then and now with many ancedotes.    Whoever knew that the American Civil War was shown in the movie,THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY -- land in France (near the Spanish border) looked like Virginia and served as the location to stage an American war.  The Italian western director used Mathew Brady's book of Civil War photos to reproduce the blue and gray uniforms for the soldiers which were supplied by Generalissimo Franco's Spanish soldiers.  An Italian (non-actor) who had lost an arm in World War II was used as a one-armed soldier in the Civil War sequence.  Dressed in his uniform, he showed anger toward all Americans because of the loss of his arm.  When the film was finished, curse words had been dubbed in for the angry Italian.    Actors could speak their native language -- Greek, Spanish, French, German -- which would be dubbed into Italian or English.  A newly-released amination fantasy/allegory used both Japanese with subtitles and voiceovers in English.    The crew of THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY spent months on location in Spain.  Since it was an Italian film, the American actors did not receive residuals unless it was included in their contract.  In America, the actors receive payments when the film is shown on television.  What a difference fifty years makes!    To have been brought up in Brooklyn, he appeared in several of Tennessee Williams plays: THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED, THE ROSE TATOO, THE CARMINA REAL, BABY DOLL and THE GLASS MENAGERIE; he used the one-act play \\"Hello from Bertha\\" in acting school with co-star Maureen Stapleton.  He played a character called Tennessee Fredericks in the movie, A WAY TO DIE.    He did attend the University of Texas in 1935, so I guess he talked more Southwest than Southern.  He was cast in THE MISFITS with Montgomery Clift, Clark Gable, and Marilyn Monroe in 1960.  He made a lot of movies, but most were made for t.v.    I don't know anyone who has had a more illustrious career in either theater or films.  I think it's time he had a good retirement and rest on his laurels.	2005-07-08

This memoir by an established author is revealing in her coming-of-age years, growing up, as she did, in Washington, D. C.  She could have been here in hillbilly country for all the non-sophistication she and her sister had in their formative years.      \\"From 1801, when John and Abigal Adams moved into the half-finished White House, until the mid-1950s, when air conditioners started appearing in homes, not just movie theaters, (movies were called \\"the oases of air conditioning\\" back then), summers in D. C. were sweltering and generally miserable because of the humidity.  From 1951-57 (only six years but it felt like a lifetime), I spent my summers in the suburbs of Maryland, not far from D. C. and, to a little girl from Tennessee, it was a grand adventure to ride the train back and forth (an overnight trip) no matter how hot it felt.    She relates how Camp Shangri-La in Maryland was changed to Camp David by then-President Eisenhower (who was not very literate).  Life during McCarthy's \\"great witch hunt\\" of the '50s was scary there but not as bad as out in Hollywood.  Her grandmother was a history and civics teacher who refused to take the loyalty oath to continue teaching and quit when she reached the age to retire.    If this is a \\"childhood as it used to be,\\" I'm glad I was spared the sexual molesting and fear of being called a Communist she found normal and everyday occurrences.  She tells it the way she experienced it, \\"not necessarily the way it was in rurals areas.\\"  Perhaps it was worse, but we in the Bible Belt had our churches for guidance.  My sister, Evelyn, who was a young lady when I was still a child (eleven years difference in age) endured some of the shame Ms. Holland thought was normal.  And now I understand why Aunt Gertie had so many children!  Back then, that is all women were good for, according to this writer.    Her cover photo with that cigarette reminded me of the girls in the YWCA in 1958, but no doubt that was her photo taken ten years earlier.  Her mother illustrated children's books when she was young.  She wrote fourteen previously published books including WHY LIFE ISN'T AS GOOD AS IT USED TO BE, ENDANGERED PLEASURES, REFLECTIONS ON LIVING ALONE, IN PRIVATE LIFE and SECRETS OF THE CAT.	2005-07-08

Dan George was educated in a Catholic school and was not allowed to speak his native language.  He spent many years at hard labor as a longshoreman before he formed \\"Dan George and His Indian Entertainers\\" which played one-night stands at hundreds of locations.  He appeared in television shows in the '60s and was cast to be a Chief in LITTLE BIG MAN which starred Dustin Hoffman.      He went on to make other movies, 'Alien Thunder,' 'Shadow of the Hawk,' 'The Bears and I,' 'The Esctasy of Rita Joe,' and 'The Education of Phisistine,' among others.   There are two photo sections in this book by his friend Hilda Mortimer, including one of him and eldest son, Bob, with his mother.  One shows his grandson, Lennie, with his white wife Susan, and another has Dan George with his youngest grandson, Rueben.    On the border of Tennessee/North Carolina, the Cherokees lived until a tragic event happened when Andrew Johnson, a Tennessean, was President.  It was called The Trail of Tears, as our natives were forced to move to Oklahoma to provide their holdings to political friends of  the government for homesteading.    The Trail of Tears is an ugly part of our history - the U.S. government forced the removal of more than 15,000 Cherokees in 1838-1839 to designated Indian territory that became Oklahoma. Thousands died along the way. About 1,000 Cherokee hid in the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina during the roundup, and their descendants, headquartered around Cherokee, N.C., have formed the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation.      \\"We celebrate our history, good and bad, as a motivation to seek a better way of life,\\" and \\"The value of the Trail of Tears is to teach and remind us of the lessons of history that will prevent such travesty of justice, sham of public policy, disdain for human dignity and political integrity as was inflicted upon the Cherokee during the forced removal\\"  were comments made by the ruling leaders of the East and West groups.     Congress votedin 1987 to designate what was then known as the Trail of Tears as a national historic trail of the National Park Service. The trail extends through Tennessee and six other states.  Research since then has documented additional trail routes and holding stations. The information has come from military journals, diaries of witnesses, payment vouchers, newspaper accounts from the time, oral history and period maps. The House bill would add North Carolina and Georgia and extra routes in other states to the national trail, more than doubling the original designation of the trail.     The bill requires the Interior Department to study documentation within one fiscal year and add additional areas to the trail that are feasible and suitable.  \\"The Trail of Tears is a tragic story but it is very much an integral part of American history. We need to document it better make it a much more significant part of American history and therefore allow our citizens to learn the lessons to never repeat the injustices that took place.\\"     While injustice is the major part of the Trail of Tears, there also are stories of human courage and dignity displayed by those being transported across the trail that have come to light through further study and will continue to emerge with even more attention. Unfortunately, injustice is part of America's history.(N-S)    The Trail of Tears is as much a part of Tennessee's history as it is a part of the history of the Cherokee Indian Nation. The government is proposing to add to the 2,000 miles of the national historic areas of the trail.      He contributed greatly to the Indian heritage by his entertainment value and showed us the good side of his people.  Most of us grew up watching cowboy and Indian movies, and he and Tonto were the best to emulate.	2005-07-07

Judith Warner, who wrote a book about Hillary Clinton called THE INSIDE STORY, about her work with the former First Lady on child care in this country.  She cescribes the job of motherhood today as a perfect madness.  Perfect, it's not; madness, maybe.  But is was brought on by the changing culture.  I was just as busy doing all I could for my three sons, getting them to music classes, sports, band practice, football, soccer, Boy Scouts and church choir practice -- and still doing all of the housekeeping plus PTA, literary club, Church Women United, and later temp computer jobs. <br /> <br />The life hasn't really changed all that much.  But, mothers on the other hand have.  I know two mothers in their forties, one a stay-at-home, the other working at her choice of outside job.  Each has one child and doesn't do a fraction of the chores and maternal duties expected of me.  I did have some extra jobs outside the home at times. <br /> <br />The mothers of today are spoiled brats, not really grown up.  They expect their husbands (both have career partners with good and high positions) to do most of the child-rearing, especially during the early years.  Both men have to cook meals on a regular basis, man the dishwasher, do the laundry and grocery shopping, and carry on their outside fulltime jobs.  Even then, the wives claim they're exhausted, too tired for sex, and suffer migraines and PMS.  Why, oh why, didn't I have a husband like that?! <br /> <br />We ask that we be granted what we requested and live with a perception, a fear that something else bad will happen.  We've gone throught the procedures with all due candor and acceptaance.  \\"Life doesn't have to be this way.  It's time to take a step-back and figure out how to make things better.\\" <br /> <br />Everyone in a family are busy with his/her own activities that it is hard sometimes to be present for a sit-down meal or a play in a small theater.  We have no problem with that as the is always the viceo camera tocapture important events. <br /> <br />Guilt has always been dominant in this situation.  All-or-nothing situations were bound to be disasters; we've gone through the proper scheme of things and still find something lacking.  We want the life classified as \\"status quo\\" -- we want to make the community proud. <br /> <br />We often feel that if we don't do everything right for our children, we are due to suffer failure as a good mother.  What we are proposing to do is become a super-Mom and end up punishing the hard-working husbands.  We have no problem with that as long as we have Ambien and Valium for ourselves and Ritalin for the manic children.  Poor dad, all he can do to cope with so much stress is to drink and contemplate what was address at the wedding: \\"through good times and bad,\\" ever skeptical about the rules of manhood and motherhood.  Sometimes, these days, they are one and the same.	2005-07-06

Stage 1 really begins with the birthdate of your first child, not pregnancy as she suggests (as some don't make it to term) on through the colic stage when you lose a lot of sleep, nurturing and caring for a lovely baby. <br /> <br />#2 emcompasses the rest of that first year as you find yourself and your purpose inn life.  God put Adam and Eve together to procreate; and you've reached that important time of feeling like a mom for the first time. <br /> <br />#3 (Toddler Year) and #4 go together as you watch your child grow and learn anything and everything through you.  You're not really letting go or trying to do it all -- yet, that comes later.  You're merely overwhelmed at the enormity of this mission and how very much your own child means to a fulfillment you've never known before. <br /> <br />#5 -- The child's 3-6 yrs. period, when they really blossom into a person who will love you until the end of time or hate you for not being there for them when they needed you.  This is an extremely pivotal time. <br /> <br />#6, she calls the \\"gray zone\\" -- the pre-teen years can be rewarding and glorious as they can be \\"your\\" protector and friend and show their pride in having such a wonderful mother. <br /> <br />#7 is the most critical.  Ages 13-18 yrs. are the worst for mom and child as they are seeking their freedom at whatever costs it takes them.   These are the rebillious years, and I thought I would not live through my last son's teen years.  It was a difficult time.  They get attached to the wrong people and experiment with drugs, alcohol consumption, and sex.  The girls of this age dress (or half-dress) in what we called underwear (camisoles, even a grandmother's black silk slip) as outerwear, showing lots of skin.  Becoming a single mom now is not looked down on as in the Fifties and before the hippies invaded America.  After all, they'll receive a government check of their very own. <br /> <br />Then, if you're lucky, there's another stage (my #8) when theyflee the coop and try out their wings.  The ideal would be college but some choose the homeless lifestyle -- free food and lodging, free clothes and transportation, and sex (not love) with multiple partners.  Some are creating what some pets used to be called, mongrels. <br /> <br />They grow up amd away much too fast.  The loving child becomes the unloving adult child.  \\"Raising children may be the most gratifying experience available to women, but it's also the most challenging; believing that you can somehow avoid the anxiety, anger, and guilt only promises more of the same.\\"   Mothers' attributes include \\"determination, commitment, strength, energy, empathy, humor, kindness, wisdom, courage and sensitivity toward others.\\" <br /> <br />A good mother learns how to balance work and family, nurture your marriage, get a grip on anxiety, set limits, show intense feelings of love and anger, and when to let go.  That is the hardest part of all, as nothing will ever be the same again.	2005-07-06

This book was a personal spiritual journey in which a theory of \\"goodness\\" is incarnated into the grace of experience.  The journey of \\"self\\" involves the journey of the human side as well, becoming decent human beings who treat strangers in their midst as they would like to be treated.  We have many homeless here and, last week, I became verbal in a bus because the driver made one of them run a block to the sign showing where the bus stop officially is; he could not deviate one inch.  When I let him know how unfair that was, he yelled and hollered at me.  He could have just one on and not waited at all.  I've observed that tendency in some of the local drivers, especially if she does not like that person.  I had barely missed a bus I need on Main Street and the supervisor told me to go and get a cup of coffee and a doughnut.  He would not ask that driver to wait for me, even though the bus was stopped at a red light halfway way down the block.<br /><br />Caring for others and going that extra mile could have a connection to our physical health.  It is imperative to respond to others' vulnerabilities to address our own.  Exercising empathy and compassion makes our body and spirit soar.  Positive emotions cause greater activity in the brain and increase the antibodies which fight disease.<br /><br />Gifts of self-esteem, choice, spirit, wisdom, and of the heart are discussed using letters off her web site from the 1200 received.  Everybody wants to tell his story.  Intuition influences every choice you make in life.  Being kind to others is a fundamental \\"choice\\" as you receive invisible power.  One of the most empowering benefits is to believe in someone when he lacks the faith to believe in himself.  Pray for Jacki, a critic.<br /><br />The power of love, kind words, kind thoughts and a search for the truth are explained as is the fact that life is full of miracles. You possess a very particular type of honesty that's so straightforward and full of integrity it can often be intimidating. Don't ever let anyone tell you it's not the right way to be -- especially now. Situations today call for someone with the courage to push the envelope past the point of politeness -- to boldly say what no one else has the courage to say.

Oxymoronica is described as a paradox, contradictions in ideas.  This book celebrates the power and beauty of paradoxical thinking.  He has something brilliant from the minds of the deepest thinkers to those not so seriously-minded, like Carrie Fisher to Goethe.  The book has an index, so you can look up your favorite whatever and see what 'put down' or observation he/she has to say about someone else, or perhaps even their own life at present.    Oscar Wilde said:  \\"George Moore wrote brilliant English until he discovreed grammar.\\"  George Moore wrote:  \\"There is always a right and a wrong way, and the wrong way always seems the most reasonable.\\"    Robert Browning's famous \\"Less is more,\\" says in the least amount of words what Walt Disney said, \\"It's kind of fun to do the impossible.\\"  Horace Greely lamented, \\"Journalism will kill you, but it will keep you alive while you're at it.\\"    Margaret Mead remarked, \\"Always remember that you are absolutely unique.  Just like everyone else.\\"  James Thurber asks the question, \\"Why do you have to be a nonconformist like everybody else?\\"    Joseph Addison wrote, \\"Our real blessings often appear to us in the shape of pains, losses, and disappointments.\\"  William Blake wrote, \\"It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend.\\"    An 'oxymoron' is a rhetorical figure of speech by which contradictory terms cause it to appear absurd, but involving a point.  The word appeared in English for the first time in 1640.    I will close with someone we all know: Charles Kuralt who wrote in his 1985 book, \\"Thanks to the interstate system, it is now possible to travel the country from coast to coast without seeing anything.\\"  That's not exactly true.  At least, you can say you've been in all of those states.  That's good for something.      This silly trivia was interesting to a word person, and is entertaining.  You will find some good and not so good quotes from some of your favorite people.  It's fun to use the index to find someone you like or dislike.  Either way, it is a game.	2005-07-05

George Washington's friend, Betsy Ross of Philadelphia, sewed the first flag for N. America on June 4, 1777, which was made out of bulldog cotton.  The colors:  white for purity, red for hardiness and valor, and blue for vigilance, perserverance, and justice.  The stars represent the states and it varied as the nation was developed.    \\"Just as Thanksgiving is for families, Presidents' Day and the day after Christmas are for shoppers, Valentine's Day for sweethearts, the Fourth of July is for crowds.\\"  It is for picnics with family and friends, or a concert of patriotic music, and, of course, fireworks.  For some, it is a time to travel far to see a family ignored the rest of the year.    In a \\"patriot conspiracy\\" during the summer of '42, Old Glory (with its 48 stars) was on the cover of many magazines to rally support for World War II.  In 2002, flags (now with 50 stars) serve the same purpose they did sixty years ago.    This photo book is mostly concerning the events of 9-11-2001 and how it affected our country.  Many of the pictures are sad as that was a traumatic day for the whole United States of America.  Four years later, we are still fearful it will happen again, only on a larger scale.  I really think it is time to move on.  The healing process should have taken place by now.  There is nothing we can do to make things different.  It happened -- we need to get over it.  Dwelling on something that horrendous only makes life less than good.  Let us remember the founding fathers and the wonderful flag which represents this country of ours on this Independence Day, 2005.	2005-07-04

S. was on the open road.  In Rhode Island, in September 1896, eight four-wheelers lined up at a horse-racing over for what would be the world's first track race.    In the first decade of the 20th century, in 1903 in Florida they started thirty-two years of land-speed trials on the hard-paked sand of Ormond Beach.  Racing swept the country.  It started on April 24, 1908, in New York as a Stock Car Race, the first on average town and country roads.  On March 13, 1910, Los Angeles had its own race at Ascot Park, the last (100-mile) dirt-track race staged there.      In the early days of racing, cars were almost exclusively playthings for the wealthy.  The Indy races started on a smaller scale on June 20, 1902 at the State Fairgrounds.  In 1909, the races there were still short, but they decided to build a Speedway of 500 miles which was finished in 1911.  We now have a NASCAR racetrack at Bristol, Tennessee.    In the 1955 movie, 'Rebel Without A Cause,' the photo shows a young Natalie Wood giving her \\"good luck\\" shake to James Dean as he starts a drag race.  Mickey Rooney starred in a racester movie called 'The Big Wheel' in 1949.  Of course, everyone knows 'Thunder Road' filmed on the hilly,curvy roads around East Tennessee in 1958, which starred Robert Mitchum.  In 'American Graffiti' in 1973, we saw a race of the Fifties Chevies and one fancy roadster.  Elvis drove one in 'Viva Las Vegas' with Ann-Margaret as his co-pilot.    Today, NASCAR is one of the biggest businesses there is in America.  Some years ago, I met Darrell Waltrip as he was induced into the Sports Hall of Fame in Nashville (the first race car driver to earn that honor) and asked for his autograph to give to Zachary.  His son has gone on to keep the image alive.	2005-07-04

The title of this book denotes the passageway to the desert West of Santa Fe where a whole new world lived for a brief amount of time.  Robert Oppenheimer was sent in March 1943 to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to work on a classified Manhattan Project site known only as 109 E. Palace.    In the mountainous desert location a few miles from there, he and a team of world-famous scientists built the first atom bomb.  Trinity is the site where the bomb was first tested on July 16, 1945.    This was a secret city like Oak Ridge, thirty miles from Knoxville, which was cut off from the rest of society for 27 months to accomplish their mission to end the war.  To the GIs and WACs, Los Alamos was an interminable limbo they called \\"Lost Almost.\\"  They hated it there.  The pictures in the photo section tell the whole story.  Oak Ridge has just now released their own story in photos I hope to see soon.    Dorothy was the official 'gatekeeper' until June 28, 1963 when it was closed.  Oppenheimer died from cancer on February 18, 1967, and the woman who loved him was 88 (seven years old than he would have been had he lived) when she followed him on December 17, 1985 (almost twenty years later).  She was heartbroken.  Although this is an account of the formation of Las Alamos Laboratory, it is also a bittersweet love story.  A real one.  Mark Twain wrote:  \\"the only difference between fiction and nonfiction is that fiction should be completely believable.\\"    In the primitive living quarters, there was a PX which had a jukebox (like the Wurlitzer I took a photo of at MacDonalds's on Clinton Highway) and a dance floor.  Dancing, drinking alcohol, and carousing took place nightly.  Needless to say, there was a baby boom in that 27-month period.	2005-07-04

Anarchy is a governing system that eschews authority.  Oligarchy governs from, through, and for authorities.  These ideologies feed off each other dialectically; they are rapidly remaking our global information ecosystem: the increasing speed and amount of information and the basic paradox of the digital world onto the real world.    Libraries are never as placid as they appear.  They are sources of controversy and conflict.  After it was confirmed that some of the terrorists had used public computers in Virginia and Florida, the government decided they want access fo patron reading habits and Internet use.  Thus, the USA Patriot Act came into existence.      The Patriot Act, signed by President Bush II, in October 2001, has turned into an intrusion in the privacy of library users and those who check out books.  Anyone pretending to be FBI can check your account and no one will inform you.    The FBI is notorious for overstepping its bounds.  This intrusion into patrons' privacy is against the Constitution.  We are being denied our inalienable rights.   The library is not just functionally important to communities all over the world, the doors should be open to everybody.  Librarians are being forced to choose between their values, but they are supposed to support and protect the patrons.  We are not to be intimidated by the choice of books we choose to read.  I am using a diverse study among the nonfiction (simply because they are new), clearly not my choice of reading material, but folks on Amazon. com seem to prefer the newer books for their reviews.    As with Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama,  unclassified technical reports have disappeared from the Los Alamos National Lab web site.  How is that possible?  It never should have been put online in the first place.	2005-07-04

In Madagascar, there is The Celestial Grocery with a vintage jukebox of old Southern soul songs.  It was the last of a constellation of Chinese-run country stores which used to exist in almost every river town between Memphis and New Orleans.  The original sign was an ancient pressed-tin Coca-Cola sign with a Chinese symbol which wished \\"long life\\" to all who entered there.  There is an old boarded up Lyric Theater past its time.    I was intrigued with the title only to find it was a 1968 worn-out thing which sometimes works, not properly.  On it you may find Johnny Cash, Percy Sledge, Patsy Cline's 'Crazy,' and Hank Williams' Kalayga -- American roots music.  On the radio, you could hear monks in Himalayas chanting or aboriginal panpipes.  This was the way life was in the outback of the South maybe a hundred years ago.  This novel, however, takes place in that small town across the river from Memphis filled with a variety of different kinds of people, none high-class.    The author, originally from Massachuetts and Georgia, was curator of William Faulkner's home in Oxford, Mississippi.  She chose rural Mississippi at the time of 9-11-2001 happenings and how it affected their mixed-race life.  She shows the badness of the South after moving on to Texas.	2005-07-04

Media is as the real history of today, partly made up on the spot to appear sensational. <br /> <br />Look at how the media made up rumors about suicides of the Michael Jackson fans if he were convicted of the abuses he did to many young boys.  He pretended to be sick and the media were there promoting that falsehood to get pity for the poor white guy. <br /> <br />The media has become mediated, sated with false information and written from a prejudiced point of view.  The media think they rule this country, as we all want to know what is happening now and all of the details. <br /> <br />This is a sad state we've come to in the television and radio broadcasts and the news networks.  After all, they have to have something to talk about, so why not make some of it up.  Embellish it a little to up a rating for that newscast.  Media  today has fallen to yellow journalism and Hearst would be proud.	2005-07-01

My children (three sons) grew up watching Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood on public t.v  Now, my cat Star enjoys watching the reruns.  Alas, our beloved Mr. Rogers could not live forever, but he left behind (thanks to his wife Joanne) some of his plain-spoken wisdom.  Here are just a few which spoke to me:    \\"The media shows the tiniest percentage of what people do.  There are millions and millions of people doing wonderful things all over the world, and they're generally not the ones being touted in the news.\\"    \\"The greatest loss that we all have to deal with is the loss of the image of ourselves as a perfect person.\\"Each person in the world is a unique human being, and each has unique potential.  One of the important tasks of growing is the discovery of this uniqueness: the discovery of \\"who I am\\" in each of us -- of \\"who I am\\" in relation to all those whom I meet.  \\"It's really easy to fall into the trap of believing that what we do is more important than what we are.  Of course, it's the opposite that's true.  What we are ultimately determines what we do!\\"    \\"We don't always succeed in what we try -- certainly not by the world's standards -- but I think it's the willingness to keep trying that matters most.\\"  No matter what our age, no matter what our condition, life's disappointments show us the limits of what we're able to do.  But, of course, in dealing with them, we just might create a new forward striving.  \\"You are a very special person.  There is only one like you in the whole world.  There's never been anyone exactly like you before, and there never will be again.  Only you.  And people can like you exactly as you are.\\"    This little book is filled with all of the sayings we heard him explain to us on his show.  The trolley is on the cover to remind us of all his wonderful characters.  He is sorely missed, but this book (the young librarian said \\"this is wonderful\\" as she checked it out for me along with five other books) will let young children who did not get to see him 'live' still learn from his vast amount of knowledge.  Thanks to you, Fred Rogers, for letting us go on part of your journey and for the things to remember along the way.  Thanks, Joanne, for assembling them as your special gift to a special person.  The most special of all.	2005-07-01

Mediation means dealing with reality through something else.  In this book, mediation refers to arts and artifacts that represent and communicate; also to the effects on the way we experience historical happenings in the world and our place in it.  Nowadays the media has reached a new, higher plane of being \\"engendered by mediating representations of fabulous quality and inescapable ubiquity.\\"  I love those words!    Cell phones, answering machines, digital telemarketing messages, Xerox machince Web sites, and BlackBerries are a part of media today.  These are ways of communication.  Consider the Inspector Clouseau redux.  It's all a farce as far as the news and tabloid papers present the details of any event.      This is censorship in the worst way.  I will just go back to the library and take the book out again and redo the review only make it more detailed and much longer and see if they take it off, too. The media today is warped.  Something is going to have to be done as it is full of things the terrorists need to know to dishevel this country and the media is helping in any way it can.    He calls astronomers 'dorks' and perhaps he is right.  I have a son who is one and pretends he does not enjoy the trips to Pasadena with the tours he gives for students.  He's a liar.  The Justin Helmet Principle takes care of the first question that this isn't about media per se but about being a mediated person in a world made up of represented opinions.    This book is aimed to \\"zap the zeitgeist\\" (whatever that is); they can't represent the reality as it is beyond mediation.  That is part of the unrepresentable mood that eludes mediation at the dawn of the age of terror.  Thomas de Zengotita has a PhD (as does my son, the derk astronomer) from Columbia University and teaches at Dalton School in New York.  Norman Mailer offered his salute to this author on the success of such a marvelous treatise on his emotions, remembrances, and what he thinks others should do. It was certainly different, JN.	2005-07-01

This is an interactive how-to book fulled with relevant comic strips and cartoons -- a very graphic publication. In it, he promotes reverse psychology to get what you want; my sister mastered in this type of child rearing which I could never learn.  <br /> <br />This book is about setting goals, not just realistic, but real. Make this goal as though you were living it today. Visualize. By doing this, your enthusiasm will rise, your focus will intensify, and you'll be able to stick to your goal.  <br /> <br />Nothing is impossible. Sure enough, one day, you will make it happen, because you'll have made it important to you, vitally important.  After you set your goal, you have to plan how to achieve it. Too many retired people are so focused on maintaining a living that they sometimes forget to have a life, and become 'bored to tears!'  <br /> <br />Lincoln said: \\"And in the end it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.\\" He gives several \\"what-if\\" and \\"if-only\\" scenarios.  Whatever you choose, however you go about achieving your goals, the main end result is to be happy along the way and when you reach your destination. We may not get what we want when we want it. I was told by a stranger some years ago that God does not work on our time, but He has a plan for each of us in His own time.  <br /> <br />John Greenleaf Whittier said, \\"For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are those \\"It might have been.\\"  He tells us that \\"Bill Gates is rich because he own a whole lot of Microsoft, the software company he started. He's the richest person in America, perhaps the world.\\"  Part II shows you how to have your cake and eat it, too: take your choice, pound cake is fixed income investments and stocks; marble cake is filled with both. Cupcakes are fads. Avoid them.	2005-07-01

In 1937, after being a member of the Communist party for twelve years, Whitaker Chambers lost confidence, he said, and confiscated some 'important' government papers which he hid in a bathroom cubbyhole of his nephew's home in Brooklyn.  These included seventy-one confidential reports and memos from the desk of Alger Hiss.  The purloined documents had been typed at home by Priscilla from papers her husband has written; none dealt with vital secrets. <br /> <br />Alger Hiss worked for the State Department and was secretary-general of the United Nations organizing conference in San Francisco.  In 1948, he was brought to trial on the accusations of Chambers and charged with perjury.  The first trial deadlocked, 8-4.  In 1950, he was found guilty and was incarcerated for almost four years.  Later, academics would look back on McCarthy's \\"Red Scare\\" with Alger as its chief martyr. <br /> <br />He died in 1996, exonerated with front page headlines.  This writer tries to prove Alger guilty of spying (after the facts).  Why'd he wait almost ten years after the death to tarnish a good man's reputation?   Sounds fishy to me! <br /> <br />It is amazing how the media, politicians, and academics fall for bad ideas.  Their lies become accepted as truth, and we all needlessly accept what they write as factual.  Journalists and historians present the new history and turned a separatist into a civil rights icon.  Some at UTK want to destroy everything Nathan Bedford Forrest achieved during the Civil War as they want to change history as it was. <br /> <br />Daniel J. Flynn calls this book a wake-up call, a 'reality check.'  It is just one man's opinion and I don't agree with him about Hiss or Al Gore.   <br /> <br />Flynn is a member of the Leadership Institute dedicated to training future conservative leaders.  He is the author of WHY THE LEFT HATES AMERICA.  He can't help but further their case with his views in this slanted book.	2005-06-30

The United States invented a patent act in 1790 which restricted patent protection exclusively to original inventors.  In the early 1790s Eli Whitney developed a contraption which separated cottonseed from the fiber and took it to the Southern states where cotton was grown.  His design was copied by others there (pirates of the Industrial Age), so he returned to Connecticut in 1793 to obtain a patent from Thomas Jefferson stating that he was the original inventor.    When America was first formed, they copied inventions from Britain and other European countries as a \\"given.\\"  The machine which secured Whitney's place in history drained his finances as he had to file many lawsuits against the Southerners.  He became immortalized because of the controversy and has a pretentious gravestone in New Haven modeled after that of the Roman General Scipo who defeated Carthage.    The interlopers felt they were simply following in the footsteps of their ancestors, as America had welcomed such practices since the early days.  The American nickname \\"Yankee\\" originated in the Dutch word \\"smuggler\\" and suggests the violation of European industry and the idea that was second nature to the colonists from the early days of settlement.    Such things are still taking place in the United States as it is so easy to find anything on the Internet and copy it without permission.  If you copy someone's writing, it is plagaralism, which is a disgrace today.  You can write about the same thing but cannot use the same words unless you have written permission, or use quotes to show that it is not your idea.    Patents did not help the early inventors, as many people claimed to have invented the Steam Boat.	2005-06-30

If you remember the t.v. show called 'The Millionaire,' this is nothing like that.  A total stranger is not picked at random to become a millionaire overnight.  This involves two brothers, Oliver and Charlie. who work in a high class bank in New York City.  Oliver is in the high echelons with a walnut desk and grand office (Victorian bronze oval doorknob and 18th century Chinese porcelain vase used as a garbage container) while younger brother Charlie is in a beige cubicle far below the sidewalk.  Charlie doesn't begrudge Oliver his fancy office as he's really not interested in banking anyway; he's into music!    Oliver is persuaded to tranfer nonexistent millions for a prominent client of the bank as he cannot reach his boss, Lapidus, nor anyone else in authority to make the decision for him.  The three hundred and thirteen million was not actual but a worm in the digital land of the unknown.  Four days of interest, one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars, was transferred to a regular account.    The brothers did not know of the deception and thought it had belonged to a deceased bank customer.  So they decide to partake of some of it, only to get caught.   Charlie starts a band, something loud but smart, and Oliver has the perfect name for it:  'The Millionaires.'    We had a big band sound coming from just a few practiced musicians until the band leader died last Spring.  Now, a 19-yr-old is planning to revive the old sound of the '30s and '40s with a nine man group, one of whom played for the Al Curtis Orchestra.  He'd turn over in his grave!  His dances were sponsored and free for seniors, some of which made dancing look easy and as beautiful as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

Written by a world-renowed environmental analyst and a co-author, Jennifer Kent who has written several papers in conjuncition, a researcher.  He teaches at Duke University and has recived many awards for his works and books.    The new consumers are people in developing and transition nations who have achieved a level of affluence to buy cars, eat more meat, and own electrical appliances on a par with the least of us in America.  China leads the group in meat and grain consumption; there are lots of people in China.  India is not far behind, and it is very hot there.  Russia has become the biggest oil-producing country in the world, and now rivals Saudi Arabia.  Mexico has gained many U.S. manufacturing companies and other America owned concerns, so now they can live well.    Poland, where our former mayor is now ambassador, is on this list and now the natives own many more automobiles and lead a higher life style since our beloved Victor Ashe relocated.  The twenty countries who comprise the globalization include South Africa, Brazil, Iran, Pakitan, Turkey, Ukraine, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Argentina, Columbia, and Venezula.    This vast phenomenon has an unprecedented scope of world trade in these twenty countries.  Japan is the leader in producing electronics.  Millions of these new consumers own television sets and computers.  Now, however, exists the parallel difference between the \\"Haves\\" and the \\"Have-Nots\\" like in this hillbilly hometown of mine which tries to think it is a city.      Among the worst off is Bombay, India (12 million residents, half are homeless or slum-dwellers).  Absolute poverty abounds in all  twenty countries as it does in the United States.  So many homeless here in every town and city!    Owning a car is a status symbol -- the ultimate of \\"You've made it.\\"  In America, you need two or more to reach that goal of the good life.  In most places, a car is a necessity (with the exception of Manhattan who chooses to lease a car on weekends) and not a luxury item any longer.    Leading car ownerships in these twenty are Brazil, Russia, Mexico, S. Korea, Argentina, Malaysia and Poland.  Elsewhere, there are more bicycle riders and trains.  This increase in driving cars is causing more air pollution from carbon dioxide.  Six of the world's (outside of U.S.) smoggiest cities are Sao Paulo, Beijing, Shanghai, New Delhi, and Mexico City.  In U. S. Knoxville is on a par with Los Angeles in air pollution.  Poland uses a tax system to encourage unleaded gasoline.    Shanghai has put ten billion dollars into a rapid transit system.  Pittsburg, PA, equals Ottawa, Canada, with a bus-based rapid-transit systems.  The buses in Knoxville are used to serve the University of Tennessee to the exclusion of the public.  It is called a public transit, but it is run by Cincinnati, Ohio, management and they prefer sub-contracting the conventions and running the forty new buses (which TDOT paid for use of the public) day and night -- wearing them out -- to bring in additional ridership and profits.  And the City Council backs this endeavor to deceive the public.	2005-06-29

This is an account of Ross' four years in an Ivy League University and also of the 'privileged' education the American elite cultivated at the turn of the century.  In 1998, Ross from New Haven, Connecticut, arrived on campus with an idealized vision of the place, just as I had of modern Knoxville about the same time when I returned after so many years.  Neither of us received what we were looking for or anticipating.  Wiser but poorer in the existence of humanity and what it has become.    Harvard was a culture of 'privilege' but it was only a steppingstone to positions with high salaries, not academic excellence.  The Harvard of his dreams never materialized.    Booze and sex were plentiful, as is the case at UTK (free buses and trolleys all day and at short intervals until 3 a.m. to a bad area of town full of taverns and crime; the strip on Cumberland Avenue with both sides filled with many, many drinking holes).  He describes his dormitory as being worse than the 'mission full of unwashed bodies' as the local buses are stinking from those who don't care how they smell.  How could rich kids act that way: dirty clothes, smelly used furniture, half empty bottles of liquor.  He endured a horrid graduation day in June, 2002.    Ross gives a realistic look at Harvard from that we've been led to believe, with all the fallacies and prejudices only the Ivy Leaguers could shape and enforce.  \\"So it is that Harvard and at similar schools across the country, a privileged class of talented (drunks and drug addicts) sits atop the world, flush with pride in their own accomplishments secure in the knowledge that they rule because they deserve to rule, because they are the best.\\"    In his account of his last night there, he gives an expose of the polluted atmosphere and rampant vice on campus.  Since graduation , he has found a career in journalism at 'Atlantic Monthly,' which leaves him yearning for the old Alma Mater\\"  \\"I love it, and I miss it even now -- the lunatic schedules and sleepless nights...I miss stumbling home drunk at 3 a.m....More than anything I miss the place itself.\\"    Pleasant memories surface of a younger self, an irresponsible student (only three years ago) who found the promise of a Harvard education \\"went unfulfilled.\\"  It was the place of unrequited dreams, the university of imagination.  It's damned if you do and damned if you don't.  It's disillusion with the sanctity of life everlasting and of morals.	2005-06-28

They'd like to think they are modern Napoleons and his wars, but I'd like to remind them to remember what happened at Waterloo.    It takes a lot of maneuvering to make politics in this modern age of favoritism and people in office who have no place there.  Those with the government jobs locally are not qualified or trained and most dress up and play act, from the Mayor on down.  Alas, this is the trend in most of the country.  Will we become another fallen country who will depend on India to come to our aid?  It's something to contemplate.  If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a dish someplace, you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthiest.

In the past, these plants were for use medicinally, from toothpaste to the pangs of childbirth.  The ruffled, gray-green horehound was used to soothe a cough -- I still use it today.    From the first to the sixteenth centuries, silvers were noted for their healing properties like sage, mostly confined to the herb repertoire until 1980s.  Silver plants were considered very important visual elements for their contrast to shades of green.    Blue spruce is one of the most beautiful silver/blue trees, popular for use as a Christmas tree -- but grown outdoors, they expand and grow tall, keeping the special shade.  There was a huge one directly outside a gate at the apartment building where I live, and it was cut down a few weeks ago.  Not easy to grow, a lovely treasure, but this town of Knoxville, Tennessee, likes only one tree, pink/white dogwoods.    They cut down others freely as they have no sense of decorum or beauty in something which has no bright or purple flowers.  This is a purple town!  The Taplow Blue shrub has the look of blue spruce without the tall sculpted shape.  Another name for heather is \\"Silver Knight.\\"  It has been used in medicinal preparations.    There is a silver dollar gum tree, The so-called  \\"money\\" plant turns silver when it goes to seed and makes an ornamental grass to use for decorations.  The Southern Lady fern has silver in it.  There is a Spanish fir tree and blue noble species.  There is silver feather maiden grass and the Spanish moss in Louisiana is a gray/dull silver.      Some are named after animals: pussytoes, rattlesnakemaster, quail, silver bluebeard, ponyfoot, coyote, wormwood, lamb's ears, hummingbird plant, donkey tail, Tasmanian devil, and hens & chicks.  Not just silver plants are spectacular, but so are silver-haired ladies.	2005-06-28

S. politics and \\"democracy\\" is written by an eminent historian who devoted many years to writng a six-volume history about Churchill and his importance to the outcome of World War II.  He wrote FIVE DAYS IN LONDON (in May 1940) pivotal to the success of WWII in favor of the Allies, and THE DUEL between Churchill and Hitler. <br /> <br />He is a man who lives and breathes history.  He feels that the current form of American democracy which had its roots in the 18th Century have changed drastically to a dangerous form of populism.  History today is written for entertainment or propaganda and depends more on public opinion than on actual facts.   <br /> <br />The machinery of publicity (the media) has caused the United States president to rely on nationalism and militarism to hold our society together.  The decline of privacy (Big Brother cameras everywhere, even out on the Interstates which traverse this country) and the rise of criminality make for a dark future, full of fear and hatred. <br /> <br />The division between the two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, make for a bad choice of bedfellows.  The very material order (or disorder) of the world is not at all the dundament but the consequence of what many people think.  Mayors, public officials, government workers, Governors, Presidents -- all are in power because of their popularity and not their ability.  In America, you get where you are by who you are or who you know.  It's sad what this world has become since 1945 when our future seemed secure.  Nothing is secure today and 9/11 proved it.  Those terrorists died in the plane crashes, but there are double that amount in U. S. A. today waiting for their turn to be suicide bombers, whether in planes, trains, or public transit.	2005-06-28

It is packed full of pictures, not only of her family but parts and people of the Rocket & Space activities out in LaJolla and Pasadena.  I take back what I wrote about THE LONELY DOLL.  That was before my time and I was not privileged to own one.  This woman was essentially \\"the lonely doll.\\"  There is a family portrait of her dad, Charles Carroll Lord, as a child in 1906 with his parents.    Charles Edward Lord had died when the vehicle in which he was trapped was hit by a train as he was on the job working for the International Harvester Company.  She learned the details of the accident, Oct. 19,1919, (the government could get rid of who they felt were untrustworthy) from her dad's filing cabinet ater his death.  Her father never talked about it.    She calls Edward Teller, the architect of the hydrogen bomb, the real-life Dr. Strangelove.  Not only did we bring Von Braum from Germany to start and carry on our defense program, there was another Theodore von Karman, legendary Caltech aerodynamicist.    \\"My father learned well before the '70s that technology could turn on you -- that a machine designed to make your life easier could rip that life apart.\\"  Her father was lucky to get a job at Harvester making mechanical drawing and  designing tools, in the '30s.  He was late getting into the atomic (nuclear) business: 69, but he did as he was told.  His portrait at that time shows that he fit right in with that group from Massachetts and was used to keep tight rein on the formation of the Jet Propulsion Lab near L.A.    This little book tells all about the unlikely beginnings of the JPL, going from science fiction to science fact.  My son is a patsy for NASA and takes large groups of young people on tours at this Lab and they stay for days on end.  He too will feel what it is to die young when they think he knows too much.    Like Ms. Lord's grandfather whose door would not open, but two others escaped, before the train demolished the car anddragged him a long way down the track.  Her father was only 46 when he died but he looks like an old man.  That's what leaks from nuclear and atomic production will do for you.  Maybe Jeff will last one more year.  He's already having false heart attack symptoms.    This book is packed full of revealing pictures of how this government has and continues to fool Americans about the safety of this precise killing machine.  Stephen Hawkings tried to warn us, but now he too is gone.  Thank you, Ms. Lord.  You have done a good deed letting us know the real life in the Space Exploration Center where anyone is expendable.    Isn't it exhausting to try and be the person in charge all the time? Why not sit back and let the universe drive -- just this once? Who knows? You may enjoy the experience so much that you decide to do it more often. And really, sometimes the arrangements that the universe comes up with are ever so much more appropriate than the ones you try to wrench into place. You may hate to admit it, but you know it's true. So relax and put your feet up.	2005-06-27

By the same author of MY MISPENT YOUTH (a group of essays -- essays are supposed to be nonfiction, at least in the local newspaers, the columnists publish books of their essays and in the library it is label nonfiction), this book is fiction but based on her experiences.    \\"Lucinda was me.  Is me.  Except that the Lucinda who lost her apartment lease on Broadway and Ninety-fourth Street in Manhattan was a person of such a long time ago that I have difficulty even associating that face with the one who now tells this story.\\"  She's now in a Midwest town called Prairie City, located along the old Oregon Trail.  It is a nondescript town, could be a suburb here where the same thing is taking place -- making meth, a drug \\"coke\\" for the Payless shoe set.  The women use it to help them lose weight in the beginning, but it causes them to lose their looks and ultimately their very lives.    She explains the world full of trailer parks.  In Knoxville, they are hid in certain areas  that the other, richer transplants won't even know they exist.  You have to ride the public transit buses as they ramble in out of the way places to see them.  It is hilarious to hide the poor trash, when all of the multitude of homeless are sleeping out on the street in the downtown area, on benches, in door fronts, on Market Square, and out in the open for all to see.  They've taken over the Broadway Shopping Center, which is very scary.  These are desperate misfits who came here because they get free medicine, free clothes, free meals, free nighttime housing (if they're not drunk).    Prairie City has so many trains, like here (I could believe she has been to this town), that there is no wrong side to be from.  Once I was told by a bus passenger who travels on the bus to the elite section of town but finally rode on around behind the rich icing-on-the-cake places and admitted that she lives on the wrong side of the track.  Where I was born, a train track came over the bridge where the TennesseeRiver begins.  I walked up it to take lunch to my grandfather working in the marble quarry.  My dad was a railroad man and I rode the lovely sit-in cars of the Southern Railway every summer to Washington, D. C.  What a blast!  At the Forks of the River, there was no wrong side.  One held the quarries and stone/cemet/brick-building places, and the residences were mainly filled with the quarry workers.  We had our own little company town beside the railroad.    In this god-forsaken-place out West, she soon learned the art of waiting things out, and even gained a bit of class.  Lucinda comes to realize that 'quality of life' is more complicated and richer than she could ever have imagined.  We must bloom and multiply where we are planted.  Sometimes, we find ourselves in a place which is sucking the life out of us and have to move on, or back.  It is true, You Can't Go Home Again.  Good advice from the old Thomas Wolfe, not the new kid on the block.	2005-06-27

This decade was \\"the best of times\\" for those of us growing up then.  The music was the best and is still being played on radio stations fifty years later.  And yet, the Scripps newspaper left out this decade when local talent shows abounded, and even some of us did pantomimes (not just the two Don Ferguson wrote about), and one newspaper editor said it was the worst of times as you couldn't drink in a restaurant.  Most of Knoxville drinks behinds doors anyway; I had one radio announcer tell me that  he knows all about the solitary drinker.  Poor thing!    Harry Truman was still the war president and ordered the Atomic Energy Commission to develop the hydrogen bomb.  He had already made our military use the atomic bomb which was developed in Oak Ridge, a few miles from Knoxville.  He was a ferocious president but a coward in doing the fighting for himself.      Innocent people were slandered and a couple of \\"spies\\" were electrocuted in New York prisons -- time has shown that the wrong people were put to death.  Because of politics the career of Alger Hiss was destroyed because of malicious lies by a political informer.    The pictures in this volume are absolutely fantastic.  Hopalong Cassidy is there watching an orphaned bear in New Mexico hold a poster with a U.S. Forestry offical \\"Help Prevent Forest Fires.\\"  Guess he is the original Smokey the Bear.    There is a photo showing a theater marquee proclaiming \\"Free To Public Kefauver TV Senate Crime Hearings.\\"  McCarthy tried to destroy  the lives and careers of folks out in Hollywood.  He did some, but others assumed different names and kept on working on films.    The U. S. Postmaster General cuts mail delivery from twice a day to only once.  Now, it takes a week and the cost of postage has gotten so exorbitant that most people send e-mail.  Sometimes, even a Priority Mail ($3.85) does not reach its destination in 2005.    New on T.V.: \\"The Jack Benny Show''What's My Line' (tried to get on that one at the tenderage of 15), 'You Bet Your Life' with Groucho Marx (boy, he was a clown!), and 'Your Show of Shows.'  Why'd they leave 'Coke Time' out; that was THE SHOW for that decade and Eddie Fisher was thebiggest star of the Fifties.    Douglas MacArthur is remanded to the States by Truman to a ticker-tape parade and he declared to Congress, \\"Old soldiers never die; they just fade away.\\"  But he didn't -- no sir, he went back to where he promised he would return and rebuilt Japan singlehandedly.    In the Fifties, the average cost of four years of college was only $1800 (what I was promised when I married my teacher -- didn't get it!), up 400 percent from 1900.  What is it today?    The execution of the Rosenbergs is a black eye on this country and will forever be a travesty of justice.  It is blind justice.	2005-06-27

This is a combination of IN COLD BLOOD and HELTER SKELTER, both about unnecessary killing of victims who did not deserve to die.  In the first crime (opening scene) two cold blooded killers appear to be 'bungling amateurs' when they worm their way into the high-scale home of the superior court judge on a Sunday night when they know that his wife is not at home.  How do they know this?  Why, reading the society page of the newspaper.    To throw the police off kilter, they spray paint WHITE POWER! in red as the Manson group painted PIGS with blood in one of their murders.  At first it seems to be revenge killings as another ex-con is savagely murdered.    The judge's former stepson (he'd been married to the mother) is on the police rolls and is able to gain entrance to the crime scene.  He has not gotten in touch in person with him and now regrets his negligence.  \\"Kids need regular contact; you can't do that by long distance.\\"    More people die before the convict who can 'no longer dance' as he is confined to a wheelchair and was supposed to have died in prison 28 years ago is murdered by persons unknown.  This was not an easy crime story to read, and the sex could have been left out.  It detracted from the real story.	2005-06-27

Cavier is the choice of the rich.  It is merely the sturgeon's eggs.  Sturgeon populations have declined 70% in the last twenty years because of the gluttony of obese, wealthy connoiseurs of fish.  It is now becoming a most-endured species. <br /> <br />Harvard grad Richard Carey informs us of the people both profiting from the cavier producing business and shows a high-stakes cocktail of business, crime, diplomacy, technology an dthe problems of conservation.  As the public appetites gorw and more people now can afford this staple to their diets which was once a luxury, it soon may become extinct. <br /> <br />Fish has always been my favorite food since the days of cowboys movies around Market Square and the lunch at a diner, always fish.  Being a Southerner, I love to eat catfish and hush puppies.  Having no way to get to the specialty fish places in East Tennessee, I have to depend on Captain D's and Long John Silver's.  Usually I go to the nearest, CD, but today I rode a long bus ride to rach LJS , and it was worth it.  CD may produce a larger fish sandwich, but LJS tastes better. <br /> <br />Sturgeon was plentiful in the waters around the Persian Empire 250 million years ago.  Today it has declined drastically in the Caspian Sea where it had survived against all odds.  The large salaries of 2005 enable more gluttons to afford something which sells for $100 an ounce.  It corresponds with sex appeal among the high and mighty. <br /> <br />The sturgean has seen more years when it first spawns than many fish see in a lifetime.  In East Tennessee, the carp are enormous, and people don't have the rich tasts -- though you may find it at some of the gatherings of the social groups at KMA. <br /> <br />This was the pap of life, the milk of wonder as the food of the gods.  They spawn only in rivers of a world without sin.  Soon they will all die out, becaues some people don't practice restraint in their culinary desires.

According to these PhD authors, it is easier to give love than to receive it.  It goes back to our childhoods when a parent failed to nurture and rejected the person who depended on him for her very life.  When a mother is absent, and a mean uncaring father ignores the daughter, she ends up with a complex which clearly says \\"Nobody can love me, so why try.\\"<br /><br />When we get grown, even married to a noncaring, sick man, it is impossible to get the love we want and need.  Sometimes, you just have to look elsewhere.  And that's not good for the children.  Oh yes, you can have children without loving the father of those children.  Sometimes, it is forced on you; sometimes it is taken from you when an abusive husband forces the wife to have an abortion, because He does not want to spend money to raise another one.<br /><br />In this book, there is a guide to help one break the shackles of self-hate and -rejection, and to accept love from others.  So often, what they are offering is not love, so you must weigh the issues and try to come to a logical (not emotional) conclusion.  Your very life depends on it.<br /><br />First, you must accept what is offered, but not indiscriminately.  Be sure it is love and not lust.  All women are \\"used\\" on occasion, but if possible you must not give in.  The authors of this guide to help you to decipher true love from false promises look to be a couple.  There is a science to any relationship; learning to accept love from the person you do love will make you whole again.

This is a novel of deceit, starring who else but Lincoln Rhyme, Deaver's model of an investigator.  At the beginning, a young music student is murdered and the killer is caught red-handed, only to escape from a locked room.    What is illusion?  A flutter of wings, a whisper of silk?  Yes, if you are a magician.  Harry Houdini was the  greatest escape artist in America, if not the world,  in his time.  This story takes place in one week, following the murder, from April 20-25 in which we learn the magic trick called \\"Lazy Hangman.\\"    Magicians are illusionists and sleight-of-hand artists who weave a spell to delight and captivate the audience.  When David Copperfield (of course, that's not his real name, just as Englebert Humperdink was not the birth name of the singer who used it; his buddy Tom Jones parlayed his stage name also) made the Statue of Liberty disappear on television, I kept asking \\"How DID he do that?\\"  Of course, he didn't -- it was all illusion.    I've seen amateur magicians here at different events describe exactly how this kind of thing is done.  But to flee a locked room takes more than cunning.  There had to be a false opening in the room somewhere.  A magic show has no reality to it whatsoever.  What you are convinced you are seeing does not exist at all.    This is a 'gothic' tale modernized by a famous author.  He took us back in time through a time tunnel in the woods of Virginia.  Remember?  Here, he endeavors to make it so that a criminal can change his appearance and become a whole different person.  Some people do that without magic!  He uses magic tricks he has seen modern artists performing, only putting them in a fiction context.    The Conjurer has lived through a troubled past and has murderous urges, but why this particular girl?  Of course, he is blessed with a brilliant mind like Hannibal Lecter , and he's a master of his trade like Houdini.    Like Diane Boxx, Amelia Sachs wants a fire-engine red car.  A sequel is in store, asusual with Jeffrey Deaver whose personna is this Lincoln Rhyme, when the ending shows there are two dead diplomats -- and a pair of missing shoes, both for the right foot.  My goodness, what title can we anticipate for these expensive shoes.  What about THE RED SHOES.	2005-06-26

At the Fort Lauderdale Convention Center in April, 2000, he gave thirty-five talks about his find.  Michael W. Skrepnick made the unusual illustration of this 'find' which looks like a giant baby duck.  This is the cover for \\"Feathered Dragons.\\" <br /> <br />Dr. Ostrom revealed finding a DEINONYCHUS in 1969, an unusual discover in paleontology which shows that dinosaurs were the logical ancestors of birds.  Guess they at a lot to get so big. <br /> <br />It was thought that they were a primitive form of Asian bird.  The early dinosaurs had avian traits and could fly.  They laid eggs like birds do, but fish do, too.  They could be a combination of the two but how'd they get so large. <br /> <br />The feathered COELUROSAURS were found in China and the SINOSAUROPTERYX were in Patagonia and Mongolia.  The editors all all specialists in the field of dinosaurs.  There were various contributors to this study of feathered \\"dragons.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Life of the Past\\" was by James O.

She won a trophy for this role of a lifetime.  Thrust into the role of monarch, she inherits a disenchanted country who had endured an era of religious repression.  There were bitter hatreds (like today), plots upon plots as in Shakespeare's time, and much violence (couldn't be as bad as Iran and Iraq today).   <br /> <br />At that time Elizabeth was not allowed to marry Robert Dudley, just as Margaret could not marry her first love -- but now Charles married his long-time lover (nothing hid about that affair) Camilla.  What is this world coming to?  Is nothing sacred? <br /> <br />It's time to do away with royalty in Britain.  They are just figureheads anyway.  Since Diana's son has finished his education, he should by rights be the next King, but with the treacherous and lecherous Charles, he will never get the chance.  And poor Harry may not even finish school, because of all the threats about his safety.  They got rid of Diana, that's for sure, so that Camilla could do what Mrs. (George's wife) could not do -- become queen while being a commoner. <br /> <br />In a game of high political risks and personal sacrifice, she must prove worthy to rule for the fate of that so-called nation hung in the balance.  Well, it survived, but for what?	2005-06-25

This is a story of a fallen Baptist minister, Joe King, who had to serve six months for a career-ending crime.  Written by a circuit court judge, it is rather crude for such a learned man. <br /> <br />The cover shows a curly-haired white male with red horns and devil's beard painted on his picture in red with artificial red flames covering his mid-section.  This shows the dubious choices made by the main character influenced by conniving youth.  These irresponsible youth have been corrupted by today's morals and based on those who were brought before him as defendants.  Some were falsely declared neglected, even though they had good mothers who furnished everything material and all the name brand clothes a boy could want or need.   <br /> <br />It is called a cocktail of church and sin, an examination of faith, and the 'fraud we perpetrate on ourselves as members of today's society.  It shows Joel King and his involvement with a teenage vixen, Sandra Ham, as his wife demands a divorce -- bring his disgrace all the way round.  What goes around comes around.   <br /> <br />He is expressed by Martin Clark as a 'Job -like hero (that man in the Old Testament who was going to sacrifice his only son by killing him!) who was lured into an insurance hustle and scam by a member of his congregation.  He's also involved with crooked lawyers (there are crooked judges as well!), con men and bad people. <br /> <br />How he could dedicate this book about corruption and evil in memory of his \\"sweet mom\\" is beyond me.  He is a circuit court judge (the worst kind) and knows the lowlife by the people who appear in his court.  I doubt he has ever lived in a mobile home (trailer) in his life. <br /> <br />Perhaps he has known a corrupt preacher as Virginia does have Southern Baptists.  It right next to Tennessee where we have plenty of those.  No judge believes in God.  I've observed several and they're all influenced by money and are biased.  And none know what 'duress' means.	2005-06-25

Walter Sorrells has brought Charles Sloan back to life; he was originally created by Willima J. Coughlin who died in 1992.  His best-selling books included SHADOW OF A DOUBT, IN THE PRESENCE OF ENEMIES, THE JUDGMENT OF MYSTERY, etc.  He was a judge and a defense atty. in Detroit in addition to his novels. <br /> <br />Sloan has been summoned to the mansion at Pickeral Point, Michigan, by Miles Dane at 4 a.m. to fine Mrs. Dane savaglely murdered in her bed.  The police were called, and the first on the scene was a youngster who strung up the crime-scene tape.  Fifteen minutes later, a woman with the unforunate name of Sandra Ham Denkerberg, showed up to investigate the murder. <br /> <br />She was a tall, handsome woman of about fifty, her severe black pageboy punctuated by a white streak over the left ear, with painted on eyebrows and false eyelashes.  She asks Miles, \\"So your client is a liar.  Does that make him a murderer, too?\\" <br /> <br />After an ordeal with mystery surrounding the death of his wife, Miles sold the house to a 16-yr-old rap star from Detroit and moved to Los Angeles.  He became a squire of young actresses at movie openings.  Then in the 'Free Press' a story appeared, \\"Controversial Author Dies of Self-Inflicted Gunshot.\\" <br /> <br />He'd admitted to his attorney that he had killed his wife and gotten away with it, but who knows.  As Daniel Rourke, a detective, said on the stand: \\"In the end, Miles Danes' creations always got their just desserts.\\"  Could it have been cake?

Written by the mother of Ann Patchett, from Nashville, TN, a nurse by profession she is writing about something she enjoys doing at home in her spare time when she is not busy writing.  She has previously written JULIET & ROMEO, JULIET & ROMEO GET LUCKY, and STEP-BALL-CHANGE.      It's strange how famililes can get published when struggling writers don't have the wherewithal to get an agent and publisher; she had her first novel published at the age of 61.  The baking comes from her mother and she prefers lemon flavored with raspberries on the side.  Just the kind Ruth, the character in the novel chooses.  \\"When your family grows fractious, well, let them eat cake!\\"    The mixing, measuring, folding, making, smelling, seeing, tasting, there's no way to top baking a cake.  When Jeff was in nursery school at the First Methodist Church in Pulaski, he gave a recipe for how his mom baked a cake: You get out the mixer and mix it for maybe an hour, then you pour it in a pan and cook for ten minutes.  That's how it seemed to be to a three or four-year-old.    Ms. Ray says that she \\"loves to bake in the evening, after dinner.  It's something I find relaxing and rewarding, both in the doing and in the giving.\\"  She has two daughters; I think the other one is a critic by the name of Sandra Ham.  She appears to be as critical as Ms. Pratchett was when her 'friend' needed to spend Christmas with someone, but she was going off with her lover; thus, the woman committed suicide.  Too bad she didn't get some of the nurturing her nurse mother surely had and should have passed down to her daughters.	2005-06-25

After Michael Feinstein and Eddie Fisher, Teddy Bart is the best singer I've heard in you life, on screen and off.  He was a fixture on a local show in Nashville as host for many years, before becoming a talk show host on radio. <br /> <br />This book is to tell the story of the Nashville sound.  There are many songwriters who are equally talented as singers and these days the quickest way for a singer to become recognized is for him to write a song and sing it.  Singers are easy to find, and there are many good ones.  But finding a singer who can write is the plum.   <br /> <br />He talks about John D. Loudermilk, who wrote Waterloo,' 'Abilene,' \\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye,' and others.  A young Willie Nelson is shown with 'Hello Wall,' 'Crazy,' 'Funny How Times Slips Away,' and others. <br /> <br />This book is a compilation of interviews Teddy Bart wrote about with the top sonwriters who wrote the songs for the Nashville sound.  Roger Miller, Bill Anderson, Bobby Russell, Chet Atkins, and Hank Cochran are just some he included in this history of the Grand Ole Opry sound in the 70s.   <br /> <br />There are photographs of Uncle Jimmy Thompson, Uncle Dave Mason, Eddy Arnold, Tex Ritter, the Solemn Old Judge George Hay, Jim Reeves the Gentleman singer, Cowboy Copas, Johnny Cash, Ernest Tubb, Minnie Pearl, and Harlan Howard.  Teddy interviewed them all; he was as influential to their careers as Ralph Emery. <br /> <br />Teddy from Pottsfield, Pennsylvania, was the best transplant ever to settle in Tennessee.  He once told me that the best remedy for a sore throat was honey and lemon.  He also sang in the Clubs around town before he became a known music figure in his own right.  No one can beat Teddy Bart for music knowlege or for vocal talent.  He's the best.	2005-06-25

In 1993, Mary Karr's first book was published, a book of poems about evil, THE DEVIL'S TOUR.  In 1998, she wrote a semi-memoir, THE LIAR'S CLUB, which rode the top of the bestseller's list for over a year.  People were fascinated with this account of low-life in the East Texas refinery town, her frankness about her mother's multiple marriages, and the title is named after her violent father and his group of drunks he called friends.  She suffered an abusive childhood, as did many back in those days when the police looked the other day.    My sister also had to live through the nightmare of abuse but, when she reported it to the police here in this backward town in the South, she was told to go on home and keep her mouth shut.  You know, this kind of thing is still going on in the backwoods area of this state and Kentucky, a kind of 'approved' incestuous lifestyle -- and they are getting away with it.    In this followup, we are in the drug life of the '70s.  She has found a way out of that awful life and is on her way to Los Angeles in 1972.  \\"Time's march is a web of caues and effects, and asking for any gift of mercy, however tiny it might be, is to ask that a link be broken in that web of iron, ask that it be already broken.  No one deserves such a miracle.\\"    Was it possible for a little girl to go so far and still be able to function out in the world?  \\"You only love when you love in vain.  Try another radio probe when ten have failed, take two hundred rabbits when a hundred have died: only this is science.  You ask the secret.  It has just one name: again.\\"    This is a romp through the drug culture of the time.  Her mantra was \\"Effie say I can sang, Effie say I can sang...\\"   That oddball catchphrase will serve as a touchstone in years to come, an instant you'll return to after traveling the far roads.  \\"You were there solely for embellishment and witness.  You were there to watch.\\"  She was still wrung out on the acid as she wolfs down half a watermelon ina messy-kind of way.    \\"Its soaring close proves that from even the smokiest beginnings a solid self can form,\\" one capable of facing down all manner of monsters.  She amazingly is a Professor of English at Syracuse University and wrote VIPER'S RUN in 2001.  I'd advise obtaining the audio version which is on the market now and hear the voice of this person who lived it all, how 'dead' and 'defeated' she sounds.  No one should feel that way.  She survived by the hardest, but it left its mark.  Not once does she sound joyful.	2005-06-24

This book is a true story about slavery 150 years after the Civil War.  Maybe the American blacks were set free to cause havoc and mass produce, but this lost girl from Germany in 1818 was bought and turned into a slave in a New Orleans cabaret.  In Knoxville, the young poor girls were turned into a kind of slavery as prostitutes, owned by the person who owned the whorehouse which kept them captive.  They had no freedom and had to do what they were told.    Sally Miller was estranged from her family in a Transatlantic crossing 25 years before she was discovered sitting on the step outside the bar in 1843.  She was recognized by a German immigrant who had been on the same ship.    It took a six-month trial, one of the most sensational of 19th century, to determine whether Sally was indeed Salome Muller who was white or whether she was a Louisiana mulatto, and thus slave or free.  This was a dark period of American history and politics but not as dark as the Civil War which culminated in Lincoln's death.   Now, that was dark.    John Bailey is considered a diligent researcher and good writer who weaves history and mystery in a web of intrigue.  He offers his own conclusions, which some people disagree is fact and not fiction.  He is as credible as Edward Klein.	2005-06-23

This book just proves that one is never too old to learn.  Who would have thought it -- Britian had slaves in the 1780s.  Three hundred thousand Britons were encouraged to boycott the sugar produced by Caribbean slaves.  Wow, we thought that abomination was an American fallacy.  It took a generation for New England to get involved and even longer for Quaker Philadelphia.    There were Quakers in England. In 1787, Thomas Clarkson held a meeting of Christians in his London shop to protest slavery.  Over the next half century, this group termed as 'rebels' and others recruited for the causes which alerted the British public to the horrors of slavery's consequences.    It was the first successful mass protest in history and contributed support for other revolts around the world.  Emphasizing the personal suffering on which the institution of slavery was built, they ignited the \\"do-gooders\\" to feel guilt as if the slaves who produced their favorite products were their own.  By buying such products, they were accepting and approving the practice of denying freedom to black people who were treated as sub-humans by their masters and their foreman.  The slaves used religious services and spirituals to promote revolution against their status in life in 1838 in Britain.    Written by a historian who admired the rebels but disliked the religious aspect in the protestors' convictions which led to the creation of this abolitionist crusade against slavery everywhere.  The British led the way after they lost the American Revolution.  It took the atrocious Civil War to stir up the attention of the American public.

Well, she took her advice and hit on him some, made him feel guilty because she won't be a proper wife, and never has been. <br /> <br />God save us if someone like that gets in Office higher than the Senate.  She is a farce, as is her daughter.  Let him have a life now that we know the truth.  I can understand why he had the heart trouble.  Living in such a sordid family situation will kill him is he persists in pretending that she is his wife.  She's somebody's \\"him\\" instead of his \\"her.\\" <br /> <br />It's sick that people hide behind other's coat tails.  In DERELICTION OF DUTY, we learned that she carried around those files wherever she went; that means she had plenty to hide.  She knew it all, and Pres. Clinton kept his mouth shut about her and tried to cover up so that we would not discover the real truth.  Now, we know it all.

This book looks at the major causes of happiness and why they don't seem to be working.  He asks, \\"If money can't buy happiness, what can?\\"  More people have money to use for trips, vacations, pleasure, cruises, clothes, cars, houses, etc. -- more than they know what to do with it.    Americans have a higher standard of living at present, but do our many possessions and luxuries make us happier?  Doesn't seem to, as we're all stressed almost to the limit.    Societal pressures to make and spend money on more and expensive possessions takes an enormous toll on overall happiness.  Do we even know what it is to be happy anymore, to be loved, to be in love, to have good children who care; exactly what is happiness?    He attributes the lack of average satisfaction on the vast difference between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\", but it seems he is mainly concerned with Britain there.  In this small backward town, there is the same thing.  Some who have it all, and the rest are ignored as if they don't exist.    Love, family togetherness, contentment, community ties, religion, employment -- all are lacking and almost nonexistent.  A person's health will influence the amount or lack of his happiness.  Americans are the most medicated people on earth.  Have you heard someone brag about how many pills a day he or she must take just to keep going?  I know someone who spends as much every month on so many medications as the meager income I must use to survive, plus enormous amounts of money on insurance so he can live longer than his ancestors.  Don't they realize they've turned into drug addicts almost on a par with meth users?    There will be discontentment as long as the rich flaunt their finery in front of poorer citizens, aliens, and the homeless -- and look down their long noses at them.  They care only for themselves, and that is not conducive to happiness. The wealthy aren not happier, just more comfortable than the rest of us -- for the time being.  Any kind of catastrophe could render them penniless and homeless, and then they will experience misery.    Sir Richard Layard is a British professor at London School of Economics and was inducted into the House of Lords in 2000.	2005-06-22

This is the story of an 85-yr-old woman who feels that she must do something to bring the family back together.  Like most of us, she is lonely with her two sons so far away and the devoted, loving husband now dead.  It is a story of healing, love and forgiveness -- something my family needs badly. <br /> <br />As she writes her invitations of the last Homecoming, she says to herself, \\"I don't feel different from the way I felt when I was twenty.  I only look different.\\" <br /> <br />As e-mail is the way to communicate these days, there is still nothing as satisfying as to send and receive a well-written letter.  Annette Byrne did such that December as she looked out at all of the Christmas trees they had planted.  She had a special place with loving care to maintain it over the years -- it was a showplace. <br /> <br />Now, she has invited the brothers who had a falling out, embittered by a breach of ethics, honor, and trust.  Those things happen in the best of families when a parent dies and the will favors one over the other.  There are two grandchildren invited who are estranged from their families and the 'get-together' will do them good. <br /> <br />It is a touching story, as so many of Belva Plain's novel have been over the years.  I especially enjoyed THE CAROUSEL and EVERGREEN.	2005-06-22

This is an interactive how-to book fulled with relevant comic strips and cartoons -- a very graphic publication.  In it, he promotes reverse psychology to get what you want; my sister mastered in this type of child rearing which I could never learn.    This book is about setting goals, not just realistic, but real.  Make this goal as though you were living it today.  Visualize.  By doing this, your enthusiasm will rise, your focus will intensify, and you'll be able to stick to your goal.  Nothing is impossible.  Sure enough, one day, you will make it happen, because you'll have made it important to you, vitally important.    After you set your goal, you have to plan how to achieve it.  Too many retired people are so focused on maintaining a living that they sometimes forget to have a life, and become 'bored to tears!'    Lincoln said: \\"And in the end it's not the years in your life that count.  It's the life in your years.\\"  He gives several \\"what-if\\" and \\"if-only\\" scenarios.    Whatever you choose, however you go about achieving your goals, the main end result is to be happy along the way and when you reach your destination.  We may not get what we want when we want it.  I was told by a stranger some years ago that God does not work on our time, but He has a plan for each of us in His own time.  I'd really love to go to South America to see their pyramids.  John Greenleaf Whittier said, \\"For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are those \\"It might have been.\\"    He tells us that \\"Bill Gates is rich because he own a whole lot of Microsoft, the software company he started.  He's the richest person in America, perhaps the world.\\"  Part II shows you how to have your cake and eat it, too:  take your choice, pound cake is fixed income investments and stocks; marble cake is filled with both.  Cupcakes are fads.  Avoid them.    Learn to be yielding, and that way, you'll exercise your strength. It sounds contradictory, but it's not. Many ancient cultures consider water the strongest substance on earth because it acts with gentle persistence rather than brute strength, and in that way manages to shape its circumstances without   destroying what lies in its path. Maybe there's a lesson you could learn from that and apply to your own life.	2005-06-21

Written from a test pilot's perspective, this is the real story of an unusual man who was a magician with lots of money. Hughes was a true pioneeer in aviation, constantly on the newsreels. He had a fascination with planes, even those which could float on water.  There is a picture of the Hercules after it was brought of storage in 1980.    The pictures of so many airplanes brought the story so much better than words could do and Hughes contribution to the war effort.  He was truly the Aviator of all time, better then the celebrated Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.  I'm glad he had Bruce Burk at his side to aid in this quest.    After he changed TWA to TransWorld Airlines, he ran into conflict with PanAm president who told him in the Coconut Grove, where a lot of the personal interaction took place, that no airline should have a monopoly on international travel.     There were scandals with the women, though he appeared to enjoy touching planes more than women. He \\"interviewed\\" many young starlets under contract to him. He was clear at the end that aviation was the great love of his life. He was dubbed as capricious and eccentric, but mainly he was afraid of people -- paranoid, thinking there were spies in his midst to learn his secrets.      If he loved any woman, it was Kate Hepburn who left him for Spencer Tracy, He visited her family in Conn. but felt alienated, and she tried to dominate him. He wanted to control Ava Gardner and asked her to marry him. Both women appeared in his delusion to prepare for the Senate hearing.  He was alo involved with Rita Hayworth and Terry Moore, who claimed to be his wife when he died. The senator accused him of producing a dirty movie and making airplanes which don't fly.     At the hearing, it was promoted that the whole world will see what he has become. The Hercules (later dubbed the Spruce Goose) became Howard's folly, the sixty-ton white elephant with a wing span the length of a football field. It was meant to fly 200 tons ofarmy equipment. When he successfully got that plane out of the water, it proved his ability to overcome his tarnished reputation. The senator charged Hughes with defrauding the government for accepting millions of dollars for spy planes he never delivered.    George Marrett wrote CHEATING DEATH: COMBAT AIR RESCUE IN VIETNAM AND LAOS in 2003.  This is the real story of Howard Hughes contribution to aviation, his first and last love.	2005-06-20

The feline has inspired poetic adoration since the days of the pharohs, (they were considered sacred in early Egypt) and the poems collected here cover an astounding range of periods, cultures, and styles.      Oscar Wilde's 'The Sphnix,' proves that theory:  \\"In a dim corner of my room for longer than any fancy thinks,  A beautiful and silent Sphnix has watched me through the shifting gloom.    In violate and immobile she does not rise, she does not stir  For silver moons are naught to her and naught to her suns that reel.  Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and all the while the curious cat  Lies crouching on the Chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold.    Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and put your head upon my knee!  And let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx!  And let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory, and grasp  The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round  your heavy velvet paws!    That is an example of the holy cat; here's an ordinary one:    A cat is not a person, you say, not a Christian --  I have seen many!  Playing with mice who sat on their tails squeaking out their protest,   Then let them go to die by themselves of shock  without wounds other than small claw-marks, little love bites.    I've had some great cats, starting with Kit Carson, on to Tosca, her daughter Ligeia, Fluffy, Comet, his daughter Star, and her mother, Little Bit.  All have had different personalities and were wonderful companions.  We had Tina who was a black-and-white boy cat who mysteriously disappeared, as apparently we had him confused about being called by a girl's name.  Then there was Bandy who saved a litter of kittens whose mother disappeared and was killed trying to find her way home to me.  Cats are faithful to their owners and look after them as much as the owners feed and care for them.  And they don't bark!    This little Everyman Pocket-sized book of poems should delight cat lovers everywhere with the unassailable superiority of the cat (loveable and otherwise).  Emily Fragos is the editor and she explains why she chose the poems in this volume.  It is a 'great' treasure.	2005-06-20

According to this expert on government and war, it is our duty to rebuild the countries we tear up in the process of war.  She says that Genereal George Marshall achieved the rebuilding of Europe after WWII, and General Douglas MacArthur did the same for post war Japan. <br /> <br />She feels that the military are used in place of civilian corps of aid workers -- a real peace corps -- to take charge of reconstruction in Afghanistan.  She goes on to tell how, after the German surrender, General Dwight Eisenhower charged U. S. peacekeepers with a set of duties similar to those issued by Lt. Col. Michael Ellerbe's troops in Kosovo. <br /> <br />Having access to all levels of the military, she goes to the countries involved, interviews locals plus our military men out in the field, and takes photos she uses liberally in this book.  She traveled to twenty countries on her mission to write this book. <br /> <br />Previously, she'd been the 'Washington Post's Pentagon expert; then she reported on the CIA.  She has received awards for her 'distinguished defense reporting.'  This book is in much detail on subjects of interest to her in particular but the American public have no inkling of and possibly would not agree that our money should be used in this manner when there are so many at home who are needy.  Have you ever seen so many homeless?  Perhaps, she could go from town to town and talk with these unfortunate misfits and then determine how the government could help them without bringing in the military.	2005-06-19

This book is about a Union soldier from Missouri who enlisted in August 1861 at the age of nineteen.  His Illinois company fought the Rebels at Stones River, Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  In fact, he spent two years of the war traversing this great state of Tennessee, though most was in the Middle section, where people are friendlier.  I know, because I lived there for most of my adult life.    In May, 1862, his group was traveling down the Tennessee River over a very rough countryside to Pittsburg Landing, and on to Corinth, Mississippi.  On September 1, they came back up through Florence, Alabama, Lawrenceburg, Spring Hill and Franklin to Murfreesboro on the way to Cumberland Gap.  On Sept. 7, in Nashville, he wrote \\"all the country from here to Lawrenceburg is as pretty as it can be.\\"  Walking at the rate of fifty miles a day, they found 60,000 troops there.    His brother, John, was killed early in October on the  battlefield at Perryville; \\"would I had died in his stead --- my only, my true and noble hearted brother,\\" he wrote to his mother.  He sent her a lock of John's hair, everything taken from his pockets but his \\"Testament.\\"    November 4 they were on their way back to Nashville from Kentucky.  Thirty miles to the SE there were 100,000 Confederates at Murfreesboro waiting for them on December 2.  From January 10-25, 1863, it was rainy but \\"warm as May\\" at their camp east of Murfreesboro.  \\"The enemy reinforced is reported at Shelbyville 22 miles away.\\"    In Franklin, just outside Nashville, \\"This is the prettiest country I ever saw...the few people who are left are very friendly and of refined manners.\\"  On June 30, they were in Manchester, 13 miles from Tullahoma and July 12 found them in Winchester, \\"no pen, let alone mine, can describe the horrors of civil war.\\"    He had no high regard for the Southern men and called them names, but \\"the people are sociable and intelligent and very obliging to the soldiers...the town is healthy and beautifully situated.\\"On August 8, he wrote, \\"The Dixie gals are awful nice, and it is very pleasant to be here.\\"    He was wounded in the Battle at Murfreesboro on Sept. 27, 1863.  His arm healed properly and by March 3, 1864, they were in East Tennessee.  March 3, 1864, they were in Newmarket, 40 miles north of Knoxville and on the 25th in Strawberry Plains only 20 miles from town.  However, they bypassed us and, from April 16 to May 31, his company was in Cleveland, TN south of Knoxville, 30 miles east of Chattanooga.  His last letter was written on June 8 and he was discharged Sept. 5, 1864, with the rank of Corporal.    This was the story of Benjamin \\"Webb\\" Baker, based on ninety letters to his mother, grandfather, Uncle Adams, Cousin Louisa, Cousin Amos, and his brother, John.  It is written by his great grandson, Benson Bobrick who also used family papers of his late grandfather, James Chamberlain Baker --  which means that Webb got home safely and married, thus a son to look after the legacy of war as he experienced it.	2005-06-18

This is a beautiful book full of color photos of people and places.  Humans first entered America when it was joined to Asia by an Ice Age land bridge over what is known now as the Bering Strait, perhaps as long as 40,000 years ago.    Machu Picchu \\"The Lost City In the Clouds\\" was discovered by Hiram Bingham who wrote the book LOST CITY OF THE INCAS in 1981 which I read and marveled at the importance of such a place.  It was a remote mountain retreat in Peru and was one of the Incas' most sacred sites.  It is on a mountain top, built by P. I. Yupauqui and served as the royal estate for his descendants until it was abandoned shortly before the Spaniards arrived.  It contained three ritual locations, \\"Hitching Post of the Sun,\\" Temple of Three Windows, and the Sun Temple, used for astronomical observations.  It was noted for having its own spring-water system.  Peru has its own Stonehenge nearby.    The South American pyramid-temples were more spectacular than those in Egypt.  The Pyramid of the Sun is rounded on top to mimic the surrounding mountains.  The Pyramid of the Moon is surrounded by shorter structures as in the Valley of the Kings.    Shamans of the Indian tribes use spiritual techniques extending back to Palaeolithic times.  They may be healers, seers, or keepers of sacred knowledge.    Chacmooi is a giant reclinging figure used in temples.  Its legs are half bent and its head is turned to one side, with an open box on its abdomen to hold offerings.  It represents the Aztec gods of drinking and inebriation.    There is a good photo of fierce-looking Low Dog, a Sioux warrior who fought General Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876.    Some American Indian tribes are Hopi in Arizona and New Mexico, Pawnee in Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma, Passamaquoddy in Maine, Arikara in North Dakota, Arapaho in Wyoming and Colorado, Apache in New Mexico and Missouri, Blackfoot in Montana and Canada, Creek in Georgia and Alabama, Choctaw in Mississippi and Oklahoma, Comanche in the Rocky Mtns. and Mexico, and Cherokee in Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky.    This book is illustrated with over 500 color and some black-and-white pictures; there are more than 600 alphabetically arranged entries and is fully cross-referenced and comprehensively indexed.  It was printed in Singapore.	2005-06-18

Michael Shapiro explains why he is not ready to settle down after traveling to six states and three other countries to interview this group of his favorite travel writers:  \\"There's a fascinating world out there we've barely begun to explore.\\"  His dad has moved on to a better place, somewhere out there with my grandson, Tristan.  The cover showing his beautiful cat is homey with a sense of place; their feline could be the twin to Star.    I was attracted to this book because it included two of my favorites.  As much as I enjoyed Paul Theroux's three books about rail travel the one on a boat in China, I can't say that I liked his fiction, except for O-ZONE.  I must be the only reader who did as when I recommend it, no one else has heard of that one in particular.  His most famous was THE MOSQUITO COAST in which he lampooned his native U.S.A.  I was disappointed in his saying that he had set out to fool his readers with MY OTHER LIFE and MY SECRET HISTORY by striving to tell flat-out lies and no truth whatsoever.  He sounds like a pompous ass.  Though I did receive a postcard from him back in the '80s.  His latest is DARK STAR SAFARI (2003).    I wrote to Bill Bryson in 1998 after readng A WALK IN THE WOODS to comment on his Appalachian walk to Knoxville, my hometown, but skipped the Smokies.  I recommended he try the NATCHEZ TRACE in Middle Tennessee.  He wrote back a thanks, saying he was embarking on the Australian trip.  Since then, I've owned A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING which I gave to a friend for Christmas last year and MOTHER TONGUE I kept for myself (as I like words).      I feel bad that now he's made a bundle off us Americans he will leave our country again.  I feel that both he and Paul Theroux are fickle Americans and perhaps should never have left England to come back here.  Who wrote \\"You can't go home again?\\"  They proved it.    Shapiro has written three books about Internet Travel Planner and has a web site, NetTravel.com.  He helped to develop Global Network Navigator for the O'Reilly & Associates group, won a 1998 Lowell Thomas (the ultimate traveler) award for an investigation into frequent-flier programs, and has made bicycle journeys across United States and through Cuba.  He'd feel right at home in Knoxville, where some people ride their bikes to work.	2005-06-17

On September 11, 1985, Pete Rose reached his height when he broke Ty Cobb's record for career hits and earned a red Corvette with a license plate PR4192.  A few years later, in 1989, he reached a low seldom experienced by a famous person.  A few have served time in prison, and Pete had his turn.    According to the book jacket, he \\"holds more major league baseball records than any other player in history.\\"  He played for the Cincinnati Reds and went on to end with 4,256 before losing everything on his hobby, gambling.    His team played in Riverfront Stadium where I saw a game in June, 1959, on my honeymoon.  Instead of watching the game, I had a good time watching a bunch of drunks enjoying the game.  I'm not a sports nut, so this review will be objective.  One thing, though, he called Clyde Wright, pitcher of the Angels in 1970, a \\"big farm boy from Tennessee\\" so I will remind him that Alvin York was described as such at one time, also.    His father, Harry, had played semi-pro football for twenty-three years.  In 1947, when Pete was only six, he was the team waterboy for his dad's team.  Pete himself accomplished a twenty-four year career in baseball, though his interest went back a good deal farther.    In 1993, he earned $40,000 for a four-day appearance in Cooperstown, New York, signing autographs for customer's at Mickey's Place, a Mickey Mantle (my favorite ball player) museum store at the time of the Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.  His best remembrance of that long weekend was \\"visiting with\\" Babe Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, then 76 years old there for a book signing.      He says that all the players accepted cash for autograph signings, just as he did.  But it wasn't the gambling which put him behind prison bars; it was the income tax evasion as he didn't list all the cash payments he received.  He was put through the mill in 1989.  The \\"never back down from a fight\\" attitude I got from my mom...and the perfectionist work ethic I got from my dad served me...well on the baseball field.\\"  Pretty good for an Ohio boy who didn't finish the tenth grade.    He didn't have it easy in prison: \\"they could take my freedom but...they weren't gonna take my dignity.\\"   On January 7, 1991, he walked out of the federal prison in Marion \\"a free man\\" after serving five months.  \\"I paid an enormous price for my mistakes.  They caused a great deal of misery in my life.\\"  The last fifteen years has been his 'prison without bars' by being banned from baseball.  He was born April 14, 1941, and this book was finished on his 62nd birthday.    Rick Hill is a writer (of the screenplay 'The Long Shot' based on the life of baseball star Jim Eisenreich), director and actor in Hollywood for 20 years.

This would make a perfect addition to every middle school library as the history in letters and pictures is simply spectacular.  It is a lovely book about three girls and their families during a devastating time of war abroad and the Haloucast.  One girl is famous because of the diary, given to her on her thirteenth birthday, a red plaid, on June 12, 1942, which survived long after she died in a concentration camp. <br /> <br />I became interested in Annelies Marie Frank in 1956 when a call went out all over the United States for a look-alike to portray her in the movie.  They wanted an unknown, so (foolish me) sent in my picture full lenght with shorts and barefoot.  Though I looked something like  her in the face, I guess they didn't want a 'Southern' accent on a Dutch girl.  Millie Perkins, a model, won out over all of us commoners, though I did receive a letter from Twentieth Century Fox -- don't remember who signed it.  I got rid of all my movie memorbilia twenty years ago.  Lots of movie posters given to me by an usher at the Tennessee Theater and autographed glossy 8X10s ended up in the garbage can! <br /> <br />The 1959 movie won three Oscars.  By then, I was a married woman.  I did have a penpal in Sabadell, Spain outside of Barcelona, though he was an older factory worker, not a young girl. <br /> <br />Two Iowa sisters, Betty and Juanita, in Danville were given Anne's address in Amsterdam by a teacher.  My picture was in Your Hit Parade magazine and Carlos' borther saw it and wrote to me first, to Kingsville, Texas, but it found its way back to Knoxville, Tennessee!  Amazing.  Now you can't get a Priority Mail to a few miles, from one post office in town to someone who works in downtown. <br /> <br />Anne attended a Montessori school in 1941 and led a privileged life.  We in America did not live so well.  Her diary was published in Dutch as THE ANNEX in 1947, and in English, THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK in 1952. <br /> <br />This book in textbook binding was published in association with the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, California.  It is a keepsake for any girl  (or woman who lived through those times).	2005-06-16

Gus tries to resume his old life after serving in the Marines during WWII.  In May of 1946, he is again a policeman and is bribed to get involved in an unground lottery which the gangsters control. <br /> <br />Like the law during those days, he visits the brothels and recruits for them.  Who else but the police could entice young women into a life of crime?  It happened here in Knoxville in the Fifties.   <br /> <br />Gus is a  hard drinker at his neighborhood bar, just two blocks from where he lives on the South Side, where the seedy side of life converges after dark.  Drinking too much makes an old man in a young man's body.  He just couldn't leave his past behind.  His apartment was the typical for that area, and, in May, he wears a trench coat over his suit, as it is 50 degrees in the night air.   <br /> <br />This story is full of corrupt politics, senseless murders and a sordid life style.  Gus was responsible for many of the deaths, and has to relocate to Kansas City with 'a price on his head.'  The former Marine had not settled into his old life.  It's true that you can't go home again. <br /> <br />As he left it all behind, his thoughts were on growing up without a mother.  Join the Club!  It's tough.  Steve tells a believable story some of which we saw in the old crime movies, of the ugly '40s.  His debut novel, '57 CHICAGO, was published in 2000.  He has a way with dialogue and is a former sports writer in his native Chicago -- my kind of town!	2005-06-15

Written by a formre newspaper reporter in Tennessee who, after graduating from Harvard Law School, settled in New York City.  This is like a female prototype of THE FIRM only instead of enticing a bright law grad to Memphis, she is encompassed in a high-powered Manhattan firm.    She feels honored to be chosen as an associate attorney of such a prestigious group.  Her first assignment is to a controversial case of sexual harassment(quite over the head for a novice, young lawyer, no matter how bright she is).  Her glamorous senior partner receives a mysterious e-mail luring her to an equivocal death.  Or is it?    Kate has to go on the defense trying to figure out who did the old girl in, as many suspects surface.  There may be two or more meanings to 'equivocal death,' homicide, accident, suicide or natural death.  It could be any of her colleagues or, could it be the hairdressser?  You must read to see how things end in just a few weeks.    Kate decides to move on with her life as these seedy cases are not what she was trained for at Harvard to face and to endure such harsh treatment.    This is a riveting crime story on a high level.  No one is immune from murderous urges and the need for revenge, but most of us are sane enough not to follow through.  This is a first novel, which got my attention.  Since then, she has written IDENTITY IN DEMOCRACY and THE ANNIVERSARY.	2005-06-15

The writer admits that he has been interested in Buffalo Bill Cody and his fame for sixty years, since at the age of eight, when he heard his uncles talking about seeing the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show at the 101 Ranch.  At that time, he was an old man and all he did was ride his white horse around the arena and wave at folks.  We have a cowboy 'wannabe' Marshall Andy who hosts public t.v. cowboy movies on Saturdays and in the promo to his show he rides his horse dressed to the hilt, reminds his viewers to wear a white hat 'so we'll know you from the bad guys.'    Buffalo Bill was a frontiersman for sure with his dark long hair, facial hair, and limpid brown eyes.  He had different costumes to match the feat he was perfoming in his Stetson hats and buckskin.  Later he adopted a Colonel's uniform with his cowboy hat and sweeping white hair.    He married a religious woman in 1865, Louisa (who looked like Elsie Davis, another religious woman, in her elder years).  They had a strange home life but stayed married for 51 years and were divorced in 1905.    Major John Burke, also kept his hair long, was the press agent of the Wild West Show.  The colonel was an assumed rank, as the highest he got in his meager military action was brigadier general.  He rode for the Pony Express from 1859-1861.  His idol was Kit Carson, after whom he named his son, and James Butler Hickok (Wild Bill) was considered a friend.    The middle of the book gives some history of the Sherman and Custer fiascos after the Civil War and about Indians on the warpath (like we saw in cowboy movies of the Fifties).  Ten years after the Civil War ended, the military men were out West pursuing the Indians.  Matthew Brady was there taking everybody's pictures as he did in the East during the War.    Cody named his Springfield buffalo rifle, 'Lucretia Borgia,' and let the Grand Duke Alexis use it.  He watched as some Indians 'entertained' the Duke.  His last forty years were in show biz for himself.  He wasalways having 'final performances.'  For many years, he hired real Indians.  The Wild West was a crudely put together 'pageant of American life and the settling of the West.'  His last show was the 1916 Chicago appearance which was more like a rodeo.  He became a national celbrity, always with a 'sense of image.'    Annie Oakley performed her marksmanship in his show for sixteen years.  She could shoot behind herself with the help of a mirror.  She was not outgoing or beautiful, but became one of the most famous women on earth.  In 'Annie Get Your Gun,' she was played by a tomboy-ish Doris Day who was loved by Howard Keel as Wild Bill Hickok, though she was officiallly the wife of Frank Butler.    At Buffalo Bill's funeral in 1917, six old girlfriends appeared to pay their respects.  Louise had the last word with her book, MEMORIES OF BUFFALO BILL, but she died three years later.  Annie died in 1926.  The end of a grand show biz era, Western style.	2005-06-14

This book states that Hollywood started as a \\"Christian\\" settlement in the early 1900s.  It has fallen in stature and has a reputation of Sodom and Gammorah instead of a Godly place.  No true religious nature has been reflected in television shows or movies.  Wonder why.  One quote I found may state it all:  \\"In Hollywood, self is on the throne.  The culture of Hollywood encourages it.\\"  Being a Christian isn't 'hip' in Hollywood.    As I looked at each entry, I was amazed that most of the stars use their own names.  It wasn't like that in the past.  Two in particular who didn't were Charlton Heston (birth name: John Charles Carter) and Kirk Douglas (Issur Danielovitch Demsky).   Most of these he chose were not my favorite stars, so I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to those not familiar; when he quoted George Clooney, I could identify (though I am closer to Nick's age), then I saw that Mr. Comfort had included a good sermon on George's comment.    He used quotes for Walt Disney who died in 1966; Charlie Chaplin (1977), John Wayne (1979) and Orson Welles (1985).  These amazed me even more than the false names.  He quotes Eddie Fisher's daughter Carrie saying her dad is happy because of his faith -- he is Jewish.  I hope he is happy now.     George Nader, one of my favorite actors, always the gentleman, is dead, but I know he was a good Christian.  I think, too, that Bing Crosby believed in God.  How could he not after portraying a priest in all those movies?    He named presidents who had a deep faith in God, but he omitted Lincoln, the most ethical we've ever had.  The only one connected in any way was Reagan.  He should have quoted Nancy.      At the end, he interviewed Jesus of Nazareth.  Now, that is a feat unworldly.  He had the most to say, as he is the son of God!  But I've always had a problem with a 'virgin birth.'  There can be no such thing.  And I do believe in God, but he is a personal God.  I don't ask for material things like some devoted Christians I knew in 1980 (and behold! they were given what they asked for, with one exception).  I thank God for the people I love, and I pray for them to be safe and happy.      Some churches are an abomination and treat their members cruelly.  I won't name names, but they know who they are.  I was christened a Methodist as a baby, grew up Baptist, and returned to the Methodist as they are not emotional and use ritual.  I don't believe in emotion in religion.  I've always loved and admired the Jewish people.    Ray Comfort has written many other religious books, and some not so religious.  He is the co-host of a t.v. show out in L.A.	2005-06-14

Rigel was born a sailor; both parents were involved in the boat-building business in Nova Scotia.  A family friend trained him as a boy, got him a job as cabin boy on the 'Ernestine' when he was twelve with Dan Moreland, captain.  Years later, as a college student, the 'Picton Castle' would beckon to him with the same captain, now owner: a combination of Tom Sawyer and Darth Vader.      They were scheduled to leave on November 1, 1997 but were twenty-five days behind as they set out on the maiden world circumnavigation voyage from Nova Scotia, Canada.  With a carefully-chosen crew, thirty paying $32,500 each to cover 37,000 miles from Nov. 27 to June 23, 1998, 47 ports in 22 countries and two glorious weeks in the Caribbean.  Several were women.    They became more like a family than a hard-working crew from the experiences endured through rough seas and long days.  Six of the crew later married.  \\"Though memories have faded, bonds remain strong.\\"    He adopted Maggie the cat and has lived in Savannah, Georgia, since 2001, after serving as a relief captain on a cruise boat out of Tampa, Florida.

This is a running diary of a strange life after graduation from Sarah Lawrence College when deciding to become a writer by enrolling in Iowa Writers' Workship in the mid '80s.  She had a Catholic education (like my nephews) all twelve years before going off to school.  A fellow classmate had made an impression on her, though was less than friendly, because of a facial deformity which had crippled her life.    Lucy was a year older than Ann, but she needed a place to belong, somewhere she could be expressive and not be looked on as an oddity.  After they were settled as roommates in Iowa, they became best friends.    In Nashville, Ann met Dr. Karl V. and Lucy liked him as well.  Lucy wasn't exactly normal, taking heroin which caused her death of an overdose a week before Christmas, 2002.  The reason she continues to see Lucy's 'spirit' in odd places is the nonchalant way she treated her when she asked if she could spend Christmas with her -- Lucy felt rejected!  And probably knew that Ann had turned her back on her friend to be in Atlanta with Karl.  After so many years together, she should have been invited along, but that's 'hind-sight.'    She tells so much 'truth' in this book you wish sometimes she would be more discreet, for a Southern girl -- but the 'beauty' (if there is any) is on the inside, and not from a bar of soap at all.  Smooth skin means nothing when your face is deformed.  Having to face that truth turns one bitter with no hope for a happy future. The mirror does not lie, I've found to my despair. This is not a happy story, and some of the intimate details would have been better left unsaid.    Ann Patchett wrote THE MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT and BEL CANTO previously.	2005-06-13

In the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., there is a portrait of John Fitch, identified as \\"Steamboat Inventor,\\" of Delaware, in 1790 with his 'poor Johney Fitch.'  However, in 1783, Claude De Jouffroy constructed the first successful steamboat in France. <br /> <br />The 1978 THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE declares James Ramsey as 'the inventor of the steamboat'; in 1783 when he told George Washington of his plans.  In THE BIRTH OF THE STEAMBOAT, Philip Spratt declared the 'Charlotte Dundas' built by Alexander Hart in 1802 as the world's first practical steamboat, but it was really a tugboat. <br /> <br />Scottish poet Robert Burns aided in the design of the 'Edinburgh' by Patrick Miller.   In 1816 he build the steamboat, 'Charles-Phillippe.'   <br /> <br />In 1807, Robert Fulton demonstrated the first comercially successful steamboat on the Hudson River.  By 1824, there were fifteen steamboats running on the canals of America. <br /> <br />At the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition, on one side of the golden door of the Transportation Building these words were inscribed:  \\"Of all inventions, the alphabet and printing press alone excepted, the inventions which abridge distance have done the most for civilization.\\"  That's why we still have steamboats in various locations now in 2005. <br />	2005-06-13

Christian Crumlish (wonder if  that is his real name?) has been involved in web technology for ten years or more, so most of the technical stuff did not pertain to my small amount of knowledge of the Internet.  He used too many personal experiences throughout the book and tells how so many people responded to his inqueries and he listed their web sites free of charge and put in a plug for all of his endeavors.  He's really into the social scene online, though his To Briggs speaks louder than words. <br /> <br />There is too much about blogs and political sites.  All of that is in the past now, and it is time to move on to the next election and spend time developing something for us not so well-developed computer users.  He has written THE INTERNET FOR BUSY PEOPLE and THE INTERNET DICTIONARY.  In this book, he has a glossary but most of it is Latin to me, and an Index which was helpful. <br /> <br />Now, down to my level, e-mail still 'feels' relatively private, although that is generally an illusion.  I know that it is not exactly protected, but who would want to read through a stranger's communications with his friends?  That is an invasion of privacy in the worse scenario.  E-mail didn't catch on in a big way until there were nice graphical point-and-click interfaces and seamless Internet connections backing everything up.  I was trained (8 months of hard work, 5 days a week) in Computers and Word Processing, yet I was not prepared for the actual work I did as a Temp at factories.  It was all different and all interesting and was a joy to be able to use a computer for pay.  But, I have noticed at the public computers in libraries and free labs are full of homeless people sending e-mail, and some of the not-so-nice men looking at porn.  These people have no training even in typing, yet they are able to send and receive messages to people far away. <br /> <br />The fallacy of online communications is that so many use false identities.  On Dateline, an NBC reporter used several aliases (Justin Case, that type of foolishness) to film a scam, which seemed to me unethical, but the people who claimed to be wealthy and in need at the same time, needing cash which would be repaid in multiple times were as false as his monikers.  It is a shame that the web has come to this and a decent person is not safe.  I have a friend who does only email on Yahoo and she keeps having to change her address using initials instead of her real name.  That's sad! <br /> <br />The solitary writer of yesterday gives way to 'the power of many' on the Internet.  Me, I'm a loner; if I can't be a leader, I will influence politicians and important people one-on-one.	2005-06-12

This colorful book is full of beautiful illustrations and information about the various types of personalities.  Most of us tend to assume that everyone else responds to the world in much the same way as we do, and we're shocked when they don't.    This book shows how dramatically dissimilar people prove to be, and that you are not alone.  We are not fixed in space or time, and we are constantly changing.  We each have a unique individuality.    Ordinary people see no difference between men (Pascal).  Our outer image may not mirror who we are on the inside.  If we were misjudged as children, we build up armor and strategy to cope with the 'brand.'  Yet we must escape those bonds as adults, else we have a false sense of 'self.'  Self-esteem damage in childhood may make you semi-unsocial, but you should accept yourself as you are and never stop growing into the person you want to be.    You must reconstruct an inner picture of who you have become so that you can expand into wholeness, integrity, and health instead of becoming fragmented , contracting and in ill health.  A good outlook makes for good mental health and a happy disposition, and others will emulate your positive attitude.    If you take the different tests in this book , your whole individual personna will emerge, giving you a fuller and more accurate self-portrait of who you are now.  You will discover that your \\"weaknesses\\" are due to accidents of birth and situations outside your control.      You will gain a more realistic knowledge of your own abilities, strengths, and weakness, and give you knowledge of how other people interact and behave.  We all have imperfections.  There are differences between who you are, who you think you are, and who you have become!    This journey of self-discovery contains the road signs you need leading to your destination of realizing who the real you is and how worthy you are in the stratasphere of the universe.	2005-06-12

Jamaica Kincaid writes this memoir of her travels in Hong Kong, Nepal, and the Himalayan Mountains in October 2002.  Her fellow hikers were Dan Hinkley of European descent, living now in Seattle and Bleddyn & Sue Wynn-Jones from Wales.  They belong to a group of botanists who go on trips to gather seeds from plants to transplant after they return to their separate homes.  In 1998 she had been on a similar trek across southwestern China with Dan.    On this trip she was exhilerated by the lushness of the foliage, so like a paradise garden, but could not get used to the deceptive nearness of their destinations (so near and yet so far).  She was not accustomed to the vast difference between her expectation, perception, and reality -- the way things really are.    They faced some dangers along the way and some hardships, but the trip was long and winding up and down hills and they were exhausted by nightfall.  A tall waterfall was so ferocious it sounded like jet engines on an airplane.    It took a while to absorb all that she'd seen to put it into book form for the National Geographic.  They felt lucky to get back to civilization after the three-week long walk.  She took notes along the way and had her digitial camera with her to take relevant photos.  She grew up on an island in the Carribbean but now lives in Vermont where she has a continuing garden.	2005-06-12

Professor Anderson asserts that Dr. Dolittle might have been able to 'talk to animals' but they could not talk back.  I enjoyed Rex Harrison as the kindly animal doc in the Disney movie, and the song in particular.  He points out that it was Hugh Lofting's 'fictional' character who could communicate perhaps with all of his animal friends, but they, in turn, were unable to use intelligible language.    I've owned cats on a daily basis for more than twenty-five years now and they do talk to me.  They do understand English (I swear) and their meows mean something as well.  It's just that I don't know 'cat talk.'  It's not merely a response; when Star awakens from a dream, she runs to me with a whole string of meows to be soothed.  I explain that it was only a dream and she settles down right away.  It's all in the interpretations, usually they want your attention, food, or could be informing you that something may be wrong.  She lets me know when she hears an unusual sound.  And she minds me real well.    He discusses sign language as a way of communicating with gestures called 'signing,' that apes possibly use a similar way of getting what they need.  Frogs make their distinct noises, birds sing, bees buzz and 'dance.'  Some birds can talk and mimic humans, but I'm not sure they know what they're doing; it appears they are 'entertaining' to get people's attention.    Understanding of the minds of others emerges in human infancy.  Austistic children lack this ability of comprehension.  Language skills require interaction with early experience and the autistic child can not express his needs verbally.    Human language is indeed unique, but sometimes regional dialects get in the way.  There are so many foreigners in America today, they don't even try to speak English.  Why should they?  We all talk differently and can hardly understand each other.  I remember while growing up in Knoxville that I and my idol, Bob Lobertini (a t.v. personality), had trouble pronouncing the \\"L\\" sound.  We just left it out.  Recently at a dinner, I heard a grown woman call 'salmon' 'samon' and I commented on it.  Just because I moved away and learned to enunciate clearly instead of shy mumbling, the natives here assume I'm from \\"up North.\\"  I certainly don't sound like a New Yorker or Pennsylvanian, but I do talk differently -- as we all tend to speak the way we hear others talk, and it \\"rubs off\\" after awhile.    It takes intelligence to work through the ambiguities of phrases as units instead of words fitted together to form a sentence.  If you move a phrase, it can cause a different meaning to the whole thing, or can clear up any misunderstanding.  Many English expressions are ambiguous.  But so are the verbs in another language.  That's what trips me up.	2005-06-11

When I was a girl, my dad would take me to town on Saturdays and I'd see the cowboy movies at the three theaters near Market Square.  Later, when we were one of the first in our neighborhood to own a t.v. set, I'd watch Hopalong Cassidy, Lash LaRue (my favorite), Roy Rogers, Cisco Kid, Wild Bill Hitchcock, Kit Carson and the Lone Ranger (with Tonto).  Full of violence, ambushes, shootouts, and Indian skirmishes, they were a type of amusement all the kids enjoyed.    On t.v. Davy Crockett used a flintlock rifle he called Old Betsy and wore a coon skin hat.  'The Ballad of Davy Crockett' spent six months at the top of the 'Hit Parade' and I sang it on a local talent show.  Little boys loved to play cowboys.  There is a picture of a real one completely outfitted on the cover with his trusty gun.  For some reason, my sons weren't into the violence thing.      There are pictures intermingled throughout this book to demonstrate the text, not in a separate photo section.  There is a diagram of 'Tortures of Medieval Times.'  One of the most remarkable examples appeared in the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.  From May 27 to November 1, on 424 acres along Lake Michigan, (a friend of mine, Virginia Barnes, from a small town in Middle Tennessee, attended this gala exposition.) \\"A Century of Progress\\" contained an exhibit called 'The Torture Chamber' with a souvenir booklet.  This was touted as a modern marvel of mechancial engineering, complete with sound effects.  Located near a Freak show and a Midget Village of sixty small entertainers, it showed the debased state of contemporary American culture.  It also showed progress from real torture as entertainment to counterfeit cruelty on motorized dummies.    In the Middle Ages, daily life was steeped in grotesque forms of violence, public executions and animal torture.  Church paintings and stained glass windows showed martyred saints in gory detail.  There were 'miracle plays' about the apostles and mutilated Jews -- and religious drama about the 'Slaughter of the Innocents' showing infanticide to eliminate the Christ Child.  Scenes of baby slaughter and torture of women (St. Barbara) were subjects of religious plays.  They used illusion to portray the vivid torture.    Even Shakespeare's dramas were full of murder and mayhem, like 'Macbeth,' and 'King Lear,' called \\"revenge tragedy.\\"  'The Punch and Judy' shows in the 1800s showed family violence with corrupt political, social, and religious overtones.      One of my favorites, Poe, used violence and morbidity in most of his tales.  He was the master, slightly deranged.  Even the 'Crockett Almanac of 1839' showed illustrations graphic in their brutality to accompany tales written in a backwoods dialect.    Harold Schechter has written four books about serial killers, THE HUM-BUG, THE BOSOM SERPENT:FOLKLORE AND POPULAR ART, among many others.	2005-06-11

When you are depressed, you are not only unhappy, your will is weakened.  You are unable to act.  You have lost the 'good fight.'  Sadness is a confabulation of an evil side.  Sometimes it leads you astray, causing paralysis which results from sadness and depression.  This is manifested by our self-destructive side, our own personal internal enemy.  This book explains how to overcome the darkness to see the 'light.'    LIGHT means life, the ultimate awareness.  The tree of life corresponds in mystical imagery to \\"the One without end.\\"  The tree of good and evil corresponds to a world of multiplicity, division, corporeality, and tangible reality -- 'the world of action.'  The goal is to balance the two trees.  To balance our power to act, our self-assertion with the humility of being selfless, then we can perform wonders.    Rabbi Kushner of San Francisco and Rabbi Polen of Boston break down the Yiddish words into multiple meanings and interpret the Jewish liturgy so that even a Christian can appreciate their concentration on prayer, and each day being a renewal of life, a new beginning.  They have both written for the Jewish Lights, and Polen is the author of THE HOLY FIRE about Warsaw.  Both are professors of Jewish spirituality and thought.	2005-06-11

Written by a clinical psychologist from Baltimore, who teaches psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, he has come up with something new, a gene which will make many Americans \\"the most successful citizens in the world.\\"    Hypomanic describes many successful and hard-driving business people and inventors here in America.  It is different from manic-depressive as that means they have to suffer major depression on a regular basis in addition to their innate manic drive.  When you are hypermanic, everyone knows it, because they must suffer your arrogant, erratic behavior.  When you are depressed, quite often you suffer alone.    Hypomanics are brimming with energy, confidence, and big ideas.  They think, talk, move, and make decisions quickly.  They live on the edge, between normal and abnormal.  H.M. gives them an edge over the competition as they are highly motivated and over-achievers, more than a little impatient.  The paradox of H.M. edge is that it is a double-edged sword.    They are creative, with lots of ideas -- some clever and other ridiculous.  The ideas jump from topic to topic in a rapid, energized way, a sign of hypomanic.  Impulsive behavior and high-energy risk taker precludes their every action.  They feel they are fulfilling some kind of prophecy.    Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull was the hypomanic of birds, always striving to be the best, to do what the others could not do, fly higher and faster until at last he feels outcast and doesn't belong anywhere, until Maureen came to take him \\"home.\\"  He was a one-in-a-million who learned so fast to fly without limits.  He felt more alive and happy, with no one to tell him what he couldn't do, as he didn't like obstructions.  Chang taught him that the most important thing is love, forgiveness, and being yourself: free to go where we wish, inspire others to be individual.    Christopher Columbus was a messianic character who saw himself as a religious crusader.  He was a lucky fool who stumbled across America, claiming to have found China and the Garden of Eden.  You can't get more foolish than that, but it's precisely this type of person who goes where no man has gone before.  \\"If we want to keep human genius alive, we'll have to suffer fools gladly.\\"    Mr. Gartner includes an appendix, notes section, bibliography, and index to prove that the very idea of our craziness and success are based on genes and not insanity.	2005-06-09

As a young girl, I was warned that lecherous old men were \\"wolves on the prowl.\\"  After all, children read about Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf with big teeth.  These are only imaginary wolves not the real 'vicious' wild animals.    When the Europeans came to America, there was a goodly population of these creatures, hungry and ferocious as a tiger in a zoo.  Wolf legends preceded them and they were forced to migrate to the West because of rampant eradication in the North East.  Steeped in myth and symbols, they existed in folklore long before history connected them to humans.    Wolves were territorial and their haunting howls were not as predators but communication 'songs' warning rival groups in search of food to look elsewhere.  Wolves had their own reasons for 'singing' -- to prevent the forced eliminaton of each other.    Like the Indians and buffalo, they were forced off their native lands to the wild West to the point of extinction.  Exterminated in the rangelands and farming regions of the U. S., the species survived in the upper regions of Alaska and Canada, along the Great Lakes in the East.    Humans are vicious at the core, generating pain and suffering on each other and cause extreme violence to feel \\"big.\\"  People transported their hatred in stories and traditions,not their souls.  Humans tortured animals and showed all kinds of nasty behavior.  Euro-Americans killed wild animals and transformed habitats.  They espoused a climate of public opinion that mixes love, hate, and indifference with savage behavior.  Like the buffalo, they became an endangered species, yet they have survived.  Some of the Canadian wolves have been transplanted to Yellowstone National Park in Montana.    In the Smoky Mountains, we have the vicious black bears, as dangerous as any wolf who will actually kill humans who find themselves on the wrong hiking trail.  Will the uneducated hillfolk of this area decide to exterminate the bear population?  People in this large townat the base of the Smokies will spend all day at Cades Cove just to see a real deer.  In Middle Tennessee, we have Davy Crockett Park full of deer to enjoy.      But, no one can trust a wolf unless, of course, he is a caged animal in the zoo.  Humans are so insecure and must use guns not for protection but to feed their egoes.  The painting on the cover shows a group of Puritans huddling together as the big, bad wolf growls, the old woman with a red cloak and the man not aiming his rifle (just pointing at the dangerous predator), reflects how uninformed our ancestors really were and how naive.  He looks just like a wolf-hound.    Jon T. Colemen traveled the country, from New England to Utah, stopping in Denver along the way, for his research; this well-researched book began as a doctoral thesis at Yale University.  He teaches history at the  University of Notre Dame, and helps take care of his children (along with the laundry) as does my son, the astronomer.	2005-06-09

My first impresssion was what a shame to make a comic book out of Raymond Chandler's classic crime novels.  But, the more I got into it, I realized what a great idea -- as this novel beginning can educate a whole different audience, a new generation, those whose concentration allows them to read only this type of format in literature.      The hair styles of the women and short, wide ties of the men date the stories, making this new process appear old.   Just today, I told a tall man \\"I like your tie\\" which was wide, bright, and long.    Included are three stories featuring Philip Marlowe of Hollywood, California, GOLDFISH, TROUBLE IN MY BUSINESS, and THE PENCIL (by Helga Greene).  Marlowe represents the basic conflict of the human condition.  He works hard at his job, but is not always successful in his 'heroic quest for the truth.'    Chandler wrote: \\"as (a) detective, outside the story and above it, and always will be.\\"  He should have known -- he created this 'misogynistic' character.  In movies, Marlowe has been acted out by Humphrey Bogart, Dick Powell, and Robert Mitchum.    The creator, R. Chandler, was born in Chicago but educated in England.  His first Philip Marlowe novel, THE BIG SLEEP, was published in 1939.  He continued writing for twenty years in America until his death in 1959.    These were adapted to this format by Tom DeHaven, James Rose and Jerome Charyn for Byron Preiss Visual Publications.  I hope they will do more, as these are delightful.	2005-06-08

Brand names mark everything we use or wear.  The single most important element is the brand name.  Getting the right name isn't easy, and make a major difference in what sells and what doesn't.  A name embodies a company's reputation and its \\"goodwill.\\" <br /> <br />Names identify something or someone.  Names help us keep things and people straight.  We label children by their gender -- add an \\"a\\" to a man's name and Presto! the daughter matches her dad.  If I'd had a daughter, she would have been named after an Edgar Allen Poe symbol fot 'the most beautiful woman in the world.'  No girls, so had to name one of my cats, Ligeia.  Tosca, another cat, was named for a perfume, not the opera. <br /> <br />A clever daughter-in-law named her little girl Kaleena (aborigines for 'daughter,' she said.); I discovered another Kaleena here in Knoxville who admitted that her mother named her after a soap-opera character.  So much for cleverness!  I've heard of girls named Dakota, but now a bus rider here has named her son Dakota.  Could it be for the state of Dakota, or for a male soap opera character?  Most sons are named for their fathers, even II & III, instead of Junior; some are named after their mother's first love. <br /> <br />Brand names are products and services, while trade names are the companies who offer them.  Ordinary words began as branded products -- what is 'ordinary' usage varies from one country to another.  A trademark in the U. S. may not be one in England.  It's all in name recognition.	2005-06-08

To be a successful business, you must have a clear direction with the right people who have the abilities to do the job wholeheartedly.  Character is the ability to maintain monentum long after the mood has passed.  Creating a reason to rise above tough conditions is necessary.  Respect others and realize that there's a fine line between enough and too much accountability.  Mainly, you've got to get back to basics; the things which makes or breaks the company is the manager's ability to get everyone at every level following through and to show a good example.    Customers are fickle and will take advantage of the best offers and costs.  Chance plays a big part, as does inducement to switch and, as always, curiosity (wanting the best deal even if you have to go way cross town to get it) are important considerations of customers or clients' actions.  Disappointment in the product, services, or common courtesty on the part of the company they've trusted will drive them away.  Everyone can be replaced.    Recently, a store manager at Walgreen's repeatedly hurt my feelings at different trips to my neighborhood store, and was most unfair to a regular customer.  Did it do any good to go to the head office?  I doubt it, as the district over the local stores refused to listen.  When this happens, you lose business, prestige and other customers -- as interested bystanders viewed his tough and mean attitude and will no doubt go elsewhere.  Also, word-of-mouth publicity will cause that particular Walgreen's to get a bad reputation in this town where stores close as fast as they open, and gives the nationwide company a black eye.    A very important factor to consider is not to abuse the elderly customer (as there are lots of us out here) and someone who can't fight back.  Nobody will spend their money on a bully.  It goes way past disappointment.  He said some mean things but what he did (humiliate a regular, long-time customer in front of others) is abdominable.  To stoop so low became 'the straw that broke the camel's back.'    First, your product must be reliable.  If you fail to stick to your store's promises just as long as things are fine, but when they're not, you fall back on excuses, or accusations to get your point across and lose customers as a consequence, that's when a change should be made.      Customers don't \\"understand\\" being made a fool of in public, and they'd be crazy to come back for more abusive attitudes.  You can say that you're right until you're blue in the face, but you are definitely a failure at your job when you don't adhere to the adage, \\"Customers come first\\" to prove your point that you are 'in charge.'    If you do what what you say you're going to do to correct a situation (not turn the tables on the customer and put the blame on him), then you can be relied on to do the right thing.  The follow-through to make things right, just 'touching base,' are what makes a business person successful.  Otherwise, he's a failure representing that store, and should be replaced.  There is a vast difference between winners and losers in every phase of life but, in business, it makes or breaks the company's reputation in the long run if managers are allowed to run amok.	2005-06-07

This is an in-depth biography of a notorious person.  Other such bios by this author was PHOENIX (about Lucrezia's brother) and DISRAELI (a New York Times Notable Book of the Year).  Lucrezia was the 6th of nine children fathered by Rodrigo Borgia, from Southern Spain, who became Cardinal in 1456 and Pope Alexander 6th in 1492.  Was that when Columbus sailed the ocean blue?    Lucrezia was born on April 18, 1480, and married in 1493 to Giovanni, then to Alfonso who would not consummate the marriage, her last to another Alfonso, which whom she had five children.  Ippola who lived from 1509 to 1572 (became a Cardinal), Eleonara became the Abbess of Corpus Domini, Ferrara; two of her sons became Dukes, another a Marquis.  Her mother was Vannozza Cattenai.    Her father, the Pope, led an immoral life and used her as the victim of his shifting patterns of alliances.  She spend most of her married life from 1502 in Ferrara, which was known as the moated castle.   Her last husband was the Duke of Ferrera and she the Duchess.  She seemed to prefer poets and noblemen as lovers.    The Pope was poisoned and had a grotesque burial in a coffin too short and too narrow.  As a Borgia, Lucrezia was resilient and could not show grief for the father she had loved.  Such political intrigue followed his death, but she could be as scheming as her mother and utterly indifferent to sexual morality (her father's heritage).  She had ambition and power.    There was rampant superstition at the time of the Renaissance with unscrupulous power grabs.  Things were corrupt in the surroundings in which Lucrezia found herself and in the church hierarchy.  She died in 1519.    Ms. Bradford, wife of the Viscount Bengar in London, has published two other accounts of the Borgia family.  In this one, she used letters to substantiate Lucrezia's affairs of the heart and of state.  She has also written bios of Jackie Kennedy, Princess Grace of Monaco, George VI, and Elizabeth (the Queen).	2005-06-06

There was no such thing as religious freedom in the 1770s unless you were a Quaker, Methodist, or Presbyterian.  Robert Carter had joined the Baptist church because his slaves had found religion \\"within its doors.\\"  It seemed like he 'forced' religion on his vast number of 'property' and was a stern but humane master.      Though he was a Baptist, he spent some time with Francis Asbury, the British minister and anti-slavery activist, in 1785.  He had become dissatisfied with the established churches because the Baptist preachers were whipped, jailed for months at a time, and grossly mistreated.    In 1782, the new House of Delegates had passed \\"An Act to Authorize the Manumission of Slaves,' the most liberal anti-slavery bill in its history, allowing private slaveholders to liberate their slaves without special permission.  It took nine more years of pro-active and self-defeating arguments for him to emancipate 442 slaves.  His \\"Deed of Gift\\" described a transfer of property.  He left a list of handwritten names of 452 slaves of color to be freed.  He did not leave a written account of why he felt this had to be, but as a result was excluded from his famous neighbors and became considered an outcast and 'forgotten' until now.    He freed his slaves during the 1790s and 1800s, a period when white Virginians sought to \\"contain the flow of emancipations, and to redefine a large free black population as a threat to social order.\\"  They considered this as a 'civic sin.'  Fifty years ago proved them right.    Between 1782 and 1861, the slaveowners of Virginia freed more than one hundred thousand slaves whereas the Northern states liberated only sixty thousand.  Maybe that's all they had?    It was on Robert Carter's Bull Run Tract of land in Prince William County, Virginia, where the Civil War began.  On July 21, 1861, the first Battle of Bull Run marked the onset of conflict between the Confederate states and Union armies.  As a result of the Civil War consequences of the assassination of Lincoln and the Jim Crow laws, the KKK was formed to protect the Southerners (black and white) from the Northern carpetbaggers who clambored to the South to take whatever they could get.    Carter was considreed eccentric and lost status as a minor 'founding father' because of politics and religion.  That's why we have separation of church and state in today's political scheme.  Baptists were too zealous, and religious fervor was not looked upon as being exemplary.  After he left the Baptist profession, he was described as having an 'unstable' disposition.  It seems he could not please anyone.    He is the 'forgotten' patriot for having the courage to stand up and act on what he believed was right.  Some of those who have monuments all over the place were slave owners, too, and yet they were vilified as saints.	2005-06-06

Dr. Lee (PhD) is a native of Taiwan, which he left to come to school in America in 1963.  While at Texas A&M, he rode Greyhound buses across the country and observed \\"that America is a very complicated place, with lots of contrasts and many different kinds of people.\\"    He became a U. S. citizen in 1974 and arrived in Los Alamos in 1978.  Los Alamos was a 'secret town' near Santa Fe (like Oak Ridge a few miles from Knoxville, Tennessee).  At the time of the Rosenberg trial, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller were involved in the workings at Los Alalmos.  It was a secluded area of natural beauty with only one way to get in and out.  There was a cloak of secrecy surrounding the place.      This is where the Rosenbergs (actually Ethel's husband and brother) were charged with stealing the blueprints for the bomb.  This is where the Manhattan Project was developed.  J. Robert Oppenhiemer, a friend of Einstein at Princeton, was the lab's first director at Los Alamos, a settlement of 12,000 residents almost all of whom work on classified information concerning the atom bomb.    By 1980, he felt that his wife and two children had reached the American dream when he purchased a brand-new house.  By 1999, his 'American dream' was shattered when he was charged of espionage -- after working there for almost twenty years. After 1989, American nuclear secrets were declassified , and anyone could get access to the documents.    In December he was confined to jail for nine months where he was mistreated because he is Asian.  Now an American citizen, he hoped for vindication -- but was kept away from his family based on false accusations and wihtout factual justification.  Two other books about Dr. Lee are KINDRED SPIRIT (his codename) by Notra Trelock, and CONVENIENT SPY by Dan Stober.    This book is all about the abuses our government's power allows to harass well-educated and trained foreign-looking employees of National Laboratories, because of the secrecy surrounding their purposein being.	2005-06-04

With the Jewish ban on idolatry, there are no people -- only things and places in pictures.  That's strange, as my photos are full of views, beautiful or unusual scenes and things of the past, but very few people.  In the Bible, there are prophets in abundance, but in the New Testament, the pictures are most always a glorified Jesus and his apostles.  A messiah is less a person than an idea, a hope, and the yearning for the world to have a happy ending.    Thomas Carlyle, a pious Scottish Presbyterian, who died in 1881, wrote that hero worship is a human condition that \\"cannot cease till man himself ceases.\\"  I've had many heroes in my time.  One of them is listed below.    A hero is someone we admire for who he is, but not so much because he is someone special to us when we need someone to love, a person who can take the place of a busy family, someone you don't come home to and have to listen to their complaints.  A hero is perfect, he's an image we conjure up in our minds as being the person we would like to be.    Lincoln was shot five days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox on Good Friday; Booth was a crazed hero-worshipper and had to die for his mistake.  Each era in America has its hero.  Charles Lindbergh in 1927 because he did what no one else had done.  General MacArthur in WWII because of his determination and defiance to do what his heart dictated.  A Civil War hero, Abner Doubleday, was dubbed \\"father of baseball\\" after his death.    We all know that politicians say one thing behind closed doors and another in public.  Movie stars and pop singers were \\"images\\" created for a purpose, to give us an imaginary world to enter in the theaters.  The superheroes of the comics were Jewish American creations.    All of this history to establish his hero-worship for a ball player because of his will to win, mainly the will to survive.  His father had been a newspaperman.  He became a writer, thus subconsciously was emulating his dead father who was the real hero in his mind.  A Mother is a Mother is a Mother...how can she be a hero?  This book is \\"especially for those who read about others to find the truth in themselves.\\"	2005-06-04

First, he wrote a prize winning memoir of his father, MY FATHER'S HOUSE, in between, he published four books about Abraham Lincoln and one about P. T. Barnum, until finally, he got around to his famous mother, THE DREAMING GAME.    It is based on a poem which Dorothy Kunhardt wrote at the age of twenty-three in January, 1925, about youthful imagination, dreaming of being in China.  Actually, she was in France when it reached fruition.  Throughout the years, she and her friend Kate corresponded and the letters were saved.      In her youth, she had a cat named Columbus.  Her father was extremely strict and expected too much from her.  To her sensitive feelings, she felt the lash of his tongue, with his harsh criticism, lecturing tone, unbending stiffness, materalistic, judgmental, opinionated, letters but considered him merely kindly but firm.  He was a noted poet and author, and she wrote children's books.    Her love letters from Phil, a football player at Harvard, are included in this volume.  They were married in April, 1926 and the author of this book was born on February 5, 1928.  Kate, the trusted friend, was married in 1929.    At her funeral service in December, 1979 after celebrating her 78th birthday, this son described her as having a clever, fanciful mind, noted for her talent for drama, her insatiable curiosity, her sharp, eccentric wit, her extraordinary scholarship, and her fierce, infectious capacity for love.  Late in life, after her husband died, she developed an addiction for codeine and alcohol.    The assortment of copies of the letters on the inside of the covers is delightful.  The pictures at the beginning of each chapter are interesting and tell a story all their own.	2005-06-02

These two doctors have written a great 'self-help' book of dealing with grief.  The pain of separation causes the person who's grieving to exist in an insular world of grief which has to be worked through in stages.    Suffering is a natural consequence of living in the real world today, and losing someone close makes it even worse.  These rare and special kinds of dreams associated with the grieving process can be healing (from the subconscious surfacing during one's sleep) but living through them can be a scary experience.  Two of mine came true.    The main types include 'visitation,' 'message,' 'reassurance,' 'trauma,' and 'faith.'  However, there is another which affected me last month when my grandson was killed in a car accident.  It was in the form of a premonition (called precognitive dreams), where you are made aware of an event before it actually occurs.  They are prophetic: first, Tristan's death,which I refused to believe, and then one about my bank account being emptied with a card.  It was but not exactly as the dream led me to believe it might happen, but it did anyway.    Have you experience deja vu, a feeling we have been in a certain place or experienced a certain event before; we have already 'been there' in a dream?  In your sleep, you lose the basic law of free will and the subconscious sometimes shows you what may happen so that maybe it could be prevented.  There are instances given in this book about how some actually saved the life of the person dreaming.    If you feel like God has deserted you, when something like an unexpected death happens, it can be acceptable to work things out by going to nature, art and music for consolation.  I've had to use all three lately.  Faith comes in many forms, and you need community support (which I lacked here at these apartments as the Baptist preacher assistant manager did not even say he was sorry, nor did he list the death for others to see).  Even the noted theologian, C. S. Lewis, questioned his faith in God when his first wife died (read the book A GRIEF OBSERVED), and a miracle came to him in the person of an American divorcee named Joy for which he wrote an ODE TO JOY.      \\"If we could only know 'for sure' that our loved ones continue to exist in a peaceful realm beyond this earthly one, then the pain of separation would be a lot more bearable.\\"  Message dreams are warnings we should all accept, as being from a loving God or the dearly departed.	2005-06-02

This book is a treasure in the fact that a man who has a young son (who should have been his grandson) at that age realizes that he may not be around to share all of these stories and this valuable insight to Dylan in person, and he put in print the things he would have told him (maybe) had he been a young father. The last twenty-five (27) years were a trial for him, as they were for me, as a divorced woman with a son the same age at the time of the divorce.  You feel that you've just got to be there to see that son grown, then get on with your life. <br /> <br />He is funny.  The Jewish jokes were okay, and the one he had Bobby Kennedy tell about the price of meat was okay, but this whole book is written in the joking way he thinks.  Serious times about lowering the flag to half-mast on the UCLA campus the day JFK was assassinated.  He was there when brother Bobby died and heard the shots.  He and Dylan's mother lived in an area of New York where they were able to watch the Twin Towers burn on 9-11.  This is history he passes down to his son in intimate terms. <br /> <br />He writes fondly \\"some of my best memories of my father are of him laughing while he and I watched TV.  We didn't go to movies much; most families didn't in the early '50s.\\"  My sister Evelyn took me to my first movie about that time (before she ran off and eloped, ending up spending the rest of her life up North) and I marveled at the beauty and splendor of Tennessee Theater.  I don't remember the movie, but I will never forget how I felt looking up at the mural on the interior dome.  In the middle and later Fifties, I went to many movies there and even sang in a local talent show on that stage.  It was no big deal. <br /> <br />As a film critic, he explains that movies are a fraud and goes into detail about how they are made.  But, those he chose for viewing with Dylan were a varied and motlely group, not my choices at all. He tells how old he was when he saw them and how he felt.  He dishes the dirt about some of the big movie stars.  The index is full of big names.  You think of one, he has met him or her and has a funny anecdote to share.  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I can understand why he would want to explain to his son what is happening and why.  Since he is such a funny man, I guess he would choose the Marx brothers' films.  I did enjoy Groucho on the t.v. game show! <br /> <br />Of course, he wants 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Honeymooners' to be available for Dylan to enjoy and share a few laughs.  His remembrance of live t.v. in Los Angeles, 'Time for Beanie,' brought back memories of 'Your Startime' hosted by Bob Lobertini for me as I was one of his regulars, and later he had a 'Popeye' show in Nashville where I took my sons.  He told them on the air that he and I had appeared on t.v. together in Knoxville; that was stretching it -- he was the star, I the adorer. <br /> <br />During the 1958 Winter/Spring, one of my best friends was the young Jewish usher, Joe Feldman, at the Tennessee Theater.  I had moved to the YWCA to finish high school and, that Easter, he took me to eat Easter dinner at the S&W Cafeteria on Gay Street.  I still have his senior picture from Young High School. <br /> <br />Dylan is a darling child and so much like Ken Young when he was younger.  I sincerely hope they will share many good times as he grows up -- and away.  That time will come before you know it.	2005-06-02

The Masons are international. <br /> <br />Brought here by the British before the American Revolution after it was formed in England in 1717, and called the Grand Lodge -- first in Philadelphia and later in Boston.  By the 20th century, the Masons were firmly established in America.  At one time, more than half of the members of this esteemed group in the world were in the United States of America.  The first American members were of two types: the philosophical intellectuals and gentlemen who came as a social club, similar to the British men's clubs. <br /> <br />They deny they are a religion, but strictly non-sectarian.  It is a male secret society which promotes and practices equality, solidarity and brotherhood.  Their God is called the 'Great Architect of the Universe.'  They ban political arguments in the lodges and enforced racial segregation. <br /> <br />Black lodges were formed and named after the first black member, Prince Hall.  Some prominent members of this group included Booker T. Washington, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Sugar Ray Robinson, Ty Cobb, Paul Whiteman, and Nat King Cole. <br /> <br />The Pop Music world was represented by Irving Berlin, George M. Cohan and John Phillip Sousa.  Cowboys included Kit Carson, Roy Rogers, and Buffalo Bill Cody.  In the film industry, Cecil B. DeMille led the movie group, with L. B. Meyer, David Griffith (who directed the 1915 movie. 'Birth of a Nation\\" which glorified the KKK), Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Audie Murphy, John Wayne, and Clark Gable. <br /> <br />John Paul Jones led the naval group (died in 1792 at age of 45) and Admiral Richard E. Byrd.  Early members were Ben Franklin, George Washington, Nathan Hale, Benedict Arnold, Paul Revere, John Hancock, James Madison, and James MOnroe. <br/> <br />The illustrous Edmund Burke, Winston Churchill, Frederick the Great, La Fayette, the six Ringling Brothers who brought us 'The Greatest Show on Earth', Dr. Karl A. Menninger, George M. Pullman, and David Sarnoff.   <br /> <br />Notable Americans include John Jacob Astor, J. C. Penney, Henry Ford, Melvin Jones (who formed the Lions Clubs), Charles Lindbergh, Dr. Charles H. Mayo, Norman Vincent Peale, J. Edgar Hoover, General Douglas MacArthur (my hero), John Glenn, William Jennings Bryan, and La Guardia, mayor of New York for 12 years. <br /> <br />Some Presidents of the United States who were Masons include Theodore & Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman, McKinley, and Gerald Ford.  Earl Warren and John Marshall were also Masons, as was Mozart. <br /> <br />The cover has the Tower of Babel which was reportedly built by the Freemasons.  Mr. Ridley has written (in additon to many biographies of important people) SECRET SOCIETIES, FRIENDS APART, and A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TUDOR AGE.  This books is well researched and most informative.  I recommend it highly.	2005-06-01

Barnum, owner of the circus advertised for 'all the uncivilized races in existence' in 1882 and R. A. Cunningham shipped nine original 'living curiosities' from Australia to San Francisco.  The oldest, Tambo (had a long beard), made it to Cleveland, Ohio, before he was the first to die.  Toby, the next oldest, did not reach London in 1884.    The seven survivors were billed as living cannibals at Barnum's Museum in 1860 and appeared at the Columbian World's Fair in Chicago in 1893 as 'an opening on the Plaisance.'  They had left North Queensland in 1883, an original group of uncivilized Aborigines on display for all the world to see.    There is a poster of Krao, called the 'missing link,' a living proof of Darwin's Theory to the Descent of Man, although she was a woman.  As they were transported around the world and put on show at fairs and shows, they were sometimes called 'wild men of Borneo,' Zulu warriors, Australian Bushmen, and Pigmy Earthmen.    In October, 1993, Tambo's mummified remains were found in the basement of a recently closed funeral home in Cleveland, prompting a funeral service in February 1994 which made the front page of the paper.  These poor souls were made into a Western Spectacle and put on display as sub-humans.    This book contains 85 illustrations and photographs of the two groups of Aborigines from Australia.  Previously, Ms. Poignant has had published OCEANIC AND AUSTRALIAN MYTHOLOGY, MYTHS OF MICRONESIA, MELANESIA, AUSTRALIA and DISCOVERY UNDER THE SOUTHERN CROSS.	2005-06-01

As we travel along the train line, we meet up with some odd and unusual people, all 'London Transports' in the literal sense.    She describes Londoners as weary, shabbily dressed in old raincoats, and in a hurry.  A young woman goes to a critical 'friend' to get assistance in obtaining an abortion.  Eve went to an office in much disarray to seek a job, and was not impressed with all the clutter, black venetian blinds on the one window, and a dead plant.    In another, she describes a fifty-yr-old woman with grey curls as an aging Harpo Marx.  Just wait until she reaches that age and she will realize that is not 'aging' at all.  You'd have to be at least eighty with that awful perm to even pretend to look like Harpo Marx.    Seems her Irish humor is hid in a lot of these low descriptions.  You'd think in twenty-two different stories, there would be a little sunshine and fun.  I was expecting an exciting trip across England with friendly companions.  Beware the subways in London; they are a major terrorist target.	2005-06-01

His house was built in a tree.  Here, the Ruhlmans give a detailed account of their acquisition of a 100-yr-old place in Cleveland and how their lives were changed drastically.   It is in a neighborhood meant for the city's elite, an aristocratic Anglo Village, but that was long ago.  Sounds like the Fort Sanders area here.    Chuck played 'This Old House' recorded by Rosemary Clooney about a worn out, tuckered out place and no one who has the time to fix the shingles.  The house on the cover of this book has shingles.  Unless there is a resident ghost, no old house is as good as a brand-new one.  Years ago, I tried to save Tennessee Hall in Pulaski, and my group of old-lady residents of the town were treated to a meal in the college president's exclusive dining room of the cafeteria.  The dean, a Methodist minister, told me, \\"You can't go home again\\"  -- everything changes.  I was going to prove him wrong by returning to my hometown 'to die' but I soon learned that he was right.  There is no going back.    The cost is too prohibitive to rehabilitate old, worn out houses and ancient downtown buildings.  The plumbing and wiring are antiquated, meant for a different era.  In Pulaski, a gazebo was built out of three tall antebellum columns (the 4th crumbled during demolition), all that is left of our historic Tennessee Hall.  It was my first residence as a college girl and later as wife of a teacher with two small sons when it was used as a boys dorm.  One student always whistled the song, 'Mrs. Robinson,' when he saw me.    Houses are like people, some age gracefully but others die in accidents (fire); a few have a variety of lives when a gullible rich family gets duped into renovation.  For some, owning a house means they have made it -- achieved what their parents did, but at what a price?  Others move constantly.  My dad was one of the movers and shakers, until his old age.  These past 25 years, so have I been unable to find a 'home' -- so I guess the lure of the open road can be an inherited instinct, like hyperthyroidism as a medical problem or osteoporosis handed down from grandmothers.    Houses give a sense of permanence which is an illusion.  On a local talk show, a volatile caller upset some folks by proclaiming that only land owners should be allowed to vote.   A house gives false protection from harm, but a castle had a moat to keep out intruders; burglars lurk right around the corner.  And you can't control who your neighbors are or how they conduct their personal lives or the company they entertain in their own homes.    Lincoln said that we are all created equal, but the poor suffer the indignities because of their social status or lack thereof, and the rich are selfish individuals and not all are happy.  A house does not make a home.  It is the people who live there and love there (sometimes born there) who make the place a home.  It is not rich furnishings or expensive ornaments.  It is contentment and being relaxed and eager to 'come home.'    All the Ruhlmans wanted was to possess a place of their own to call 'home' no matter the price, financially or emotionally.  He has written other books, about cooking, and numerous articles for 'Gourment' and 'Food Arts.'  He must be a master chef.	2005-05-31

Just who or what is Guerilla News Network?  It claims to be independent and alternative media.  Any news can be tampered with, just as photographs can.  There is no such thing as \\"true lies\\"; it's either one or the other!    The Center for Public Integrity founded in 1989 by a 'Sixty Minutes' producer, Charles Lewis, exposed the Clinton Administration's abuse of privilege by letting their 'friends' and major donors to his campaign spend the night at the White House, specifically in the \\"Lincoln Bedroom.\\"    Much of this book is about 9-11 and how the Bush Administration ignored the warnings, with George W. asking, \\" Was that 'our' planes?\\"   They inform the reader about the tainted election debaucle of 2000 (when Al Gore won) and the manipulation by eliminating targeted groups' votes by 'chads' in Florida of all places where a Bush is governor.   Now, rumors abound that this younger brother or First Lady Laura Bush will run against Hillary Clinton to become the next President of the United States.  How ludicrous!    They argue that the mainstream media has become disabled by a form of mass self-denial, keeping the American public from actually knowing what our nation represents to the world at large.  Today's TV news coverage was one such example.  The media prevents us from seeing who we really are and which interests our government serves.    I was attracted to this book because of the cover:  A 'One Deception' dollar bill with both Presidents' Bush (father and son). but who is that handsome fellow in the center with the mike underneath the heading, \\"Black Box Voting\\"?    The writers are not media per se.  The main one, Anthony Lappe has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University and an undergrad on politics from New York University.   Stephen Marshall is a co-founder of GNN.  Ian Inaba, producer of documentaries, graduated from Wharton School of Business and obtained an engineering degree from University of Pennsylvania.	2005-05-31

After writing GODEL MEETS EINSTEIN: TIME TRAVEL IN THE GODEL UNIVERSE in 1999 'for philisophers and educators', he was asked to do a companion book for average readers -- the public at large.  This is the result.    Both intellectuals had early successes in their fields, and failures in latter life because of their eccentricities.  Einstein, born in 1889, was known at Princeton as the \\"Jewish professor with a bohemian lifestyle and heavy German accent.\\"   His specialty in the field of science was the relativity theory and quantum mechanics.  Both believed in general relativity as opposed to special relativity.  Both believed that \\"time does not exist.\\"    Godel's chief 'boast' was the arithmetization of metamathematics -- a logician instead of a mathematician.  He believed in time travel, going back to other ages.  He was a philosopher of space and time.  \\"Einstein's work had not explained time, but explained it completely away.\\"    Both lived isolated, reclusive personal lives, though Godel had a wife, Adele.  Einstein had left his family in Germany.  The two scientists had worked together for fifteen years before an aorta aneurysm killed Einstein in 1955 at the age of 76.  J. Robert Offenheimer was an associate and is shown with them in the photo taken at Einstein's 70th birthday celebration, in which Godel stood tall.    Kurt Vonnegut wrote about them in his novel, MOTHER NIGHT, as \\"But what a two!\\"  They shared a scientific dignity which others envied.  Godel became paranoid and suffered clinical depression, slowly starving himself to death in 1978.  He loved math and did not want to be called a philosopher, as that had no respect.  He and Adele were from Vienna.    Palle Yourgrau is an associate professor of philosophy at Brandeis Univresity in Massachuetts.  Another book he wrote about Godel was THE DISAPPEARANCE OF TIME.	2005-05-31

Only recently while riding public transit, I heard two bus drivers discussing the 'fact' that Masons are devil worshipers.  This was my first encounter with that type of prejudice  and innocently spoke up to say \\"it is a secret society but in no way do they worship the devil.\\"  I talked about seeing them in the movie, 'National Treasure' (the treasure was found under a large New York church -- way in the dungeons -- which I found strange, and a graveyard did figure into the puzzle).    The freemasons organization was formed in London in 1717.  In America, it has had a rocky past because of miscreants who some way managed to infiltrate and give them a bad name.  A member of my extended family was a Mason.  He was not an ethical person, and a confirmed alcoholic, and I always wondered how he had pulled that coup to get into a prestigious group.  But, you can't blame a whole society which incoporates foreign countries on one individual.  I said to the drivers, \\"Many important people and United States Presidents have been known as Masons.\\"    Little did I know about all the controversy as expressed in this book from many sources and Baptists who have spread the rumor in print and on the Internet.  It's sad when superstition and immoral people bring about such potentially slanderous assertions.  The Southern Baptists will believe anything; they even use their preachers to tell from the pulpit who the congregation should vote for in national elections.  That is the opposite of 'separation of church and state.'  I said, \\"No one tells me how to vote.\\"    The Masons universal message is of brotherhood, relief, and truth.  It does not include religious beliefs.  The person I know who was iniated into that group was Methodist.  Reputations are tarnished by some unruly church activities and false rumors.  Until you know for sure you are hearing the truth and nothing but the truth, \\"consider the source.\\"    The Masonic Information Center is in Silver Springs, Maryland.  This book was written by two former Master Masons.  Art deHoyos, a technical writer of the Latter Day Saints persuation, attended Brigham Young University.  S. Brent Morris, a math teacher, attended Duke University and Johns Hopkins University.  They have included a concise index  of research materials used in the second volume.  DeHoyos has written THE CLOUD OF PREJUDICE and Morris, MASONIC PHILANTHROPIES; both have contributed articles to the cause.	2005-05-30

This was written not as a biography but as a project for the Penguin Lives Series by Ms. Huxtable who previously had published THE UNREAL AMERICA: ARCHITECTURE AND ILLUSION.  Being an architecture critic, you'd think she would have concentrated on his varied styles and master creations.  But she dishes the dirt about his personal life and that of this parents.<br /><br />He was born on June 8, 1867, in Wisconsin and named Frank Lincoln (after Abraham) Wright, later changed to Frank Lloyd Wright which was a maternal family name brought over to America from Wales in 1844.  He has been dead since April, 1959, and the Archives have been opened for perusual by 'scholars' so that his real life is becoming known for scandals instead of innovation.<br /><br />I was expecting a treatise about the complicated and varied buildings he designed.  Chicago is full of them, (as is California) a whole neighborhood in Oak Park on the North Side.  The week I stayed with my son when he was a student at the University of Chicago, we passed one near the campus and Jeff wanted me to go inside.  I didn't see anything unusual about it, but was assured that the interior held a host of beauty, and unique corners, mantles, etc.  He was never able to entice me to stop and go inside.  After all, there is so much to see in the Windy City and one week left me craving for more.<br /><br />Ms. Huxtable claims that his surface life was a creative act and manipulated facts  -- no truth whatsoever.  Instead of praising his talent and achievements with his architectural wonders, she dealt on his 'painful search for love (some of her \\"illusion\\"); he married more than once and suffered the destructive impulses, revenge, destruction and emotional ambivalence of his second wife.  The man had no peace.  Even with his trouble-filled personal life, he lived to be an old man.<br /><br />Why bring a big name master builder down to ordinary terms in which she wants to prove that his whole life (as presented) was a lie.  This writer believes in airing a celebrity's dirty linen.  It was his second wife whose crazy antics ruined his finances and almost his professional life.  In 1927, he had opened an office in Los Angeles and started designing his unconventional houses.  He was not only an innovator, but a hands-on builder as he dictated every detail.<br /><br />Russian immigrant Ayn Rand wrote THE FOUNTAINHEAD, which became a movie starring Gary Cooper, about an architect modeled on Frank Lloyd Wright.  He appeared to be an architectural Don Quixote.

This 17th Amelia Peabody mystery written by a special person, a writer of note, a grad of University of Chicago (Jeff's alma mater), an Egyptology expert, and the best investigative character to come out of literature after Arthur Conon Doyle's classics.   <br /> <br />This one is a more routine adventure with the whole family in Egypt in 1922 (meaning there will be many adventures yet to come).  Amelia and family, Emerson, Ramses' family including the four-yr.-old twins, are drawn into a dangerous quest to return a cursed statuette to its rightful tomb.  It is just up her alley! <br /> <br />In addition to the 17 A. P. mysteries, Ms. Peters, who lives in a haunted farmplace in Maryland, has written eighteen others.  I especially enjoyed THE LOVE TALKER, THE SEVENTH SINNER, DEVIL-MAY-CARE, and NIGHT TRAIN TO MEMPHIS. <br /> <br />The colorful surpent ornament in the front cover is magnificent, but what's with the blue eyes?  Egyptians have dark brown eyes.  She gives credit to Dennis Forbes for the Egyptological jokes. <br /> <br />Much fun and anticipation of this new Amelia Peabody, a liberated woman before her time.

Written by an admirer, he has only praise for her and accepts her gross eccentricities as being 'normal.'  Her autobiography simply entitled ME was published when she was 84, and Helenmae Cohen reviewed it in her inimitable ways.    After seeing her in the movie, 'The Phiadelphia Story,' I felt intimidated by her unfeminine ways (self-assuredness, stubborness, bossiness, arrogance) and Connecticut speech and vulgarity and lack of decorum (she saw nothing wrong with living with married men).    It was not until I saw the movie this year based on Howard Hughes, 'The Aviator,' did I know that she was from a prominent and cultured, educated family who made fun of Howard.  He truly loved her and needed her kind of woman instead of the starlets he used as a substitute.  She was too strong-willed to care since she could not control him.    By then, she had met Spencer Tracy, a married man, while still Hughes' paramour.  And so her presence in his life and her connections in the acting business made him a star.  She did not know that Spencer Tracy had been buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park -- she was forgetful in her old age.  He was still married and his wife had thought that the 27-yr. affair was only a rumor.    She compared her tomboy youth to Louisa May Alcott's behavior of a New England girl.  She played golf and men's sports and dressed like a man, long before other women started wearing pants.  Hers were the men's tailored type.    She quoted Robert Frost, \\"Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.\\"  She chose the family's summer home in Fenwich as her haven for 25 years until a ferocious storm swept it out to sea.      She was 75 yrs. old when Scott Berg entered her life and documented private conversations in which she recalled events of her life and shared her reflections.  There is a lot of movie gossip dispensed by Ms. Hepburn in her nonprudent way.    What these men saw in her besides dollar signs is Greek to me.  She left her estate for A. Scott Berg to handle.  She proved to be a foolish old woman to turn her entire estate over to a younger man.  She died almost two years ago on June 29, 2003.  Old women are foolish when it comes to men.    There are twelve photos on the inside and two on the cover at her summer cottage.  So like Kate to pose with Queen Anne's lace as she had always considered herself a queen to beat all.  And to Hell with anyone who thought differently.	2005-05-29

Of the twelve listed in this book, I'd pick Sinatra as being the most talented, not exactly the best person as he did have his problems off screen.  Not only was his singing 'perfect' but he proved he could act, even winning an Oscar for his co-starring role in 'From Here to Eternity,' which I saw in Atlanta, GA, in 1958.    Some of the others, like Clark Gable and Robert Taylor, were more handsome, but they could not sing.  And music is my thing.  Frank was much too skinny, but I loved him in 'Pal Joey.'    Mickey Rooney had talent galore but could not compete with John Gilbert or suave Peter Lawford in the 'looks' department.  He and Frank Sinatra did share an ex-wife, Ava Gardner.    Now, Elvis was a category all his own.  He was not handsome per se, but he made  up for it with his frenetic movements.  He sang, but that's about it.  He was no Pat Boone or Eddie Fisher, the tops in the Fifties.  His type of singing was like his looks and outrageous outfits, 'a thing of his own.'  He was 'different' from those who had gone before him.    Spencer Tracy would have been an 'unknown' if Katherine Hepburn had not hooked onto him.  He was rough around the edges.  After seeing the movie, 'Harvey,' I could not watch Jimmy Stewart films, as his voice (to me) wasn't 'manly.'  He was good in the Christmas movie, but...    Van Johnson was great in 'Brigadoon' but he was never a 'star', always the co-star.    In her previous book, THE GOLDEN GIRLS OF MGM, Joan Crawford had two memorable quips:  \\"If the man commits adultery he's (just) a rascal...\\" and \\"Women grow old, men become (look) distinguished.\\"  How true!    She also wrote LANA, after her daughter killed the mother's lover, GRACE KELLY'S MEN, MARILYN'S MEN, KINGS OF TRAGEDY, and a slew of other books about Hollywood celebrities, not considered as biography.	2005-05-28

I was educated by the chapter on Black Talk. Didn't know when I perused it that he has written more than one book on that very subject. But I learned enough in this one. Shocked and repulsed by their sexual slong and jazz (jive) talk, and how some of it was transferred to the white world through the hippies and rebels of the Sixties, Elvis Presley's songs, and the Beatles of Britain with their drug-related songs. Manson ordered his followers in California to kill innocent people as his drug-crazed mind used a Beatles' song for his dementia. <br /> <br />Black talk goes back to slave days, when they had to do double talk to fool their masters, and the spirituals with the double meaning and 'disguised messages.\\" They associated with African cults (their own vresion of KKK)in 'Steal Away' and preached 'liberation,' revolt (in 'Judgment Day'). His teaching of how they talk to their own peers is still the same today. They do it here on the public buses where most of the drivers are black (nowhere else could they get away with it!) -- they ignore completely white women with white hair as if they are not there. On the other hand, I have observed that if the elderly white woman is the only passenger, they are courteous and are able to communicate on a 'white' level until, that is, a black person gets on. They automatically revert back to Black talk, bad grammar, gossip about other blacks -- even drugs -- and personal happenings, as if theyare on the street. Blacks leave out verbs and use too many \\"that\\"s; his version of 'loud talking' was amusing as here they yell instead of talking.  <br />  <br />	2005-05-28

If that is possible, anything is. <br /> <br />When I was young and a singer on local television, my older cousin was using my name in the cafe where she worked in the old Market House; people were always asking if she was the one on t.v. even though we didn't look anything alike.  And, when a former boyfriend of my older sister needed a new companion, and I rebuffed him, he went to that same cousin who had parlayed my name many years ago. <br /> <br />None of  us are safe anywhere in this country.

I saw many (probably most ) of the Hitchcock's movies in which he always made a surprise appearance.  The best part of the occasion was trying to find him out in the crowd somewhere.  He always was a practical joker, even in the serious films he directed.  He had the most distinctive profile of anyone alive at that time (Twenties to the Seventies).    Now, he has been dead for twenty-five years and Ms. Chandler has released this comprehensive history -- why not earlier?  Why now?  For many years she talked with the big man himself, and later his wife, Alma and daughter Pat.  She also interviewed at least sixteen of the stars he used -- he always chose a blonde female co-star and the best looking males available.  Some were Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Henry Fonda, John Gielgud, Grace Kelly, Tippi Hendren, Kim Novak, Doris Day, and Janet Leigh.    Being a Britisher made him different for us young moviegoers, but we could overlook that English accent as it was just plain fun to find him right there in his own movies.  He told Ms. Chandler in one of their conversations, \\"I remember Ingrid Bergman coming up to me in a terrible state.  Worried, miserable, high-strung, romantic, idealistic, sensitive, emotional.\\"  She said, \\"There's something I must tell you about my part.  I don't feel it.  I can't find my motivation.\\"  \\"I said to her, 'Ingrid, fake it.  It's only a movie.\\"    Last spring that is what a young man told me when I had written a bad review of ANCHORMAN starring Will Ferrell which I hated -- \\"it's only a movie.\\"  But it did not make me like it any better.    Life today is like one of Hitchcock's advice.  We fake it.  If we worried about terrorism and instant demoliton from an atom bomb, we'd all be basket cases.  Just fake it, as he would say.    Some time ago, Ms. Chandler wrote THE ULTIMATE SEDUCTION in which she included an interview with Tennessee Williams.   Now, she is finishing a book about Bette Davis.  I haven't liked Bette Davis since she was the crazyone in 'What Happend to Baby Jane.'  And I hated that song, 'Bette Davises Eyes.\\"  You'd think she could chose someone more respected and more talented.	2005-05-26

This is a story about conflict.  In fact, it starts with the murders of a con man, Roland Jon Emr, and his son Roger (by a disgruntled employee, Robert Suggs) as they drove down Slauson Blvd. in Culver City, California.  It shows the sordidness of behind-the-scenes and drugs in the movie industry.    This is a true story based on facts (court records, police reports, personal interviews of more than one hundred possibly involved individuals).  The author is a grad of West Point, a talk show host on KMPC radio station in Los Angeles, and the film critic for 'Los Angeles Magazine.'    He admits to putting words in the mouths of some of the characters, and yet maintains \\"No scenes have been created from my imagination in order to achieve a novelistic effect.\\"  He tried to use personal accounts and tape recordings but used \\"...my own common sense before coming to my own 'educated' conclusion about the truth.\\"  Truth is a fallacy, as people see things differently but always think they are telling the truth.  There are many variations on the truth of any situation.  Most times, it is just opinion.  Talk show hosts invariably feel that their opinions are facts, the infinite truth.    Rumor was that the Emurs were killed over their production plans of a film about James Dean.  They were originally from New Jersey but found the con business more lucrative in Hollywood.  He aspired to be the next Sam Goldwyn in the movie business.    He felt that \\"once you control a man's dream, his soul would soon be yours.\\"  His death represented the \\"logical resolution to a life of deception and manipulation.\\"  Most of all, it represented \\"the lie of the pipe dream.\\"    A year and a half later, Suggs' remains were found out in the desert.  He'd been murdered by persons unknown.    Jon Emr, the con man, had \\"sullied the image of James Dean.  The image of Hollywood.\\"  Hollywood is not a real glitter city.  It's all \\"image.\\"  Los Angeles, on the other hand, is thriving in the movie business,but their air pollution is as bad as ours here at the foot of the real Smoky Mountains.	2005-05-25

Straight out of broadcasting school, her teacher who just happened to be a good friend of the general manager of KYOR had arranged an interview to be the night person on the air.  No experience on a real station, but that did not stop her.  After debating in college what kind of career she could enjoy out in the real world, she thought she might give it a try.  Like me, her first two years were not focused on one thing, just liberal arts.  Not like me, she'd never had any desire to be on radio.  I didn't make it, but she did almost overnight.      No hard work, no desire to play the music she loved and get paid for it.  She couldn't see doing paperwork in an office eight hours a day, but that's what I ended up doing, for awhile.  Radio is (or used to be) a twenty-four hour business, so we need a live body on the premises -- 24 hrs. a day.  My favorite Music Of Your Life is taped.  Westwood One is live, but the personalities playing the Fifties music and big band make a difference.  They are not supposed to be 'hip.'    Christie was born with a good speaking voice, while I continued throughout my life with a young-sounding voice.  She had determination to make this work and to show the program manager that she could succeed.  Rick was not easy to persuade.  Their first face-to-face was more of a confrontation.  \\"There was a difference between being realistic and being sadistic.\\"    Little did she know that the voice she'd depended upon to get her through late night school work would belong to her protaganist.  He'd been in the radio business for ten years and had no time for a neophyte.  After proving her mettle, she comes to realize that she has met the man of her dreams whose baritone voice had kept her company and solace as she was 'growing up.'    At my junior college, I was able to get a weekly news shot on the local station, WKSR, because I came highly recommended by an older student of my speech teacher who just happened to pull a few strings with the owner ofthe station.  He was reprimanded for not going through channels, as the program manager preferred to interview and find the best 'voice.'  However, I was on the air for a few months reading the news from the Martin campus every Friday afternoon prior to a high school boy taking over the evening music show.  Later, after I was married to the speech teacher, I was able to repay the favor and help the person who went to bat for me to get a radio position on my favorite station back in Knoxville, my hometown.  I knew a few of the d.j.s there as I had been a regular on local radio and t.v. as a natural singer (as opposed to trained), but not a news reader.      Ms. Donovan worked for seven years writing commercials at a radio station where Charlie was a d.j. (also her husband).  LOVE ON THE AIR is her first novel, and we all know that debuts usually include personal experiences.  She was the lucky one.	2005-05-25

This is the first in a series, CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS; Book 2 will be called SONG OF REDEMPTION.  This story concerns the events in the lives of two kings of Judah, Ahaz and his son Hezekiah, from 732 to 687 BC.  I was intrigued with the front cover, showing a rearing riderless horse connected to an empty Roman chariot.  Where is Charleston Heston?    In 931 BC, Jerusalem was divided into separate kingdoms, Israel the larger to the North and no longer governed by a descendant of King David, after King Solomon died.   The Southern nation called Judah is where this narrative takes place.  Uzziah was dead and Zachariah was drunk, begging God to let him die.  \\"Can I ever find forgiveness,\\" he beseeched his friend, but Uriah was angry and with self-loathing lashed out at Z.  \\"I admire you so much; I had wanted to be just like you.  You had the most brilliant legal mind the priesthood had seen in generations.  You're a disgrace.\\"  Pity, guilt, and grief raged inside Uriah as he saw that his mentor had 'feet of clay.' \\"You're lying.\\" It is never good to place someone on a pedestal.    Ahaz was only twenty years old when he became king.  However, he was paranoid and was always imagining that people were out to get him.  He had ordered Uriah to execute Z as he erroneously thought that Isaiah, who was of royal blood, and Z were plotting against him.  They had attempted to cause a revolt by humiliating him in front of the entire nation.     They had a new king and hoped that maybe things would be different as King Hezekiah's coronation took place.  He was the second son of Ahaz.  The prophets are our only hope, and they did keep things going.  Isaiah was one of the best, but my favorite for a long time was Jeremiah.    Ms. Austin has written a trilogy about the Civil War previous to this series, which earned her the Christy Awards for Historical Fiction.  She is one of the best to come along in a long time.	2005-05-24

This intimate glimpse into the feelings, thoughts, and life of the Dalai Lama is thought-provoking.  He is the world's most famous living holy man alive today.  I became interested in Tibet and the leader of Tibet many years ago when Paul Theroux took a journey there and had quite an adventure; along the way, he gave the Dalai Lama's glossy 8X10s to secure passage.  This was when things were good there in Shangrila and Tibet was still independent.  God willing, it may become so again.    The Dalai Lama says that he forgave the Chinese for destroying the beauty and majesty of his life in Tibet.  He preaches that one must \\"love your enemies.\\"  He's always had a sheltered existence since being chosen as the Dalai Lama as a child; he was mischievous at time and had a bad temper, which was controlled gradually.    He travels with body guards and he and Victor Chan took a journey from India to Ireland.  He spends a lot of time in meditation but also watches the Discovery Channel on television and the BBC World.  What's wrong with CNN?  Every week, two Tibetan doctors give him a complete medical checkup.    Is it possible to forgive people who malign your reputation; is it possible to forgive 'monsters' who make your life miserable?  What about those who threaten your integrity and demean you because they are bigger and younger?  He's never had to deal with these situations.    What about corrupt business men?  We know how the the truth means nothing to a politician, as they say one thing and do the opposite.  They are master liars!  Can we forgive their pandering to their own kin and cronies instead of hiring competent people to run their business.  Our mayor is just a totem as his father and those with wealth run this town now that the independent mayor was chosen as the Ambassador to Poland.  I miss him.  Can you forgive someone you can't trust, and those who say they are your friends when you know deep down in your intuition they are not.  A friend does not cause turmoil and unfeeling callousness and make false promises.  A friend does not tell you to find someone else to listen, as they have better and more important things to do, like drinking with pals.  A friend is not a friend unless he can show compassion.  That is sorely lacking in Knoxville, and it hurts.  Can you forgive those who don't care whether you live or die?  He is constantly pampered and protected.  He will never encounter such as the examples I have given.    Forgiveness is Biblical in context, even though he is Buddhist, but what if your tormentor is not a Christian, nor believer in the Bible.  When a person hurts you so much that your body rebels and causes chronic pain, how can you forgive?    D. L. told Victor Chan in some intimate conversations that \\"peace of mind can lead to a long and healthy life.\\"  Constant stress and turmoil can cause premature death.  He says that if a situation is causing you much pain, and there is \\"no solution, then also no need to worry -- because you can't do anything\\" about it.    Victor Chan said that he had felt a sense of inferiority living under British rule of the 50s and 60s.  When he came to Chicago to study at th Fermi Institute, he realized that China is backward technologically.  A few years ago, I asked my son to take my picture with the Atom Smasher sculphure outside his office window there on the University of Chicago campus.  He said only you and the Japanese would think that thing is pretty.  Victor was impressed with it as well and learning all about quantum physics, which Geoffrey hated.    The Dalai Lama is a great individual and a good leader \\"in exile.\\"  I wish him only the best.	2005-05-24

This psychological drama starts with the death of Rebecca in a head-on car collision.  In time, David could deal with talking about her death.  As he said, it was the thinking about it he couldn't handle.  As time went by, he discovered tucked in the page of a baby book a piece of paper on which she had written across the top \\"Things we will teach our child.\\"  Ten important ways to live:  to love, laugh, laugh some more, listen and learn, say 'please' and 'thank you,' have opinions, respect those of others, be honest,  be a friend, and most of all to be yourself.  He placed the book in a safe-deposit box. <br /> <br />To overcome his grief, he gets involved with one of his clients. Samantha who kills her husband.  A courtroom scene ensues at which another 'mystery' client appears, and is subsequently murdered.  \\"Every perfect murder starts with a perfect lie.\\"    S. Kent got life without the possibility of parole.   <br /> <br />Three years later, with his new wife, Terry, he discovers that \\"life, in all its wonders, has a nasty habit of reminding you that you're never really in control.\\"   She'd found the safe-deposit key and reclaimed the list which she put in a frame and hung on the nursery wall.  A little prosaic, but hey! that's life, the continuation of the species.   <br /> <br />Trust is everything in therapy, but he had wondered \\"what if the doctor could be trusted but not the patient?\\"  The trial takes up the majority of the story and is primitive in the specifics.  He had previously written THE UP AND COMER, and plans to keep writing.	2005-05-24

What we need in this modern age is a respect for and attempts to \\"cultivate old-fashioned gifts of the spirit.\\"  Trouble is, the people of today are not old fashioned.  Even in this backward town where I was born, some people can be so rude and uncaring.    Mr. Carmody's wisdom (through age-old human techniques) in this guide to peace of mind divides it into five sections:  thinking, feeling, sharing, deciding, and praying.  He was a former Jesuit priest who took a wife, Denise.  They have written books together.    After being diagnosed with bone cancer in 1992, he wrote this book as a guide and an inspiration for himself.  It is a guide of acceptance, by which you learn to use your inner resources.    To be reasonable, first you should put aside your own illusions, fantasies and self-indulgences.  Many (or most) of our troubles come from being foolish, but we all can't be wise.  We learn by experience, right?  Wrong! we learn by paying attention to one who has been there, done that!      Mainly, we must be aware of our own emotions, moods, consolations, and desolations in order to move on and have \\"peace.\\"  Our feelings are the way we discover the \\"world of values\\" -- what we esteem and value and what we appreciate.  We must overcome emotional troubles to establish the peace we seek.    Share what is troubling you.  Trouble (or grief) shared is halved if another is involved.  Break out of your isolation and allow objectivity to help you realize that you are not alone.  Talk it out, get it (whatever is hurting or bothering you) out of your system.  Share what is happening to  you, and you will learn that others are hurting, too.  Make a move.    Deal with the deeper issues so as not to be foolish, dumb and cowardly (three deadly sins).  Open your heart to those you love.  Ask for their consolation and understanding as you go through these difficult times.  And you will enjoy beautiful days (the sunrises and sunsets of our lives) again.  Life is good.  Live it to the fullest.  Not only will you help yourself, you will be helping others too.	2005-05-22

The pain of loss never vanishes entirely.  It takes time to work through the early shock and dark reality of your grief.  Time is a trap for those in agony as they suffer endless hours.  See the movie, THE HOURS.  Coping with time (days and nights) seems endless and sometimes unbearable.    Most of us don't know what to say at a time of deep loss.  There is no promise anywhere of a magic wand.  I've found three diverse individuals so far who helped with their stories about loss to  themselves.  But the main comforter was the one who just listened and made the comment, \\"It's tough.\\"  I could not have made it without him and his willingness to listen.  He could have turned me off as he did on many occasions before, but this time he was my 'limb' to hang onto.    One small instant of 'focused awareness' can bring immeasurable relief.  Just focus for a few minutes on a cheerful sound, like the warbling of a mockingbird who does imitations of other birds.  I have used Michael Feinstein's music as I can sing with it, and Linda Ronstadt's DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE cd.  Listening to THE LONG BLACK VEIL by Johnny Cash helped in a small way.  You see, I am tuned in to music, music of the spheres, ballads by pop singers, and went to see STAR WARS for the music.    Whether your loss is fresh and bitter, or of long standing, it takes work and time to endure the days of desperation and pain.  Our bodies as well as our minds may be in shock.  No doubt, you will be scarred from the unexpected death of a loved one because it was so sudden and seemingly unnecessary; sometimes that pain is still on a high level (10) forty years after the tragic accident.  You will never stop hurting (as I did when young Miran died in a fire), or wishing you could have told your loved one \\"good bye\\" -- and you are sorry, so sorry not for them, but for yourself as a chunk is taken out of your heart.  Your heart is not exactly broken as at the end of a love affair; it is just not complete anymore, forthis is a never ending thing.  You can always find someone else who is willing to love you.  Love needs an object.  This is not being self-centered or selfish.  It is loving, a person, a presence, a spirit of a human.  Life can have a purpose again even though it doesn't always deal in 'happy endings.'    It is progress when you can give thanks for the tiniest recognition to the person who helped so much just by being near in your crisis.  The grieving process will change you.  We fear what we do not know; resentment can poison you.  Forgiveness can liberate you from the despair of self-pity.    Most of us fear the dark.  Nights are dark and can be filled with dread and fear.  At night, we don't see things as they are -- in shadows.  In the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.  Out of death comes inner strength for the survivor.  Be able to hope again.  Just the simple words \\"I know how it is\\" may ease someone's sorrow.    After all, Katie Couric has found a new love and hope for the future of feeling complete again.  A woman alone even with children is never whole.  We all need a protector here on earth.	2005-05-22

Ezra Pound profounded: \\"What thou lovest well remains; the rest is dross.\\"   What remains is our beloved past.  This story follows a Jewish family of immigrants (those who survived Hitler's concentration camps) to England.  These cultured Greman natives had been privileged, with large ancestral homes. And yet, their \\"present\\" was composed of impoverished relatives, now face a dubious \\"future\\" liberated, but not really free. <br /> <br />In the literary club of which I was an energetic member, one of the best wasd a college teacher whose family had to flee Castro's Cuba.  She too had a privileged life in that beautiful country and they bled Communism, leaving behind most of their rich possessions and jewelry to find a form of freedom in the United States of America.  How she and her family got to Tennessee is a long story.  Their home in Cuba was taken over by a foreign embassy and she quipped, \\"I'm still teaching a foreign language.\\"  English was to her foreign. <br /> <br />Karl and Julia decide on America as the 'brave new world' in which to raise their sons, Ben and Jacob.  Elsa yearns for her protected past of pre-Nazi Germany.  It's about \\"that memory palace, the past.\\"  I too returned to my hometown after forty years farther South (and yet, some folks here ask me if I'd been up North!  I explain I was still in Tennessee, only near the Alabama border) to reclaim my good memories of growing up here in the Fifties.  They were dashed by unfeeling natives and the Tennessee Theater I'd looked on as a 'temple' now repulses me.  Our past shapes us for immortality, but \\"what remains\\" when we are gone. <br /> <br />Nicholas Delbanco teaches English Literature at University of Michigan, Christine's Alma Mater.  This is his 20th published book, quite a record, and this one lives up to his reputation of relating unforgettable characters.  He can even get \\"quixotically erotic\\" -- is a teacher of writers, as is Zachary Adrian.  His latest is called THE VAGABONDS.	2005-05-21

It seems that ethics is the primary issue now, ethics in government, in business and in private concerns.  Moral courage is described as \\"the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics.\\"  I don't think that is necessarily the moral issue. <br /> <br />Morality has nothing to do with ethics.  Morality is standing up for your rights and standing firm when others do harm to you.  He asks, \\"Am I motivated by my desire to uphold my beliefs or just to impose them on others?\\"  There is no way to impose anything on anybody who is not willing to accept it. <br /> <br />Some of us fight for moral courage, which is so lacking in today's world.  But is telling the truth right when it can hurt someone else desperately?  Is that moral?  Is it ethical to do things and say things which you know will cause irreperable harm to innocent people? <br /> <br />Our culture is full of those who get their kicks out of putting down an old woman and making her feel soiled, even though they have not touched her physically.  Emotional abuse is by far a much greater harm to the psyche than any physical abuse is to the body.  I know, because I endured it for 21 years.  But I am a survivor, and I have always stood up for my rights.  I was praised once upon a time, a while back, as sticking to my convictions, that not so many people will stand behind the courage of their convictions. <br /> <br />You don't have to achieve maturity to have moral courage.  It just takes determination and character, no matter what your age is.  No, it is not esoteric or practical, it is a necessity in today's world not to back down.  That's the Scots-Irish in us Southerners. <br /> <br />Dr. Kidder is from the East where morals are different from the Bible Belt of the South.  He is highly educated and serves on many boards as a VIP.  I wonder what audience he wrote this particular book for, us commoners who have to struggle with everyday problems, like a death in the family, or the CEOs who dally with other people's money.  There is a vast difference.	2005-05-21

Written by a young Irish solicalite, this debut novel is funny and sad, well-written, and timely (for me).  As you know, I love first novels, as most are based on the writer's life experinces.  This one is the exception, as the author is so very young.  And yet I learned some things from her to get me through my period of grief.    About Holly, she writes, \\"She was a woman who made mistakes.  She was a woman who sometimes just got things wrong.  Whatever lay ahead, she would obey Gerry's final message and seek another true love.\\"    I've never lost a loving husband, but an older lady shared with me the time her husband tragically drown while saving a young boy, leaving her with two young daughters to raise alone -- this happened forty years ago and she still can feel the pain. I did lose my 'first love' developed at the age of seventeen.  He did not die, at least, I don't think he has.  But, like Gerry, he will forever be in my heart and 'good memories of growing up.'  It is the first love which makes the most impact on a young girl's life.    However, when you are older, and worried about your own mortality and just not ready to 'give up' yet, a death in the family (as in James Agee's book, ALL THE WAY HOME) with the wrong (younger) person dying, it is harder to \\"grieve\\" -- you just get mad and lash out at innocent people.  I think I had the whole town upset with me a couple of months ago, from the Mayor on down to menials, when I learned that my twenty-yr.old grandson Tristan had been killed in a car accident.    I was told yesterday by a person who I had disliked a few years ago (because of his rudeness) that the first stage of grief is anger.  And, boy, have I been angry with the world at large!  Why a young man who had his life before him -- why not me!  But a rude Hispanic male on the bus yesterday as I was on the way to see the latest STAR WARS movie, woke me up.  His rudeness did not make me angry, it made me sad for someone so young and uneducated to treatan 'old lady' that way.    In this lovely book, her husband left behind some advice in the form of notes for her to get on with her life.  He knew he would die of a brain tumor.  Most of us don't know when or how we will die.  But Holly carried on and, though, she missed her adored one, she was able to do mundane and exciting things with friends.  And, glory be, she ran into a stranger at a local store and invites him to a bar for a cup of coffee.  She, my dear, is a modern woman.  We need more Hollys in this world, as opposed to the Holly-Go-Lightlys.      Ms. Ahern has out two more novels.  More power to her.  She's from a fantastic family, but is the most fantastic of all!	2005-05-21

They thanked God for bringing them to this new land.  This first permanent settlement was later known as Jamestown.  Our U.S. president sets the moral tone for this nation.  Abraham Lincoln, like many presidents who preceded him, clearly recognized the need to call upon God for help in order to fulfill the demanding duties of a national office.  Now what?  Lincoln, in his farewell address in Springfield, Illinois, on February 11, 1861, spoke \\"I now leave, not knowing when or whether I may return.  Without the assistance of the Divine Being, I cannot succeed.  With that assistance I cannot fail.  Let us all hope that all will be well.\\"  He did not return to his state because of his stance during the Civil War.    John Wesley, recognized as one of the greatest men of God of the eighteenth century, wrote in his journal in 1739, \\"I look upon the world as my parish.   He was the founder of the Methodist Church.  His motto and rule is as follows:  Do all the good you can by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you -- to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.  With the diversity of religions in the country now, who knows what road to follow?    In 1893, Katherine Bates, a teacher from Massachusetts, had a glorious moment enjoying the majesty and beauty from atop Pike's Peak in Colorado.  It is still sacred today after Samuel A. Ward added music:  \\"O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain; for purple mountain majesties aboved the fruited plain! America! America!  God shed His grace on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea.\\"    Our founding fathers were aware of the cost of freedom.  During WW1, \\"America the Beautiful\\" was popular to encourage the pride and loyalty.  On Veterans Day, we still gather to wave flags to show our patriotism.  Our government and military leaders must be ever vigilant in protecting this nation.  After 2001, we simply cannot take chances.  If nothing else, do your part in praying and talking with God to unite this country which is full of diversity and hatred for those who don't belong.  Perhaps we should all learn a different language.  If we give God permission, he often changes oour prayers midcourse, as if to say, \\"Have you considered this, my child\\"?  We must pray for others and give God the chance to intervene if he desires.  You might be surprised by the results.  Some of us have a one-on-one direct to our Maker and can say, \\"thank you for your mercy, love and guidance.\\"  Sometimes, anger serves a useful purpose.      Grief and guilt, like Zach's over Tristan's death, are twin emotions.  Feeling unworthy for having been spared is natural.  There is a reason God allowed this to happen.  No matter how shattering the event or loss, ultimately it serves as fulfilling a higher purpose we cannot perceive at the moment.  It takes a lot of courage (moral and otherwise) to endure verbal and emotional abuse.  It takes fortitude.    All of us can reach out to others around us who are suffering a loss.  Often, the greatest gift we can give is our willingness to simply be there for them.  Let not your heart be troubled, believe in God, believe also in one who loves you.  Mark had hardships but now is a new person, vivacious attitude, and is sturdy like Job.  He should have been one of the disciples to save people from their own foibles and stubborness.  Life goes on, but for how long  -- it all depends.	2005-05-21

This is her fourth endeavor to write romances.  Corinne is a dramatic, \\"hyper\\" single who needs a man to calm her down, not control but to rely on -- Matt, an office chum.  Though an accountant, he shows her what lurks underneath his calming exterior.    Do you remember your first love?  Odds are that he disappeared to another world, another place and settled down with someone else.  But you didn't die or wither away.  Although he was your 'one true love,' he got lost and you think of him at the oddest times.  Like me, you might have gone 'home' again, expecting him to be there waiting for you.  It doesn't work -- maybe he forgot you; whatever, he chose someone and some place else.  And we just have to accept the fact of man's folly.  They will always take the  better deal, the female who offers them more financially.     Corinne decides to go on a two-week vacation to search for #1, the person who makes her heart beat faster and her insides melt like jello.  Matt proves that you don't have to run off in search of Mr. Right when perhaps a little jolt can show Corinne he is there, ready to be her 'one true love.'    Stephanie Doyle, author, single, has the silly idea that if she waits (while writing 'dreams'), he will \\"sweep her off her feet.\\"  These days, a woman does not sit and wait; she goes out and makes her own selection, but be sure he's the one man you constantly have in your thoughts and heart.  Otherwise, it just won't work.	2005-05-19

The upside down poodle on the cover was a clever touch, as some of the autistic children do see things upside down, but are not able to express it.  This book written by a Britisher, Mark Haddon, is so close to life it is unreal.  People who have not experienced contact with these exceptional people do have a distorted opinion.  To some, it's funny; to others, it's sad.  Such is life.  But to those who live daily with such a child see it as a burden, not an easy life, but the child is their flesh and blood and a valued individual.      The one thing a writer must do is to put himself in someone else's shoes.  Christopher, the \\"voice\\" of this novel has Asperger Syndrome, a behavior disorder similar to autism only milder.  He can't understand other people's opinions.  You can never get inside his head.  It's as if a wall is built up to insulate the tender feelings he might have.      Savant Syndrome is a rare condition in which these defective males verge on brilliance, math ability, or genius in the talent and music fields.  Chris (John Francis) Boone has a fantastic memory and math skills.  \\"I know all the countries of the world and their capital cities (I've heard that before) and every prime number up to 7,507.\\"  In the 8th grade, we had a mathematical genius in our small class and the male teacher tried each one of us at the blackboard to see if we could out do him -- none could.  We thought at the time that he was just strange, as math was all he could master.      Chris is a lot like the character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the 1988 movie, RAIN MAN.  Here in Knoxville, many such adults ride the buses and have menial jobs.  At one of the malls, I had a strange interaction with one of the children; waiting for a bus, I stood at the door (inside as it was cold out) and heard a mother castigating her young son, \\"Don't run in front of a car, do you hear me -- whatever you do, do not run in front of a car.\\"  He looked over at me; I winked at him and he winked back.  I waved to him, and he waved back.  As he started out the door, he said in a loud,clear voice \\"Good-bye.\\"  His mother grabbed him and yelled, \\"Did you say good-bye\\" two or three times.  He just looked at her perplexed.  I explained what I had done, and she said, \\"But he never talks.\\"  God works in mysterious ways, putting us in particular places for a reason.  You see, I had caught the wrong bus and was waiting for the right one.    At the Green Hills library in Nashville, last Spring, after the children's story hour, I sat on one side of Eric and his father (my son) was on the other reading a kids book to him -- one of his favorites.  I said, \\"Jeff, I am a non-entity to this child,\\" as he was totally unaware that his grandmother was there.  Sometimes, love hurts.    This book was released as a children's book and for adult readers at the same time, and has won many awards.  It is inspirational.	2005-05-19

Suffering produces endurance; endurance produces character; character produces hope. (from the Bible)  \\"We may reduce suffering by improved medicine, safety campaigns, and personal precaution, but there still remains an inevitable residuum of pain.  Love itself has pain in its heart, sometimes aching with loneliness, sometimes burning with passion, sometimes freezing with despair, sometimes bleeding with loss.  The more we love, the more we expose ourselves to the possibility of pain.\\"  Life is strewn with enigmas.  Such is the mystery of evil. Time and chance happen to us; chance favors the trained mind.  What we call chance may be part of destiny when looked at in the divine perspective.<br /><br />This is The Age of Anxiety.  Anxiety disorders can be difficult to diagnose if it is wrongly identified, it is not a disorder when it is based on real danger and daily mistreatment.  The author of PEACE OF MIND wrote, \\"man has to pay the price of fear and worry in order to be human.\\"  The wise man may not always get wealth in return for his wisdom, but by putting intelligence into his work, he develops more wisdom.<br /><br />Pain is a feeling which is the opposite of pleasure.  It can be caused by betrayal of a friend, a family's misjudgment and misunderstanding, disappointment, anxiety, helplessness, bereavement, and lack of compassion -- among other things.  A chronic pain is a living Hell -- believe me, I've had one (perhaps misdiagnosed, but painful all the same) since 1994.<br /><br />We think of accidents which may befall us at any time (my grandson was killed in a car accident recently), of calamities that may come crashing around the corner, of illnesses which are catatrophic, of wars sparked by a dictator, or of death lurking we know not where.  It could touch us directly or peripherially at any time, and only God can see us through.	2005-05-18

Little Gloria proved that it was not necessarily a \\"good life\\" and this is a 'tell-all' to beat all.  Gloria Vanderbilt was the female equivalent to Eddie Fisher in BEEN THERE DONE THAT, only more open and vulgar with her descriptions of the sex involved.  She knew exactly what she was doing.  Eddie had a hard youth growing up in Philadelphia.  She, on the other hand, was rolling in wealth, moving from one place to another.  Sure, there was the custody battle described in LITTLE GLORIA, HAPPY AT LAST.  But, was she ever happy?  And she didn't exactly stay little.    She turned into a Don Juan with no scruples at any time.  Most times, it's the men who 'use' women, but this memoir shows clearly that was the opposite for Ms. Vanderbilt (Cooper).    Peppered with sexy photos to match the braggart sex-kitten actions, she might be compared with Ann Margaret, or Elvis!  In the family portrait, she looked like a Russian duchess with the four children in tow.  She went from man to man indiscriminately looking for a father, as did Marily Monroe, she said.  She lived the high life, that's for sure, but she was not happy inside.    She labels her mother as a lesbian.  I disagree with her that same-sex couples should or could raise children.  How could they possibly be termed as normal or set a good example, and children are taught by the \\"parents\\" the facts of life (which should not be perverted.)  Gloria went to the extreme opposite of her mother, more promiscuous than most movie stars on the way to stardom via the bedroom activity.    Her strange ideas are not for everyday, average people.  The rich do as they please.  Even Truman Capote, a gay, with his cache of cocaine was exposed.  She moved in a wild group and the men meant nothing to her more than mere sexual partners.  She may have lived well, but she did not love anybody but \\"little Gloria.\\"  She has no morals.  Has she no shame, a high school dropout, having all those affairs with the famous and intelligent men who should have known better.  Some of those men are dead now and can't refute her accusations of bedding them.  I ask, will Little Gloria ever be happy after living such a sordid life?	2005-05-17

At one time or another, all women strive for perfection.  Men are born perfect.  Nature made the male birds  the beautiful ones who must get the notice of the female; men don't have to fool with makeup, or worry about hairdos.  If they're clean and don't overdo the after shave, most are perfectly groomed without trying.    But with women, we get caught in \\"the perfection trap\\" not only with looking as good as we can but training little girls that subterfuge is natural.  What gets to me are all the old (really old) women who continue to dye their hair.  I know one who wears two sets of eyelashes at the same time.  I wonder who she plans to seduce, as more men look at me with my natural hair, no eye makeup and coverup foundation with lighter shades of lipstick.    This is a book of pictures more than guidance.  That of the old woman reading to her cat is the most perfect.  I talk to my cat,Star.  The two girls dressed like we did back in the Fifties with books on their heads as they walk are almost perfect.  The five swimsuit dressed girls in their high heel shoes sitting on the railing watching another do a head stand looked to be right out of the Forties.  Maybe that was perfection back then.    Anna says that \\"trying to be perfect may be inevitable for people who are smart amd ambitious and interested in the world and its good opinion.  What's really hard and amazing is giving up on being 'perfect' and beginning the work of becoming yourself.\\"  Good advice.    This writer sounds familiar but I can't recall seeing her little books previously.  Her column, \\"Public and Private,\\" (sound like a gossip column) in 'New York Times,' won the Pulitzer Prize in 1992.  Well, I'm not a regular reader of NYT; perhaps, just maybe, I read one in 'Newsweek.'  Anyway, it doesn't matter, as she is the \\"perfect Woman.\\"    The things she experienced growing up sound catty to me, but she had fun doing them.That's the main thing.   Perhaps her antics in high school made her feel like Ms. Perfect (a la \\"Grease\\" movie).  Finally, she was old enough for college, where the real world kicks in.  I was sure I knew everything I needed to know when I went off to college but I soon learned that I didn't know anything important.  Free of the past never makes us free of remembrance of the things which happened.  She had missed something along the way; the mind would tell sooner or later.    A good student in high school, though no desire to be perfect.  Takes too much work and effort.  I was going to be a famous singer.  Marriage puts the end (period) to our plans and desires for fame as family takes over.  Actually, I grew up with #1 and #1 sons, only theyu were smarter than I.  The photos intersperced in this essay show more normality for the times than perfection.  Kaleena became a pro ballerina (there's one in every generation in most families).  Sometimes, our wishes when we were young come to a stony sadness.    Mainly, Mrs. Q lectures the reader about what not to do as you learn to be an adult, but we all have to experience failures with the successes.  As age cycles come and go, we go through changes some for the better, some we might wish had never happened.  There is no \\"being perfect\\" unless you're a robot.	2005-05-17

He was a visionary, wanting to conquer the world like his first hero, Alexander the Great.  He conquered the media world with CNN and TNT.  My hero was General MacArthur; he too conquered the world with his determination and fighting spirit.  His \\"I shall return\\" was a war cry and a promise.    I was drawn to this book because I appreciate his sponsoring GODS & GENERALS, a Civil War movie with the South's viewpoint in which there were many generals, but God let us down.  He spent $55 million of his own money to produce this masterpiece.    Ted's grandfather was a sharecropper in Mississippi, and yet Ted was born in Cincinnati, Ohio (Nick Clooney's town).  His father was a dictator, which caused Ted to have mood swings and a ferocious temper.    When married to Jane Fonda (1991-2001), he secluded himself in an efficiency apartment \\"penthouse\\" atop the CNN Center Building in Atlanta.  Previously, he had slept in his office.  She was window dressing and traveling companion.  He owned at that time an 8,000-acre Florida estate, cattle and sheep ranches in Montana, New Mexico and Argentina.  Who knows what else?  Anyway, he kept her 'in style' and it was observed that she was his \\"equal\\" -- she was different.  He treated her with a lot of respect.  She had been an anti-war activist, movie star, and daughter of Henry Fonda.  What else could he ask for?  But, every cloud sooner or later bursts and a thunderstorm ensues.    His motto is \\"You cannot give up hope... The situation is hopeless -- but I might be wrong.\\"  He's had an exciting life, but not much luck in the marriage department, like Peter Fonda.  Now,  he can rest on his laurels.  I enjoyed seeing the photo of the young Ted Turner with \\"no perfect teeth\\" and in the straw bowler hat.  He was a dandy back then.  Thank you, TT for GODS AND GENERALS.  Thank you, Ken A. for a good bio.  He overcame all odds and he is \\"somebody of stature.\\"	2005-05-17

This memoir was about a family tragedy, the first-hand experience of the accident in which his mother died instantly.  He had witnessed her fall from a horse directly in front of the horse he was riding.  He'd felt guilty and, as a boy of fourteen, he believed that he had killed his mother. <br /> <br />A son never gets over the loss of his mother at a young age.  My brother would have been sixteen when our mother died of cancer.  My father was having problems adjusting to the death of his first wife (even though it had been a long and horrible way watch her die), and so he took out his pain on Ralph and Cecil.  To escape the daily thrashings and humiliation, Ralph got married the next year at the age of seventeen -- to leave a tormented home situation.  In 1990 (42 years later), Ralph was dying from emphesema and liver failure when I visited him in the hospital.  A nurse came in his room as he and I were alone and conversing (I lived 200 miles from here then), and casually asked him, \\"When did your pain begin?\\"  The 58-yr-old man sobbed and said \\"when my mother died.\\" <br /> <br />Like Ralph, Mr. Bordewich became a man overnight and had to cope with an alcoholic father.  But life goes on and he lived through the turmoil to become a father himself.  His mother (a beautiful person) was an important person, well-known on a national level.  Our mother was an abused woman who'd borne nine children (five died at birth) without a doctor's care -- even I, the baby of the family, had been born at home -- and as a result developed cancer of the  uterus.  In effect, our fahter killed her.  I was nine years younger than Ralph; Cecil and I both thought that we would die at the age of 36, our mother's longevity.  My mother did not leave a ghost behind; Fergus is lucky to have had her lingering presence to remind him how fleeting life is. <br /> <br />This is much better than ANGELA'S ASHES and more substantial and heartfelt.  Those brothers in New York City even considered putting Angela's remains in a garbage bag out for the trash collectors to get. <br /> <br />So much for being a mother of boys -- you devote your young years to be their chaffeur, first teacher, cook, supporter and see that they are properly cared for, and what glory do you have when they are grown with families of their own. <br /> <br />I'm glad his mother was Irish.  I've always like to think mine had been, with the blue eyes and light brown hair.  We inherited my dad's dark eyes and dark brown hair; his father's family had mixed with the Cherokee Indians of the Smoky Mtns.  When my mother was in her casket, they'd pulled her long hair behind her head and I kept asking, why does she look like a man?  Such is life for the youngest left behind. <br /> <br />He has written books on diverse subjects, including the Underground Railroad and many articles published in \\"American Heritage,' 'Smithsonian Magazine,' and 'The Atlantic Monthly' among others.

This is a book about liberty; she quotes Daniel Webster (\\"God grants liberty only to those who love it.\\")which is one of the strong themes of this guide to a better understanding of your feelings and where you belong in God's 'wider place.'    To be free is the major thing in our existence on this life, to be free to make decisions which impact us:  You're as self-sufficient as  need be, so when someone you respect approaches you with guidance, you're torn between listening to them and listening to yourself. In most situations, a little of both is best, especially if you're being polite. In this particular case, your antennae aren't wrong. Pay attention to the common denominators in their advice and your own instincts. It's the one and only path to follow.   This is good advice.    This book needs to be read from page 17 to 250 to get the needed instruction on liberty and what it means to be free in a free land.  This is definitely a book for Christians, but could help Muslims to understand how the majority of us in America are brought up to believe in our God  and to try to follow Christ's teachings.  However, we believe in the Old Testament too, not just as background but as apropos to conventions of social behavior.    Too many of us are caught up in captivity of one kind or another these days.   Part III helds to free the reader from life-changing attidutes.  Rigidity, Indecision Fear, Loneliness, Conformity, Opinion of Others, Responsibility are some of the things Ms. Price leads us through.  It may not be possible to change all of your beliefs, but we should accept her offerings with gratitude and gratefulness for being the person she is and sharing her thoughts on 'higher' issues.    We should ponder on how we choose, consciously or unconsciously, the partial bondage in which we find ourselves.  At some point in our lives, we must choose to follow blindly the conditioning we have endured, such as conforming to special groups' emphases so as not to appear an 'outsider.' or to enter the 'wider place' where God leads us to redemption.    Ms. Price has written a whole slew of books, over one hundred listed in Amazon.com, and all worthwhile reading.  LIGHTHOUSE is her inspirational classic; a couple others are BEFORE THE DARKNESS FALLS and  WHAT REALLY MATTERS.  Of course, her BELOVED INVADER is what got her started on this adventure.  We can share only a partial part, but any and all will be rewarding.	2005-05-16

This was an interesting book about Candice Delong written by Elisa Petrini. Before becoming connected with the FBI, she'd been a nurse in a psychiatric ward. She was a divorced mother then, still something of a stigma in the early 1980s. In the late '80s she was assigned to the cocaine trafficing in Chicago.  <br /> <br />There was a drug pipeline which stretched from the South American country of Columbia, then the cocaine capital of the hemisphere, up through Mexico into Texas; from there to Chicago. I've been told that it went through Lawrenceburg, TN on the way North.  <br /> <br />There is a manadatory minimum 20-yr. sentence for anyone caught with ten or more kilograms of cocaine (about 22 lbs.). Each kilo is the size of a brick and worth $15,000 - 30,000 depending on the quality of the drug. Heroin is a lot more. She had some interesting times working with DEA in narcotics, even being tricked into babysitting for the informant on her first case.  <br /> <br />She was involved in the Unabomber case and the way they discovered it was a former University of California at Berkley (where Savage (Weiner) may have found his cocaine) professor. She was in on the specifics in Montana,trapping Ted Kaezynski in 1996. Then back to San Francisco, where Savage settled.  <br /> <br />She gives good pointers on how to handle home invastion or sexual assault. Always yell \\"Fire.\\" There are almost twice as many sex crimes against women over sixty as certain killers go after the older women to act out their anger toward the strong female figures in their lives and the fact that elderly women are easier to control. Compliance is by no means the same as consent.  <br /> <br />Rape is all about power, not sex. A woman's goal is to survive the attack. About 41% of rapes and sex assaults are committed by acquaintances of the victim. Sex offenders don't think like normal men and are always on the alert for what they think of as \\"provacative\\" behavior or dress.  <br /> <br />After twenty years, she became a private citizen again and went on the lecture circuit. She is proud of her achievements and the privilege to work as a 'public servant' in the FBI. <br />	2005-05-15

I love first novels as usually they contain as much truth as fiction, based on actual happenings in the author's life.  In this one, however, we get acquainted with Gideon whose young wife just suddenly disappeared leaving behind a six year old daughter.  Throughout the novel, you wonder why she left and did she go voluntarily. <br /> <br />It proves that \\"a battered soul can learn to live with a tragic past\\" as he waits a year before opening the suitcase of her life she left behind.  Would a bad mother leave her only child and all of her \\"history\\" behind?  I don't think so. <br /> <br />Raya Salomon, mother of Lizzy, 'storyteller, liar,' left behind a challenge for her husband of seven years.  Could this be that so-called \\"Seven Year Itch\\" of which a movie was made in the Fifties?  I don't think so.  She left behind in the suitcase the photos and personal letters plus a book -- the reflection of her life.   <br /> <br />After her desertion, he wanted to put her enigmatic memory in the past and move on with his life and taking care of his daughter.  He refused to believe that she could be dead, as she was always alive in his broken heart.  She had been his 'life' for those seven years, but did he know the real Raya who had been less than truthful about her past. <br /> <br />Her mysterious disappearance affected him in such a way that he devoted himself to her memory completely, marrying her spirit this time.  Her personal effects had demanded his unconditional surrender, and he accepted the challenge. <br /> <br />Two years later, he finally had her declared deceased legally.  \\"It was the only way of keeping her in my life, of holding on to what the three of us were.\\"  Such devotion! <br /> <br />The English version was translated by Barbara Fasting.	2005-05-15

A fiction writer makes things up, albeit they may be based on actual happenings.  The Survivors Club (as they called themselves) included three women who have been victims of a warped, evil man.  Instead of staying victims, they form a club for survivors, the think.  We need one of those in Knoxville as I, too, was a victim in 1999 and almost became that Knoxville Girl in fact, the one in the ballad who was killed and thrown in the French Broad River.  But did the local police consider that I had been one of the many victims of the same man who continue to prey on white women and empty their wallets to \\"pay for his time\\" -- and get away with it.  Most times, he had an accomplice (a woman) who did the actual beating so that he was \\"home free\\" but I escaped that part of his ritual.  I was a survivor by my own wits and determination to get out of the situation alive, and the cops could have cared less.    <br /> <br />One stupid 'officer' asked if I was taking a mind-altering drug when I said that all I took was my daily Fosamax.  He was ready to slap the handcuffs on me, as he apparently had never heard of osteoporsis.  That amused the chief of the detectives.  But so many of our officers are so undertrained and lack common sense and intelligence.  When they're not trigger happy, they become victims themselves.  Three were beat up so badly by some boys in the projects who tried to keep their drug-laden vehicle from being searched that one of the 'officers' had to go through surgery on his face. <br /> <br />In this novel, the man who had changed their lives forever by perpretrating his crimes is found dead and all three 'victims' became prime suspects.  Sometimes the police (and corrupt attorney general) look the other way to protect those they like or need as snitches, and justice falls by the wayside.  What drives even the best people to 'cross the line' and become a killer -- is it the husband who goes out to shoot ducks and geese, and wild turkey, legally?  Couldit be those who kill racoons and deer for the sport of it?  Some of us survive to old age, others die young. <br /> <br />When in a dangerous situation, the survivor learns to be smart and stay controlled.  That will keep you alive.  And, above all, drink plenty of water to stay calm, but get it yourself.  Don't let your tormentor bring it to you. <br /> <br />She has written THE KILLING HOUR, THE NEXT ACCIDENT, THE THIRD VICTIM and THE OTHER DAUGHTER.  She doesn't look like one who has murder on her mind, but at times looks can be deceiving.  Don't trust anyone with blue eyes -- only dark eyes show fear and violence.	2005-05-15

It is suggested that we recreate our lives from negative thinking to positive love.  The only problem is that some people will not accept your love, acting as if your status as a decent human being is beneath them because you are poor in finances, not abilities nor intelligence.  They are afraid of you because of social status, or lack of.  Only the rich and powerful are worth anything in America.    She states that God will help us to change the world.  What if parts of the world don't want to be changed?  Spiritual giants have humility in abundance, minus the ego.  According to a verse in the Bible, ICor. 15-51, \\"we shall all be changed -- in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound...\\"  She obviously is talking about the end of the earth, or as some call it the Rapture.  Most of us won't be around to hear that trumpet.  Custer heard his!  And what good did it do -- he still died.    When you are upset or in pain over a larger social reality (a public agency), it's impossible to know who you should trust.  So many gloss over the problem (which is very real to the person harmed or abused), and try to suppress it.  They ignore what is happening, hoping it will go away, but it never does.  It continues to fester until the boil it causes bursts open and a 'can of worms' is opened for all to see.  That way, no one ever wins.    Remember how your mom always told you not to gulp your food or you'd choke? That's great advice to apply to all areas of your life right now. You might be in such a rush that you're missing all the things that actually make life worth living: good conversations, long walks outside, seeing the funny faces people make when they're waiting for the bus, and, yes, good food. Learn to appreciate all the wonders, big and small, that make up your everyday life.     One of her 'key bridges of transformation' is to live in the present, not the past or future (who knows if we or our world will have a future), togo from forgetting who we are to remembering who we are.  I say, we should never forget who we were, as our experiences have made us who we are now.    She preaches that we should go from \\"who we were\\" to \\"who we are becoming.\\"  When she ages twenty more years, she will hold onto the good memories of who she was as opposed to being old, isolated, ignored, abused mentally, and be glad that she still has the wits left to remember that 'once upon a time' she was somebody.  Like we all are at certain periods in our lives.  It is not good to bury that in your subconscious.    Other books, Ms. Williamson has had published include A WOMAN'S WORTH, EVERYDAY GRACE, and HEALING THE SOUL OF AMERICA.  As far as my reading goes, I feel that America has no soul.	2005-05-15

Thich Nhat Hanh was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  He guides the reader of this new book how to go about getting rid of the violence he holds inside.  As in his book, ANGER, he tells how anger and unhappiness can consume you.  Violence is an outmoded response we can no longer afford politically and in daily life with family and friends (we usually tend to lash out and hurt the people we love the most).   <br /> <br />Walking can calm our feelings and help us recover out peace.  Walk to release your anger and pain.  It calms negative feelings, helps you to get in touch with positive elements within and around you.  Walking outdoors increases our happiness, peace, and harmony. <br /> <br />He tells us that we can each make a difference by being compassionate and not overbearing toward others; we are not helpless by any means.  In our community, where the bigwigs hold sway and money is everything, we need to seek peace but not accept repression.  Each individual is precious in God's grace -- I hope Tristan had a peaceful transition.  He was a good-looking young man. <br /> <br />We can all work on inner change in personal lives, but global changes are in the hands of politicians, the leaders.  So many are inexperienced and unsuited to lead anybody; others are corrupt.  As in the movie, 'Kingdom of Heaven,' we will have to hope that God is on our side.	2005-05-14

Finally found an authentic author from Tennessee!  From 1991-96, she was the religion editor (still contributing editor) for 'Publishers Weekly.' <br /> <br />Money is the root of all evil; it gives the wealthy the false assumption that they are better than everyone else and they don't care who they run over to keep their wealth.  Even poor people hand onto too many possessions.  They feel that is what makes them worthwhile.  Ugly is as ugly does; it's what is on the inside. <br /> <br />This was a little book, in a series on the Seven Deadly Sins.  Others are Pride, Envy, Slth, Gluttony, Lust, Anger -- what about Avarice, Strife, Covetousness, Allurement?  Why not Evil?   Some people are just plain evil and try to hurt others, be it the elderly or someone they have power over, through greed. <br /> <br />I can't see how greed is a greater calamity, as the others are equally just as bad.  I consistently harbor anger and pride.  For what -- it only hurts myself.  Former President of U.S. Jimmy Carter admitted he has 'lusted' in his heart!  President Clinton took it farther than that.  Politicians are the worst for greed, and all the other sins, as they always manage to get away with it.  I learned long ago not to envy others especially those who have lots of money. <br /> <br />Here is where greed comes in.  The average American differs from the major players in the game of wealth (Martha Stewart, Jack Welch -- the good guy, and Gordon Gelleo) only in degree, not in intention.  Most of us ordinary folks have never known luxury, seen it in movies, but have no idea of the real thing.  Image is everything.   There is no longer ethics or morality in America.  But there is an abundance of greed.	2005-05-13

The Federal Reserve Board makes decisions which affect all Americans.  The committee meets eight times a year to determine short-term interest rates and economic well-being of us all, poor and rich alike. <br /> <br />In 1974, Alan Greenspan was chairman of then-President Ford's Council of Economic Advisors.  After the stock market crash in 1987, he succeeded Paul Volcker during Reagan's term.  George Bush said, \\"I reappointed him in 1991 and he disappointed me.\\"  He felt that it had cost him the reelection because economic recovery wasn't visible to the public. <br /> <br />The Greenspan years were 1987-2000.  Each president's Treasury Secretary is a member of the committee of seven.  And yet, in the photo shown, there were 24 present. <br /> <br />Sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt, reluctant, perplexed, nervous or calm, skeptical, dispassionate, enigmatic (adjectives to describe Greenspan), he was always struggling, often alone.  In 1997, he married Andrea Mitchell, a NBC correspondent.  He became the symbol of American economic reeminence. <br /> <br />In the new book, GREED, there is a photo of the drawing of 'The Greenspan Buddha) which is most irreverent. <br /> <br />The Federal Reserve is located in a magnificent marble structure on Constitution Avenue, built in 1930s, no doubt from Knoxville, Tennessee, marble as were so many of the D.C. federal buildings, including the Capitol. <br /> <br />Bob Woodward and his fellow reporter, Carl Bernstein, of the Washington Post exposed Watergate and caused the demise of President Nixon in 1974.

On June 25, 1876, General George Armstrong Custer led a group of men to their massacre.  Two retalitory battles ensued, July 7 and Sept. 9 as the U. S. Army took out their revenge on the Cheyenne and Sioux Indians.  They were, after all, on the native's land.    Some notables included in this book include William F. Cody (Wild Bill), Jack Russell, Captain Jack Crawford (The Poet Scout), and Trader Jack Becker.  The most prominent Indians were Blackfoot, Red Horse, Iron Thunder, Little Eagle and Rain Maker.    This was a sad time for our country as it marched ever Westward after displacing the Cherokees.  The battle was one of the most picturesque ever fought in the West.  Crook and his officers stood in the camp, the center of a vast amphitheater ringed with fire, up the sides of which the soldiers steadily climbed to get at the Indians, silhouetted in all their war finery against the sky. (Cyrus Townsend Brady) A marvelous picture in words.    The photo on back flap of Crook City mining town showed how it looked in the summer 0f 1876, at that time an illegal white settlement on Indian land.   The photos at the front, preceding the narrative, showed the 'First Scalp for Custer' and I was apalled as it appears to be a skunk, as I don't think that the Indian men wore their hair that long (could they have killed a woman); Dr. McGillycuddy looked lost as he posed beside a garbage heap.  And that poor emaciated horse getting shot in the head reminded me of the shot of the Vietnamese by a corrupt General in that awful war.  Chief Horse looked combative and his wife apprehensive.  I did like the \\"teepee\\" lodge and party of westerners at Little Big Horse.  That is a classic picture.  Pictures can tell a story much better than words, and this is a wordy book.	2005-05-13

In FOUNTAIN OF SECRETS, we meet Persephone who lives in isolation on an island burdened with a secret she is unwilling to tell anyone, even the English nobleman, Gavin, just landed on this paradise.  On the island nation of Akora in 1837, he is hiding his own secret, the volcano is ready to erupt and he must save this strong-willed recluse.  The present danger threatens to destroy the destiny of this beautiful island.    As they worked together, she discovered that his mother had been an Akoran princess rescued by an English Earl.  Is it their destiny to follow in the same footsteps, or will the 'sins of the past' prevent them from love and happiness.  It seems they inherited an ancient legacy which will keep them apart. Or, will they be able to overcome the differences fate has put in their lives -- has fate forgotten them?  Now, this is the kind of story Zachary Adrian could write.    Since there is no photo or author information on this writer, I am wondering if she has a non deplume.  FOUNTAIN OF DREAMS was the first in this trilogy (about Amelia and Niels on a dangerous mission).  FOUNTAIN OF FIRE (about Clio and William) completed this series.  Sounds like Rosemary Rogers to me.  Earlier, she had written a Medieval trilogy about Akora including DREAM ISLAND, KINGDOM OF MOONLIGHT, and CASTLES IN THE MIST.	2005-05-12

Valhalla looks spectacular on the outside, so much so that anyone would want to visit there.  The second balconies look so inviting, and that middle tower like something Cape Cod would have for the wives to watch for the returning boats.  Not exactly like a widows' walk, but fabulous just the same.    I used to read a lot (I mean much) horror when I was younger and my nerves were in stronger condition.  There is nothing like being so scared that you have to tell others about the book you are reading.  I still go to the occasional horror movie and do enjoy the scariest parts.      However, this 'house that Jack built' reminded me of the happenings at Red Rose where a psychic had to be called in, and it was more gory than this.  Jack Belias was a legend in his own time, a gambler who was dealt a stacked deck.  He perhaps had the King of Hearts missing; and so his retaliation will linger for centuries.  The ambience, along with the psychic vibrations, are what make a good thriller and this book lives up to the hype.    Graham Masterton's photo looks like he must have in 1976 when his first horror book was published and became a Tony Curtis (wasn't he so handsome?!) film, THE MANITOU.  Since then, he has made a prolific career with this genre; I feel that it could be his Polish connections which vibrate throughout this fantastic story.	2005-05-11

David's dreams and delusions seemed so real to him and Danny in their new home which had been an orphanage in the 19th century.  There is an adjoining cemetery with an assortment of 60-70 elaborate gravestones and a small, abandoned Gothic chapel across the stream from the back garden.  In this garden near the back gate there stands a marvelous sundial near the rose arbor.  The 'thing' in the attic is causing them nightmares.    There was a recent (2003) novel by Michael Crichton with this same title.  Thus, when I saw it on sale, I thought at first it was his until I remembered THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.  This horror story was released almost ten years earlier in Britian and is not about scary monsters of animals or cloned dinosaurs.  It is scary, full of ghostly figures and apparitions.  SHIVERS calls this book \\"one of the most disturbing novels I've read.\\"   Not so, it's not disturbing -- it's just a restless soul seeking redemption.  Apparently the old woman had osteoporsis, as she was all bent over.    It is legend that if a person dies under mysterious circumstances or is killed by persons unknown, his spirit lingers behind until someone discovers the secret.  Like the movie THE GRUDGE, these restless spirits neeeded redemption and the truth to come out concerning their deaths.  It reminded me of the cable-t.v. movie of a house which lured people there but lived off the occupants.  When one died, the plants were more vivid and healthy.  Now, that was scary.    Graham Masterton has mastered his art in the horror genre.  If you like to feel shivery and get that heart beating fast, this is the book for you.  I take back what I wrote in another review about his Polish connections.  He is a gem who found his niche.	2005-05-11

This funny (and sometime sad) memoir of a midlife crisis, a man remembering the past and wondering what it would have been -- if only he had made some different choices, chosen the other fork in the road.  He quotes Joe E. Lewis, \\"You only live once but, if you work it right, once is enough.\\"  He feels he is a man with no regrets, but we all have regrets, for saying the wrong word, for reacting in a bad way to a slight, and for marrying the wrong person.    He starts out with two short stories; the first about Jeff Besos, founder of Amazon.com who used basic logic to start a new frontier in his life.  Thank God for Amazon.com!   The second was about George Plimpton in New Mexico about chasing bats and a t-shirt too small.  This is a story about missed opportunities.  He had a mixed-bag journey and lived an 'adventure in possibilities.'      He said, there is 'no sadder story than that of \\"small regrets'' -- I've had some large regrets, so he's way ahead of me in the game of life experiences.  He feels his actions were most accidental, and wished he'd had 'another shot' and ponders life's lottery -- could it have been better?  God gave us 'free will' to develop our own potential.  If we fail to carry through, it is only because we took the wrong fork in the road of life.    In these twenty chapters, the most important events, he revisited crossroads in hopes of reliving them.  We can do that without getting out of our own homes, just get old enough and you will constantly relive what was important and eventful and ALWAYS wish you had done something different.  But then, we wouldn't be the person we are now, as life experiences make the man.    Don't we all wish we had acted or reacted differently at times of crisis, and wonder if we could have been happier.  No one is really happy these days.  Our ancestors accepted their 'lot' in life, but mine weren't happy to have been born poor.  Are the rich happy -- only at times!  Money does not insure happiness now or in thepast.  Oh, it helps to have the good things in life at your fingertips, but they are just objects.  They are not life.  Only accomplishment and fulfillment at any age can truly be termed happiness.  Be proud of what came your way as it won't come again.    I value certain people, not the many possessions I lug around.  The past is in the past and cannot be resurrected.  I was happy once, the few years I sang on several local talent shows on radio, television, and on the stage of the Tennessee Theatre (back then in my youth).  It didn't matter then whether you were from a wealthy family or a railroad man's household.  Talent is talent.  I was happy again when my first child was such a delightful, bright, beautiful extension of myself.  He's always thought he inherited his curiosity and intelligence from his dad!  Wrong -- as was the second one feeling that his writing ability came from his English teacher dad.  I told him when he first started that it had come from me.  Did he listen, did  he believe, of course not!    Well, I was rewarded with the 'postscript', born 13 years after his brothers.  He wasn't my 'Ligeia' but finally someone just like me!  Later, his daughter Chrissy was proof of the gene pool-- like her grandmother in many ways, even looks.  You can't fool Mother Nature.  Well, her outgoing personality and spark put the eight-yr.old me in the shade.    Joe Kite, a seasoned journalist, has traveled the world (and didn't have to pay for any of it), had life experiences we all would give 'an arm and a leg' for.  And yet, he questioned how different choices might have made him happier.  Not in the romance department -- he found his soulmate and is still married to the mother of his children.  They live in Pennsylvania, but his voice does not have the harshness in speech as my sister-in-law who was from that area.  Believe me, they are as different from a Southerner as black and white.  He sound like a delightful person to know.  Previously, he had publishedWISDOM OF OUR FATHERS.  Now, this 'running around in his mind' memoir is full of his own wisdom.	2005-05-11

If Ken Young and his mothre were not such devotees of Sylvia Browne, I would be skeptical of her claims in the introduction to this book, and be certain that she'd crossed over for sure.  I had some vivid dreams lately caused by a medication my body and mind could not tolerate, so I have an idea of what she experienced.  Mine, though, were clear and nothing superimposed, but then I'm not a psychic, nor even come close to wanting to be. <br /> <br />If we know what is in store for us, we'd all cringe and some not want to live.  My twenty-yr-old grandson has just died in a car accident.  Could I have save him had I been psychic?  My young friend, Ken Young, wrote in an e-mail to me: <br /> <br /> \\"I believe that all things in this world happen for a reason - whether it's from our own design, before we come to this Earth, or be it from God's will. \\" <br /> <br />Now in her elder years, Sylvia is becoming prophetic about Space Travel.  All of that 21st Century bunk we were led to believe would occur didn't.  People are still driving vehicles on Interstates which use gasoline.  None are using Space vehicles as in the 'Jetsons' t.v. show. <br /> <br />From Extraterrestrials to Mystical Travelers:  I've had one in my life, too, like Jared -- only Miran was only four when God decided she was needed elsewhere.  She had a great impact on my damaged life as I was suffering from PTSS when she appeared.  She showed me love through her beauty and shining aura and letting me share her short life for only a short time on earth.  I have believed for more than thirty years now that they are here among us, but I've called them 'aliens.'  I didn't recognize Miran as one but I do know that I've met some here in Knoxville these past five years.  They are advanced ans so skilled at subterfuge and camouflage you'd never look twice -- as humans don't all look alike, but they let certain people know in vague ways.  My son met one named Stanley in 1975 who told me that spirits hover around usall the time and, when you feel an itch in your hair, it isn't dandruff but one having a bit of fun. <br /> <br />You must be perceptive or it can 'fly over your head.'  It doesn't take intelligence or sensitivity to realize the advanced knowledge they possess.  Most don't look like normal people.  The one I knew took Dolly Parton as the human to emulate, except for the blonde wig. <br /> <br />Some predictions:  2012, a successful manned exploration of Mars led by extraterrestrial physicists on the NASA team; 2030, extraterrestrials out of the closet to take us on chartered moon junkets; 2040, moon base for visits, sightseeing trips in the solar system; 2080, explorations to other planets. <br /> <br />Sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us appreciate what we've got.  It's too bad she won't be around to see how these things are received.  I won't, either, but she's older than I.  Maybe if I wore a blonde wig, I wouldn't look my age, either.  But I refuse to wear false eyelashes. <br /> <br />Last year I sent the audio of her HEALING YOUR BODY, MIND AND SOUL  to my young friend for his 25th birthday, as he was having a bad time and needed encouragement.  It was his best gift, he said, and he would gladly share it with his mom.  He's a good son.	2005-05-10

In this adventure, Richard Hannay is aided in his mission of his undercover work by Greenmantle (modeled on American Aubrey Herbert).  The writer, John Buchan uses his experiences as assistant private secretary to the British High Commissioner in South Africa (1901-1903).  He was literate, wrote adventure novels of three separate series.  He wrote this story while serving in the Intelligence Corps during WWI (1916) in France.      He was born in Scotland, the son of a minister.  He was a lawyer and partner in Thomas Nelson & Son publishing house in Edinburgh in 1907.  In 1935, he was appointed Governor-General of Canada and died in Montreal in 1940 before I was born.    Richard and his group must undermine a Holy War in the Near East of Muslims against the British.  As they work on this goal of preventing vast disaster, they are miraculosly aided by the Russian Sossack calvary.  \\"Then I knew that the prophecy had been true -- that their prophet had not failed them.

Tommy Tenney traveled around the world as an itinerant minister for twenty years.  He is a prolific writer residing in Louisiana with his family.  In this smll book, he seeks ways to understand what happened on 9-11, 2001, in American.  That was a warning that the United States can not got onto foreign soil and force evil and corrupt leaders to change their ways of life.  This warning has not been heeded, and we are still over there, where we don't belong and the whole country may go up in flames becasue of an egostical U. S. President who loves the limelight. <br /> <br />We cannot \\"police\\" the world and don't have the ethical right to go into a country tow hundred backwards but much richer in resources and \\"make them\\" give up their way of life.  If you see the movie, KINDGOM OF HEAVEN, you will come to understand the history of wars in the Holy Land at the time of the Crusades.  Wars (religious and otherwise) have continued in that God forsake land and will continue until the end of time.  If God did not want the 5,000 \\"innocent souls\\" to be instantly snuffed out in the manner in which it happened, why did He allow it to happen at all?  The Bible was written for the years B.C. and not for 2005 A.D.  with the current crises and turmoil. <br /> <br />When all those people died in New York and Pennsylvanic, I learned that the hamangioma on my liver was not situated in an area to burst and cause internal bleeding -- and I was not dying right away.  I had a new lease on my life, buy all those folks died a useless, tragic death because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br /> <br />You can preach until the cows come home, but if God did not want the United States of America to learn a lesson perhaps the terrorism would not have developed into such hatred toward this country.  God had nothing to do with it!  They died; I live.  My twenty-yr-old grandson Tristan has just died in an automobile accident.  Why him?  Why not me?  We can't fathom death, but we can work to keep this kind of killing from happening again.  We can bring our military men home before they are all killed on foregin land. <br /> <br />Watch KINGDOM OF HEAVEN if possible, written by William Monohan, and you will learn that their God is not our God!  They are not understanding and sharing people -- they don't hve God in their hearts.  Look at how low Saddam sank before he was found hiding in a hole like an animal.  America should work to be the best example of God-fearing people for the sake of its existence.  Else we may be blown to smitterens by heathens. <br /> <br />Paul F Crouch of TBN wrote a short, inspiring foreword.  Tommy Tenney attempts to use funeral and biblical references to influence the reader to 'know what to do and what to say.'  But Do You Know WhomTo Trust?  Will God really save us, or is He on their side in the War of Worlds?  We will soon know the way things are happening over there.	2005-05-10

Yes, there have always been wars, and God can't be on both sides.  In the movie, GODS AND GENERALS, God refused to take sides in the Civil War.  In KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, it seemed that God had deserted the person who would not sell his soul.    What we believe affects the way we live and influence others.  When an immoral person slanders you, is that God's love.  Why would he allow such a grevious act.  Does God love everyone, those who toil to do right and those whose enjoyment is in hurting innocent people.  Where is God when this happens -- has he taken sides?  There are definitely devils among us and feast on the hurt of innocents.    Why so many hateful people who delight in hurting others in the world today, is it because they are hurting inside?  What's this world coming to, so much fear and worry, trouble, combative ugly entities?  We need a few gracious Christians.  Not just in church on Sunday but every day of the week, every moment of the day.     If God is love, how can He be so judgmental and cause pain to those who do no harm?  How does he allow such a thing as 9-11 to happen in the first place -- why didn't He have the power to divert those planes?  If He is God, He could have!    Written by two Quaker preachers to prove that God loves us all even the evil ones who harass and threaten us.  They believe that God will save every person.  I was involved in a heated exchange on the public bus about the power of Jesus.  The other combative participant shouted that Jesus loves everybody.  And I just as emphatically replied that the people she was praising don't believe in Jesus, are not Christians, are here in this country while their countrymen are killing Americans.

I bought this book because it reminded me of the two Jack Finney novels of this period (many years apart, for marvelous detail and atmosphere): TIME AND AGAIN (1970) & FROM TIME TO TIME (1996).  I think we're all fascinated with Jack the Ripper and the stalker who preyed on prostitutes on the streets of London.  Who was he really?<br /><br />Eighteenth century has an allure we'd love to emulate.  How wonderful if the U.S.A. women would decided to dress as those of that era instead of being blatantly (half naked) indecent -- makes one wonder if they are that sex-crazed.<br /><br />Since my son is an astronomer, I learned things from Ms. Redfern he knows but never had the time to share.  The stars in the firmament and the universe we saw from early space exploration with its many planets can't be beat.  One of my cats was named Comet, and his daughter is Star.  appropriate?<br /><br />Crime always is a good attention getter.  Politics haven't progressed remarkedly over the 150 years, but British are different from that in the United States.  That's what the American Revolution was all about, freedom to govern ourselves as need be.<br /><br />We are as different from the British as the French or Portugese and need politicians elected democratically to \\"serve the people\\" so that we can have input into government.  That is not the fact in England or the Communist countries.<br /><br />And music -- that's been the main element in my life; ethereal as in the spheres but more the ballads of the Fifties, and some big band.  No one in modern America could beat John Williams.  He does the Star War films and other blockbusters.  When this story is transfered into visual images, he would be the best to present 'The Music of the Spheres.'<br /><br />Ms. Redfern is a teacher (astronomy or history?) in England.  This is her first novel.  Her subsequent novel is AURIEL RISING (2004) in which she goes further back in time.	2005-05-10

This is a three-month day-to-day guide to help you lose weight (or you could try the South Beach diet, only this is healthier), strengthen and tone your muscles, be healtheir and stronger, and add years to your life as a consequence.    On day One, you start out with a ten-minute walk by merely walking five minutes, turning around and when you get home, your first workout will be complete.  Pace yourself and go slow in the beginning.  Try to increase in speed as it does help your heart to put a little 'good' strain on it.  It takes discipline, perseverance and the desire to do something positive for your own health and well-being.    As you pick up the pace, it burns the calories and gives the heart a more complete workout.  But do not overdo, or the stress can be harmful and cause heart palpatiations.  Use good judgment; no one can feel how the exercise is affecting you but yourself.    By day 75, you are walking for 25 minutes.  This book guides the participant through the routine and suggests that you find out what's right for you.  Don't do anything in excess: exercise, eating, drinking, or trying to increase the walking speed too swiftly.     After you reach the three-month goal, and stuck with it, you will have realized the healthful benefits and 'rejuvenated spirit' that regular, daily activity brings to your life.  I had my own personal trainer, Vic, for a month, and he taught me the leg and balance exercises I needed to personalize the routine.  With this book, you move at your own pace but do try to keep up day-by-day.   It will be worth all the effort and sweat in the end.    Mark Fenton has experience with the Olympic Training for Racewalking and is senior editor for 'Walking' magazine.  Seth Bauer is 'Walking' editor-in-chief, and won a bronze medal for the 1988 rowing team and a former world-champion rower.  They make a good team.	2005-05-06

Some mysterious deaths, starting with young Duncan Grover from Denver (who'd journeyed to Bear Lake Valley on a vision quest) upset the status quo among the inhabitants of the Wind River Indian Reservation, located thirty miles north of Denver.  A medicine man (shaman), Gus, tries to persuade the natives that evil spirits sent by the Thunder order had murdered (or at least caused) the death.  He convinced the police that it was just a chance happening, a suicide.    However, there had been a witness to the tragic death who gave details in a confessional to the Irish priest, which is considered 'confidentail' information, not to be repeated even to the police.  Thus, Father O'Malley finds himself in a dilemma.    Lexcon has found methane gas in different spots throughout the Reservation, and the \\"Boss' thought that Grover must have discovered what was going on.  Why else would he camp out so long on that cliff,  observing things from on high?  He'd been deep in meditation with no food and was lightheated and unobservant as he walked toward the edge of the cliff.  The police had determined it had been a case of suicide and not accidental, and no longer investigated.  Actually, he had been hit in the side of the head with an iron rod by these underlings and thrown over the cliff below the crude carving (looks like an alien) called Thunder in the boulder.  He didn't know what hit him or why!      Only after the confession, did the possibility of murder surface.  Vicky is summoned via an anonymous phone call, but the caller was killed in a hit-and-run accident before she could get there from Denver.  When it comes to big oil companies, anybody is expendable.  For this story, Ms. Coel sought the services and expertise of geologists and an archaeologist.    She has written a series which includes THE EAGLE CATCHER, THE GHOST WALKER, THE STORY TELLER, THE DREAM STALKER, and THE LOST BIRD.

It doesn't appear to be autobiographical and yet, who knows.  First novels are based to some extent on one's life experiences.      A lifetime ago, (in 1976), growing up in the suburbs of Washington, D. C., on the Virginia side, the sisters had been close especially the last year of Marcy's high school growing-up period.  She idolized her big sister who was off in college.  Her essay about how much she admired her sister is the last page of this book.  She'd always made Marcy feel like the 'ugly duckling' as all the boys would swoom over Cleo with her 'goddess' figure, driving the red mustang convertible dressed in sexy clothes.    \\"On the day Cleo's husband was buried, a sudden thunderstorm struck without warning.  Ligtning danced like ghosts on the bay.\\"  Two day previously, a thunderstorm had come into San Francisco out of nowhere and the bolt of lightning had blinded him, causing him to lose control of the car.  At least, that is Cleo's story.  What is it with this 'rain' thing?    Now that she is a rich widow, with a troubled teenage son, Luke, and a ten-month-old daughter, June Moon.  She challenges Marcy to come and stay with her through the adjustment period.  Cleo is an exotic dancer who had been married to an older, balding man.  \\"Our mother had often pointed out that Cleopatra had inherited her beauty from out grandmother.    And yet, the real Cleo with her dark side had surfaced from time to time that pivotal year in D. C. (like the delinquents in the 2002 movie, 'Better Luck Tomorrow') when she began to show symptoms of their important father's mental illness.  He traveled a lot and sent home postcards to the girls.    As Marcy develops a friendship with Luke and little Junie Moon, she remembers how great (and at times bad) her adolescence had been and she is disturbed all over again about what will become of the children.  Will they survive?  The bad memories of Cleo drunk and abusive, all those things \\"came back tome like a bad song on the radio.\\"   This book reminds me of the Liza Minelli movie in which she played \\"Junie Moon.\\"    Previously, I reviewed her sister, Ginger Park's novel, TO SWIM ACROSS THE WORLD; the photo of the two sisters on the inside flap is candid, with Frances by far the prettiest.  Together, they wrote a children's book, MY FREEDOM TRIP, about their parents' move to America from North America.	2005-05-05

The first line in the Prologue grabbed me, \\"It always rains when a child dies.\\"  It was a wet day when the body was found near Mount Rose Road.      Written by a young, sensitive, descriptive writer from St. Paul, who had decided to educate us about some mysteries which happened in his town.  Thus begins a mystery within a mystery which goes back to the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932.  Will history repeat itself?  Or has it already happened on the other side of the country?  That seems to be the case in the blizzard of 1982, almost fifty years to the time young Charles was killed.    He writes, \\"Dogwoods gushing pink and white decorated the hilltops like a giant birthday cake.\\"  In Knoxville, the whole month of April is devoted to worshipping the dogwoods, which is the only time this scruffy little \\"city\\" basks in the glorious surroundings.  This too has been occurring for fifty years.  What a coincidence, I wonder if Mr. Thayer has visited one of the yearly Dogwood Festivals here.  Our Bradford Pear trees paved the way with beauty.  Now the birds have returned but not as in previous years, as our downtown park was transformed into vast ugliness and an artificial owl placed in a nearby parking lot with a head that swivels and eyes that shine, to scare the lovelies away.  This town dislikes trees almost as much as birds, as they continually cut them down in the business district and drive the birds away with an awful 'bird in distress' noise on the federal building and at the entrance to one of the Malls.  That's why we have as much air pollution as in Los Angeles.    It is May but the festivities are over as all the green leaves have replaced the blossoms.  This is the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains where beauty abounds everywhere, but the town here at the bottom is old-fashioned and stuck in the past.      The little boy's body was discovered by a trucker who took a code 10-7 (bus driver code for rest stop) and thought he had found a little green Martian.  There is such a thing as the Body Farm where human corpses are left out in the elements to observe the phases of decomposition.   We do have a statue of a famous Russian composer in a newly developed park near the University -- on the old World's Fair Park where the world came to us in 1982.    Steve Thayer has previously written THE WEATHERMAN, SAINT MUDD, WOLF PASS, and MOON OVER LAKE ELMO.  He's a very good writer, quite entertaining.	2005-05-04

Memory is faulty.  \\"Even when we remember events accurately, we are apt to misidentify their places in the casual tapestry of our lives.\\"  It wasn't anything in childhood which influenced psychologist Steven Pinkier to pursue his dreams or career, or take a certain path.  I think that fate has some place in what we become and do at a particular phase in our lives.  It was in grad school when his interest in language became the focus for his career in vocabulary and grammar, my special interests, too.    Just like a man, when he is confronted with a question or situation he isn't expecting, he just nods -- therefore, no real \\"thinking\\" takes place.  For a psychology professor, he has a strange way of thinking about truth, changing his viewpoint as the whim hits him.  He feels that childhood influences don't steer a \\"curious mind\\" in a certain direction.  Usually we find our niche in life quite acccidentally.    Most of us don't know what we will become (when suffering through childhood) nor any way to deflect what the future has in store for us.  Happenstance has a way of steering us in a direction we might not want to go.  We never know when life will throw us a curve ball.    The old hometown is full of transplants and aliens interested only with making big money, not in promoting \\"curious minds\\" of children to become scientists.  Thomas Wolfe was right, \\"You can't go home again.\\"  Because home is where you are, not the place you were born.  That's a myth -- an illusion.  Nothing is ever the same.  No one is ever there to greet you or welcome you \\"home.\\"    These essays include stories by Howard Gardner on making a social scientist, Doyne Farmer (physics), Steven Strogatz (math), V. S. Ramachandran (science), no big names, no one I've heard of, but they have been successful enough in their diverse fields to be included in a social science assortment.    John Brockman's books include SPECULATIONS, CREATIVITY, and  HOW THINGS ARE, all of which decide who we are as individuals and what we become as adults.  He's been busy writing, editing and co-editing.  He owns a software agency in New York City.  What I am wondering is why he didn't become a scientist with his \\"curious mind.\\"	2005-05-03

The most famous historical mysteries contain a large amount of contradictory evidence; most cannot be solved in actuality.  Mysteries of disputed identity have ancient origins and are based on medieval folk tales.  Nineteenth Century romantic history was built on these legends because the aristocracy liked mystifications and conundruns, plus their prevailing literary taste.  The writer of historical mysteries presented his subject matter within the boundaries set by the traditional Gothic novel.    The Little Prince died in France after his parents, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI had been put to death on the guillotine during the Revolution.  Rumors surfaced that the Royalists had saved him, and more than a hundred 'pretenders' claimed to be the Lost Dauphin.    Other mysteries in this volume by Dr. Bondeson include a duke whose country estate had a maze of tunnels in the basement, who possibly had a double life as a furniture shopkeeper with a separate family (Emperor or hermit), Kasper Hauser in Germany, Duke of Baker Street in London, and others.  Rumors about George III's bigomy were boundless.      Some of these mysteries of 'disputed identity' developed into national enigmas, based on folklore and romantic fantasy.  Thus is history.  He explains his summations thusly: \\"What is it about these tales of lost heirs, secret marriages, and immortal monarchs (who) turned into immortal mysteries (which) engage the minds of millions?\\"  I was disappointed that he left out the case of Anastasia in Russia.  I love the cover pictures of those he did write about, so true to life -- as it was back then.	2005-05-03

According to Oriental philosophy, going back to the 12th century, the bull represents life, energy, truth, and action.  But once found,  the bull cannot be tethered; he must be free.  Describes us Taurus-born people to a \\"T.\\"    A person should indulge in the process of seeking insight and finding himself.  If you go down false paths into dead ends, away from your true nature, you suffer loneliness and despair.  If you get lost along the way, you find disappointments, confusion, pain and fears.      American society is based on a person's wealth and possessions.  He started questioning, \\"If man is his 'things,' what happens to him when he loses them or they are taken from him?\\"   That is a perplexing illumination to ponder.    He feels that life is a trip, not a goal; and often a person becomes 'fixed' so much on the end that he totally missed life as it should have been.  He decided to take The Way Of The Bull to find his purpose in life.    Life isn't the goal; it's the voyage in a creative existence -- in wonder, joy, peace and love.  If you stick with the Way and learn from those you meet on your travels, it will lead you back to yourself, the only place where you can ever become.  Feel free to explore other societies and places to help you grow along the way.    In this part of his journey through Life, he visited folks in Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Ceylon, India, Bali, Hong Kong, Saigon, Calcutta, and Nepal.  Sounds like one of Paul Theroux's travel books?  Buscaglia has written numerous books on the subject of Love, Personhood: Art of Being Fully Human, The Fall of Freddie the Leaf, and Bus 9 to Paradise.	2005-05-02

I saw the cover of this paperback with the sewing form (hour-glass figure) on a stand like my coatrack.  This was the first in a series for Harlequin, a new \\"Flipside\\" line by different writers, using romantic comedy 'with an attitude.'     This is another Francesca (the original was in Waller's BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY), but this one is only 29+ years old.  She'd been engaged already three times due to Josephine's arrangements and Francie's inability to say \\"No\\" -- until she gets cold feet.  Well, she doesn't ride a Greyhound bus from Atlanta to Albuquerque, but always manages to get out of the mess in which she finds herself.    She had vowed to 'stay single,' until Mark decided to use his own, modern way to lure her.  Will she take the bait?  The tables are turned on him as he never meant to fall in love.  She'd decided that 'staying single' was highly overrated.    Millie Criswell has more titles available on Amazon than anyone else I've looked up.  She went on to write SUDDENLY SINGLE as a follow-up.  The cover has a burgundy stand underneath the dummy form.  Lisa, 27-yr. old sister of Francie, had eloped but got cold feet 'after' the wedding and returned home to find herself in 'hot water.'  This Morelli family is peppered with colorful characters.    Millie has written over twenty-five romance novels (fluff, mostly) and has two million books in print.  Quite prolific for a late-starter.  She won the \\"Maggie\\" award and the Dorothy Parker Award of Excellence.	2005-05-02

Too bad -- he's a good singer; I had his CD but gave it to a 'friend' and wish I still had it!  This book pushes the First Amendment concerning the freedom of the press.  Funny, I thought it was all about freedom of speech.  I have invoked it on more than one occasion.  Jim Batten was CEO of Knight Ridder until his death in 1999.  Now, they have a medal in his memory.  Tony Ridder became CEO and his brother, Peter, is in charge of the TRIBUNE. <br /> <br />Greed may do what radio, television, or the iNternt weren't able to do in the demise of newspapers.  Readers don't have respect now as they are not given the full story.  Newspapers \\"compromise\\" on what they will print and use mainly what will sell papers for t hem.  They are not in the business of public service but for a \\"for profit at any cost\\" not caring how omissions  can cause distress to those left out.  This single-minded pursuit of profit in the media game as \\"watering down\\" of newspaper journalism. <br /> <br />Local t.v. stations are the opposite, constantly adding more newscasts; the public can't get enough.  The latest was a 4 p.m. addition on one station (8) to compensate an \\"older\\" female anchor so they could get by with hiring a younger one who sounds like a kid in the early morning slot.  They teamed the transient one with a sports reporter, and it works.  They compete with a younger couple on Channel 10 who have a full hour of local news and events.  At 5 p.m. Channel 6 gets into the fray.  They are number one.  Eight is on again at 5:30 and 7 p.m. with different anchors.  All three are on the air at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. <br /> <br />Daily newspapers (most are not locally owned) are harming the public they are meant to inform.  This \\"complete\\" flow which we all need to \\"govern\\" ourselves is on the brink of drying up.  Knight Ridder is the second-largest news company after Scripps Howard which owns the News-Sentinel in my hometown.  This is the paper which doen't like to admit they have made an error; they refused to admit they need to correct a lapse in full coverage.  In fact, they hired the old guy who left out the decade of the '50s in the coverage of the Tennessee Theater. <br /> <br />In 1974 (the year my last child was born), Knight merges with Ridder Publications.  Since then, things have gone from bad to worse.  Our \\"rights\\" are being limited as certain facts or matters are dropped for financial reasons.  Buzz is right \\"on target\\" by informing the public about this situation. <br /> <br />His newspaper career spanned forty years and he was Senior Editor of 'The Wichita Eagle' when he retired in 1999.  He's not the only former newsman to take on the big syndicates, but he tells the stories (facts) in a way we can understand.  After all, journalism is on a third grade level.  Fifty years ago, many adults didn't get past 3rd grade but in 2005 we have more PhDs and lesser college grads floating around out there -- trying to figure out why there's so little \\"news\\" in the local daily paper. <br /> <br />He feels that \\"the kind of journalism\\" which \\"gave rise to -- and preserves -- our democracy will disappear.  Many people are unhappy and starting to let the press know how bad it is to let Morgan Stanley take over a \\"free press.\\"  One spectacular thing about the book is the larger print.  Man, it is hard to read the newspapers these days, not just because the print is so small some folks have to use a magnifier -- the quality of recycled paper is a disgrace.  On a 'note of caution' about the results of Buzz's research, contact your local daily paper and COMPLAIN.  It probably won't make much difference but, at least, you'll feel better for getting your right to make a statement.	2005-05-01

This memoir is full of reflections of the time he spent almost thirty years ago in the Arctic where he'd gone to listen to an old man tell \\"stories,\\" myths, folk tales, some of which I think he made up.  It is about a Japanese woman eleven years older (had the ages been reversed, it might (probably would) have made a difference) than he, who is also there to translate the same stories into Japense for a publishing concern.  They formed a close relationship and he learned from her and her battle with cancer.    The old man, Frank, tells  his myths and how he understood the fable of Noah and the Ark from our HOLY BIBLE.  He enjoys Helen's mannerly presence, but there is friction flavored with antimosity toward Howard.  He wants to make sure that he will be paid for his knowledge.  Both men, young and old, are influenced by her quiet ways and intelligent interpretations.  Helen discovers her illness while on this project.  Howard is there for research purposes on behalf of a Michigan museum.    In 1998, NORTHERN TALES: STORY FROM NATIVE PEOPLES OF THE ARCTIC AND SUB-ARTIC REGIONS is published and it is the basis of this short tome about his feelings toward the other writer.  Helen is his most \\"unforgettable character.\\"  He won't admit that he loved her, only that he held her on a pedestal of sorts.  It is sad to read how they interrelated and helped each other to understand the old Eskimo's tales as he transcribed them into English and she in her native Japanese.    He seemed overwhelmed by the fact that they came from opposite ends of the earth and met in the cold Arctic region on a literary job.  She types her notes on an old-fashioned Remington typewriter similar to the one on the cover of this book; he kept his in notebooks written in longhand.  What he did reveal was the nature of their friendship of an older woman and younger male and how much it meant to him.  Had she not died, perhaps fate would have been nicer.    After Helen's death, Howard went on to marry and settle in Vermont but he would never forget this lovely woman who had influenced him in many ways.  He has written THE NORTHERN LIGHTS, THE MUSEUM GUARD, and others.  Now this Fond Remembrance of Helen, a truly remarkable woman.	2005-05-01

Read this book for success stories from a selct list of best selling, 'successful' writers.  I have my own list of favorites, none of which were included, so... <br /> <br />Sometimes it takes fate to intervene in the guise of another best-selling author to help get the newcomer through the gates of the mighty publishing house.  For Paul Theroux, one of my favorites, it was V. S. Naipaul whom he later criticized in a best-selling book, SIR VIDA'S SHADOW.  I wrote to him trying to get him to come to Pulaski to research KKK to write a novel about the first one (which wasn't 'bad' at all) and told him how 'weird' I thought his first published book was because the subject matter was so far out.  Now, it has been a scandal in the Catholic Church; so I guess it was based on his personal experience growing up in Cape Cod. <br /> <br />For second generation writers like Martin Amis, it is just 'heritage'; his father, Kingsley Amis, a weird character but a best-selling novelist in Britain was successful.  I don't know why!  This is only one example from my recent reading.  It could be 'name recognition,' like Peter and Jane Fonda's reminiscenes, not for their acting abilities or movies but because of their famous father, Henry. <br /> <br />For novelists, what brings uniqueness and zest to their stories is 'life experience' -- what they've seen and heard during the course of everyday existence, and what they have observed from people they encounter along the way.  That's why I love 'first novels' -- they are based on something the author needed to get out of his system, and we all know that the best way to do that is to write it down, longhand, typewriter, or computer -- doesn't matter. <br /> <br />After I read BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY by James Robert Waller (another of my favorites), I wrote to him and asked if it could be based on truth and I loved it mainly because it was written by a man \\"from a woman's point-of-view.\\"  It was absolutely marvelous!  On the book cover,he was quoted as having a happy marriage and used his wife in the subsequent novel after the success of his first.  I received a reply saying that parts of it were 'real' but he couldn't (or wouldn't) reveal which parts.  After he became famous because of this book, he wife and daughter all moved from iowa where he had been a college prof. to a large ranch in Texas, the marriage dissolved.  He is a good singer, I have the CD, and all of his subsequent books. <br /> <br />Like Gregory Macdonald (can't say he is a favorite, as I did not read any of his early successful books, but I like him as a person), a best-selling author of the FLETCH and FLYNN novels.  He moved to Giles County, Tennessee, from Boston (MY, what a culture change) when I was working as 'casual labor' at the local library and  Shirley Eubank, assistant librarian, and I gave him a big Southern welcome (\\"Welcome to our town!\\").  After he'd been there a while, he obtained a \\"vanity license tag\\" for his government-recycled jeep (\\"OldMacdonaldHadAFarm\\"-- clever, huh?)and he loved our rolling hills which revived his youthful attitute.  His wife, however, found the change too drastic from society life in Boston, Mass., and a divorce took place.  Both Macdonald and Waller (going through the midlife crisis) shared their wealth and farm-(ranch)life with younger, willing women who moved in with them. <br /> <br />A good literary agent is a necessary expense and can make the difference between staying the 'best local writer' to becoming known and appreciated on a national level.  A good editor can make a valuable asset by calling attention to your books at publishing houses. <br /> <br />It is important to be established as the publishers push best-selling authors' books because they are less risky in market sales than a new or mid-list author.  They don't want to lose money by having to turn over a large inventory of unsold books to DollarTree to sell to  us commoners for only $1.00.  When I recently found a fabulous $50 book by Peter Jennings for a dollar, I went back to buy two more for some family members.  The Gores have two or three on that list, and I've purchased theirs because of the Tennessee connection.	2005-04-30
258844:US	35985708	R1J61FL4PTG21J	0195173430	187716428	On Apology	Books	3	7	22	N	N	Please Say "I'm Sorry." Yell It If Need Be!	There are four parts of the apology process: acknowledgment, remorse, explanation, and reparation.  These were exemplified in Lincoln's 2nd inaugural address, concerning slavery, placing the blame on the whole country and not just the South.  This book is not just about personal relationships, but he probes into the war offenses by Germany and the United States' treatment of Japanese-Americans, both during WWII.    A grudge is a form of dormant anger sometimes over a trivial matter, such as making an insulting comment about someone's appearance; it's a combination of resentment and memory long after the \\"offense\\" has occurred.    When siblings squabble over a parent's estate and feels that one received or took more than he deserved or when they erroneously felt that responsibility for the care of a dying parent was not evenly shared, it's a big deal.  It is common for this grudge to be held for the remainder of their lives.  It's not caused by guilt but by a feeling of being wrongly treated by the \\"victor.\\"    To apologize for making a mistake or had used the wrong word which offended the other person causing emotional pain, apology is needed and works only if you value the person; otherwise, it is a useless gesture.  An apology has to be accepted for any forgiveness or healing of the wound however caused, deliberately or callously without meaning harm.  It caused humiliation and if not sincerely and honestly expressed, can prompt the \\"victim\\" to seek vengeance.  It is easy to apologize but not so easy to be gracious enough to put things back together again.    When I was going through a very painful experience of divorce twenty-five years ago, a friend's young daughter could not understand why I was unable to do what her family kept praying for, and I sat down on the back steps to explain to her that sometimes a person can hurt you so much (not physically) and you cannot live with them anymore.  She accepted my explanation but not the fact that their prayers were not answered.    A simple apology is not sufficient if emotional and verbal abuse had been consistent over a number of years.  Sometimes it takes a minor incident to be the 'straw which broke the camel's back.'  Prolonged stress and criticism cause more pain than physical abuse.  To ever heal, you have to remove the stressor and the only way to do that is through the courts.   It is easy to get married, but not so easy to divorce and ever trust another man.  After I suffered from chronic nerve pain for ten years, my abuser finally apologized for making fun of my pain and not believing it could possibly be so bad (after he had a back operation and had to give in and take pain pills), but it was too late to be accepted.  There's only so much humiliation a person can accept.    When a person refuses to apologize, he doesn't feel he's done anything wrong and instead has a real reason not to give in.  They say you can forgive but never forget when a person has intentionally hurt you to the core.  Sometimes there is no way to make reparation.    Dr. Lazare wrote an article on apology in 'Psychology Today,' very well received; thus, he's become a leading authority on the psychology of shame and humiliation.  He's a psychiatrist who taught at Harvard Medical School and now holds a position at the University of Mass. Medical School in Worcester.	2005-04-29

What's \\"real\\" to one person may not feel the same to another.  Three years ago I was having the time of my life writing to and receiving emails from a local (the 'best' in Knoxville) writer.  In a way, it went to my head that someone so 'brilliant' and 'erudite' would send me such long involved epistles.  Until, one day, when he'd concluded that he and I were speaking different languages.  Of course, we weren't, but we were on different levels, he in the literary use of some words and I in the factual above-board definition.  So, I took offense and retaliated 'in kind' which in turn caused him to accuse me of having 'moods.' Sounds familiar.  It has taken me until now to realize exactly what he was referring to, as the same words meant different things to each of us, and there is an age difference to make matters worse.  I now agree with his interpretation (from his stand point), but that does not make his version 'real' while mine is 'far out.'    This book shows ways to communicate verbally in easy-to-understand language, giving skills on the process to let your stressor know what he or she is doing wrong (some I can do, others I wouldn't want to -- because of Southern belief in humility and the Biblical belief not to hurt others on purpose.)  Yes, he hurt me in many ways with his accusations which I felt were 'unfounded.'      To bring some kind of peace to a relationship, volatile or otherwise, here are her seven \\"keys\\" in a nutshell.  Her instructions (not suggestions) are to start a conversation with \\"Hearing you say that, I feel...\\"; I want...; I have some feelings to clear.\\" (Don't we all!)  \\"I'm getting triggered (absurd -- how can that bring peace to any situation?); I hear you, and I have a different perspective (a woman never says that to a man she cares for!); Can we talk about how we're feeling?  (Now, that is a \\"no-no\\" when it comes to men!); but I do like this one, \\"I appreciate you for...\\"  Trouble is, they won't believe it when you get into a combative 'mood.'    Thoughts are worth sharing, but not demands or controls.  These are things, she says, we should not do: deny pain when you're hurting (no one else can feel your pain so why bring down their day with complaints!); being nice to avoid a hassle, keeping silent to avoid conflict (I don't agree with these as no one wants damaging emotional confrontations in a situation she can't handle.) and lying to protect someone else's feelings (preposterous! sometimes it is better to tell 'little white lies.')  Why hurt someone intentionally.    Mainly, you yourself must decide if it is a relationship you just can't live without.  Unclear communications and unexpressed discomfort about them are a major source of stress in our lives.  How often have you wasted energy worrying about what you should have said or wondering what someone really meant?  Why lose sleepless nights over a minor thing.  Major -- yes, it is worth some discomfort to work things out with the least damage to either participant.    Instead of saying what's real, we need to be real human beings with emotions, intellect, reasoning, bargaining power, understanding of the other's viewpoint, and \\"live and let live\\" response when it comes to fight or flight.	2005-04-29

A child of wealthy Hungarians, she was orphaned in America and had to survive on her own by her wits.  She died at the Arizona Pioneer's Home in Prescott on Nov. 7, 1940, a week short of her 90th birthday.    Born Mary Katherine Harony, she used several other names: Mary K. Cummings, Kate Fisher, Mrs. Silas Melvin, Mrs. Doc Holliday.   She latched onto a lot of men in her rambuctious way, but they just used her.  \\"I've tasted passion, love, pain, and sorrow in large doses and survived all of it...here I am, like a clay jar overflowing with memories, all of them as vivid as if they had just happened.\\"  Sounds like some dreams I had recently, interesting but disconcerting.    Traveling with a gambler, Anson McGraw, she met Wyatt Earp out West.  Six feet tall, with the coldest blue eyes, like rain ice in January, he was one of the handsomest men she'd ever seen.  The West was a hard place to live, especially if you start with nothing.  Charity didn't exist in those wild towns in the early days.  It was every man for himself and no room for a downtrodden woman.    She worked as 'one of the girls' in Wyatt's sister's saloon and bar, reminded me of \\"Miss Kitty\\" in 'Gunsmoke.'  When she went to Dodge to bail Doc out of jail (\\"he'd save me once; now it was my turn\\") she dressed as a man complete with knife and derringer.  She and Doc traveled to Denver and on to Deadwood where they teamed up with Wyatt, and there she met Calamity Jane.   Then on to Tombstone.  She gives a good account of her memories of the O.K. Corral shoot-out.    So much sorrow in the world:  \\"Wyatt with his memories (of his wife dying in childbirth in Missouri), Doc with his broken dreams and diseased lungs, me with my loneliness.\\"    The writer is a recipient of the Silver Spur Award, living on a ranch near the legenday town, Tombstone.  She has written similar stories and had many published.  As many cowboy movies as I have seen in my life (as a girl, my dad would put me in three different theaters around Market Square every Saturday to watch cowboy movies; later, I saw all the cowboy shows on television), this was still not an easy book to read.    She had a hard life but outlived them all.  Good for her.  This shows that it is not always the pure in heart or chaste who are rewarded with health and a long lifetime.  She did get her heart broken a few times, and was married on more than one occasion -- if you can believe all she remembers.  I have discovered that old people remember things as they \\"wish they had happened\\" not the actual events.  Life hasn't changed so much after all.	2005-04-28

In the late 1980s, the \\"central\\" bankers made one historic political break through rebuilding those international rules -- the world's first common standards for bank capital adequacy.  I'm sure  that is where Jake Butcher got the money to bring the 1982 World's Fair to Knoxville, Tennessee.  Probably what caused his and his brother's banking empires to crumble and fall a few years later and they exited this town in disgrace.    Howard Baker, from this area, and Japan's finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa (later Japanese prime minister) had struck another bilateral bargain: to elect George Bush in November, 1988.  Guess that's why we have so many Japanese students at UT, Knoxville?    Japan is called the world's largest creditor nation.  After we rebuilt Japan, now here we are having to borrow money from that country! Any sudden capital cut off from Japan was obvious.  If America went down, Japan's export-dependent economy was all but doomed to follow in what would be the economic equivalent of a nucelar WWIII, according to this journalist.  Steven Solomon traveled around the world twice and gained the 'confidence' of some of the people involved.    The U.S. - Japan tensions were symptomatic of a unique juncture in world economic history; for the first time, the world's reserve currency country was also its largest debtor.  They now own most of America, buying land and our movie and media industries.  The major electronics are manufactured there.  Junk (collectibles) are our major import from China.    Others playing roles back then include:  James Baker, Donald Regan, and G. William Miller, all were U. S. Treasury secretaries are various times; Arthur Burns and Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairmen; John Crow, governor of Bank of Canada, Citi Bank officials (thank goodness, David Sharp's bank is locally owned!).  In Europe, Margaret Thatcher, England's prime minister; German federal chancellors, officials of Bank of England, Bank of Italy, Bank of France; Swiss National Bank, and Denmark National Bank.    Solomon did marvelous personal research, and most of this money talk was above my head.  He was on the staff at 'Forbes' and had articles in 'Esquire,' 'Euromoney,' 'The Economist,' and 'The New York Times.'  I hope he will do a follow up as our economy and federal budget is in straits again and need some help desperately.  I just bet he could find the right people to get us 'up and going' again as a nation of first rank moneywise.	2005-04-28

This was an inspiring novel written for a special project to introduce young people to history.  Others in the series include HINDENBERG, 1937, SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE, 1906, WASHINGTON AVALANCHE, 1910.  This writer has out a series called DAUGHTERS OF LIBERTY, which looks interesting.    This one concerns a young 18-yr.old girl who ventured to Chicago after her family was killed in the Civil War in Georgia.  She takes on a disguise of a boy and acts in a small theater, sort like the Black Box Theater here where Actors Co-op and Word Players learn their craft.    She meets a young minister on a street corner who persuades her to help him create a shelter for the destitute called the Homeplace.  When he discovers that young William is indeed Ms. Katina, a fierce fire breaks out in Chicago and engulfs the city rapidly.  The only thing to survive that fire was the Water Tower on the North Side and it is still standing.  I have seen it.  I have been to Chicago where my son attended University of Chicago from freshman to Ph.D (a total of ten years).    She had been rescued but jumps overboard there at the Randolph Street Bridge right downtown and swims five feet to shore where she finds her way back to the Homeplace where she knows that Russell Cosgrove will find her.  This may have been made into a PBS movie, but I have not seen it.  It is a cute romance and the fire is exciting, as history does indeed sometimes make sense.    Ms. Massie is not a historian, nor does she claim to be.  She even admits that she has never been to Chicago, but suggests as reading background the books, THE GREAT FIRE by Jim Murphy and CHICAGO: GROWTH OF A METROPOLIS by H. M. Mayer and R. C. Wade.    This is a great series and has the purpose in the right place.	2005-04-27

His father, Kingsley Amis, won the Somerset Maugham award for his first novel, LUCKY JIM, in 1954.  In this same regard, he shared the same 'experience' with his dad in 1974 for his first book.    His father, a peculiar personna, refused to learn to drive (insisted on a chauffeur) or to fly (how'd he get to Nashville, Tennessee, from England), didn't like boats, either!  He was full of phobias and couldn't tolerate being alone in a bus, a train or a lift (I guess that's Britain's word for elevator?).  I had a similar father who refused to drive on the Interstates and married many times just so he would not have to 'live alone.'  The only times he was not married was when my bother and I were in high school and he had a woman who cooked for him, near his workplace, and after he lost all his money to a conniving wife and he ended up in a high-rise for the elderly, he accepted his 'lot.'  Even there, he always was able to find a woman to cook for him and be his friend.    Kingsley came to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1967 (a place we all know is called the 'Athens of the South' because of the Parthenon left over from a big thing out in Centennial Park) as a visiting professor with his second wife.  In his 1991 memoir, he made fun of the way we talk -- draw out the words.  In the South, we talk slower so that the words can be understood, unlike the British who run words together and tend to 'mouth' them -- while we 'articulate.'  I have concluded that Kingsley Amis was a snob whom I would not desire to meet.    It's too bad Martin was too busy to come to our part of the United States, a really beautiful place full of friendly people.  He did come to New York to have a tumor removed from inside his jaw, and that indepth report of dental procedures was morbid.  Because he was only 5'6\\", he'd developed a complex, causing him to become a \\"rebel.\\"  He was a cute boy and passable-looking adult, thus he was able to attract women, and men.  He grew up in boarding schools with the rich and aristocratic, but it gave him an inflated sense of self.  We are all created equal.  He'd fit right in here in Knoxville as the majority of natives are short, not necessarily thin.    He uses too many asides (footnotes) for continuity.   Why does he write such strange stories?  He lived a strange life, that's for sure -- unless this memoir is fiction.  His choices of reading material like LONELY HEARTS by Dennis Overbye must have affected his reasoning, and his over use of Valium (like his dad's reliance on hard liquor) shows some mental instability.  He had an ample supply of women (like father, like son in many ways) but showed photos of a friend, Bruno, who went from being a beautiful young man to the typical AIDS victim in the sketch of his death.      This was the brother of Isobel, to whom he dedicated this book, whose photo had eyes showing an empty soul.  In her glamor photo, her \\"medicated eyes\\" appear to show her as being on drugs?  You can tell a person's soul by his/her eyes, you know.  His photo section includes at least two pictures of an unnamed baby which he did not identify because of 'structural' reasons, but was probably his own child.    He flew high with British literary society because of his 'pedigree' (having a famous writer for a dad), but would never have been admired as a moral person in the United States.  He 'adopted' Saul Bellow and tried with Paul Theroux's mentor, V. S. Naipaul (who 'scuttled' instead of walking) but it didn't work.    His first cousin had been killed in 1973 by Fred West, one of Britain's most notorious serial murderers.  There are some photos of her in this memoir.  Her disappearance and discovery may have influenced some of his fiction.  He liked to use one-or two-word titles for some reason, like EISTEIN'S MONSTERS, TIME'S ARROWS, YELLOW DOG, MONEY, SUCCESS, EXPERIENCE (this one), and THE MORONIC INFERNO.  It is possible he may have sunk into Dante's Inferno at one point of his life, as he was always \\"searching\\" for(but apparently didn't find any) normality in his strange, evocative existence.  Which is so sad!	2005-04-27

Written by Tennessee State Historian Walter T. Durham, a distant cousin of my friend, Hal Durham who was from McMinnville, Tennessee and now Florida, he has published others since 1995 about Tennessee and his native county, Sumner.  He calls the subject of this detailed account Balie Peyton an American patriot.    First Peyton was on Jackson's side, then formed his own Whig party.  Then worked behind the scenes to maneuver national politics.  Andrew Jackson had laid the cornerstone for the city of Washington, D. C. Jan. 11, 1836.  Baile Peyton was born, raised, lived most of his life within a few miles from the Hermitage, antebellum home of \\"Old Hickory,\\" our distinguished President from the State of Tennessee.  Born in 1804 on a farm three miles from Gallatin, up the river a little ways from Jackson's grand home, and was buried on that same land on which he had been born in 1879.    Described as a great orator, highly skilled raconteur in politics and horseflesh; perhaps his greatest talent was public speaking.  Once he gave a \\"strong, taunting speech\\" -- my kind when I have the chance to give one -- and was passionate in many confrontations as he did have a temper, as do I.  Let's see, he must have been born in May.   \\"When he told a tale, his listeners were spellbound.\\"      He was a slave owner as was his neighbor there in Hermitage (yes, there is a town named that now so that folks can find this historical place -- and it is worth the trip to Nashville); but he loved the horses which he bred in that area of bluegrass from which they transplanted the grass and the thoroughbred horses from Kentucky.  He used both the slaves and the horses as 'studs', but not together!  Quite a feat for someone who was always involved in politics in Washington and other places.    Once he was in Texas when Sam Houston and Ohio Congressman had a dispute which ended in the court system.  Sam was charged with assault in 1832 because the Ohio politician had called him one of PresidentJackson's \\"bullies.\\"  A resolution in court declared Houston 'guilty of contempt of Congress' for his physical attack while William Stanbery was censured for \\"use of unparliamentary language.\\"  Sam had accused the Ohio man had made \\"wanton attacks\\" on his domestic relations, probably advertising Sam's festering groin injury; he testified that Stanberry had 'slandered' him in six newspaper columns and \\"refused ever to answer a polite note.\\"      \\"Modern\\" history was rewritten a few years later when A. W. Terrell wrote an article in which he'd added a squalid drinking party which included James K. Polk, another Tennessean who became U. S. President, and statesman, Balie Peyton.  Though he was a Southern Unionist (worse than a Union sympathizer!), his son John Bell Peyton, joined the Confederate Army and died in battle.    In 1879, Peyton was buried in the family cemetery on the farm where he'd been born seventy-five years earlier.  Graveside services were conducted by Rev. John Arbuthnot of Gallatin Presbyterian Church and the local Methodist preacher, Berkett Ferrell.  He had intervened to free Ferrell from incarceration during the Civil War and now \\"in a broader sense, the minister was returning the favor.\\"	2005-04-27

History today is written for entertainment value, either to sell books or lead into a movie deal.  The viewers and readers think they are reading what really happened, when a good deal of the 'interesting' parts were made up and didn't happen -- at least, not in the way they are presented.  We in America are constantly 'revising' our history, leaving out relevant activities and inserting things which didn't take place as promoted.  He admits as much with his diagnosis of a 1959 book, THE FUTURE AS HISTORY:  \\"I am struck by how much he (Bob Heilbroner) got right, as well as what he missed.\\"  Ommission is as bad as a downright lie or 'error' of judgment, but you can't convince the local newspaper or elderly 'historians' they have made a mistake by leaving something out. <br /> <br />We can say the same for his umpteen history books.  When Meriwether Lewis' 'suicide' was presented as fact and listed as history by him in UNDAUNTED COURAGE, I could not persuade a local historian how wrong he'd been.  Even though I have been in the actual building there on the Natchez Trace where Lewis died and seen the monument on which the word 'melancholy' was misleading, I still was looked on as not knowing what I was talking about.  When I read that, I too automatically thought 'maybe' it wasn't murder, but all the facts show it definitely was.  'Melancholy' back then wasn't the same as clinical depression today. <br /> <br />Every one of these nineteen chapters came from his preceding books on the same subjects.  Nothing new was added.   I was interested in the eight pages he devoted to Andrew Jackson, who was not an evil man, as one teacher here in Knoxville teaches her students! <br /> <br />It goes from the Founding Fathers (Washington and Jefferson) to Nixon's paranoia and resignation as president of the United States.  In between, he touches on U. S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and the war stories about  George Custerand Crazy Horse, the Creek Indians, War in Europe and the Pacific (D-day, 6-6-44 and Normandy (6-7-44 to 5-7-45), and Vietnam.  This took the first 2/3 of this book; the last third was his own opinions on just about everything.  I'm glad he got it out of his system before he died. <br /> <br />His view on what history professors decided the robber barons had profitted from the TransContinental Railroad was only his opinion.  That book was problematical as to the information being factual, and he was called to task for his interpretations. <br /> <br />In Founding Fathers, he promoted Joseph Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS, his own UNDAUNTED COURAGE (both of which had historical errors)  and David McCullough's JOHN ADAMS, which Jeff Rollins out in California read in its entirety.  Ambrose was accused of plagiarism and Ellis of distorting facts. <br /> <br />He touched on racism and slavery, saying that Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and William Clark were all slave owners.  So were a lot of people!  He states that Abraham Lincoln wanted to ship all slaves back to Africa.  \\"He'd decided that the whole country was guilty of the fact of slavery, not just the South.\\"  How different America would be today had that happened!  He spoke of Washington being 6'3\\" tall, or was that Abe Lincoln?  Whoever, he writes, \\"His army lost more battles than it won.\\"  What kind of historian, I ask you, was he anyway?  Distorting facts the way he did, he deserved what he got.	2005-04-27

When I picked this book up at the library, I was reminded of the Peggy Lee song, 'Is That All There Is to Love?'  I enjoyed the quotes interspersed by Mark Twain, Margaret Mead, Albert Schweitzer, Clarence Darrow and especially liked \\"The proper function of a man is to live, not to (merely) exist\\" by Jack London. <br /> <br />Soft addictions are described as unhealthy habits, unlike hard addictions (certain foods, alcohol, medications, cigarettes, bad thoughts, game playing), but they serve to drain our energies and sense of fulfillment.  We use them as time wasters to provide a sense of activity to feel that we are achieving something -- but actually we are using these traps to avoid real problems.  What we are doing appear \\"normal\\" (shopping, t.v. for company, computer games) but we are left with a feeling of emptiness and being unsatisfied. <br /> <br />The author, Judith Wright, confessed: \\"Only after I faced the unhappiness of my first marriage did I start on the path of personal growth.\\"  A man you trusted and loved in the beginning can inflict real damage to your whole being with his criticism and harshness.  A man does not have to act tough to be a man (nor does he have to wear cowboy boots), but he shouldn't talk like a woman, either.  It seems we have a need for elocution teachers again to show a young adult male how to lower his voice and not just act like a man but sound like one as well. <br /> <br />Being the mother of three sons, growing up with a brother three years older than I with only a father at home, I can honestly say I've been around men most of my life, and accepted each as an individual.  Guess I was lucky that none were effeminent in any way.  Returning to East Tennessee to 'retire' the first thing which bothered me was the way the men here talk in the higher register, and I commented that their wives had deeper voices than they.  I don't (never did) sound like a man, but I have a definite Southern drawl unlike the Knoxville harshness -- which I developed while I was away.  We talk like the people around us, everybody knows that.  I look Knoxville (short, dark eyes, a natural wave in my natural hair, a fighting spirit for doing \\"what's right\\"), but I don't sound Knoxville, and the twain shall never meet. <br /> <br />Ms Wright lists various activities she says when overdone become soft addictions such as media, buying/shopping, sexual, risk taking, card games, crossword puzzles when done alone.  Moods, self-pity, chameleon-like behavior, sarcasm, crankiness, evading and escaping social interrraction, oversleeping, isolation AND things (edible & consumable) like fast foods, coffee, snack foods, cigarettes, and brand-name merchandise:  all can turn into addictions. <br /> <br />This book is interesting in the fact of learning these facts.  After twenty years of developing personal growth programs, she and husband, Bob, have developed MORE through seminars, now on a web site and the eight-step program spelled out in this book.	2005-04-25

This is one in a series of books about artists for young children about the lives and paintings of these famous oldsters.  Written as a report by a fictitious student gives a different aspect and will appeal to school children perhaps; and yet, it contains a biography of Claude Monet (the good and the bad) which appeals to adults, but especially his marvelous paintings are worth the money.    He was very handsome when he went to Paris at the age of 18, but the other painters kidded him with the nickname \\"Dandy\\" because he wore ruffled cuffs even though he was just the son of a poor grocer.  As a young child in the early school years, he would draw stetches of his teachers and sell them to his classmates.  The sketch he drew when he was sixteen looks like something you might see in 'The New Yorker' and is now a part of the expressionist grouping at the Art Institute of Chicago.  Some years ago, my son Geoff took me there but that part was closed off for renovation.  I told him it didn't matter as there was so much else to look at; as it turns out, the expressionalists are my favorites.  Oh well, it was grand just being there.    'The Poppy Field' is one of his most famous, but the people in Knoxville would much prefer 'Water Lilies' because of the purple. By his 83rd birthday, he had finished twenty-two giant paintings of waterlilies. He had his own water gardens as an older man with a bridge (a photo of him standing by with his long white beard); there in his garden at Giverny the flowers were so colorful and plentiful, it could be Longwood Gardens in New Jersey.  He and Renoir painted the same scene of a group of party-goers along a frog pond and the canoes pulled up for their use.  Renoir's is a close-up though he has one of his trees with long hanging branches, while Monet's is more exact and clear.    He was happily married twice but the deaths took their toll; Camille had been his model for ten years before their marriage and he painted many strange pictures after her death with her face in them.  When Alice died, he was so distraught he was unable to paint for some years as his eyesight diminished.  In 1923, he endured eye operations and had special glasses to use for resuming his career.    Steven ends his report with \\"On December 5, 1926, he died (shortly after his 87th birthday).  He had been happy, sad, poor and rich.  In his life, Monet painted more than 2,000 paintings, which now sell for millions of dollars.  They are worth it.\\"     Some of the phrasing is for kids to understand, but the book is so full of information not included in adult biographies it is well worth the time and money to purchase this little treasure.	2005-04-25

Sometimes a  serious health scare can put a person in the frame of mind to search for his own destiny and to strive to achieve it before it's too late.  Being somewhat educated by Dr. Dyer on other self-help subjects, here I was planning to get my \\"intentions' in the proper framework with his guidance.  We all have superficial intentions of doing things we want to while there's still time to do them.    Riding the Knoxville buses these last six years, I'd find myself leaving home intending to go to a particular place but, due to changing bus schedules and herpas the bus I'm riding is running late and the driver won't ask the bus you need to transfer to wait so you'll reach your \\"intended\\" destination.  Thus, instead of a long wait for the next scheduled vehicle, I have a change of plans and go a different route entirely.  On the spur of a moment, I changed directions and made the decision that the intended task for the day could wait for another day.      I've learned to be flexible and, at first, it was kind of fun to venture out on different buses to places unknown.  When you're retired and \\"come home\\" to a town grown in one direction which wasn't there when you left (never to return) that was the way I learned to get around on the buses in my hometown.  I'm not so sure I can do the same thing in Nashville, as it is a larger town.    Whoever said \\"You can't go home again\\" was so, so right it hurts to have to admit defeat.  Even if you move away for two and a half years, returning to a small town also has its setbacks.  Mainly, there are no buses!   And not so many changes in the town per se, but you can no longer can be quite so independent.  Age has a way of catching up with you when you least expect it and often what you \\"intended to do\\" must be rearranged to what you're capable of doing without transportation.    Well, the power of intention is a higher power and our egoes don't make the selection as it did in YOUR SACRET SELF.  No matter how hard you may try,intention can't be accessed in the same way and readjustments are needed.  When the supremacy of ego is weakened, you seek intention and maximize your potential.    Four pathways necessary for this change are discipline, wisdom, surrender and love (loving what you do and doing what you love).  You must strive for unity.  Keeping an open mind, you can fuse your creative energy and free will and the destiny of intention making a dichotomy by blending the opposites and live with paradox in every moment of your existence.  You need to merge your individual thoughts and upbringing with the universal mind.  We all have a limited time to fulfill our hopes and dreams on this earth.  This is a new beginning for life everlasting.    Of all the many instruction books, Dr. Dyer's directions are, in my opinion, the best and easiest to follow in THE SKY'S THE LIMIT, A PROMISE IS A PROMISE, MANIFEST YOUR DESTINY, and PULLING YOUR OWN STRINGS.	2005-04-23

Since the dawn of history, every civilization has seen men who studied the skies.  In Europe and Asia, astronomers existed in Babylon, Egypt, India and China.  In America, the Incas and Aztecs built pyramids and temples which showed knowledge and fascination with the sun, moon, and stars in the night sky.  England had Stonehenge.    There's not much factual knowledge about Jeremiah Horrocks short   life; there has been only one other biography to surface, published in 1859 by A. B. Whatton.  Photographs show the area and places he lived as he moved about.  Born in May, 1618, he was only fourteen years old when he entered Cambridge on July 5, 1632.  Just seven years later (1639), he was knowledgeable about the solar system and his observation of the primitive set-up he used in Carr House to view a rare celestial event, the \\"transit of Venus\\" was documented.  It is similar to the way we are encouraged to watch the eclipse of the sun so as not to be blinded by the strong rays.  He died in 1641.    The Royal Greenwith Observatory was founded in 1675; John Flamsteed was appointed as the first Astronomer Royal.  However, Jeremiah Horrock is known as the \\"Father of British Astronomy.  This book was released to coincide with the June, 2004, viewing of Venus moving across the face of the sun (for only the fifth time since the 1639 occurrence: about every 73 years or so).      My son Geoffrey earned his PhD in Astronomy at the University of Chicago and learned how to handle the monster telescopes at Kitt Peak as a grad student way out there in Arizona.    Peter Aughton has written ENDEAVOR, RESOLUTION, and NEWTON'S APPLE.  He teaches at the University of the West of England and a Fellow of the Institute for Math.  In 1970s he was involved with the Concorde supersonic airliner.  He certainly knows his astronomy from primitive times.	2005-04-22

One day Jean Nathan remembered a book from her childhood and set out to find a copy.  It was a most unusual book of photographs of a blonde doll with her bear companions, father and son.  In 1957, it was popular with girls; I had boys so we missed it completely.    There were nineteen books for children altogether, ten of which included the bears.  One scene in particular showed father bear spanking Lonely Doll.  She named the little girl doll Edith after her mother; it was an actual doll from her childhood.  Her mother Edith had been a portrait painter, and father Leonard an actor and drama critic.    After the marriage ended, the mother described as a \\"free spirit\\" entered a fantasy world for herself and her daughter.  The photographs of her parents used for the wedding announcement were separate and in profile.  Both were handsome people, as was Dare as a grown woman.  There are nude pictures of her on a beach.      Jean Nathan located Ms. Wright in an indigent hospital in dire circumstances out on an island in New York and visited with her and her California friends.  She was given a scrapbook and suitcases of memorbilia when the apartment on W. 58th St. which had been featured in 'Good Housekeeping' in its hey-day was being packed up and closed.      The first book was called THE LONELY DOLL, then came LONELY DOLL LEARNS A LESSON, EDITH AND MR. BEAR, and A GIFT FROM THE LONELY DOLL.  Dare Wright, never allowed to 'grow up,' died in 2001 at the age of 87.	2005-04-21

He says that ninety per cent of people in our culture buy things they can't afford.    I once knew a driver for a transportation company who followed Dave Ramsey's radio tips on investing money who now owns his own vans and company, enjoying being his own boss.  It happened here in Tennessee to a minority from Belize and California.    He talks about 'baby steps' for becoming financially secure.  He borrowed the baby steps from the movie, 'What About Bob?'  In each sections, he lists Myths which lead to Ignorance, Approval, or Denial.  Ignorance is not lack of intelligence; it is lack of 'know-how.'    Being real takes tremendous courage.  We like approval and respect; to say otherwise is another form of denial.  Wealth is not the answer to life's questions.  It isn't magic; it is common sense.

A Britisher with a Native American guide goes on a cross country search for the grotesque, unsettling, strange, odd, and bizarre just lurking beneath the surface wherever you chance to look.  I have the updated version printed in the U. S. by Fromm International; the cover is different, but essentially the stories are the same.  Two of them were used for movies here in the States. <br /> <br />He traveled to places we here have not been aware of, even though you can find drag queens, devil worshippers, belly dancers, the women in black, and lots of homeless from all over America right in Knoxville, Tennessee.  This is a melting pot of the bizarre.  I'm surprised he missed it.  He showed the most interest in crime and the lower class folks, with the help of Charlie Horse. <br /> <br />They observed and interviewed vigalante groups in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, then on to Birmingham, Alabama to watch the prison guards wrestle bears.  In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, they learned about the hit men and, in Greensboro, North Carolina, it was a court trial of 'alienation of affection' which made the divorced wife a millionaire. <br /> <br />\\"Snakeskin Rhapsody\\" takes place in a tiny church in West Virginia, where all the members of the congregation handle rattlesnakes and speak in tongues (out of their heads in rhapsody).  This was similar in some way with the story of the snake charmer in East Tennessee who entertained a whole den of rattlesnakes with his fiddle playing.  As long as he did it on sunny days, the snakes were docile.  After dark was another story altogether. The preacher of the 'holiness' church explained to him that the snakes can tell if you have any fear.  The people there were not friendly to strangers.  In the town's only diner, after church, each person has a pinched expression as if life comes knocking on their faces everyday with 'unreasonable requests.' <br /> <br />Mr. Jeffreys has been an investigative journalist and editor at the 'New York Post,' the'London Times' and the 'Daily Mail.'  He has had some articles published in 'Vanity Fair.'	2005-04-19

Amanda had rented a bronze silk evening dress from A-list discards place to go to see how the bigwigs entertain in Old Philadelphia, known as the City of Brotherly Love.  Her beau Mackenzie matched her in his rented tuxedo.    They pandered back and forth with a bit of naughty gossip about old Benjamin Franklin.  Mark Twain is reputed to have remarked that \\"in Boston they asked how much a man knew.\\"  In New York, it was more important how much he was worth.  In Philadelphia, the thing which mattered the most is \\"who were his parents?\\"  Mr, Roederer's middle name was Franklin, which turned the blood in his veins 'cobalt blue.'    Amanda had led the faculty in gaining support for the grant to obtain materials for the media center.  They had received a windfall from a Trust to replenish the shelves of the library.  Two of her students, adopted son Griffin of the Roederers and the preacher's stepson, Jake, were best friends.      Griffin's parents were wealthy with pedigrees a mile long and prestige to match their money.  They oppose the Moral Ecologists over what books might 'pollute young minds' led by the Reverend who is involking the First Amendment.  After the book burning , there is a murder, but not one of the 'blue bloods.'      The beautiful cover has an illustration by Lisa Falkerstern of two classy ladies and one of the two men looks like the movie actor, Robert Taylor.	2005-04-19

I'd always heard of the query, \\"Is the glass half full (positive) or half empty (negative)?  It depends on the person doing the judging.  If you follow the precepts given in this book: kindness, recognition, praise, confidence, positive energy, optimisim, you will have an overflowing bucket.  He promotes stability, pleasantry, positivity and productivity on the job and in your daily life.    Everyone has an 'invisible' bucket; we are at our best when it is full and at our worst when it is empty.  Everyone has an 'invisible' dipper, which we can use to fill or to dip from others' buckets.   Don't diminish yourself by bringing others down.  Whenever we choose to fill others' buckets, we fill our own.    Most people are more productive in the presence of positive people.  He gives five strategies for increasing positive emotions.  Doing this can have an impact on longevity by a good ten years.  Everyone needs at least one very close friend.  Lonely people suffer psychologically.    Negative employees run off customers for good, with their attitudes and words.  The number one reason people leave their jobs is they don't feel appreciated.  Sixty-five percent of Americans receive no recognition in the workplace.  I remember being asked on a temp job by the manager, \\"Are we having fun yet?\\"  Bad bosses increase the risk of stroke by 33%.    Dr. Clifton worked on several other books with others at the Gallup Organization.  'The Mystery of the dipper and the bucket' is his idea.  Tom Rath, his grandson, is a leader at Gallup and completed this book after his grandfather died in 2003.  He had wonderful grandparents; writes about his marvelous grandmother.    Remember: life was not always going to be a bowl of cherries, nor would it turn out to be a bowl of sour grapes either.	2005-04-18

Written by a monk since the age of sixteen who has also written many others of poetry, fiction and Eastern philosophy for more than 30 years he has been in exile.    In one moment of anger, lives can be ruined and spiritual development destroyed.  Fear is based on ignorance, and this lack of understanding is also a cause of anger.  If you learn not to fear this turmoil and suffering, you learn to embrace them with mindfulness (on which he has since written a book) and to transform them into something useful.  It is most important not to keep your anger and fears repressed.  Let it out (get it out of your system) but, whatever you do, don't take it out on others, especially your best friend.  Love is the key to happiness.    To be happy is to suffer less, but true happiness must come from within.  Bitterness results from repressed anger, and the 'hurt' person complains and blames others for his problems.  When someone says or does something to make you angry, you suffer; thus, you may retaliate 'in kind' to make the other person suffer.  But he may try to find 'relief' by making you suffer more.  It becomes a vicious cycle.    We live in a time of sophisticated means of communication.  Information can travel via computers to the other side of the planet almost instantaneously, but the family members cannot speak freely of their feelings.  If they can't restore communication, happiness will never be possible.    He gives exercises and suggestions on how to succeed in this process.	2005-04-18

Mr. Cose is an editor of 'Newsweek' magazines and has written six other books.  The Ford Foundation grant allowed him to travel to South Africa, Ghana, Peru, New Zealand, and othe places.  He touches on slavery (how the past shapes the present) and KKK (the challenges of life).  He wants justice, revenge, mediation, retribution for the crimes against victims of various wars and races. <br /> <br />We have all been unjustly harmed to some extent, and somehow we managed to deal with it.  Yet to deal with pain or trauma is not the same as being free of it.  He seeks repentance, negotiations, reparations (money) for unspeakable truths and harm.  Forgetting is not an option as the hurt festers and must be addressed at the appropriate time to rectify the wrongs of the past. <br /> <br />Memories of the 'wrong' linger and must be dealt with in some fashion.  Recognition of the wrongdoing is essential for reconciliation and forgiveness.   You can choose to forgive, enjoy a sweet revenge, let go of resentments, or you can demand restitution for physical and emotional damages.   <br /> <br />He gives his take on the surrender of Saddam Hussein.  Ultimately, it comes down to t he human need for hope, the consequent capacity for faith, and demand for the ultimate punishment.  Else society would be sanctioning wrongdoing. <br /> <br />He has appeared on 'Nightline, 'Dateline,' NPR, PBS News Hour, and ABC 'Good Morning America.'	2005-04-18

This is number 13 in the series featuring the Mamur Zapt, starting with A COLD TOUCH OF ICE, THE SNAKE CATCHER'S DAUGHTER, THE GIRL IN THE NILE, and THE NIGHT OF THE DOG.  These mysteries written by an academic in Sudan, Michael Pearce, are simplified Elizabeth Peters sagas with murder and mayhew involved.    In a cat cemetery (where cats are interred after being mummified),the body of a blonde German woman is found with the wrappings of a mummy covering her completely.  She is married to an Egyptian and it is WWI where Germans are feared, even the blonde ones.    Owen tells Zeinab that it was the \\"war\\" which killed the victim.  \\"It was a marriage built on love but based on fear.  As the world pressed in, fear took over.  The outside world was too much for them, and the obstacles, difficulties became obsessive, so they turned inwards.  In the end they couldn't face the world.\\"  My, how things have changed.  Of course, this is America and not the Sudan with the camels, tombs and pet cemeteries.  Here, we bury the family pet out in the back yard.    It was fascinating, but written for younger readers, I think.  He certainly has a full slate of these books for anyone interested in Egypt told in a ficitonal sense, not many facts.	2005-04-15

This writer has already published a dozen books mostly with numbers in the titles about Stephanie; this one, however, could be the beginning of a new series based on Alex (nicknamed Barney).  I was expecting a sophisticated \\"uptown girl\\" (from the Billy Joel song), instead I find a grease monkey who can build cars from scratch.  She teams up with a race driver in Miami named Hooker to find her errant brother, Wild Bill.    Sounds like they might be from the west, but to my dismay I find they live in Baltimore, Maryland, of all places.  Bill is always getting in trouble and Big Sis Alex bails him out.  So this January, cold in the east, she flies to Miami where it is hot to find clues as to where Bill has vanished.  It seems he \\"borrowed\\" th race car driver's yacht to take a Cuban \\"lady\\" on a treasure hunt and ran into trouble.  Big Trouble with a capital T.    Alex is a tomboy all grown up but shows Hooker what a woman is lurking underneath her veneer.  Adventures galore, but I think maybe she should continue with the letter game (now at number 11).  METRO GIRL wasn't what I was expecting when I accidentally came across this novel.	2005-04-15

Homer served in the army in Viet Nam 1967-68, worked for NASA in Huntsville, Alabama; during his second stint in the army he learned to scuba dive in Puerto Rico.  Then he returned to Huntsville, where he became a scuba instructor in 1973 at Aquaspace.   In 1975, he started diving and researching shipwrecks along the Atlantic Ocean while writing articles for 'America History Illustrated' about his adventures under water.    He lived three years in Germany and at the age of 38, in 1981, he returned to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville as an engineer on Spacelab Program, where he worked to develop the flawed Hubble Telescope, NASA's giant eye on the universe.  Even with the blurred optics, the Hubble changed the way we view life in outer space nonetheless.    He writes, \\"I am proud to have been one of the thousands engineers and scientists who designed, built and then fixed this magnificent observatory.\\"  He trained astronauts in weightlessness using a tank of water.  Along the way he learned to fly a Cessna.    In 1994, the article he wrote about the Rocket Boys in Coalwood, West Virginia for the 'Air and Space/Smithsonian' magazine was expanded into the book and the movie, OCTOBER SKY.  Parts of the movie were filmed here in Knoxville and used my old high school, now a middle school in Ftn. City,for some of the experiments.    Overnight he became a celebrity there in Huntsville with the astronauts asking him for his autograph.  He wrote the book BACK TO THE MOON for Hollywood.  THE COALWOOD WAY, a sequel to the ROCKET BOYS, and now this memoir, SKY OF STONE.  To come from a poor state like West VA, he has flown a long way from home and, with his books, will climb even higher.	2005-04-14

Ms. Windham is a good purveyor of scary (in a sense) stories which I used to hear sometimes as a child from a friend's grandmother here in Knoxville. She, like Kathryn, was a good story teller, but I would wonder why she chose bedtime to scare children. <br /> <br />This is a collection from the five out of print Jeffrey books.  The Bell Witch in Adams, TN, as witnessed by Andrew Jackson was wrongly named (Kate) -- from the two family members taunted by this \\"devil\\", it shows definitely to be a male.  He was jealous of the wife and loved the daughter. <br /> <br />The snake charmer in the hills of East Tennessee  was just plain stupid who took a fatal choice with his fiddle playing -- the rattlesnakes took their revenge for all the snake skins he had collected one by one.  He still plays the devil's instrument on still clear nights as the rattles keep time with the music. <br /> <br />The farmer who \\"vanished\\" in broad daylight in Gallatin, Tennessee, was a made up story by the 'Cincinnati Inquirer' in the 1880s; it never happened similar to the story made up by a Chicago paper around that same time about the Indian Rope Trick.  There is no evidence that either happened, only a tale to pass on for posterity. <br /> <br />We all have a ghost story to tell, one from the past or one we experienced as an adult.  Actually, my experience was with both, and they were \\"good\\" ghosts.  Someday, I plan to haunt the Tennessee Theater and the Knoxville buses -- but I hope that will be a long time from now.  It will be fun!	2005-04-14

From the book cover and the title, I mistakenly assumed it was about magic, as the magician has the shadow of a woman levitating; yet, the three different sizes shows that he too is disappearing.  It's all illusion, but a strange, unexplained one. <br /> <br />Kiki had confided in one of her friends in San Francisco that the worst thing about growing old (she is forty) was having to do it in America where youth, money, pretty things, and cussess are revered.  Most of all youth and beauty, at least where women were concerned, are of major importance.  So different from Europe and China where the older woman is appreciated.  The American male attitude toward aging women makes them appear to be invisible.  It's a fact, even in a backward town like Knoxville, Tennessee. <br /> <br />This is a reprise of the storyline of her first book HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT, only this time the participants are involved in a t.v. game show and not in sewing.  She uses the stories of each character.  In one of the disjointed vignettes, on traveling across America before her total disappearance to Paris, she is told that people are friendlier, poorer, and \\"less tolerant\\" in the Deep South.  I think she found the Luray Caverns there in Virginia.   <br /> <br />At Arlington National Cemetery, she tours Robert E. Lee's house where she could envision his dilemma of deciding to go with his region (the Confederacy) during the Civil War.  His wife comforts him and, though her arms \\"encircle him, he cannot feel her.  So solitary is one in the midst of personal sadness.\\"  He was a military man doing his duty, as he saw it, and it's too bad when people from California have no notion whatsoever about our Civil War. <br /> <br />All of her little books have Oriental book jackets, all similar, and she uses the same format of short vignettes to tell varied and many stories.  This one was not about magic at all!  A later version, A COLLECTION OF BEAUTIES, goes back in time to the late-twenties andearly-thirties to the fetish of beauty and youth.  No age is perfect.  They include related tales, and she seems to be searching for her Japanese roots.  Along the way, I sincerely hope she finds some happiness.  Sometimes, beauty is on the inside of a person, no matter what age, and let me tell you that older women are still beautiful.	2005-04-13

Comparing the newest published fantasy works of two of my favorite writers, I notice the similarities in North Plains of Stephen Donaldson and Northland of Terry Brooks.  For some reason this kind of book requires maps so the reader can look back to see where the action is at the point they are reading.    I've always said that, after Paul Theroux, Stephen Donaldson can use the English language the way it should be expressed.  His six previous novels in the Thomas Covenant saga, THE CHRONICLES OF THOMAS COVENANT, were not complete.  Now, after devoting his marvelous writing abilities toward other genres, he returns with THE LAST CHRONICLES OF THOMAS COVENANT.      It was some of those in between which appealed to me, a romantic, starting with THE MIRROR OF HER DREAMS and A MAN RIDES THROUGH.  Those two really touched me and inspired me to read (or try to) some of his science fiction, THE REAL STORY, CHAOS AND ORDER, and FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE from the GAP series.  Those, I did not understand so well, but loved his style of writing just the same.  Why do they have to use such strange names for people in Science Fiction?    Then he went on to write a THE MAN WHO.... series which I missed completely.  THE RUNES OF THE EARTH is the first in a four-volume conclusion to the turmoil of Thomas Covenant's life.  The first few pages gives a brief background of \\"What Has Gone Before.\\"  Thomas is now alone and thinks at first that his excursions into the dream-like world, Revelstone and Mithil Stonedown, which he calls only the Land, are just in his unconscious imagination.  The South Plains has caves and the mountains not as tall as those in North Plains, which has a Glimmermere Falls.      Whatever your preference, Fantasy or SciFi, this is the writer for you.  He is a master at the English language, American-style, not that difficult British guttural stuff.  Read all or some of the above listed novels.  This fellow is great!	2005-04-13

It was a pleasure to find this gem at the public library as I could compare it with the Donaldson book I purchased recently.  In the maps, a necessary item in ScFi books, I could see how Northland of Terry Brooks was in some way similar to the North Plains in Stephen Donaldson's latest.  In their old age, for some reason, they've decided to resurrect the first of their successful series.  Terry started Shannara which my teenage son (st the time) Zachary used as a guide to write his own science fiction.  My daughter-in-law had also read all eight of the first Shannara books.  But, she reads everything.    When I became enamoured with his books, he'd started a \\"magic\\" fantasy period.  I loved  his writing in MAGIC KINGDOM FOR SALE (the first of his I read), BLACK UNICORN, WIZARD AT LARGE, TANGLE BOX, and WITCHES BREW.  All were fabulous!    Then I read ISLE WITCH and ANTHRAX from THE VOYAGE OF JERLE SHANNARA which I had some trouble understanding.  After that, I read RUNNING WITH THE DEMON, A KNIGHT OF THE WORD, and ANGEL FIRE EAST, a mixture of both fantasy and scifi, as only he can do.    Now, he's started a new series: HIGH DRUID OF SHANNARA, and TANEQUIL, just released, is the second volume after JARKA RUUS.  I can highly recommend his books, as he has a way with words and a vivid imagination.  He also has a section on Shannara: INDOMITABLE in LEGENDS II, edited by Robert Silverberg.  He is a must-read for anyone interested in science fiction or the unusual.	2005-04-13

This is a collection of some of his essays and articles as compiled after his death last September by his wife, Sarah Dudley.  The majority of them are from the 'New Yorker' although two appeared in 'Harper's Magazine,' two in 'Esquire,' two were in 'Men's Journal' (one extremely long, other extremely short), also 'New York Post' and 'Playboy.' <br /> <br />\\"The Cellular Age\\" (1996) has just now reached Knoxville.  The mental people out on the streets with their imaginary enemies have become vocal here.  On Gay Street, during the lunch hour when the outdoor eating areas were full, one man walking up the sidewalk toward them kept yelling threats at no one in particular.  Those of us on the sidewalk across the street from him looked to see who he was spewing his vendom toward, but there was no visible source.  Just yesterday, a homeless woman sat in a bus shelter behind me as I was waiting for the Broadway bus to town; she started yelling, \\"Ronnie, kill them\\" over and over.  I looked to see if she had a phone or a gun.  Thank goodness, the bus arrived and she stayed in the shelter, lost in a world of her own. <br /> <br />George, it seems, sought out the oddballs, as does one of the columnists at a local tabloid.  They seek these people out to interview as if they are normal and the readers are abnormal.  The title of this book is one of his 'New Yorker' articles about a prank which a Vietnam vet survived, only to later commit suicide in delusion that he was in a movie.  He romantizes the whole incident, but PTSS caused a lot of veterans of that war to want to die.  He made his literary success on these strange people and unusual happenings.  Some of these pieces were merely personal observations.  He led an interesting life.	2005-04-12
281898:US	35985708	RKPSO4RU1AMGT	0312310390	542313879	Why We Lie: The Evolutionary Roots of Deception and the Unconscious Mind	Books	3	3	22	N	N	The Art of Telling Untruths & False Rumors.	Written by a professor of philosophy who spent many years teaching in London whose first three books (about the unconscious -- 9-99, psychotherapy -- 2-03, and hidden conversations -- 5-99) have been too above the heads of Amazon readers to review, this one is almost as difficult.  He starts out: \\"Nature is awash with deceit; nature is farfetched.\\"    According to Mr. Smith, most of us lie because it is inbred, to insure the survival of the species.  Lying is as natural as breathing.  For men, it seems to be!  He feels that we have a need for social lies in the interest of civility (those little white lies).    Gossip is stretching the truth in a collective version of recent or imagined events concerning a person know or unknown.  Gossip is nature's telephone (it was when I was growing  up, that's for sure.), and can harm reputations especially in a small town where everybody knows everybody and what he or she does and even what they think.  I know -- I've been there!    A woman soon learns not to trust a gossip monger.  The person in whom you confide may turn around and talk about you to another so-called 'friend,' to paraphrase, as he says, \\"to stab you in the back\\" metaphorically speaking.  One song I used to enjoy was titled \\"The Back Stabbers.\\"  Don't ever tell anyone what you don't want to be repeated, as no one ever uses the same words.      \\"Words mean what words do, and how they cooperate with all the other words and sentences in a language to do their job.\\"  We have to interpret the meaning of what people say and do constantly.  It is easy to mistakenly read unconscious meanings where they don't exist.  He mentions 'inneundo,' 'puns,' 'double entendre,' 'inspired conjectures,' and 'ingenious fantasies.'  Some of these are expressed in body language.    The three types of memories he used as examples are semantic, procedural and episodic.  I don't agree with him that gossip took developmental roots in the female brain.  I know men who are bigger gossips than women any day, and seek it out to pass on to other men.  It makes them feel 'big' and knowledgable.  I do agree that men have the deceptive talents some women lack, and most do it naturally without thinking.  It is a part of their masculine prowess.  They tell lies because they know they can get away with it.  So what!  Look at a person's eyes when he is not being truthful, and you will see guilt -- I guarantee it.	2005-04-11

The writer is considered an expert on leadership, having written many books on the subject.  She received her B.A. at Sarah Lawrence College, M.A. and Ph.D. from Yale University.  She certainly has the pedigree for a good leader. <br /> <br />In this book, however, she concentrates on bad leaders and the reason they fail.  On the 'bad side' President Clinton leads the pack, along with former presidents Nixon and Harding.  World leaders who were terrible included Hitler, Stalin, and Hussein for the atrocities they did to their own countrymen.  In religion, she castigates the leaders of the Catholic church for allowing the child sex abuse which has been around since time immemorial (a long time), the Bakkers, Henry Lyons, and Swaggart. <br /> <br />On the 'light side,' good leaders include Jack Welch, Churchill, and FDR, who in my opinion was unethical by deceiving Americans about his disability and health problems.  He had women problems as did JFK and Clinton.  She left out Lincoln and his successor, Andrew Johnson, who could have been on either side. <br /> <br />Not only are there bad leaders, but they have followers who are bad, just as the good follow the good.  Her use of language to define leadership was interesting, and she made up two words of her own: 'cocreate' and coconstitute.'  I have not come across those before and I am a word person. <br /> <br />All leaders should first follow.  John C.

The half-blind grandfather passed on to him a handbook written in the 'universal language' (English) as he sets out to fulfill the destiny of his name.    It involves getting a good education and politics.  In 1941, Japan rules Korea with an iron fist and things are difficult for the rich and the poor.  Monsoons destroy the land, and an imperialistic government changes the lives of everyone.  In 1947, the Russians enter the fray and forty-five high school boys are gunned down.  Heisook Pang is the daughter of a minister in a nothern city who has relocated to the Presbysterian Church in Seoul, leaving his family behind.  She escapes Communism and flees South.    Both had attended American-sponsored schools.  In Seoul, the First Methodist Church had appointed Sei-Young's grandfather as head minister.  As the two Reverends become acquainted, Sei-Young became an assistant in the Blue House where South Korea's president included him as privy between his advisors.  In June, 1950, everything changed when the Korean War broke out.    President Rhee was frustrated with the news reporters, \\"like they say in America, you can't live with them and you can't live without them.  They are a good source for getting your point across\\" to the masses \\"even if they take unforgivable liberties.\\"  He became the president's secretary who confided words to him he would never say over the radio or to a newspaper reporter.    MacArthur with support of the United Nations provided military support for three long years of conflict.  The young couple have the opportunity to come to America and start a new life.    Written by their daughters, Frances and Ginger Park, who live in Washington, D. C., this is a poignant love story and memoir.  She never forgot her first love, lost somewhere along the way.  They have co-authored some children's books; Frances wrote WHEN MY SISTER WAS CLEOPATRA MOON and a new novel, THE HAVE A GOOD DAY CAFE.	2005-04-09

According to this magician who looked for what wasn't there, \\"history is not the past, only the historian's interpretation of a very small part of it.\\"  Those who write history do not know all the facts, do not deem some of them important or entertaining enough to sell papers, or books.  Bare facts are of little use without historical interpretations.  He dontinues, \\"Two historians reading the same text choose different facts and write different stories, nothing alike\\"  Similar to these reviews, I would imagine.<br /><br />Even in newspapers, \\"facts\\" depend on what editors have decided are important and the tales by the journalist (their personal opinions) are never identical.  History will always be a matter of opinion, but one based on evidence, so-called historical facts.<br /><br />In the 17th century, Indian and Persian magicians were called jugglers.  Mostly the charmed snakes, but never anything to compare with America's David Copperfield.  Magic was a world of enchantment, like Merlin's in Camelot, filled with illusion.  The age of technology in late 17th and 18th centuries brought Enlightenment,<br /><br />There is no documentation of the rope trick as originating from India; a shaman from Siberia claimed to have climbed to the sky \\"by the use of a rope.\\"  But it was a story about a trick with a rope in India which captured the popular imagination and became the world's most famous hoax,<br /><br />Like 'The War of the Worlds' radio fraud, this is believed to have been a false newspaper article written in 1890 in America; the author admitted it was untrue and had even written that there was no factual verification.  But the notion and notoriety prompted people to claim that they had seen it with their own eyes.  It is ordinary folks who bring a legend to life.<br /><br />Many photos throughout this book shows how the thing proliferated and could have happened.  The best in my opinion is the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, contemplating a coiled rope with perhaps five feet up in the air.

In Sharyn McCrumb's novel, IF EVER I RETURN PRETTY PEGGIE-O, I first learned of the ballad, 'The Knoxville Girl.'  Here in her cahpter about American Ballads, she's called 'Dear Little Girl.'  She has that ballad mixed up with others making for confusion on all fronts.  If I didn't know the song and its consequences, I would not have recognized \\"Nellie\\" as the Dear Little Girl in 'Pretty Peggie-O' -- \\"is with her beau, Jack, who turns into \\"Willie\\" who throttles the life out of her along the banks of some river (the French Broad).  As with local \\"history\\" of a certain theater which left out the decade which meant the most to me, now her vagueness and omission of her own as she twists this ballad after calling the chapter 'Pretty Peggie-O', what a let down.  You can hear this song in Betty Smith's 1977 'For My Friends of Song.'  I have heard that the Louvin Brothers had a good version sometime and Elvis Costello sang it in the same aforementioned theater as 'The Knoxville Girl.'    Barbara Allen was the poor Scots-Irish theme of the Appalachians as parlayed by Dolly Parton.  She is not a ballad singer, but hillbilly music of her own making.      'John Brown's Body' was used as a marching song for the 12th regiment in 1861.  That John Brown had drowned while crossing the Shenandoah River on the way to battle.  On March 1, 1862, it was sung at the spot wher John Brown, the abolitionist, was hanged by the Union.  Up 'til now, I thought it had been written about him.    I have not heard of most of the featured 'ballads' even though I'd always said I preferred ballads to classical music.  This book features many folk singers, but my ballads were by Eddie Fisher.  A big difference!    The chapter by David Thomas combined 'The Wreck of Old 97' about a train wreck in the early 1900s and 'Dead Man's Curve' by Jan and Dean in 1964 about a car crash.  Randy Newman who wrote 'Short People' also had ballads recorded by Dusty Springfield and his own 'Sail Away' which Enya croons.This book gives intermittent history of America and the editors included a plethora of works published on various subjects.  The best thing was the two-page cartoon by R. Crumb, but the black and white pictures and copies of old sheet music at the beginning of the 22 sections are almost as good.    I don't think they missed anything from a put down of Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural Address six weeks before his murder by John Wilkes Booth to Stephen Foster's 'possible' suicide at the age of forty, to Richard Speck's rampage in Chicago.  A smorgasbord of strange incidents, not all musical.  I grew up hearing my dad play his guitar and harmonica and sing the old folk songs, like 'Beautiful Beautiful Brown Eyes' and I'd always say, \\"but I love blue eyes.\\"  Still do.	2005-04-07

This well-done combination with real life characters at an historic place and time is sometimes choppy as we flipflop from the stalker and the stalkee. <br /> <br />It is a novel based on real people during the World's Fair in 1901 at Buffalo, New York.  The Temple of Music is the beautiful centerpiece of the Exposition where Pres. William McKinley is set to give a speech.  The times are good for the rich but not so good for the poor immigrants and low wage workers. <br /> <br />At 5 p.m. on September 6, two bullets were fired close up and could be heard out on the Midway.  Peopled with such illuminaries of that Gilded Age as the yellow tabloid publisher Hearst and Andrew Carnegie's iron-fisted manager Henry Clay Frick, it shows the dangers and adverse publicity our early presidents were subjected to in life and death.  McKinley lasted a week before he died, on September 13, 1901, in late afternoon. <br /> <br />In a month, the assassin Leon Czolgosz was executed in the electric chair, his brain extracted and examined after his death, and he was thrown into a pit and doused with acid.  This is fiction.  Surely we were more humane and life went on with others being charged as accessories but nothing could be proved.	2005-04-07

When I saw this book at the library, I thought it would be about poetry, as the author is called 'The Nation's' \\"deadline poet.\\"  Well, I know a deadline editor of a weekly tabloid and was expecting something intellectual to be inside this little book.    Needless to say, the stuff he had a good time making up is far from poetry as I know it.  At least, he could have used some of Poe's lamentations.  He lampoons both Bush administrations, other politicians, and enemies of our country, but trying to understand what his point is has me baffled.    There's not a single one I could use as an example.  I do think the caricature on the front cover is kinda cute with the president as a captain at the wheel, but who on earth is that old fellow in uniform looking over his shoulder?      Mr. Trillin has twenty-two previously published items listed.  I hope they are not poetry.  He reminds me of the irreverent guy on PBS who played the piano (Mark Russell, I think his name is) who lampoons the politicians every election -- but he does it in fun and has a good time being proud of himself and his rhymes.  This little tome has a ways to go to even be funny as he attacks from the rear.	2005-04-06

He wasn't far wrong.   The cannon was to be the Saturn V rocket with seven million pounds of thrust.  The bullet was to be the Apollo spacecraft attached to the nose of the rocket.    Alan B. Shepard was one of the first to experiment with subordinal missile rides, then John Glenn.  Soon there came deep space flights.  We did have some setbacks, as when Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee drown after their spacecraft sank in the ocean before it could be recovered.    Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins explored further, leading up to 1969 when we landed on the moon and planted an American flag.  That first step \\"for mankind\\" was the most exciting part, as the world was glued to the television set.  Many people refused to believe it was really happening, as the popular 'Mission Impossible' show was influencing them to believe the actual thing was not happening.    We came in peace for all mankind.  The reentry (splashdown) was perfect.  They had blazed the trail.  More people would visit the moon in years to come, but these three had been the first.

At a recent library surplus sale, luckily I found this little treasure before anyone else.  The poems are in two sections.  The first \\"Memories of President Lincoln\\" include two of his most famous poems:  \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\" and \\"O Captain! My Captain!  I would never have thought these would be Civil War opines.  When I studied the Lilacs in college, I just assumed it was about Spring.  When Robin Williams quoted \\"Oh Captain!\\" in a movie, it was definitely not about Lincoln. <br /> <br />Most of these concerning the War are obscure and listed as \\"Drum-Taps, which Mark Van Doren called \\"the richest fruit of the war.\\"  Walt Whitman was born in New York in 1819 and published a volume of twelve poems at his own expense in 1855 called \\"Leaves of Grass.\\"  In 1856, he added another twenty poems to the second edition and, by 1860, the book had tripled in volume.  He constantly added more and more poems in four more editions until his death in 1892.  It was a work always in progress.  Something like the Pilgrim's Progress, but that's another story. <br /> <br />This collection represents an original as he served as a nurse during the Civil War and used his experiences to write the long section of poems, both short and long.  Some people consider him the 'father of American poetry,' but I vote for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, even though he had nothing to do with the Civil War. <br /> <br />I liked this one: <br />Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me! <br />Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me <br />A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me, <br />Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself, <br />Must I indeed learn to chang the cold dirges of the baffled? <br />And sullen hymns of defeat?	2005-04-04

I do think Alex has an obsession with Superman, which takes up the majority of the super heroes space.  His drawings go from the age of seven on progressively until now that he is grown.    He does have some nudes, male and female; and some gorgeous women from the Fifties created by his mother Lynnette who worked as a freelance fashion illustrator in Chicago where she had studied at Chicago's American Academy of Art.  These are fantastic and bring back good memories of when that kind of art was popular.    I was most interested in the fact that he made the Green Lantern figure as an old man.  I'd heard of the Green Hornet, but not Mr. Lantern.    He had a little help from his friends, Chip Kidd who designed the jacket and Geoff Spear who photographed it.  They are all fans of Batman.

Graham Greene wrote, \\"there is a moment in childhood when a door opens and lets the future in.\\"  Dr. Morrison believes that something happens in the earliest life of a baby which sets the stage for its future as a serial killer. <br /> <br />Children do not learn by osmosis but by the parents being role models and their first teachers.  It is not necessary to know everything about the parents' lives.  Some things are better left unsaid and hid in the closet.  Most young parents don't know how to raise children and tend to repeat the cruelties they encountered with their own parents.  It is a vicious cycle.  But most, no matter how badly they were treated, don't become killers. <br /> <br />An old man who had grown up in an orphanage in Washington, D. C. killed children in New York City in 1922 to cook and eat their flesh.  He left written accounts.  A father of six, it's amazing how he could cook the \\"meat\\" as roasts and such.  He had no guilt whatsoever.  Name was Albert Fish. <br /> <br />From her many years of collecting data on high profile cases, she noticed that there are distinctions between the average murderer and the serial killer.  She says \\"there is no great rage or any jealousy or any deep emotion at all\\" to prompt them to murder again and again.  I'd say it was compulsion.  They have no motives, are addicted to killing, are not mentally retarded but do have psychological defects which won't allow them to control what they do, think and feel. <br /> <br />The photos show a normal-looking Ed Gain, the model for movie, PSYCHO, John Wayne Gacy's wedding photo and his off kilter painting of a strange landscape, letters and cards from some of the serial killers she studied.  She played a large role in the trial of Gacy in Chicago, where she is a psychiatrist. <br /> <br />Harold Goldberg, her co-author, is a freelance writer for 'Vanity Fair,' 'Entertainment Weekly,' and the New York Times Book Review.	2005-04-04

The writer knows nothing of the Civil War.  Florida must be on an island somewhere out by Hawaii.  To think that he teaches creative writing bothers me, as my son Zach does the same in Florida.  I hope he at least remembers the roots of the south, where his father was born (same town as Nathan Bedford Forrest, Chapel Hill, Tennessee) and how to write properly.<br /><br />To call this is a novel is going a bit far.  It is in fragments, jumping from one thing to another and not making any sense whatsoever.  The only thing authentic  in the whole thing are the three quotes about Forrest, yet he leaves out some important info (not a historian, that's for sure).<br /><br />I captured this book because of the cover.  Yes, I am a Confederate in the vein of Sam Davis.  Wonder if he ever heard of the Confederate boy hero from Smyrna, TN whose statue is on the Capitol grounds in Nashville?  And yes, I lived there in the town where he was hanged by the Yankees.  The same town where the KKK was founded, not by Forrest but some respected judges and lawyers for the purpose of protecting the uneducated Southerners (black and white) from the Northern carpetbaggers.<br /><br />It's time the taint is taken off Forrest's legacy.  Robert E. Lee called him the best officer on either side, and yes, he did say the \\"first with the most.\\"  What's so bad about that?<br /><br />Mrs. Hollingsworth was a silly character whose other men were killers called Lee Harvey and Ted.  Not in the same league as General Nathan Bedford Forrest who led his men to victory more than once.  He was Scots-Irish and, believe me, we are fighters.<br /><br />Not piddling writers who use sacrilege to make a dime.

Being a movie fan for most of my life, this was an eye-opener.  The movie making has changed as the big studios disintegrated and props sold as so much garbage.  Except for what was saved by Debbie Reynolds, who collected enough for a museum now residing in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.      Movies are not made for entertainment these days, but for the money derived from DVDs and movie channels.  It has been hard to find a decent movie these last four months as all are violent, putrid and not meant for normal people.  I saw in the paper that an adult movie might be made here on Gay Street (for its name, no doubt) and in the old-fashioned movie theater which replaced the old musty-smelling, but stately edifice.  It is now for opera, concerts, and symphony, not films.    Back when the movies were happy and fun to watch, there was no way to buy a copy of your favorite film from a studio.  I know, because I tried to buy 'Bundle of Joy.'  Now the producers and stars get their money from sales, as Regal keeps most of the ticket sales intake.    Going to the movies is different these days, not to get in a cool place in a \\"palace\\" setting, but for diversion -- something to do.  I go to the early showings and am amazed at the number of working-age men who are free to waste a couple of hours at that hour.  Are there that many unemployed?    The early history of movie making in the East is unique and educational.  All the theaters and studios were owned and run by Jewish immigrants.  Today, a \\"star\\" can now produce, direct, distribute, sue Regal for a larger percentage, change the story and re-release a year later.  Now, I call that 'greed' on a high level.  I did not see his major production.    Columbia Pictures is now owned by Sony of Japan, who also owns TriStar Productions, CBS Records,and MGM Studio in Culver City.  Fox Studio is owned by an Australian media company.    Making movies is a principle sourse of prestige for trhe six conglomerate (global) companies, coveting thegold statuettes as \\"hold over\\" from the glory days when movies were decent.  Today, it's all about profits at the expense of decency and entertainment.    The reality shows proliferating on television could possibly make movies blase as there are no stars, no high fees, only the privilege of letting average-looking (not beautiful) people do crazy things.  Even a playboy with lots of money starred in his own series -- what a joke!    Movies will continue to be made for grown-up audiences to see in theaters, but they will play an ever-smaller part in the BIG PICTURE od Hollywood, which is all an illusion.

This is an Americanized version of a Polish girl's fate, similar to Anne Frank's, in Warsaw, Poland, where her father owned a butcher shop.  Luckily, they were Catholics and found a way to escape before the Nazis formed ghettos (later called concentration camps) for the Jews.  Anna had family in Chicago, so they journeyed there coming through Ellis Island where they saw the lovely State of Liberty on her pedestal.<br /><br />At the Pennsylvania Station, they located the train to take them to Chicago to reunite with relatives and start a new life.  All the time, she was thinking of her friends back in Warsaw and wishing they could share in her good luck.  The Chicago of 1939 was very different than it is today, no Sears Tower, but they did go to Soldiers Field and into the old theaters where they saw Clark Gable in 'Gone With the Wind' and Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale in 'Wizard of Oz.'<br /><br />They spent their first Easter in America, one she would never forget, in her new rose dress and bonnet, listening to records of Frank Sinatra, and heppy to be in this safe place.  This was a first hand account of the cruelty of the Nazis seen from a different perspective as that of Anne Frank.  She did not have to hide in an attic, but the Polish Underground existed to help those like her and her dad to excape to a better world.<br /><br />So many of the transplants to America experienced such a trauma in their young lives.

Southern fiction today, for the most part, shows the changes which began before the Civil War and 'accelerated' afterwards.  We have TVA and Tullahoma with its wind tunnel (a part of the U.S. space program) in Tennessee, Missile development in Huntsville, Alabama, the Houston, Texas space center, and Cape Canaveral in Florida.      I enjoy the fantasy works of Stephen Donaldson, which is nothing like the short pieces included here.  All of the writers have some connection to the South (however, one was born in L.A., Calif.), but many moved East as did James Agee and Richard Marius.  At UT, we have professors determined to change Southern writing, one in particular who plans his own version of Agee's A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.    Some of these writers have had books published, like Fred Chappell.  These stories are not necessarily 'of the South' nor literary.  We are not a \\"crossroads\\" per se, but a destination.

A writer of note on various subjects from 'Rolling Stone', not exactly known for its intellectual content, he predicts that \\"one world\\" will leave no place to hide because the rain forests are shrinking as is.  Without trees, pollution becomes more toxic.  Recently, the U.S. courthouse here cut down 48 trees \\"for security\\" directly at the location where the city buses congregate and leave the motors running.  This town is already so polluted, many of the residents have developed serious allergies.    When a nation becomes industrialized, the toxic refuse is dumped into the rivers and ocean.  Where to ship the toxic wastes is a revolving problem.  We are but thirty miles from Oak Ridge where they have nuclear waste products, constantly at our peril and on the roads to Utah or wherever.  China and other places which are now making America's products will be choking on the polluted atmosphere.  Perhaps they could ship it \\"down under\\" to Australia!  Or to the remote areas of Russia?  One World (ten years ago) is becoming a time bomb.    America has suffered economically by this global capitalism because Walmart (here it is called WallyWorld) and their cheap prices forced the U. S. to stop manufacturing and let China, India, Sri Lanka, and other cheap labor markets make inferior products.  We used to have pride in our U.S. made appliances and clothing.  Now, you have to search far and wide and still unsuccessfully for native-made, first quality merchandise.  Even our foods are from other countries, store brands in particular, which could be contaminated.    This possible catastrophe is to offer lower income customers cheap prices.  What we need to remember is \\"You get what you pay for.\\"  If you're happy with inferior products or possibly dangerous food items, you're taking chances.  Today, instead of having an appliance repaired, it is cheaper to just buy a new one.  The foreign made things have a short life span.    Big money hides itself in the global economy using taxhavens.  Social Security is in peril because the U. S. Government gives tax credits to the wealthy land developers who destroy the environment, causing more pollution.  It's a shame.	2005-04-02

It depicts the war clearly showing some of the multitude killed at Antietam, Gettysburg, the ruins at Harper's Ferry (all places I took my sons to explore a while back).  Lincoln is shown at Antietam after the 'bloodiest battle of the Civil War' in October, 1862.  Gettysburg, where too many from the South died, occurred in July, 1863.    The pontoon bridges were unusual and clever.  The horse and carriages and wagon trains showed how drastically things have changed.  Seeing a real ironclad was interesting.    This is a short course in the Civil War for those who want to know what happened; they can see the aspects from a Northerner point of view, as they ravished the South and left parts of it looking like bombed out London or Germany.	2005-04-02

Drucker is one of the world's top management thinkers.  When he was thirteen. he was asked \\"What do  you want to be remembered for?\\"  The classroom of boys felt ill at ease, as young men do, and none could give an answer.  They were told \\"If you still can't answer that question by the time you are fifty, you will have wasted your life.\\"  What if the thing or person we wanted to be at thirteen didn't materialize.  Does that make us a failure in life?  This motivation is supposed to push you to be the person you can become, and he suggests that you continue to ask it as you go through life.  Sometimes fate steps in and changes the whole process and you really don't have a choice in the matter.    I've used many day-to-day journals to help decide what I should do, SIMPLE ABUNDANCE was by far the best, but this one is so old-fashioned compiled from his multitude of books written 25 years ago.  It has an added day for Feb. 29, and this year did not have one.  However, it was one of the best for the average person.    Value is what the businesses define as quality, but this is not exactly accurate when it concerns the buyer.  By definition, the customer buys the satisfaction of a want; she buys value.    Today the new jobs require formal education and the ability to apply theoretical and analytical knowledge.  They require a habit of continuous learning.  They demand quality in learning and teaching.    In the United States in the 1960s, teenagers were the fastest-growing group demographically.  Now, it is the elderly.  Statistics are only the starting point.  For those willing to look and listen, changing demographics is a highly productive and dependable innovative opportunity.    No doubt Mr. Drucker is an intelligent thinker; he is author of more than 35 books on management in the business world.  He still teaches in the Management Department of Claremont Graduate University in California.  In 2002, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.      Joseph Maciariello is a colleague of Mr. Drucker and put together this daily guide from a multiplicity of the Drucker library.  He needs to do a commentary on Jack Welch, the former CEO who retired with millions and led a failing company to succeed in today's world.	2005-03-31

This story was like going back in time similar to CITY OF DREAMS and SHADOWBROOK in America.  However, Winterbourne was located in rural England of 1788.  Written by a Scottish sheep farmer who has worked as a bookseller and accountant, some of the descriptions are imaginative and artistic.    The death of the mother who'd abandoned her son but whose body was brought back to the estate for burial in the English cemetery was a turning point.  He'd felt guilty but actually she chose to leave the surroundings to live in a city to forget the past.    This was a good first novel, and he brings the varied characters to life with his novel way of expressing things.  The jacket painting of the estate, farm animals, hills and valleys, with the tricorn hats on the men, and the clouds overhead show Derbyshire as it once was.  I did not find a great deal of 'optimism' in this tale.	2005-03-31

Liz Smith was gossip columnist par excellence but, no, she wasn't a natural blonde.  The book is full of photos (half her life, she had dark hair) with the famous and infamous.  She was the ultimate party girl in the early fifties in New York. <br /> <br />She had a lovely mother but her two grandmothers looked like mine in Tennessee.  Age was not good for women in the thirties, forties, and fifties unless they were rich and, though her father owned a farm and horses, they were not on the upper scale.  She liked Tom Mix, the cowboy and never got over her desire to be a real cowgirl; kept his picture even through two marriages. <br /> <br />Growing up in Texas, she had a lot of LBJ's 'bigger-than-thou' bravado.  Seems to me I remember her at one of his press conferences but she claims the closest she got to doing a piece on the Johnson daughters for Cosmopolitan was a clandestine meeting at the St. Regis Hotel with Homer Busby, an aide to the president.  She'd known him at the University of Texas where she was a journalism student.  She says she was in her 'tart' dressing at the time, min-skirt and all. <br /> <br />The photo display shows her with a plethora of important people always partying.  She is shown with a young Barbara Walters, who describes her as \\"provacative without being vicious.\\"  She was not impressed with Sonny and Cher, put them down; guess they weren't \\"classy\\" enough.  Sonny went on to become a Mayor. <br /> <br />There are photos of her with Liberace, Truman Copote, and Bill Clinton.  She had an active social life and was the Joan Rivers of her time.  In 1976, she wrote a column for New York Daily News. <br /> <br />A memoir is just that, memories we want people to know about us, and she furnishes a full plate.  She sought a campy, bohemian life and had a ball fulfilling it on a large scale.	2005-03-30

They've searched for the location of the futuristic blimp, Akron, lost in 1933 and White Bird airplane which crashed in 1927, in rural Maine.  The lost locomotive east of Denver in 1876 was the first insurance scam.  Pirate ships can be traced back to Jean Laffite in 1821 who spent the last years of his life in America under an assumed name. <br /> <br />He gives a fascinating hyposis of what might have happened to cause the captain and crew of Mary Celest to abandon ship and how each died.  Since there were no survivors, this is a good case of \\"modern history writing\\" using some imagination and supposition, slightly dramatized.  Here we have details of the deaths and burials at sea, even the captain asking the German brothers, last two survivors, to kill him.  They, too, succumed to the elements.  It's strange that their lifeboat was never found.  Twelve years later, the Mary Celeste hit the coral reefs near Haiti and sank.  Clive Cussler was in on the filming of a failed recovery 116 years later, as the coral growth had covered the shipwreck with no way to cut through it, making it unrecoverable.  It was the grave for a Ghost Ship of notoriety. <br /> <br />Success came with the recovery of the Confederate sub Huntley after being submerged for 136 years.  Other Civil War casualties they searched for included the Confederate raiders, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama and ironclads Arkansas and Louisiana (among others) and the Union frigate Cumberland and ironclad Carondelet.  Seems he always came South in August.  They searched for the Revolutionary War sub Turtle, the twin sisters cannons from San Jacinto war, swamp angel gun used during the Civil War, and a steamer called Stonewall Jackson. New Orleans was the first steamboat to go down the Mississippi River. <br /> <br />In addition to writing his novels, C. C. will narrate a series of SEA HUNTERS documentaries on famous shipwrecks for Eco-Novaof Nova Scotia.  Look for them on PBS.	2005-03-28

Luckily, I was able to find the Large Print edition at the public library.  Written in the modern history style, forming opinions instead of using factual information, he even changes his mind from his earlier writings, LINCOLN'S HERNDON (his law partner), saying he has grown \\"skeptical\\" about what he had passed on as facts.  Feelings don't matter in factual history.   <br /> <br />He intimates that Abraham Lincolnn had \\"questionable\\" relationships with Joshua Speed with whom he boarded and shared a room and Ann Rutledge, though Lincoln seemed to have avoided becoming involved with women.  He quotes Stephen Ambrose whose opinion was that presidents need a confidant \\"who can be trusted absolutely never to divulge a secret.\\"   <br /> <br />These six spotlighted as \\"intimate friends\\" to Lincoln all divulged the letters and confidences they were trusted to keep secure!  They profited from the assassination by writing books.  His personal secretaries, the two Johns: Hay and Nicolay were no exceptions. <br /> <br />For a private, \\"close-mouthed,\\" self-educated, diversive president, he had no real friends as a youth, nor as President.  He enjoyed his sons, playing on the White House lawn with goats and other farm animals.  You can take the boy out of the country but you can't take the country out of the boy.  Did Mark Twain say that? <br /> <br />Since his orations were considered on a par with Shakespeare, I am wondering if they had speech writers for the presidents back in the 1800s.  Are those really his words and beliefs?  Did JFK really come up with the \\"Ask not what your country can do for you\\" or was that also phrased by some speechwriter?  Lincoln was a good actor, sought public influence with his Civil War addresses. <br /> <br />Mr. Donald has won two Pulitzer prizes for his earlier books about Lincoln and many concerning aspects of the Civil War.  But I would not call him an expert like Geoffrey C. Ward or William Davis.  He is a good researcher.	2005-03-26

Chris Wallace, formerly of NBC News, defines \\"character\\" in the presidency as \\"a test of will and purpose\\" as one of his favorites Reagan epitomized.  He also felt that strength and courage was involved in these controversial decisions. <br /> <br />He set out with this project to show how sixteen Chief Executives did the \\"unpopular thing and saw it through because they believed it was the right thing to do.\\"  Each believed he had a mission and responsibility to make America and the world a better place. <br /> <br />The episode of Andrew Jackson and the rich president of Second Bank of U. S., Nicholas Biddle was a duel in the sense of his temperament to always be the winner, no matter what.  Biddle had been asked by then President Jefferson to prepare the journals of Lewis and Clark for publication, but he had other, more pressing things to do. <br /> <br />This gives a detailed explanation of our currency status in the 1800s.  Jackson had fought in the Revolutionary War becoming a General, worked as a lawyer, elected as U.S. Senator and in Congress from the state of Tennessee, a judge in the TN Supreme Court, and Governor of Florida before becoming the seventh President in 1829.  He waged a battle to bring down a corrupt bank, against the oppositon of his political cronies.  He championed the common people, not the rich and powerful.  As a result of his victories, he paid off the entire federal debt, the first time in America's history. <br /> <br />At the time Andrew Johnson was elected Vice President, he was still the military Govrenor of Tennessee where he had defended Nashville against the Confederates and was chosen by the Union party to be Abraham Lincoln's running made.  Six weeks after his disastrous Inaugural Day,on April 15, 1865,  he became President as a result of John Wilkes Booth's dastardly act at the Ford Theater.   <br /> <br />Secretary of War Stanton hanged an innocent woman, Mary Sarrat, and had a wounded Booth shot and killed in a barn in Virginia.  His diary had been tampered with (18 pages torn out) which would have proved that she was not one of the conspirators in this case. <br /> <br />He was the first President to face impeachment charges.  in 1875, he became Tennessee's U. S. Senator, the only president to serve in that office after having been Chief Executive, but served only a few months before he died. <br /> <br />His successor as President, U. S. Grant, had graduated from West Point and became a Union commander who clashed with Robert E. Lee.  He served two tumultous terms. <br /> <br />Some great administrators like FDR, JFK, Jefferson, Washington, Lincoln, and others not so great comprise these stories told in the modern history style of engaging tales.  Mr. Wallace is now host of 'Fox News Sunday.'	2005-03-26
301825:US	35985708	R3N11TANRYU2F0	0151005869	564440558	Dark Light: Electricity and Anxiety from the Telegraph to the X-Ray	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Let there be Bright  Light!	Electricity had been around for awhile but not many Americans understood or subscribed to having the dangerous lighting in their homes.  So, Chicago came to the forefront with hosting the world's Columbian Exposition in 1893 in which the 'white city\\" of 400 buildings in Jackson Park sparkled and shone with electric lights.  George Westinghouse had won the coveted commission to wire the fair, and promised the \\"greatest electrical display of all time.\\"    Since a World's Fair is only temporary, for a specific purpose and time, those buildings, along a mile of midway with a huge ferris wheel, plazas, and wide promenades, were made of cheap materials but whitewashed.  Gleamingly white, they looked like real marble.  It was billed as \\"the third great American event\\" after the War of Independence and the Civil War.  It was a splendid sight, and later the University of Chicago would be built on that site in South Chicago.    Though invented in 1879 by Thomas Edison, the public was hesitant about this potent force to light their worlds.  Ms. Simon asks a lot of questions as to why Americans were fearful of this phenomena as to the purpose of her research and resulting book.    Electricity as lighting was a threat to the public who treasured shadows and secrets.  It generated widespread anxiety about becoming accidentally electrocuted.  There is a picture of a primitive electric chair, the first used in one of the New York prisons, to execute a murderer.  Edison espoused the use of hight currents as dangerous to one's health, which created more fear in a public who did not know what electricity could do.  They were familiar with the kite and lightning experiment of Ben Franklin and thought that might happen to them.  The first electrocution in 1890 was spelled out in detail and it was not what the experiments with animals had projected.  It was much harder to kill a man.    Dark Light refers to xrays, very primitively done in the beginning for no medical reason, and the telegraph, phonograph and electric light.  Thanks to Edison (and FDR), we now have TVA.  She used newspaper accounts, Conan Doyle novels and other sources to tell a good story, almost like the modern history writers.  However, Ms Simon who is a college English teacher, lists a lots of resources in the Bibliography and Endnotes.  She has previously written biographies.	2005-03-25

This research is based on the 2000 census.   It shows a very profound change from the 1990 census, after which this writer presented his version of WHAT WE ARE.  It was a hard decade for most of us as the world continues to change and take us with it.    In 1950, only ten percent of the population of the United States was non-white.  Today, one in four Americans are black, Hispanic, or Asian.  No country is home to more foreigners than the U.S.  We now have people here from Ukraine, India, even the Middle East.    In the 19th century, we invented the telegraph, telephones, and electric lights.  Then came radio, t.v., airplanes, automobiles, and the atom bomb.  Along, came immigrants in droves.  After WWII, the Japanese were given entry as we rebuilt their country.  For half a century, this country absorbed immigrants from every corner of Europe.    The United States was 40% of the world's population in 2000 in every way.  India has four times the population of U.S. but fewer people age 80 or older.  By 2011, the number of elderly will increase dramatically as the 'baby boomers' turn 65.    By 2025, the population is projected to grow by 23%.  In 2040, if no catastrophe overtakes us, Americans may outnumber western Europeans.  In 2050, the proportion of old people will have doubled.  By 2100, nonwhites and Hispanics are projected to make up 60% of the U.S. population.    H. G. Wells wrote, \\"the race between education and catastrophe is far from over.\\"  How the 21st century is determined by numbers but also by the vagaries of human nature.    Sam Roberts wrote THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE ROSENBERG CASE, is host of a daily t.v. interview show in New York City, and has been reporter, journalist, and an editor of the New York Times since 1983.

A professor of historical writing at the University of Georgia at Athens, the author of several books of academic history, wrote this book for non-historians.  He surveyed history readers on Amazon.com which showed him that the accusations of misconduct against the four writers as explained in this volume made no difference, as they look on it as \\"entertainment,\\" where fabricating and borrowing are now the norm and just taken for granted.      History by today's writers reflect only the image, not the real events or persons.  It's all a matter of taste, not truth.  There are no immutable facts and there never will be, for each interest group and each generation will make up its own facts.  The new history \\"excludes\\" important factual happenings as they would detract from the way the writer has decided to invent or re-invent the occurrences as entertaining tales.  He calls this \\"two-faced\\" history; it is like the cover of this book, a facade instead of the whole thing, only part of the truth.    Stephen Ambrose was charged with plagiarism and yet his books are still available.  He died in 2002.  Popular history will always sell, even when its authors have been proven to be cheats.  Ambrose's versions of the Lewis & Clark expedition has many false statements.  Lewis did not commit suicide, as he so nonchalantly stated.  His version of the Transcontinental Railroad is not above reproach, either.    Michael Bellesiles has out a new edition of ARMING AMERICA (a popular theme these days) with material, he asserts. which may be invalid.  He was accused of falsifying his research and credentials.  Joseph Ellis, a reviewer at New York Times Book Review, was accused of fabricating material and has written a biography of George Washington and about our Founding Fathers from his own viewpoint, and not the facts.    Doris K. Goodwin has just now released a new biography on Abraham Lincoln, as have other history writers.  He's a hot topic these days.  She was accused of plagiarism (borrowing material from others without giving credit) in 2002.    If you want to read real history, look for those bothersome footnotes and bibliography the academics and scholars use.  This distortion of our past is a travesty as the next generation will be relying on falsehoods and never know the truth of the matter.	2005-03-23

National security experts agree that nuclear terrorism is the main threat facing United States today.  Nuclear technology is no longer ours alone.   North Korea and Iran are possible places the terrorist groups could obtain the proponents to make a nuclear bomb.  In the 1990s, new nuclear countries could and still may ignite a nuclear war. <br /> <br />Just this past Sunday, I rode to Oak Ridge where the bomb was developed and passed a \\"steam plant\\" with an outside generator which could easily be sabotaged.  I could have stopped and taken pictures.  Anyone could.  The Oak Ridge High School has the nuclear symbol above the main entrance, just asking for something to happen there. <br /> <br />In Hunstville, Alabama, the Marshall Center (Redstone Arsenal) put info on the internet eight years ago about missles and other weapons.  Marie Curie started something with her experiments as did Loomis and his gang at MIT, which could possible lead to the extinction of our country.  We allowed the Manhattan Project to get out of hand at Oak Ridge and in New Mexico. <br /> <br />America's preoccupation with Iraq allowed Iran to accelerate its secret programs to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium to develop nuclear weapons.  Iran continued to import the equipment and material to establish facilities to enrich uranium.  Now, China is in on the deal. <br /> <br />Iran holds the uncontested distinction as \\"the most active sponsor of terrorism.\\"  In 1960, the Nobel Peace Prize chemist, Linus Pauling, collected signatures for anti-nuclear petitions, which got him in trouble with the U. S. government, who made him appear \\"unpatriotic.\\"  In 1997, Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize for working to get land mines banned.  Citizens need to become involved by asking questions concerning this issue of nuclear terrorism to the polictical candidates running for Senate and Congress from their areas. <br /> <br />In 1996, Mr. Allison had out a paperback, AVOIDING NUCLEAR ANARCHY; the 2004 book has brought up the terrorism issue.

Written by a noted psychologist whose book, THE SOUL'S CODE, was number one on the New York Times bestseller list in 1996.  The purpose of this new book is to delve into the myths, philosophy, and theology ot war.      Nothing can escape thermonuclear rage; if the burning and its aftermath are unimaginable, their causes (war) are not.  Today's wars depend on fighting spirit and political pressures plus diverse other deficiences.  He uses the movie 'Patton' and Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE to depict the \\"love of war.\\"  He quotes George Orwell about the Spanish Civil war.    He says there is no one cause for the United States Civil War.  First comes the immediate cause (firing on Ft. Sumter in South Carolina in 1861), the proximate cause (election of Lincoln, 1860), and underlying causes (abolition, westward expansion, power contest in the Senate, secession and many others).  He lays blame on Jefferson Davis' stubborn delusions and Lincoln's visions.  He quotes General Nathan Bedford Forrest, \\"to get there first with the most.\\"    His research is extensive from Stephen Ambrose, William C. Davis, William Manchester, Mark Twain, Shakespeare, and Ernie Pyle (about the \\"beauty\\" of war).  He quoted Admiral David Farragut, \\"Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead\\" at Mobile Bay.    Mr. Hillman resided in Europe for thirty years, taught at the University of Chicago, and has written many books including SUICIDE AND THE SOUL, THE THOUGHT OF THE HEART AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD, THE FORCE OF CHARACTER, and  KINDS OF POWER.	2005-03-22

This book was actually written by a lot of people; each chapter had varied and sundry consultants.    The cover shows a lovely new tube of lipstick, possibly Revlon or Max Factor.  Lipsticks are used as allures; beware the ingredients.  He tells everything you ever wanted to know about lipstick and maybe some you don't.  He gets pretty technical.    VANITY: Anti-wrinkle patches don't work; they can damage your eyes and will not lessen the wrinkles.  Lipsticks and sunscreens have been around in America since the 1920s, no doubt popularized by the movie stars of that era.  He left out perfumes.  Price, he says, is no guide to performance.         Tans cause long-range damage to the skin resulting in cancer by damaging DNA and the immune system' ultra-violet rays damage the eyes.  UV-A are the aging rays; UV-B are the burning rays.  Wear sunglasses to delay the start of cataracts.    VITALITY:  our bodies need carbohydrates, fat, protein plus sodium, potassium calcium, and iron, zinc, magnesium, and especially vitamins and trace elements.  Also fiber and water.    VIRILITY:  Viagra for men, the least said the better.  He goes into great detail.  Read the book to learn what really happens.    He devotes a section to germs outside the body and in; one hint is to use vodka or gin as antiseptic. I learned that brandy is made out of grape pulp after the wine is distilled.    Find out the truth about alcohol, peroxide, cleansers and all the chemicals involved to get rid of germs.    A chemist, Linus Pauling, won the Nobel Prize in 1954 and again in 1962 (Peace Prize).

This literary critic chooses unorthodox writers in a haphazard manner.  She has very little good to say about the eighteen authors she explores in this volume, similar to the 2003 20TH CENTURY ATTITUDES she had published by the same Chicago firm.

This is a continuation of The Mind of The Soul by this pair and The Seat of the Soul by Mr. Zukav.  He has published three others about the soul, yet he is not a psychologist or specialist in this field.  This is an extremely simplified textbook which found its way to the library sale.  The bold-faced \\"highlighted\\" parts throughout are distracting.    From some of the diagams, these ideas:  \\"The early antidote for painful emotions is Love and Trust\\" (combined), \\"You continually encounter what your soul wants you to encounter.  When you resist your encounters, you resist the purpose of your life, the beneficience of the Universe, non-physical assistance.  That resistance is your pain,\\" and \\"Stress is your indication you are resisting your experience in the present moment.  When you resist your emotions, you create stress.\\"    Your emotions are the force field of your soul.  Each emotion is a message for you, a signal from your soul.  When you are aware of everything you are feeling all the time (emotional awareness), you are in continual communication with your soul.  This book is a lot of wishful thinking.    They are a good-looking couple, but hardly qualified to influence educated persons about how to handle emotions or reach deep down to find one's soul.  That is a spiritual thing.	2005-03-20

When I found this book at the library surplus sale, I was skeptical about its intent, and felt I could offset the title.  This account is told by the son of a two-star general and his own military career is spectatular in itself.  He was brought up to be honest in his assessments with a strict ethical background.  He was the last person they should have hired to be one of the military aides to the 'wild man' Bill Clinton.  His mentor who had written for Parade magazine before taking government assignments, Al Santoli, in the Foreword praised Patterson who would \\"never intentionally malign any person.\\"<br /><br />It took a lot of reading and time to convince me otherwise.  He should have writtten of his concerns in 1998 when he was no longer an aide and stand up for his beliefs.  In 1996, he tried to undermine the president because, first and foremost, he was military and Clinton had other \\"more important\\" interests.  He accuses him of saying false things about our peril, what he called \\"an obvious, whopping lie.\\"<br /><br />He gives details of the scandals involving his boss, information to which he was privy.  He found Hillary to be nasty and rude, ruling the White House with an iron hand.  He stated matter-of-factly that the president feared his wife.  She was the \\"power behind the throne.\\"  He was upset with their abuse of the airplane and the high office, and their disdain toward the military.  Sometimes, they used the aides as luggage carriers or golf caddies.<br /><br />He went from fascination to disgust.  He made fun of the president's golf game and saw him cheat at golf; the photo on the cover has Clinton with a golf tee in his mouth.  It shows the real Clinton.<br /><br />As with so many scandals of Clinton's terms in the White House, it was the nation who paid the price.  And Mrs. Clinton is being touted as the first female president.  She already has been, and it was corrupt and expensive.<br /><br />Clinton's forcing of \\"coed\\" mixed-sex integration in the miltary caused serious problems, and lawsuits concerning rape.  The administration covered up the shortcoming of that policy instead of dealing with it legally.  Many women had to drop out of the military because they became pregnant.<br /><br />Pictures tell the truth.  He was young, idealistic when he was chosen as the Air Force aide; two years later, you can see his disillusionment and bewilderment about what he had seen first hand and been forced to live through.

I chose this book because E. A. Poe has always been one of my favorite writers, though most of his things are morbid.  He used one of Poe's stories to show the consequences of abject anxiety (and guilt).   Another of his recent renderings concerns Mozart's Brain.    There is a big difference between stress and anxiety, which is not a mental illness, but a prevalent and painful part of life.  Stress relates to all the unpleasant things which can happen to us.  Anxiety is how we relate to and handle such stress.  You can be anxious and fearful.  One is stressed and yet may not feel anxious.    The roots of anxiety involve perceptions and interpretations.  Situations which cause this unpleasant emotion are:  conflicts and frustration, a threat of physical or emotional harm, and challenges to our self esteem.  Worry, dread, fear, apprehension are sympthoms of anxiety.  In 'angst' we confront 'fundamental precariousness' of existence.  We're in a state of being fragile,  Our anxious dread renders us helpless.    When we anticipate the bad things which might happen, we experience anxiety.  It is only undesirable when it becomes extreme.  Inheritance plays a major role in how much anxiety we experience and how we manage it, which is useless as we can't choose our parents.    Anxiety is something we sometimes have to endure when things get too bad.  How, I ask, can one transform something so debilitating into positive, creative energy.  Medications blunt the symptoms but don't cure the pain.    Dr. Restak is a psychiatrist who had a few phobias of his own.  He has written thirteen other books, most about the brain.  He teaches at George Washington University Medical Center.	2005-03-17

Written by a psychologist, it is in the form of a textbook with Objectives at the beginning of each section and Questions to ponder at the end.  The various quotes preceding Objectives are a nice touch and the illustrations for the most part look like M&Ms, making me wonder why this book was in the library and not in schools.  It would be more effective in a psychology classroom, of which I had a taste in 1960 at Troy State College in Alabama.    The two-page list of emotions was interesting and helpful.  Emotions help to form relationships, experience growth, and evaluate our performance, as we move through the various stages of life.  Emotions help us to understand ourselves and each other.  Some potent ones are fear, guilt, loneliness, sadness, love, hate, distrust and shame.    Everyone feels all the same emotions.  It's what we do with them and how we perceive them which sets us apart.  We need to balance emotion with logic.  Instead of responding in a reactive manner, proactive is preferred to settle a conflict.  We often mistake arrogance for pride.    The goal of most power struggles is to win, at any cost!  We feel threatened by the other person.  We need to protect ourselves any way we can when we feel threatened.  Thus, a power exchange occurs with both verbal and non-verbal ways.  Silence (and withholding info, attention or affection) is the most effective communication tool of all.  There must be emotional input in all conflicts.    When forming new relationships with people, it is necessary to resolve any conflict to develop open paths of communication.  Doing it is hard, but then it is easy for open, honest dialogue throughout the relationship.  It is best at the beginning to make sure the relationship is important to you.  Don't discount the other person's perspective.    He says that \\"age, experience, maturity, and wisdom are all independent issues.\\"  He used actual cases to demonstrate his ideas and advice.  Erik Fisher is a psychologist; his co-author, Steven Sharp, is a freelance and technical writer.  Together, they simplified the exercises promoted to help the reader to understand his emotions and change them, if needed. Power conflicts are not an ego thing but basic philosophy of life on all levels.  It's something we need to learn how to handle.  This is a start.	2005-03-17

This was the first definitive biography of Alfred Loomis, written by the granddaughter of Harvard President, J. B. Conant and wife of Steve Kraft.  She used many articles written by Cleveland Armory for 'Fortune' magazine.  Most of Alfred Loomis' papers were lost or destroyed when he sold the Tower House in Tuxedo Park in 1950.  She used the services of Ruth Tenenbaum, a researcher on Loomis, and Donna Moreau on his mentor and first cousin, Stinson.    He'd led a double life, on Wall Street, as a lawyer and amateur physicist, who built a private lab hidden in part of a castle at Tower House in Tuxedo Park in New York.  He was a rich society figure who was manipulative of the real scientists, and he was the ultimate insider.  During World War II, he helped establish MIT's lab where radar was developed.  Some of his recruits came to Oak Ridge with the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb.      Albert Einstein, Fermi (father of the bomb), and Mr. Conant, the author's grandfather, were guests at his lab.  He even influenced FDR through his cousin, Henry Stinson, twenty years his senior, who was secretary of war at that time.  He had a colorful, powerful existence, had only two wives; his three sons weren't lucky in their marriages, either, but many offspring survived to be interviewed.    The forty-six pictures tell a story all their own,and her Epilogue with short, concise up-to-date bios of the main players as presented helped to understand the circumstances.  One of the most important, William Richards (son of T. W. Richards, chairman of Chemistry Dept. at Harvard and the brother of her grandmother, Grace) wrote a booklet exposing the lab, then committed suicide by electrocuting himself in 1940.  He'd also written a short version about the creation of the atomic bomb, which was kept under wraps.  Maybe it wasn't suicide?  Like Meriwether Lewis' demise on the Natchez Trace, we'll never know for sure.  The esteemed Conant family deemed this an embarassment.  J. B. Conant had the incident \\"covered up\\" and they were not allowed to speak of it again.    This was a tragedy in many ways; not an easy book to write, and not easy to read at times.  The rich are not always happier.  He purchased Hilton Head Island in South Carolina to use as a retreat for family and friends.  Though an 'aloof' man, he seemed to know everybody, all the important people.	2005-03-15

These are the thoughts, experiences and wishes of ex-Senator George McGovern from South Dakota who yearns for American greatness and peace in the world.   He served in the Senate for eighteen years and ran for President in 1972.  In 2000, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom by then Pres. Clinton.    He firmly believes in the moral and political principles of our founders:  liberty, equality, justice, truthfulness, and compassion for all -- many of those are missing in today's America.  Instead, we live in a world where millions of people are frustrated, angry, and desperate over the conditions of their lives.    He says that terrorism in American theaters, restaurants, shopping malls or buses may become a reality.  He feels that terorism is caused mainly by the conflict between Israel and Palestine more than poverty and injustice.  We've backed Israel since its inception in 1948 but, since 1967, they'be built large numbers of settlements on the West Bank of the Jordon River which they took from Palestine in the Six-Day War. There some Americans live amid hunger, poverty, illiteracy and disease.  And yet America continues to pour billions of dollars into the development and defense of Israel.  We have armed and equipped their military until it has become the most powerful armed force in the Middle East.    He had a lot to say about the stock market corruption.  He compares it to the crash of 1929 only on a bigger scale.    He believes in the 'plain old-fashioned morality and common sense, as embodied in our founding documents and the faith of the future.'  Our founders' words:  \\"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind,\\" \\"Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\\" \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\\"  It is his stance that liberalism is \\"a philosophy and way of life we inherited from the Founding Fathers.\\"    Liberalism's role is to harness federal power to serve the public interest.  He calls Bob Dole a true \\"compassionate conservative\\"; his parents' (father was a Methodist preacher)were lifetime conservatives who considered his friendship with Dole as the crowning achievement of his political life.    He gives some details about Andrew Jackson's attempts at changing the government from being controlled by the wealthy to the \\"common people\\" of America.  After Jackson, the \\"robber barons\\" exploited the nation's resources.  We've endured the Populists, Progressives, then FDR from a conservative family in 1932 changed things and served four consecutive terms.    He calls Jefferson, Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and FDR as the architects of American liberalism.  Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" was the most profound influence in shaping modern-day liberalism.  He was a believer in free enterprise capitalism and created TVA which has outlived its time.  He laid the foundations of the United Nations, which is on American soil in New York, his home state.    George McGovern is a dreamer in his old age, I feel.  We won't be around to enjoy the paradise he wants this country to become.  Wars begat wars, as in the past, and on into the future.	2005-03-15

This slanderous, slanted account of the election of 2000 is written by a partisan Republican connected to the Fox News Channel ('nough said?) and also writes for 'White House Weekly.'  If this were not so ridiculous, it might be funny!    When he had amassed the most votes (51 million) of any Democrat, there is no way Gore could have felt his \\"odds for success\\" were slim.  He had worked hard, I mean really hard for this chance to become president after suffering through all the Clinton strife and coverup.  If he hadn't \\"won,\\" he would not have pushed for his hard-won victory.  Possibly, he has some Scots-Irish blood to not give up, to keep on fighting. Katherine Harris was \\"bought\\" -- where else but in Jeb Bush's state?    Sammon confesses that he spent several years uncovering election fraud in Cleveland, Ohio, for a newspaper.  This time he spent a few months to defame Gore both before and after the 2000 debacle.  Why go to all this trouble for another newspaper, The Washington Times?  It was merely to make a name for himself.    He admits he stayed behind in Florida for 46 days (with only one change of clothes, if you can believe that) and ten of those were after the other reporters had left, to \\"inflict his own mortal wounds\\" so he could write this book.  He believes in hitting a man when he's down.  And apparently, now he has the writer's \\"bug.\\"    Not once did he interview Al Gore.  He relied on \\"leaks\\" from Gore aides whom he bribed.  And he calls Americans a \\"corny\\" lot.  According to him, \\"Most people have a kind of heater in their forehead that switches on in moments of profound anger...A mild-mannered person can go years, even decades, without the heater in his or her forehead ever activating.\\"  How absurd!    He calls Rush Limbaugh the most popular and influential radio talk show host in America.  Maybe he hasn't heard of Mike Savage.  They are a pair.  He calls Chris Matthews a Democrat but, in his book, he tells of his Republican family.  Like Savage,he goes for name-calling: Gore, a cad?  Not hardly, he's a gentleman who'd spent almost twenty-five years as a politician and had served faithfully as Vice President of the United States.  He is a statesman, and was terribly hurt when the pedestal was knocked out from  under him.    \\"Let's not forget, Al Gore won that election.\\"  He exercised his right to take the case to court.  That's his downfall, as courts are never fair.	2005-03-14

After reading this book, I understand why Chris Matthews' show is on at 6:30 a.m. instead of 9:30 or even 10:30.  His glory days of \\"hardball' are over, thank God.  He's over the hill, so to speak, and too rude with so much interrupting and inserting his own opinions.    Using this book to elaborate on his opinions to the extent of tearing the politician down to \\"prove his point\\" seems to be a San Francisco attitude.  Note the book on Mike Savage (Weiner).  To blame it on growing up in a family of five brothers in the town of brotherly love, is no excuse; and his opinions are just that -- and not the truth of the matter.    I must be still half asleep when I watch his early morning t.v. show on Sundays (after a delightful half hour preceding that listening to Don Thompson play old movie music on WHO, Des Moines), because I thought he was okay.  That is -- until he criticized Al Gore just because Chris himself was born into a Republican family.  How, I'd like to know did they decide to use him as a speechwriter for a Democrat president, Jimmy Carter!  Being a Catholic and Carter a Southern Baptist, now we know why the president came across as not being cultured.  Here in the South we thought perhaps it could be the Northern education and not the Southern gentility he should have displayed.    Granted, Gore was educated and grew up around the Washington, D.C. area, not at his dad's home in the South.  He's not the typical Southerner, either.  He may have roots in Tennessee (and this state embraced him after the presidency was stolen from him by incompetent officials in Florida), but he is not \\"of Tennessee or the South.\\"   He did garner more votes than any Democrat running for U.S. President, in 2000, 51 million.  He was trained by his father, our beloved Senator, to prepare for that high office, but the time has past.  He's gotten pudgy and rebuffs the press in our state.  I felt he \\"lost\\" because he backed Clinton in his outright lies about his indiscretion.  But, he's not at all like Loretta Young (or Lynn) with her flouncy dresses.    After a while, I decided I really don't want to know \\"what he really thinks.\\"  At least, he's not trying to start a revolution like his fellow San Francisco complainer who calls politicians names.  Chris tries to tear them apart to make himself look good.    In 1987, he started working for the San Francisco Examiner and is still a syndicated columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle.  There must be something in the air out there to produce two mavericks,  C. M. and Mike Weiner.  His wife was news anchor on ABC in D.C. in 2001.    He's written HARDBALL about his t.v. show and a book about KENNEDY AND NIXON.  He wasn't old enough to vote (neither was I) when the JFK charm worked for him.  His being Catholic goes far with Matthews, I'm sure.  Being a journalist gives him no right to tread on the other person's turf.  Before tearing another person down before the world, you should \\"walk a mile in the other man's shoes.\\"   He has no humility to even consider such.	2005-03-13

Imagine trying to teach kids that God is a part of American history in a public school where transgender studies in \\"Your Mommy Used to Be a Daddy\\" (or vice versa) are the rave. Savage said that the 'liberal' education establishment doesn't want your kids to know that the \\"absolute laws\\" found in Scripture as referred to in the Charter of 1683 became the basis for our Declaration of Independence.    Sounds interesting. Let's continue: Eighteen yrs. after the Pilgrims set foot on Plymouth Rock, they founded Harvard College (1646) to train preachers. The signs of our Judeo-Christian national heritage are etched in concrete on the Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln memorials in Washington, D.C., replete with references to God and the Bible. At the Supreme Court, the Ten Commandments hang over the head of the chief justice, and a statue of Moses is in the front section.    He quotes Daniel Webster: \\"Our ancestors established their system of government on morality and religious sentiment. No government can be secure which is not supported by moral habits.\\" Ben Franklin said, \\"If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be without it?\\"    The American Founders believed strongly in preserving the right for Americans to practice their own faith freely, publicly and without apology. They made the Ten Commandments the cornerstone of our constitutional rights. That sounds good, but today we have the Muslims, Devil Worshippers, Mormons, 7th Day Adventists, and many who do not believe as we do or have been brought up to know as truth.    His personal vitriol aims at actors, politicians, t.v. newscasters, those he calls 'dunces,' 'idiots,' and says that you are unAmerican unless you fight for your beliefs. What he needs to let through his 'ego trip' is that all individuals are entitled to their own opinions. When you put others down as he does, you bring your own image and integrity down, too.    He writes, \\"I pray to God that we will one day return America to her glorious roots of freedom, faith and family.\\" But I feel he is going about it in the wrong way, promoting revolution. He's more like Fidel Castro and I wonder if his God is mine.    He is educated in the natural sciences, but no degrees or training in history or political science. Living in San Francisco, I can understand why he is so deluded. If he'd move to the South, he could observe \\"average human beings,\\" not the perverts with whom he identifies.     I understand now why a local newspaper editor told me three years ago he has no tolerance for talk radio. I had written an article for a Senior online newsletter mentioning some talk radio. He must have heard Mike Savage. I have heard Gordon Liddy.    Savage spouts hate because he can get away with it. If we try to speak out the way he does, we'd be arrested despite the freedom of speech. He's author of 19-20 books and has a lot to say. Coming from the Bronx, he moved as far across the country from his roots. His Johnny Cash outfit (photo section) does not soften his savage personna. I hope he stays in San Fran. I'm not alone in failing to see any humor in these pages. I challenge him to look for the \\"enemy within\\" in his own soul.	2005-03-11

The local school system is considering dress codes as parents today don't care what the older kids wear in public so, when I found this book at the library surplus sale, I took it without checking the contents.  Was I in for a shock!    This unusual memoir concerns a totally different matter.  The female writer grew up in an unorthodox family situation.  The photos show a normal looking childhood and ordinary people.  However, there was nothing normal about their life, after a time.  The last photo shows her with two women, the taller is her father Richard (now Christine) who is shown as a beauty contestant.  He'd been an advertising writer and part time actor, and tried to stifle his desires with alcohol; to beat it all, he was only 5'10\\".      He and Dinah had been high school sweethearts in Cleveland, Ohio.  He kept his distance from daughter, Noelle, and she avoided being in his presence.  Children know instinctively when things aren't right.  She learned at the age of fourteen that her father had a real problem which they'd have to live with, or acccept whether they wanted to or not.  He'd implied as much in 1962 before the wedding to Dinah, but she didn't take the warning.  She heard what she wanted to hear by changing the subject.    This girl lived through emotional and mental distress because of the consequences.  There was never any guilt involved, only a determination to become what he wanted, no matter who got hurt.  Noelle wasn't successful in sticking with anything she tried, giving up in the early days of a college education, or a job abroad, and suffered a misery only hinted at.  It's a miracle she came out as \\"normal,\\" with the happenings the next ten years after her mother explained the reason for the divorce.  She remarried and Richard had operations to appear feminine and have his own way of living.  It's sad to put that burden on an adolescent who developed a split personality in high school.    She'd written an earlier book, OUT OF THE ORDINARY, with Ellen Samuels, prepping for this family revelation.	2005-03-10

Written by a professor at Fordham University in New York who had written an earlier history of t.b., THE LAST CRUSADE.  He used a lot of footnotes, meaning that he used other persons' opinions to support his own.    He says that what we call 'manners' has little to do with ethics or morals.  Edmund Burke, on the other hand, wrote, \\"Manners are of more importance than laws.  According to their quality, they aid morals...or totally destroy them.\\"  Rudeness rarely kills.  Politeness (good manners) does not a saint make!    He uses Martha Stewart as a paragon of manners, who certainly set an example about lying (or getting caught).  New Yorkers Emily Post and Amy Vanderbilt were the epitome of etiquette experts, but it takes a Southerner with manners to show how it's done.  The mobile society of today has almost ruined Southern manners.  Boorish behavior is still thriving, there is a good example right here in Knoxville, Tennessee.    Emily Post (and later her daughter, Elizabeth) believed that \\"the code of ethics is an immutable law of etiquette, instinctive decency, integrity, self-respect, and loyalty.\\"  Others considered 'civility' as politeness, refinement, propriety, courtesy, affability and good behavior.  Class differences define \\"good taste\\" but not \\"good manners.\\"    Hollywood produced 'comedies of manners' in such films as 'The Philadelphia Story,' 'My Man Godfrey,' and 'Bringing Up Baby.'  The Titanic sank on April 14, 1912.  The \\"ladies first behavior showed that the men were gentlemen to the edge of death.\\"  The glamor of life on the Titanic floated and sank, as did the civility of opposites, high class and not-so-high.    Kathryn Murray who had a dance show with her husband, Arthur, wrote a guide for teenagers in 1961 and she has noted:  \\"Though this may surprise boys who have never thought about it, most girls notice 'table manners'...Girls take a dim view of a boy who slouches on his elbows, grips his fork like a shovel, or eats untidily.\\"  At a recentnoontime organ concert downtown, a man brought his lunch, seated himself on the first row, turned sideways to eat (where all could see) and put on his own show.   He had atrocious manners.  I read in the local paper about a concert in this newly renovated theater where beer and liquor floated freely and normal patrons could not see the stage for all the drunken activity.  Those expensive new seats and carpet will be stained and smelling soon.    One's command of the written language divulges evidence of status, wealth, or education on cyperspace.  Chat rooms on the Internet can be dangerous as you can't see who is on the other end.  I received a communication from Music Of Your Life with a virus in it.  No one is safe from some kind of abuse these days, be it rudeness or damage to the computer by viruses through email.    The double standard between the sexes still exists.  Nowadays, a man who believes a woman is harassing him has simply projected his own lust onto an innocent female.  Data shows that some men are likely to interpret relatively innocent behavior as invitations to sexual contact.  It's a fact!    If somebody holds two doors open for you, do you thank him twice?  I do, as it is unusual in Knoxville, not the norm; but usually if the first door is opened for me, I open the second door for the other person.  Manners are universal, not just a considerate male.  Oh, by the way, do you eat fried chicken by holding it in one hand?  Or is that just a Southern way of doing things?  I admit we are less formal in the South ( you do have to speak to a man first!), but Knoxville isn't exactly Southern anymore.  The downtown area has been taken over by folks from other places, and the only people who talk to you on public transit are the homeless, of which we are overrun (unless, of course, it is someone you know).  We have all kinds of dialects and accents here, not like Nashville where people are friendlier.	2005-03-09

Its fate was similar in many ways to the later Titanic disaster, but on a smaller scale.  Firsthand testimony of the survivors makes this a classic. <br /> <br />The manager of the Collins Line, owner of Artic, lost his wife and two children in this 'Great Disaster,' in which four hundred people died.  Captain Luce lost his son, who was aboard but sick in bed below deck.  There were many infants, children, and teenagers aboard the boat when it collided head on with Vesta off the coast of Newfoundland on September 27, 1854, in a dense fog. <br /> <br />Of 408 parents, children, and crew, only 87 survived, with a mere 22 passengers, as the crew took the lifeboats.  The unwritten law of the sea was \\"women and children first\\" but some of the women panicked as they were little more than small canoes, only six in number.  Most of the parents and children could have fit in these flimsy boats, but the crew mutinied, going off in half empty lifeboats, leaving the others to die. <br /> <br />The Artic had left the dock at the foot of Canal Street in Manhattan, New York, ending up near Newfoundland that fateful day in September.  They tried to reach land getting as far as St. John's on September 30.  This was an important chapter in the U. S. Merchant Marines as they helped with the rescue. <br /> <br />Because the captain had left his first officer with six men to linger in the fog, the sailors abandoned the vessel.  Captains rarely speak to their sailors directly, and he tried in vain to save his command.  He would survive the shipwreck by clinging to the housing of the steam engine after it was turned to flotsam.  The strange-looking life preservers proved defective. <br /> <br />The New York HERALD printed a poem, 'The Loss of the Artic' in its October 22nd edition, included in the Appendix.  There are photos and drawings in the photo section to help understand the circumstances.  The Artic ended up at the botton of the Atlantic Ocean, but those rescued told the tale -- as opposed to the deserted \\"ghost ship\\" Mary Celeste.   <br /> <br />David W. Shaw has written FLYING CLOUD, DARING THE SEA and INLAND PASSAGE and is a sailor himself.  He did intensive research and gave a glossary so that the reader could better understand his sailor's slang.	2005-03-08

In this book, you learn about the personality of Angela and the events just prior to her death.  His version of the Irish funeral 'doings' at a fancy mortuary in New York whre they partied with lots of beer is almost sacrilege.  He had suggesting putting her ashes in a body bag and leaving them on the curb for garbage pickup.  He and Frank were in financial straits at the time, but brother Alphie was doing okay.  Frank became the possessor of her ashes in an old bean can.    Bob Miller wrote this account from McCourt's avid remembrances.  Like Eddie Fisher's BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, he reveals the bad with the good.   Malachy's narration is spelled almost phonetically, the Irish sayings Americanized, which I guess his fans would get a kick out of -- it reminded me of the old man in 'Brigadoon.'      Since I don't watch soap operas I have not recognized him as a young man, nor at the age of 69 when he was diagnosed with cancer.  He had a sad life in Ireland, but after coming to America drank his way around the world to forget his past.    Part of this book is about the retarded stepdaughter and the experimental program they agreed to at the Willowbrook State School for the Retarded on Staten Island.  To get a place for her, they signed consent for her to be used as a guinea pig in a hepatitis program funded by the U. S. Army.  The place as described resembled the one in the movie, 'Suddenly Last Summer,' in which Elizabeth Taylor is committed by a demented aunt and she wonders out on a raised landing above a mass of humanity \\"driven totally mad\\" by the place in which they were drugged, abused and locked.  These things actually existed, and he and his wife Diana witnessed it first hand.    He tried to expose the horrible abuse through the media (radio and t.v.).  He said, \\"Media types will come to the 'field of dreams', but don't ask them to cover the plains of nightmare.\\"  Finally, they were able to get Geraldo Rivera to tour the back wards with a cameraman.  It took them two years to get heard in Court in 1972.  It was a historic case, followed by similar suits across the country, that all people have a right to decent human conditions no matter what their mental status.    He made his mark in Hollywood and New York in movies and plays, and was host of t.v. and radio talk shows.  So I'm sure he has a vast following of those who've seen him -- and read his previous book, A MONK SWIMMING.    He was the Boston police lieutenant in 1978 'The Brinks Job' and was in 'Mass Appeal' on Broadway in 1982.  Then his soap opera career started in 'Search for Tomorrow,' 'One Life To Live,' 'Ryan's Hope,' etc.  Now he has embarked on a career as a writer, or at least a storyteller to beat all.  All in all, his is a success story.	2005-03-05

This collection of essays from his syndicated weekly column is sorta like Nick Clooney's in Cincinnati.  This book contains 99 short composites espousing his point of view on diverse themes; he's not afraid to state his likes, dislikes, and fears plus his sense of humor.  Like his take on Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' which is different but thought-provoking, and the \\"immorality\\" in the White House during Lincoln's term.    Surely he wasn't serious about an Oscar for Debbie Reynolds as an old woman.  She was just playing herself, as she always did.  He chose her because she was born in Texas.  Hey, she grew up in California!  For his deficient memory, she was the 'original' Tammy, then Sandra Dee took over in \\"the Doctor\\" with Peter Fonda.  Debbie is a good entertainer but not so successful in normal living, as being \\"turned on\\" is the only way she knows how to be.  Last year, she moved her movie memorbilia to Pigeon Forge (not too far from Dollywood) in the Smokies and, as a result, was chosen to ride the main float in their Christmas parade.  Now, that's a star -- to come to Tennessee after the flob in Las Vegas.  It appears that she lives through her obese daughter, Carrie, who writes.  He had flattering things to say about Dolly Parton, a native of this state but not representative of us all.    He bemoans the fact of the seasons overlapping in 'It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Easter,' due to marketing and displays in the stores.  I wish we could go back to the old days when fruit and veggies are available only in the growing season for America; they do taste better then, as he lamented.    He likes to go where the action is.  In June 1996 in Moscow, at 3 a.m. after filing his last report on the Russian elections and on the way to his hotel, he heard the voice of Ella Fitzgerald who'd just died.  She had a pure quality to her voice, received much acclaim in life as in death.  He wrote, \\"We never knew much about her personal life; we never knew anything abouther except in her songs.\\"   If he listened to MUSIC OF YOUR LIFE and Chuck Southcott, he'd be sad to learn that she'd lost both legs due to diabetes, and her friends would take her for a daily afternoon ride around Los Angeles while Chuck played her songs on the radio.  She may have seemed \\"alone\\" in her singing, but her friends in the Society of Singers made her life bearable, so as not to be completely alone.    Some of these \\"timely\\" accounts are dated, but all in all I found it an interesting book.  I'm glad I have it as he is one of my favorite broadcasters.  The comprehensive index was helpful.  I will miss seeing his friendly face on the nightly CBS news; he was the best reporter ever, and I hope he will contribute to Sixty Minutes.  Maybe he can replace Andy Rooney?	2005-03-04
330362:US	35985708	R2AMTD97AFGOXO	1400062446	568810549	Hard News: The Scandals at The New York Times and Their Meaning for American Media	Books	3	2	7	N	N	Won't This Beat All!	This is the story of a family who ran the prestigious newspaper passed down, The New York Times (Adolph Ochs to Punch Sulzber's son, Arthur, Jr.) and the almost fatal reign of an egotistical editor, Howell Raines -- as background so the reader might see how irresponsible they were to let this scandal happen in the first place.    In effect, Arthur turned the paper over to Mr. Raines, whose browbeating style offended the politicians he lampooned.  He is described as being short and \\"expansive\\" with dark, fierce eyes which intimidated the Times backbone (his subordinates) even when he wasn't speaking.  He looked like an angry hawk to make up for lack of stature.    In less than two years, after he was appointed to lead the paper into a 'bright future,' he was forced to resign in disgrace.   He had taken over less than a week prior to the tragedy of 9-11-2001 and, with his prodding, the paper was awarded six Pulitzer Prizes (for their coverage of terrorism and its consequences).  He became as visible on the society pages in gossip columns and the New York social scene as he was provocative in the editorial section, where he reigned supreme.    The legacy he left was using a national emblem as his personal vitriolic \\"soapbox.\\"  He slandered politicians unmercilessly about campaign finances, among other things.   He was one to 'hit below the belt.'      He took over and ran away anyone with morals; no one was ethically strong enough to contradict him.  He proved to be the relentless \\"boss from Hell.\\"  Soon, credibility of the Times suffered because of his activist role and questionable reporting.  He had a definite \\"flood the zone\\" mentality which irked a lot of people, not just those who worked under him.    It took another short male (only five feet tall) to bring this small man to his fateful moment of truth, resulting in the loss of his esteemed forceful hold over this paper.  These two make me think of the words of the song, \\"Short People.....\\"    Jayson Blair fromFairfax County, Virginia, was too ambitious but unreliable (the spelling of his first name is even false).  He successfully faked a story in his school paper and got away with it.  He became known as a prevaricator and scandal monger in his made-up stories.  No one checked his background (serious problems with reliability, accuracy, and his colleagues) before having hired him as an intern at The Boston Globe (where he acquired a reputation for \\"trafficking in nasty gossip\\" and stealing story lines and ideas) and the Times (where he was deceptive about his education).    All newspapers hate \\"embarrasing\\" corrections:  my local paper recently left out an entire decade of happenings in a newly renovated theater, refused to acknowledge the omission even though they made the mistake, not caring who they hurt.  Apparently, they had used the info from the management (not local people) and deemed it wasn't important enough to list as a \\"correction.\\"  Thus, they lost a subscriber, many I hope.  I wrote to the publisher that such an obvious omission is as wrong as using false statements, but it was not publicly acknowledged.    A local t.v. station had made a similar omission in the history of the station, and got away with it, so it didn't matter as far as they were concerned.  The media have lots to be responsible for and should admit when they have done wrong.    Blair went from using others' previously published work to making up stories, then claimed mental illness.  The fact that it happened at a national, prize-winning newspaper brought the truth out for the whole country to \\"talk about.\\"  Thanks for Seth Mnookin, a former senior writer at 'Newsweek,' we learn how he pulled his con game and brought to an end the destructive reign of Howell Raines, who had incidentally sent Blair an email praising his 'journalism.'  His version of 'hard news' never happened, or at least as presented in the N. Y. Times.  I hope Bruce Hartman reads this book.	2005-03-02

The book jacket calls this a \\"deeply personal journey filled with passion and a sheer lust for life.\\"   Starting as an engineer at GE in 1960, he tried to stay out of the corporate bureaucracy while he ran a collection of GE businesses out of a Hilton in Massachusetts.  For more than twenty years, he played in his home state until he was chosen by Reg Jones to be his successor there in Fairfield, Connecticut.  A hug from Reg confirmed Jack as the new boss. <br /> <br />In the early days, he says, he was called a crazy, wild man.  When he became CEO in 1981, Wall Street asked, \\"Jack who?\\"  He showed them (in fact, the whole world_ \\"who indeed.\\"  He had said he wanted GE to become \\"the most competitive enterprise on earth.\\"  He had big plans and, like Marvin Runyon at TVA, he pared down employment at the expense of being liked.  He acquired RCA but not Honeywell. <br /> <br />From the photo section, there is a pictorial record of his exploits and associations with some of the most important people in America.  He is shown with Warren Buffet who he calls \\"the smartest guy in ANY room.\\"  He is shown with Bill Gates of Microsoft, both Presidents Bush, also Clinton, even Queen Elizabeth I (who appeared entranced by him.)  In the '80s, he shakes hands with Russian Pres. Gorbachev and China's Pres. Zemin in the early '90s.   Now, I say, this is the man to be photographed with.  He is clearly proud of his young wife. <br /> <br />A photo of his Irish mother and his dad, \\"Big Jack,\\" as a conductor on the Boston & Maine commuter line show a happy family. <br /> <br />After his twenty year tenure as CEO, it is his turn to choose his successor, Jeff Immelt, whose resemblance is so remarkable that they could be father and son.  He is America's success story, I'd say even more than his idol, Warren Buffet.  Now, after 41 years, no one says, \\"Jack who?\\"  He had shown them who \\"Jack\\" is and had a ball along the way traveling here and yon, hobnobbing with important people everywherehe went.  He is a man to be reckoned with -- hate to end a sentence with a preposition, but that's what he was.  His mother would be proud of his success.	2005-03-01

Because people are living longer (at least twenty years and more), and the Baby Boomers will be eligible for Medicare in 2011, changes will have to be made in the medical care, specifically Medicare.  Already, this program which covers all Americans 65 and over is in dire straits, and it may have to become a \\"needs-based\\" program limited to the poorest elderly with related healthcare rationing reserved for the oldest and sickest.    It should have evolved into this state long ago as the rich older Americans take what they can from the government (as a given right) with no regard to the needs of persons not of their class.  People who live in enormous, glamorous homes and spend a lot of time socializing at a country club should not be receiving Medicare.  It must be limited to those unable to provide for themselves, as the extended family of the past no longer exists, and children of the elderly refuse to take on the responsibility -- leaving sick parents at the mercy of the government's social programs.    The Baby Boomers seem to resent their parents for some reason and now they are beginning to have health concerns (due to aging) of their own.  They are concerned only with the possible collapse of the Medicare as it exists today before they can benefit from the \\"system.\\"    So, the elderly are palmed off onto churches to beg for help.  As it is predicted by professionals now, the poorest and sickest will be left out in the cold as there will be no place for them in affordable government funded long-term care.  The rich will get all the beds.    By involving elders in faith communities as \\"volunteers\\" it gives them the emotional support and a source of optimism which will in turn provide stress reduction and improve their own health in unexpected and unique benefits, thus making them less of a burden on others and on the healthcare system.    Assisting the downtrodden is a theological mandate for most religious denominations.  The painting on the cover of The GoodSamaritan is your standard church literature, Sunday School fare, and makes a point of helping someone in need -- but, why is the poor fellow unclothed.  They could at least have placed a shawl or shroud around his naked shoulders, as the family is well dressed for 1857.    Written by Dr. Koenig who has published five earlier books along this same vein, Doug Lawson Ph.D who wrote and promotes VOLUNTEERING, and Malcolm McConnnell who'd collaborated on an earlier Koenig, THE HEALING POWER OF FAITH, and writes about medical and scientific subjects.      This research and informative book \\"for adults of all ages, of all educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, of all health conditions, and all faiths\\" is a result of a conference at Duke University.  FAITH IN THE FUTURE presents a synthesis of the historic March 2001 conference and expands on the themes raised there.    We need more compassionate people to care what happens to the old (65 yrs) and very old (85 yrs) as the numbers increase.  One of my favorite English lit. poems was ABOU BEN ADHEM (\\"may his tribe increase\\" because of his good deeds in the name of God).  My goodness, it's passed all bounds of the imagination.	2005-02-25

To endure life's inevitable roadblocks, we have to strive not for perfection, but contentment, and miraculously all the pain will go away -- for a while.  What he calls \\"curing\\" I call \\"coping with.\\"  There is no cure for the hardships we all encounter along the way -- becoming a hermit is even worse, as you dwell on what's wrong.<br /><br />Ultimately, all pain goes through a \\"receiving center\\" in the brain, and seratonin blocks the perception of pain and keeps it from \\"centralizing\\" in the nervous system.  In his diatribute to the ability to be pain-free, he refers a lot to his former book, BRAIN LONGEVITY, on which he collaborated with the same journalist who has written for several medical magazines.<br /><br />He uses many \\"deficits\\" for possible causes of chronic pain, but specifically names seratonin as the worst, depending on one's pain tolerance threshold.  He says that women suffer more from chronic pain due to hormonal changes, that two-thirds of all patients at pain clinics are women with migraines.  Back pain is three times more prevelant in women, according to this doctor, and chronic muscle pain is ten times more common among the female sex.<br /><br />All pain signals ultimately land in the brain, where they trigger thought, emotions, memories, and a complex array of biochemical events aimed at protecting your body from further harm.  With chronic pain, the alarm continues to shriek uselessly long after the physical danger has passed.<br /><br />Seratonin is the body's single best pain-fighter, more important even than endorphins.  Seratonin deficit is a major culprit.  He emphasizes that suffering is one reaction to pain, but not the only possible reaction -- that it is possible to experience pain without suffering from it.  He admits that all lives contain some pain but, when you can experience it without suffering, \\"your chronic, disabling pain, for all practical purposes will be 'cured'.\\"<br /><br />Pain is the most common reason people go to doctors.  Dr. Scott Fishman, president of the American Academy of Pain Management feels, \\"We've wandered from the basic philosophy in medicine, where you cure what you can but always treat suffering, to being focused only on curing.\\"<br /><br />In the section about arthritis, he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve.  One example is plain aspirin which, he says destroys the cartilage, the \\"padding\\" which keeps bones from rubbing together.  This is the most common type called osteoarthritis.  It is thought that eighty percent have this type by the age of fifty, progressing as age does.  It involves hands, spine, hips, knees and feet (primarily in overweight people), and goes back to the cavemen.<br /><br />Exercise therapy is touted as a natural substitute for medicine, but I know first hand that this type can cause more pain.  Rheumatoid is a disorder or malfunction of the immune system with more inflammation of the joints.  He says that this is most often in women between 25 and 50, with no known cure.  In this type, you have to learn to \\"conquer\\" as opposed to \\"cure.\\"<br /><br />He really only stresses what we all know, you just have to live with pain at varying times and in varying intensities.  If you try to follow all of his suggestions, not only would you spend all your time trying to locate and consume numerous herbal supplements and expensive foods, but your money, too.<br /><br />Mort Crim once remarked, \\"forgiving someone can't change the past but it can transform the future.\\"  Dr. Khalsa tried out this intensive program at the University of Arizona. I think he must have had all female subjects. It is not recommended to use this as a substitute for medical care, as needed, only as some suppositions.  More research is needed, I feel, and I wonder how long his program lasted.  I feel that traditional Pain Management, similar to what I had at Vanderbilt in Nashville is better -- but thereis NO cure for pain.  That's an illusion.	2005-02-24

If I didn't know better, I'd say she is a devout Baptist.    Whoever would have even thought she need \\"permission to prosper,\\" especially from a demanding husband.  One good point she made is that single people are independent, as they eat what they want and when they choose, and have an entire bed to themselves.  So do many modern families (or couples) as I've observed personally by being dumbfounded at how much the men in their 40s are under the thumb of dominant wives and have to prepare their own meals (sometimes also the children's) whether the mother is working outside the home or otherwise.  He must help with the child rearing and cleaning, and give his permission to succeed.  Just don't make more than he!    But a woman alone cannot prosper no matter how powerful, as she needs a man who offers emotional support.  To my mind, a poor woman can succeed but not prosper.  Why?  Simply because two incomes make all the difference, not just being submissive to a man you love.  If he becomes too demanding, you soon learn 'not to love,' and that's one of the reasons divorce is at an all-time high.  The glow of being in love wears off if the woman has to 'ask permission' to do anything.  That's like being in school where you have to ask permission from your teachers to do anything.  Whatever happened to women's lib?    Craving something and obtaining it are two different things.  Sometimes we have to work a little harder to obtain our goals, but letting a house husband make decisions we can prosper or not is absolute nonsense.    This book was written as a rebuttal to this silly idea she blithely set forth in one of her FSB online columns -- which ignited an uproar from other 'successful' working wives who felt the ridiculousness of the Biblical lore that the husband is your 'lord and master.'Ha.    A working woman can walk out of a bad marriage, but so can an independent-thinker who refuses to bow down to a man just because he shares her bed, even if she is poor.   Granted, she won't \\"prosper\\" all alone but she doesn't have to sacrifice her dignity.  No marriage partner should be a 'slave' whatever sex.    I've seen rich people with more money than they know what to do with; they continue to live together in a loveless marriage to keep the high level of living, but are they happy?  I doubt it.  When you're young like Mrs. Jaffe, love in a marriage means it is a success.  In twenty years, I'd like for her to do a follow up to let us know how \\"seeking permission\\" worked, or didn't work.      Things change and people change during the diverse phases of life.  After the empty-nest syndrom, which she has yet to experience, oft times the couple drift apart.  If they are content with the status quo and leading separate personal lives, so be it.    It's more a partnership to share a nice house and \\"prosperous\\" environment and go separate ways.  Politics make strange bed-fellows.  At least, she realizes that stress is present even in good times.    I'm glad her loyal readers rebelled enough for the research she accumulated as listed in the bibliography, but I thought it strange that she listed three of her own books as references.  She should have delved deeper for the women writers who disagree with her concept.  Love and marriage is not a black & white 'fantasy' but a job in itself, if done right.  \\"She can soar without him -- maybe even in spite of him -- but with him is definitely better.\\"  How odd.	2005-02-21

After all the 'hype' of this successful 'first novel' in England, I couldn't wait to get it.  Ms. Clarke took ten years to research the early history of England and the magic they used, uses a lot of detail and long footnotes.  It just had to be good -- too good to put down, right?    I found it to be along the lines of Harry Potter only for adults.  This involved \\"masterpiece\\" is about two magicians in 1806 seeking the wisdom and abilities of the Raven King, purportedly taken by fairies as a child and grew up to become King of England & Fairie in the twelfth century.  He was considered to be the forebearer of English magic.    Too good to be true, I soon learned as I tried to plow through all the non-magic inessential mismash to find the truly magical.  First, two non-practicing magicians seek out one whose reputation had become known, a Mr. Gilbert Norrell, at Hurtfew Abbey, 14 miles from York, where a band of old gentlemen met only to discuss (but not practice) magic.    Mr. Norell has an extensive library filled with the ancient magic manuals, but his discussion group of elderly men are only interested in reading and talking about magic, that is, until young Jonathan Strange arrives on Norvell's doorstep.  Because of his enthusiasm at the sight of all the out-of-print writings of scholars of long ago, Jonathan persuades Mr. Norrell to teach him the old practices; as a consequence, they became involved in the wars, using supernatural skills summoning ghost ships and such.      She tells good stories unknown to Americans, but from English lore.  In Camelot, we discovered Merlin as Arthur re-lived his strange childhood through memories of the magic.  In eleven years (1806-1817), much confusion and misconceptions occur between these partners in crime, as illustrated at intervals throughout the long, wordy history of English wars and fairy intervention.  I counted twenty-four shadowly sketches, few and far between which added a slight diversion, but nothing else.It took Rowling five volumes and movies to get Harry Potter to his potential.  Ms. Clarke spent ten years and only one very wordy volume to show the potential of Jonathan Strange with Mr. Norrell's direction to learn what he could do.      This has been accepted as a 'piece of wonder' in Britain, but I really doubt its popularity in the States.  Only to the faithful who read all five Potter novels would some of this make sense.  Had she divided this tome into five books to let the gory parts subside in between, it might be palpable.  The difference is that Harry Potter was supposedly written for children but even educated adults could enjoy the simplicity, this book of adult magic makes our Civil War seem like child's play.    It was just not my \\"cup of tea.\\"	2005-02-16

Written by a movie review expert who spent twenty-five years at the 'Chicago Tribune' as chief critic and arts and entertainment editor until he retired in 2002, he gives the background of early theaters and their demise.  The best feature of this study of drama and theater from the early 1830s is the abundance of old photos and playbills interspersed throughout.    Innumerable theaters existed in such a large place as Chicago.  McVicker's in the 1850s was considered the 'high class' theater of Chicago, a place for the major stars and shows of its time.  Sarah Bernhardt made her Chicago debut there in 1881, which she called the 'pulse of America.'  Edwin Booth, son-in-law of James McVickers, mgr., and his brother, John Wilkes Booth appeared there in RICHARD III.  Edwin shared acting honors in OTHELLO and JULIUS CAESAR with James O'Neill whose son Eugene wrote about in his drama, 'Long Day's Journey into Night.'  McVickers himself appeared as the grave digger in HAMLET.  It was destroyed by fire in 1871, again in 1890, to be replaced in 1922 as a movie theater which was razed in 1984 as were so many others across the country.      In 1906, the Majestic (later called Shubert) opened on Monroe St. at Main near the Loop.  It's still there in the theater district with five others.  In 1959, the Shubert hosted 'The Music Man' starring Forrest Tucker.  Shubert has continued in business through the decades, except the Depression years (1932-45).  In the 1990s, Mayor Daley decided to revive some of the old money-generating bustle and prestige-garnering glamour of the theater scene downtown.  The Shubert is now owned by New York based firms, and will be revamped in 2005, and, after all these years, will sport a new name -- LaSalle Bank Theatre.    An early move toward revival of the Loop area took place in the 1980s.  Chicago Theatre (1921) on State Street was threatened with demolition but, after nine months and $25 million investment, it was restored.   So were the Palace on Randolph St., and the Oriental (both 1926) all refurbished, back to the French Renaissance splendor as movie palaces.    The old Shubert, I feel, is Chicago's theater above par.  I was offered a chance to go inside some of them back in the '90s but didn't have any historical aspect in my life at that same, so let the opportunity pass by.  It's wonderful how Chicago was able to do what New York could not with movie theaters.	2005-02-09

In history, nothing is \\"definite,\\" nothing is beyond a shadow of a doubt.  This is a well-researched endeavor with numerous sources used for each of the seven sections (long bibliography references), but it leaves the reader with more questions instead of answers.  It does take a closer look at western legends of the past, but he persues his own, sometimes rambling interpretations.    Like his 1997 LEGENDS AND LIES, it makes you wonder if this man's curiosity for the perverse gives a certain taint to the factual truth, or is it all a figment of his imagination.  He's not a 'definitive' historian, earned a lifetime achievement award in 2000 by the Western Writers of America due, I think, to his fertile abundant novels and his prolific supply of 'western heroes.'  In WESTWARD, he admits it is a fictional history (is there such a thing?) of the American West.  This volume follows in that vein.    Sam Houston was born in Virginia but transplanted to Maryville, Tennessee, at the age of thirteen.  At 15, he was 6'2\\" and left home to live with the Cherokee Indians for three years where he was called 'Raven.'  In 1813, he joined the army and made his mark at Horseshoe Bend in Alabama with General Andrew Jackson's Creek War.  There, he was wounded in the groin area, an oozing wound which never healed completely.  Five years later, he open a law office in Lebanon, just outside Nashville, becoming Attorney General of Tennessee.  He entered politics in 1823 as a congressman for two terms, before becoming Governor of Tennessee in 1827.  After a short, two and a half month, failed marriage, he resigned as Governor and returned to the Indians to 'lick his wounds', so to speak, and recover his dignity.    He found himself a mixed-blood Cherokee widow and his former bride married a Gallatin doctor.  He moved on to Texas to resume his military prowess.  As a retaliation for Santa Anna's demolition of the Alamo, he defeated and captured the Mexican leader near San Jacinto River, 20 miles east of the town named for him, Houston.  In the action, as the battle started, he was not shot in the ankle as others declared, but it was crushed after his horse was hot and fell on him.      Due to his success in war, he served twice as President of the Republic of Texas, later became Governor but deposed two years later when he refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy.  He had a colorful existence with many and varied careers.  He was a restless, hard-drinking man of the wilderness.    In his episode about the death of Meriweather Lewis, he tells of a mysterious letter written to the daughter of Aaron Burr who had taken the Natchez Trail in 1805, and where Lewis was killed in 1810.  On his monument (which I viewed and read) was his illness called melancholia, as a possible cause of death.  This author called it a diseased brain.  Forty days before his death, he sent a letter to Theodosia, supposedly written on Sept. 1,at the age of 35 of his premonition of his thinking he was soon to die.    This letter makes this a fine 'mystery within the great mystery' of whether his death was a result of suicide or murder.  Charles M. Wilson, a newspaperman published an account in 1934 of Lewis' death at Grinder's Stand in which he wrote about the \\"I am going to die\\" note.  Lewis V. Fisher, author of SUICIDE OR MURDER (1962), attacks Wilson as being a novelist, not a historian, as he failed to document his \\"facts\\" had no footnotes, endnotes, or bibliography, thus, no credibility.    Anya Seton in her first novel, MY THEODOSIA, wrote about the letter in 1941, four years before Theodosia was lost at sea, leaving a mystery behind.    Mary Canary (aka Calamity Jane) was a legend in her own time.  Of the seven films about her which he lists (from 1936 to 1995), the ony one I remember was the 1953 musical starring Doris Day and the marvelous Howard Keel.  His research finds her called many derogatory names (on the Western frontier, jane was a fallen woman).  She was illiterate and a known prevaricator (tall tales, lies) who was a pro at profanity, growing up wild as  she had unsavory parents.  She claimed to have been a scout for General Custer in Wyoming in 1870, at Little Big Horn.      That same year she met Wild Bill Hickok, a marshal in Kansas.  She dressed in men's clothes and frequented saloons, gambling and dance halls.  She could be found at brawls and saloon shoot-outs -- thus getting the nickname, Calamity.    Later, at the age of 25, she went on to be a scout of Buffalo Bill Cody.  Hickok traveled with the stage troupe in 1873 as a actor.  He was eleven years older than she.  He was a two-bit gambler, killed by Jack McCall in 1876.    In 1885, she married Charley Burk, a one-legged Civil War veteran with whom she had a daughter, in El Paso; then moved on to Boulder, Colorado.  Many dime novels were written about her exploits after she joined Cody's Wild West show.  In 1900, she performed in the Pan Am. Exposition in Buffalo, New York, where she was a big hit.  IN 1903, she was almost blind and succumbed to pnemonia and was buried near her hero.  Her funeral at First Methodist Church of Deadwood was one of the biggest attended.  Though the actual events of her life are ambiguous, she is remembered as a legend.	2005-02-08

Because of that dog, Mattie's life changed from complacency to a purpose which led to a friendship with the local dogcatcher and a fondness for Wesley, the grandchild she'd never have.  He wanted to think that she was his grandmother, as he did not remember his mother.    Both her children (daughter and son) had remained unmarried and, like sons today, had little time to attend to her needs.  After all, she is aging and having 'problems' coping; that is, until Lamar and Wesley take advantage of her good home cooking.    She not only saves Wesley literally, but the dog also, as she changed her mind about needing a companion in her latter years.  She decided maybe it was her time to 'walk across Egypt' and get on with her life.      There were some Southern stereotypes like the Baptist preacher and nosey neighbors, but Wesley was an orphan of the world.  He could be anyone's lost child who just needed to feel a bit of love and some direction of right and wrong.  Mattie provides both.  Each needed the other for different reasons and the ending proves that environment indeed does count more than genes.	2005-02-02

This little book has turned out to be vastly popular, perhaps for its brevity.  Originally an article in 'Policy Review' in 2002, it was expanded into a treatise along the vein of Thomas Paine in another time.  He worked in the U.S. State Department from 1984 to 1988, which made him an expert on American culture.    He compares us (the Americans) with Europe (primarily Britain) and the use of power politics.  In my opinion, America as he calls us needs a bit of diplomacy and humility of the British system.      Throughout history, they waged war against each other, and even came over here to put us in our place once.  Europeans have an ardent desire never to return to a past of disastrous events triggered by some former prime ministers of England and dictators elsewhere.  We haven't reached that point historically yet.  Will we live to learn from our mistakes?    Most of those who helped to form power politics want to believe it was the transformation of mind and spirit (from war to peace) to make possible a 'new order.'    Now, the British base the rejection of force on moral consciousness in international affairs.  They no longer have the mentality (most are highly educated, you know) for power politics.  It all boils down to military might.      There are other profound differences in the way the U.S. and Europe conduct foreign policy.  Here, he avers, the Democrats seem more 'European' than the Republicans, except in the use of force.  Our founding fathers, Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton and John Adams were well versed in the realities of power politics but recognized their deficiencies.    He writes, \\"With the check of Soviet power removed, U. S. was free to intervene practically wherever and whenever it chose -- a fact reflected in the proliferation of overseas military interventions\\" with the invasion of Panama in 1989, during the first Bush administration, Persian Gulf War in 1991, Somalia in 1992, and continued during the Clinton years with interventions abroad more frequently than it had throughout the Cold War.  Thanks to the new technologies, the U.S. was also freer to use force around the world in more limited way through air and missile strikes, which we did in increasing frequency.  The end of the Cold War thus expanded an already wide gulf between European and American power.    Americans believe in power as a means of advancing the principles of a liberal civilization and a liberal world order.  Who are we to make this decision?  If, as this former member of the State Dept. avers, that if Iraq was 'dangerous' to world order, why then allow thousands to emigrate and infiltrate the U.S.    Europeans today are not ambitious for power, and certainly not for military power.  Over the past half century, they have developed a genuinely different perspective that springs directly from their unique historical experience since the end of WWII.  They have rejected the power politics which brought them such misery.  This is a perspective on power that Americans (the powers that be) do not and cannot share, inasmuch as the formative historical experiences on our side of the Atlantic have not been the same.    Paradise and power are not compatible, and this administration should know by now that they were not elected as world leaders, only here in America, and not by a majority at that.  It's time to stop this nonsense and try to be literate and let us end our existence in some kind of peace.  We cannot police the world.     Mr. Kagan writes a monthly column for the 'Washington Post,' which calls itself 'an independent newspaper.'  He's cooperated on other books.	2005-01-31

After seven other novels, this is a long-awaited sequel to those featuring detectives in a college town in North Carolina where a luxury resort is built to look like one back in the Twenties.  Does the South have a fixation on that time period -- here in Knoxville, after many months of commotion the major movie theater has been transformed back to the Twenties with all its garishness and frivolity but definitely old fashioned appearance.  An attempt at glamor by using four large chandeliers in the long, slanting lobby make it bright, but the addition of a well-stocked bar where a small concession stand had been previously, plus one downstairs where they modernized the ladies' room with mirrors and more lights, make it more like a brothel and nothing like it was meant to be.  They even removed the movie screen so that the stage could hold the full Symphony and Opera characters, took away its character completely.    At Hillston, the author claims, the South has not only forgotten the past, it has forgotten the whole idea of the past.  Not so, here -- as the entire downtown has gone overboard in making the place look old.  Everything is the past, as certain people with selective memories would have you believe.  There's nothing beautiful about the past in this town, only old crumbling storefronts good for nothing except being \\"the past.\\"  All the good memories of growing up here were dashed by omission -- what a shame.  The Twenties here were not exceptional, though there were a couple of vaudeville theaters (not reputable)  for the crude, rude men about town.      This is the South, though there is no gentility or upper crust per se.  Here if you make the Sunday paper society page, you have money and it doesn't matter how you came by it.  The women here are not beautiful (even when dressed to the hilt), the men simply self-important.    A lady in red appears along the horse trail near the luxury resort to cast a spell as she dives naked into the lake.  There was a killer in this town, though not the usual low-life type.  This one is educated and associated with the college.  He's verified by his prolific e-mail to one of the victims, over a 4th of July no one cared to celebrate.  He'd already killed his wife and parents (leaders of the town's social elite) among others.      His compulsive 272 e-mails were a Rosetta Stone of research for profiling the sociopathic personality and had attracted the coverage on CNN, MSNBC and Fox networks.  The city council took advantage of the media coverage as the prof had given the Southern college town a black eye.  The mayor and council wanted the fame and fortune anyway they could acquire it to promote the old-fashioned \\"peace in the valley.\\"    The first lady proclaimed the chielf of police deserved the medal for apprehending the criminal.  As they prepared for the Independence Day fireworks (nothing like the extravanganza this town throws), the police creed is that freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.    The lady in red had been a rock singer who made a profound effect on him.  Just human, he'd say, but as he spoke of his broken heart and shed some tears over his loss, as small town life tries to return to normal after this foray into criminal notoriety, he has some problem with fantasy wishes and down-to-earth reality.	2005-01-29

This debut novel (can't understand why it took her seven years to finish it unless it was particularly painful and personal -- most first books are to some degree) is about broken things, broken people (misfits in today's world), broken hearts, broken lives, broken glasses at a Jewish wedding, broken dishes after a funeral meal; the flap calls it \\"a glorious homage to the beauty of broken things.\\"    Things can be mended, most times, but how do you heal a broken heart when all your dreams and memories are smashed to smitterens?  She uses a quote from the Jewish Prayer of Concentration: \\"He took Bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is my body which is given for you (what would Lynn Truss say about all those commas?).    After Wanda has gotten what she felt she deserved, she reminisces:  look at what you value and hold dear.Objects first, because they are endowed by your memories as \\"sentimental value.\\"   Sentiment is defined as ascribing a value to something above and beyond what its value is to God.  There is an expression, \\"the object of my affections.\\"  She quotes from songs such as Blues In the Night, The Nearness of You, April in Paris, and Shall We Dance.    About faces:   she thinks that the beauty of those you love comes not from the smoothness of skin or neutrality of expression, but from the web of experience which has left it mark.  Apparently this is about Margaret, the old woman who took brokenhearted Wanda in and bequeathed on her a home and a life.  Margaret reminds me of the old woman in 'Walking Across Egypt.'    Close  families don't exist today and we have to make up surrogate families just to survive.  That's a sad state of affairs in America, as the young are too busy doing their own thing and spending money as fast as they can make it.    Seven years is a long time to dwell on sad things, broken or otherwise.  But now, she has a place in the library just for her under the K section.  That's something to be proud of and share with those youngsters who will grow up and away before she can turn around.  Enjoy them while they are young, as there will never be another time such as that.  They too may become broken, as time goes by.	2005-01-28

The description of this little book supposedly about grammar and \\"zero tolerance approach to Punctuation\\" is misleading.  The title alone intrigued me, but that's as far as it goes.  I was married to a college English professor and my best subject in high school was English grammar.      She dedicates it \\"to the memory of the striking Bolshevik printers of St Petersburg who, in 1905, demanded to be paid the same rate for punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly prececipitated the first Russian Revolution.\\"  If you believe that, then this possibly is the book for you.    Robert MacNeil, on PBS, recently hosted a program about the \\"English\\" and dialects in American language.  He indicated that the way commoners speak in the Midlands in upper Middle Western section of the country is the preferred enunciaiton of words.  The Southern sound is generally easy to take, his poll showed, though many dialects prevail.  His show even explored black talk which is a language separate and apart from the general population.  The use of the work 'that' is an example.    This is a comedic, actually absurd, narrative of Ms. Truss and not grammar at all.  She has a phobia about the apostrophe and the semi-colon.  Didn't she learn anything in school?  What's her take on the word 'that' which I detest.  It's true she didn't try to Americanize any of the contents.    She explains the pandas on the cover (one with a paint brush, other has a gun) thusly:  \\"A panda walks into a cafe, orders a sandwich and eats it; then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.  \\"Why?\\" asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the exit.  The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  \\"I'm a panda,\\" he says, at the door.  \\"Look it up.\\"  The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation:  Panda.  Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China.  Eats, shoots, and leaves.\\"  This must be British humor, a la Benny Hill; it's supposed to be a joke, I guess.  But I am wondering why a panda is out on the loose eating in restaurants in the first place.  Only in Britain.    A local newspaper columnist does a weekly explanation of the use of obsolete words, and their preferred pronunciation.  His material comes from the Associated Press.  Whatever happened to the Harbrace Handbook?  I say, they obviously have never heard of it in England.	2005-01-26

This historian was able to get articles in 'Parade' and the Jan. 2005 'Reader's Digest', \\"I Found My Heroine\\" and \\"Force of Nature,\\" about her OBSESSIVE GENIUS, written for the Great Discoveries Series.    She did show the human side and 'inner world' of a woman of science, Marie Curie, and her daughter Irene, both physicists like her professor of physics father.  Even her granddaughter, Helene, followed in their footsteps.    Born in Warsaw, Poland, Marie had to relocate to Paris and change her name to be able to become known, and she basked in the  notoriety.  In 1893, she became the first woman to earn a degree in physics at the Sorbonne.  Perhaps she was a 'genius' but suffered periods of depression in which she was not able to function.    In 1903, she won her first Nobel prize for physics and in 1911 another for chemistry.  In all that time until 1935, it had not gone to a woman scientist when her grandaughter Irene and husband received one from King Gustav V of Sweden for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.    Marie and Pierre discovered radium which led to the use of x-rays plus cosmetics which proved to be hazardous.  Pierre commited suicide in 1906 by walking in front of a loaded wagon outside their apt. after an argument.  He was already disfigured by radiation exposure; both Marie and Irene died from overexposure to it as did countless others.    Radium was described as that 'pernicious shimmering angel of mercy and of death.'  On p. 119, there is a long list of ads for bath salts, teas, health tonics, face creams, lipsticks, sexual aids and such.  Radium had become the pet substance of high society, like Botox today.  By 1904, a gram cost 110,710 U.S. dollars today (750,000 gold francs).  A 500 franc carries the photo of the Curies.    As with today's powerful drugs, it was advertised in news publications as a 'miracle' to restore health.  It did the opposite.    She was 38 when her husband died after eleven years of marriage, and one article states that she \\"bravely carried on, raising her two daughters and working steadily until her death at age 66 on July 4, 1934.\\"  The book tells a completely different, more human, story of Marie's affair with a younger man, a former student of Pierre, Paul Laugevin, who was married.  It turned into a sordid tale.    Radium treatment continued to be the substance of choice until the middle 1950s, when cobalt replaced it.    Younger daughter Eve did not followed in her parents' or older sister's footsteps.  Because of her mother's disapproval, she became something of a rebel and she refers to her as if they were not related.  In the mid 1990s. she and her niece donated the Curie publications, diaries, journals, and workbooks, thus making this book possible.  Everything had to be decontaminated.    The black and white photos throughout the text of the book (not lumped into a glossy section of their own) were a good addition, though most were in the magazine articles.  Maybe she became an idol to some in the science field.  \\"An image can be easily altered, can go from good to bad in an instant.  Todays's heroine becomes tomorrow's villain; we become cynical when these synthetic idols disppoint us.\\"    If she'd left out the illicit love affair, perhaps her idolotry of a superhuman genius might carry a little weight.  It merely showed that she was human and a lowly female.  A good mother?  I doubt Eve would agree.	2005-01-24

Started as a thesis by Ian Caldwell at Princeton which sprang from a research paper suggested by his teacher, Anthony Grafton, about HYPNERATOMACHIA POLIPHILLI,(which meant \\"Poliphila's Struggle for Love In a Dream\\") written 500 years ago by a fourteen year old Francesco Colonna about a world of erudition, unnatural sexual practices, and terrible violence.  They even alluded to Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN written at the early age of nineteen.    This ancient book was translated by Joscelyn Godwin and published in 1999.  Supposedly based on a true occurrence in 1497 Rome concerning a mysterious coded manuscript of an obscure Renaissance text.  A letter from a nobleman at the Vatican sealed four times with a dark wax made of a poisonous herb, nightshade, was dispatched to a church named San Lorenza.  Upon arrival, it was determined that the two messengers had opened and read the message (then resealed it) and were beheaded by a mason.    This reads like something out of the movie 'National Treasure' with a hidden crypt holding the secret for which these men were killed.  Their heads in a baker's oven supplied stories passed down through generations.  Thus the mystery and suspense as to what that letter meant.    Using a book HIEROGLYPHICA from the 1420s Italy by Horapollo, using symbols of animals to encrypt other manuscripts, some strange looking sketches and a map of Ancient Rome which had a stadium on every corner, eight along a single line labeled Ancient Roman Mile, it reminded me of Chicago's Golden Mile along Lake Michigan.    This is a convoluted experiment understood only by the intelligent members of today's PhiBetaKappas at Harvard or Princeton.  A major project by these two scholars, I'm sure they had satisfaction with the result.  You can find the official game at [...]  I wonder how many of today's computer generation brought up with Nintendo and GameBoys could figure out the riddles and mazes to discover what this thing is all about. Or even if it is worth it.  My eldest son played a game similar to this with a friend of his in high school many years ago.	2005-01-17

Written by a journalist about a journalist on a quest to earn his fee to do an appealing article for 'Historic Touring' to entice Americans to explore the Arnold Trail.  This is a historical story within a modern crime novel.  But I choose to stick mostly to the history side.  Jack was 'Johnny on the spot' when a tour bus from Boston is delayed; it seems that one of the passengers had mysteriously disappeared at that rest stop in a small Maine town. <br /> <br />At the time, Jack was researching Benedict Arnold's excursion there in 1775 on his way to Quebec.  At the local museum, he was given an old and yellowed pamphlet, 'The Arnold Expedition and Scanesett', which had been published for a 100-yr. commemoration.  While waiting for the curator, he sat on an Adironack chair on the museum's back lawn, against a thickett of spent lilacs; it was hot and close, the way Maine can be. <br /> <br />Gerry Boyle's writing sometimes leans toward the poetic:  \\"I sat back and looked at the river, which was still and wide here because it was dammed a few hundred yards downstream.  The dam crosses the throat of a deep stone gorge; above, the waters coasted slowly before slipping over the brink and cascading down over the rocks.\\" <br /> <br />When Arnold had come up the river in October, 1775, on his doomed mission to capture Quebec City, there had been no town, no dam, just a tall waterfall.  He and his group of 500 men had marched from Boston to secure boats at Pittston, Maine, setting off up the Kennebec in a leaky bateaux.  This account came from a journal kept by Captain Samuel Thayer, one of the marchers who'd camped out in this backwoods place. <br /> <br />Like a historian tends to do, this freelance writer imagines how it was back then.  The shore would have been lined with yellow and crimson in October, the river filled with fish, and the woods rustling with birds.  Arnold and his 500 had hauled their heavy bateaux out of the river, heaved them up the rocks and around thetorrent.  That done, they'd gamely continued on their way.  Most would soon be dead of exposure, starvation, or bayonet. <br /> <br />The route north ran along the Kennebec, but the river took a jog to the southwest and passed the towns which had been Indian settlements in 1775.  It was the Indian Natanis who named Arnold \\"Dark Eagle\\" and predicted that he would soar to great heights but also fall.  When they came ashore, they found The Forks, a place now favored by whitewater rafters and bear hunters.  They dragged their boats overland to the west to another river where they traveled northwest, poling, wading, and trudging 50 miles through the unforgiving wilderness all the way to Canada.  That river was called the Dead, which was just what many of those farm boys and sailors ended up, without firing a shot. <br /> <br />Now, more than 200 years later, they were forgotten, as if they'd never existed.  All those lives lost.  The writer contemplated:  \\"All that perseverence and courage.  All for nothing, and none of it remembered, except by a handful of tweedy professors, and a few old coots in little backwoods towns like this one.\\"  This was a similarity to the present mystery of the missing man off the bus. <br /> <br />Using maps to track Arnold's route to Canada led Jack on a cross-country trek in search of the unknown.  He used books about Benedict Arnold and the Revolutionary War as background.  Most of the men who followed Arnold up the Kennebec, across to the Dead River, through the frozen, trackless bogs either drown, froze to death, died of starvation, or were shot down in Quebec.  Some wasted away on English prison ships delirious with fever. <br /> <br />That's what it came down to, when you stripped away all of the elaborate myths and decoration.  They'd gotten lost along the way and ended up around Bigelow.  He made the trek all the way to the only walled-in city in North America and found it hadn't changed much since 1775.  He found the Cidadel, whereGeneral Montgomery, one of Arnold's team members, was killed, and the Ursuline Convent down Rue St. Louis. <br /> <br />At a museum in Augusta, he found a journal kept by Dr. Isaac Senter published as 'On a Secret Expedition Against Quebec' which was printed in 1846.  But the hard life took place in October, 1775, when another group who had left Cambridge with 1100 and only 675 reached Canada.  They were met by some of Arnold's advance scouts and taken up the St. Lawrence River where Arnold led an attack and was shot.  Dr. Senter was the physician who treated him. <br /> <br />In his article, he wrote, \\"You've accomplished after just a few hours drive, what Benedict couldn't after three months of marching, starving and fighting:  pass through the gates of old Quebec.\\" <br /> <br />While working on his article, he kept in mind the missing man.  There wasn't anything in 'The Maine Telegram' about anybody missing from Scanesett; nothing in the 'Globe' about a bus company losing a passenger.  You have to read a lot of muck until Chapter 30 reveals the cover photo's signigicance of the chained handcuff -- a daring rescue.	2005-01-11

This collection included just a few (36) of the interviews Terry Gross chose from her daily talk show on public radio which she has done for thirty years.  This one features people in the arts.  Whereas 'timely' interviews can become dated quickly, the pleasure we gain from the best books, movies and music stay with us.  Most of these shows were taped in 1994.    I chose six totally different, most of whom had new books just released when they appeared on 'Fresh Air'.  Perhaps they needed the exposure to promote a new book.  I've never heard this NPR program, and her pointed questions about their personal lives goes beyond a sense of propriety, to entertain her audience.  It makes me wonder why anyone would agree to be on her show a second time.  She puts people 'on the spot' to the point of rudeness, telling them to 'cut to the chase' to be concise with brief answers, as every minute counts on radio.    Isabella Rossellini had scoliosis, a spinal deformity similar to osteoporsis, as a child, which was very severe and painful.  She lost the ability to walk and endured operations to fuse the vertebrae in her spine and was immobilized for six months during the lenghthening and straightening procedures to correct the curvature of the spine.  She had to wear a heavy body cast for two years.  It was wonderful to overcome all the odds, she said.  She modeled for seventeen years under a contract similar to movie stars of the forties.  Her mother Ingrid Bergman created a scandal back then which could have ended her career.  The last image I remember seeing of Isabelle shows her distinct resemblance to her mother in looks and morals.  She is an unwed mother.  After taking acting lessons, she played an abused woman in 'Blue Velvet,' a movie I'm glad I missed.  She wrote a memoir called SOME OF ME in 1997.    The David brothers were lyricists extraordinaire.  Mack David came up with the lyrics of 'Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White,' 'It Must Be Him,' and the t.v. themes for77 Sunset strip, Surfside 6, and others.  On the other hand, his brother Hal David wrote (among many hits) the lyrics for the first ALFIE.    Michael Caine's first film to be released in the U.S. was 'Alfie' and he admits he's played all sorts of weird characters in more than 70 films in 30 years.  He told her he had made a career out of what all the American stars didn't want, which was usually flawed characters.  He won an Academy award, and wrote his autobiography in 1992.    Johnny Cash also had out his life history in 1997.  In his show with Ms. Gross, he admitted that he had a high tenor voice as a teenager and got a kick out of singing the old Irish folk songs he'd heard Dennis Day sing on 'The Jack Benny Show.'  He sang gospel for his mother, who took in washing so she could pay for his singing lessons.  He toured with Elvis Presley in the fifties, then started singing prison songs.  His first big hit was 'I Walk the Line.'  I've been told he had a good version of 'The Long Black Veil.'  He teamed up with June Carter in 1962.  They both died last year.    Johnny Cash went to prisons to give concerts.  Jazz musician, Sonny Rollins, went to prison on occasion due to drug use and was homeless in Chicago.  He had a special place on the pedestrian walk of the Williamsburg Bridge in New York which was on top of the subway where he could blow his tenor sax to his heart's content.  He grew up in Harlem with musical siblings.    She did interview children's book illustrator, Maurice Sedak, on more than one occasion.  His best known book WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, a fantasy, and he told her that he had based the monsters on old relatives in Poland.  He told about how the children who love his books regard him as one of the monsters because he's short and elderly.  He revealed the illnesses which almost 'did him in' as a sickly child, and spoke of the angel who came to him.  In his new book, WE ARE ALL IN THE DUMPS, he uses spirits to encourage children to believe theyare being watched over.  He is compared to Lewis Carroll.    All I got out of the John Updike conversation was that he wrote those sexually oriented books about a car salesman named Rabbit to titillate men.  Commenting on his first attempt at writing when he was fourteen, she said to him \\"the more you know, the more interesting detail you can put in fiction.\\"  He agreed, \\"You wind up using everything you know, and often more than once.\\"  Enough said.    In 2003, she received public radio's highest honor, the Edward R. Murrow Award.	2005-01-10
398293:US	35985708	R3BDBAIGNWFFZL	0679463038	896829839	The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse	Books	3	2	7	N	N	Progress Does Not Create Happiness.	The author is a senior editor of 'The New Republic' and a contributing editor of 'The Atlantic Monthly.\\"  Yet, it was the review in January, 2005, 'The Saturday Evening Post' which let me know of its existence.  It's another book about happiness (or lack thereof), only he stresses the paradox of how unhappiness and the rise of unipolar depression (condition in which someone always feels 'blue') are ten times as prevalent as fifty years ago.    Paul Fain wrote in the local paper that this new branch of economics is called 'Happiness ecomonics.'  His information shows that time with family and good health are the 'stuff of happiness.'  The sad truth is that we're twice as rich as we were in 1957, but only half as happy.  So, what else is new?  He goes on: \\"of the family-related factors, marital status is the most critical.  He claims that having sex once a week as opposed to once a month is equivalent to the amount of happiness generated by getting an additional $50,000 in income for the average American.\\"   His research shows that sex is better for your happiness than money.  That's not to say that being financially poor but sexually active is the secret to a happy life.  Nowhere did he mention religion and faith in God.    The percentage of Americans who describe themselves as 'happy' has not changed since the 1950s.  I was happy and satisfied with my life during the last half of that decade. And I was not sexually active!     At a meeting of disgruntled residents in the high-rise apartment building where I presently live, the vice president of the Atlanta management company listened to the diverse complaints, skipping a few, from the crowded room.  After an hour, touching on a miniscule of the unsavory happenings (most of which won't be addressed), she asked \\"Is anybody here happy?\\" and only one person raised a hand.    This is typical, according to this researcher, who stated that widespread incidence of melancholy and pessimism amidst better living conditions andfreedoms hold significance beyond the 'proclivity to complain.'  Stress, he feels, is a big factor for our unhappiness.  Perhaps the breakdown of the family and long distances between parents and grown children make the sadness factor more prevalent, as the kids are busy leading their own sad lives, trying to make a living and procreate.      Because a large percentage of Americans are overweight and sleep fewer hours, their bodies become programmed to produce more cortisol, elevating stress.  In the latest 'Scholastic Instructor,' the facts are that 17% of children and adolescents are seriously overweight.  Less sugar, more exercise, and less t.v. viewing might cure what ails the majority instead of so much pill popping.  Changing lifestyle using some type of vigorous walking half an hour each day, bike riding, or pumping iron in a gym can lessen the surplus of the stress hormone.      Anyone who does anything to excess can harm his body; now, even athletes are being denied too many water breaks as too much water is harmful (news to me!) and causes health problems.  Some water systems (10%) have arsenic in drinking water.    He advises reading a book (not by Stephen King) before bedtime instead of t.v. as beneficial for a good nights sleep.  Some paradoxes such as prosperity does not produce happiness.  In the 1999 'Forbes' 400 list of American richest persons, 72% had been divorced at least once.  We often make the mistake of assuming that money will solve all of our problems.  Money will only solve money problems.      Our thriving society tends to escalate violence.  In the pre-historic groups still in existence today in the Amazon River tribes, Somoa, Australian outback, some parts of South America, 60% of males die by violence.  After the tsunami disaster, a similar group was discovered in SE Asia; one primitive was shown on ABC News shooting at a helicopter with a bow and arrow!  He places blame on youthful violence on the contents of today's films which areproduced.    In the past, 'insolvable' problems included pollution and crime; today global warming (which Al Gore wrote about) is escalating, as advocated by the author of 6 NIGHTMARES, Anthony Lake.  The earth has sixteen million square miles of forest.  A log can burn into ash, but ashes cannot reassemble themselves....unless, of course, they're from a phoenix, a mythological bird who reincarnates itself.    His personal opinion: \\"England's May 1940 decision to continue fighting Germany (WWII) was the single greatest event in world political history.\\"  Citing 'positive psychology' as a means of creating a utopia on earth leads one to wonder.    Americans speak of the 1950s as a Golden Age when things were simpler.  Nostalgia plays a role in this glorification of the past, as does the progression from childhood to adulthood.  The British speak of prewar London as a Golden Age of quieter life and higher cultures.    The fallacy is that a Golden Age could only have happened in the past.  He ponders the proposed utopias all the way back to the Middle Ages, discussing Thomas Moore's 1516 book, UTOPIA, Greek philosopher Plato's platitudes, Roman poet Virgil's ARCADIA, Rousseau's Eden, and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD.    If the Western World has known a Golden Age, it is right here, right now.  It is ours to decide what the future will hold.  If we decide well, the future may hold an even-better life, about which our descendants will complain.  Happiness must come from within; money cannot buy it.  Robert Frost wrote, \\"Happiness makes up in height what it lacks in length.\\"     The magazine reviewer writes that \\"perhaps Americans need a lesson in the fundamentals of gratitude.\\"  He goes on, \\"Our forebears worked hard  and sacrificed so that we could have the freedom and prosperity we know.  It is past time Americans    showed some appreciation for this.\\"  We seem to think that our parents and grandparents had it better than we do at present, but the writer feels otherwise.According to him, these ancestors would say that the contemporary U.S. is the realization of utopia.    Why then do the majority of us are far from feeling better about our lives, and many feeling much worse.  Let's appreciate what life offers and do with it the best we can.	2005-01-06

This book gives the reason for his fetishes in later life and his obsessions with power. I'd heard about his propensity to have the young starlets at his disposal, and I'd thought he must be quite a virile man.     I see now how Clifford Irving was able to write the autobiography which proved to be a hoax. And why Hughes denounced it via the phone to the media instead of a personal appearance. He was a demented person by that time, from all reports. But he had led \\"the big life\\" frequenting the Coconut Grove and hobnobbing with Hollywood people. Coming from Houston, TX, and choosing his suits from Penney's, Woolworth's, and Sears (wearing tennis shoes as a standard), it had to be heady stuff. He had no social graces.    This was a decadent age (1927) and, thank Goodness, he wasn't another Bugsy Berkley with his sexual orgies and apparitions. Howard had a love affair with the airplane, not women. He made a few movies using a sky-full of vintage airplanes called 'Hell's Angels,' then a controversial western, 'Outlaw,' in which a beautiful sunset was seen along with an overexposed Jane Russell. It was denied the seal of approval by a ten-man censorship board. He made a grand presentation of other stars' cleavage in earlier films, but was denied motion picture approval. It was released anyway.    As a Texas industrialist, he turned out to be an innovator by removing the top wing so planes could fly above the weather. He bought TWA airlines from Jack Frye. He declared himself just an aviator, but he was a man before his time with his sheer determination to conquer the skies. Had he been in his prime during the Space Age, he should have had a chance at piloting the Space Shuttle.    There were scandals with the women, though he appeared to enjoy touching planes more than women. He \\"interviewed\\" many young starlets under contract to him. He was clear at the end that aviation was the great love of his life. He was dubbed as capricious and eccentric, but mainly he was afraid of people -- paranoid, thinking there were spies in his midst to learn his secrets.    The senator accused him of producing a dirty movie and making airplanes which don't fly. At the hearing, it was promoted that the whole world will see what he has become. When he successfully got that plane out of the water, it proved his ability to overcome his tarnished reputation. All his life he'd wanted to fly the fastest planes and be the richest man in the world. For a man who never smoked or drank (only milk), he made his mark for posterity.    Clifford Irving became something of a celebrity before and after the telephone interview Hughes gave to refute the book.  It is a masterpiece but should perhaps been labeled 'fiction' and been just an ordinary thing no one would want to read.  As it was, it became a sensation.	2005-01-05

This is an old man's remembrances of things as they were in the 1950s, an account of himself and his ancestors to leave for his 7-yr-old son, Jack.  He reveals how his grandfather left Maine to move to Kansas to fight in the Union Army where he 'preached men into the Civil War.'  Though he served as a chaplain, he was blinded in one eye in battle.  He kept his pistol wrapped in an army blanket, a relic from the fight between the abolitionist group of which he was a part and the early settlers who wanted to vote Kansas into the Union as a slave state.    In the most recent issue of 'The Saturday Evening Post,' Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address is revealing as to the reason for the Civil War.  He blames slave owners in the South primarily as the 'cause of the war.'  Many people believe that still, except for the Southerners who were trying to protect their territory, while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement.  He didn't expect the duration or magnitude of his oratory.      He erroneously divided the country and admitted that even after the 'cause of the conflict' might cease before the conflict itself should cease.'  I know that Lincoln was a religious, ethical man but he also blames God: \\"He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those whom the offense came.\\"    This book shows how history lives through generations enduring droughts, influenza, the Depression, and three wars.  His parents moved from Gilead, Iowa, to the Gulf coast seeking a better climate.  He describes a dawn there on the prairie where the light flooded over the land and everything turned radiant at once.  \\"Here on the prairie there is nothing to distract attention from the evening (stars) and morning (sun), nothing on the horizon to abbreviate or to delay.  Mountains would seem an impertinence from that point of view.\\"  Outside my window, I sometimes watch the sunrise appear on the crest of the Smoky Mountains.  As a girl, I remember a beautiful sunrise and dawn in Western Maryland where my sister lived.    Some of his daily routines were less than exciting, but he gave a credible account of listening to a waltz tune on the radio and decided a little solitary waltzing would be good, as long as he did it in his study.  Having received no instruction in the steps, he waved his arms and spun around a little, keeping time with the music.  Then he started remembering the important events of his youth.    He leaves the best legacy a son could wish for -- \\"the most thrilling thing that ever happened to me in my life.\\"  He called it a miracle.  But the real miracle was life itself, wherever you are.	2005-01-04

Only 36 or the 90 people who populate her imagination were historical, the rest as she called them \\"invented.\\"  She didn't find much good or decent to write about these \\"not very nice people\\" who were cruel to animals and each other.    Using the ballad, 'Tom O'Bedlam's Song' about a beggar from Bedlam who is crazy and sees things in the night, the author of which is unknown, but she innovates her own version thus.  It seems that Tom 'Bedlam in his drug addled roaming had learned that his brother was highly involved in the scheme.  But he's not believed, as a large float in the form of a dragon called a 'firedrake' is to be used during the festivities commemorating her accession to the throne.  The assassin would shoot a poisoned arrow from the dragon's eye when it get to the Queen's balcony where she is standing.      The best known of the factual personages was Sir Walter Raleigh, who she labels as Elizabeth I's new favorite.  As historical background, the author explains how Elizabeth (daughter of Henry VIII's second wife) became Queen of England and the mechanizations involved to hold on to the throne.  At the age of fifty, in 1583, she still had not chosen a King.  The mores of the time required that whoever she wed would become her 'lord and master' and she had no intention of handing over any of her power.    Due to England's rivalry with Spain, and the pirates looting of the Spanish ships, Elizabeth's life was daily in danger.  Sir Francis Drake captured so much valuables during the later 1500s he made her, as one of his investors, a very rich woman.  The costume she wears on the cover of this book is elaborate and colorful.    Using actual events during that time about counter espionage capers and tales of assassination plots, especially Throckmorton's (a Catholic traitor) plot in 1582 and Walsingham's (head of Elizabeth's secret service) success provided the author with the inspiration to use the records of those accounts.  She wrote this fiction of the 1583 Accesion Day assassination attempt which didn't happen.    Ms. Finney is an Oxford scholar where she studied history in the 1970s; she states that she reads history for pleasure and adventure.  She is steeped in this early history giving a long list of nonfiction she used for her knowledge of the Tudor politics.  She discovered in her research that Walsingham and his son-in-lar, Phillip Sidney, were in Paris during the Saint Bartholomew's Eve massacre and had been forced to hide from the mob.    She revels in the details of the dangers, savagery and treachery in that time period (as in the movie, 'Braveheart'), comparing it to VietNam.  Part of this book is about an Ames family, one of the sons being clerk to Walsingham, based on a real merchant and his family in the 16th century London, which is well documented.    This story describes the towers, where Elizabeth's own sister is a prisoner, torture chambers in the royal palaces, and other unpleasant and ugly things.  Only a true historian could appreciate all this hypothesis of what might have been.  And what happened to Philip's Great Armanda as a result.    The stilted and flowery language, which makes little sense to our American ears, brings back the English Lit I suffered through at Martin College 400 years after the facts they wrote about, not understanding much.  My favorite, as I recall, was 'Abou Ben Adhem,' but that's a different story altogether.    The Elizabethean language was such that she included a glossary to define strange things like 'close stool':  chamber pot hidden inside a seat with a lid (we had those here, I believe); 'gossip':  old friend, especially female; 'melancholia':  depression (used in America to describe Lewis' ailment when he was found dead in Tennessee); 'duds':  clothes (I've heard that before, thoughtit was American slang); and 'winding up a jack':  winding the clockwork mechanism for turning a spit in the kitchen.  She even said that tobacco had been introduced into England from America by Hawkins and combined with the leaves of the hemp plant.      This book has been compared to Eco's THE NAME OF THE ROSE.	2004-12-25

In the Oct. 3, 2004, PARADE Magazine, the Smoky Mountains are shown where the Cherokees lives.  The Author lists one of his great-great grandmothers as being an Indian who married into the Scots-Irish community.  The photo of his great aunt Rebecca Webb Hammond shows a definite Native American look.  It took two and a half months to get this book through the library after the Sunday paper featured it in PARADE.    Just yesterday at a \\"tea\\" for United Daughters of the Confederacy, Chapter 89, at Bleak House in Knoxville, TN, a member who teaches school regaled me with her firm statements about Andrew Jackson's evilness.  Just as the UT professor called Nathan Bedford Forrest white trash, some educated people have a \\"way to label\\" important people, if they don't like them.  At the time, I'd just told her how I discovered that my family had some Cherokee Indian heritage, and she was blaming Jackson for the Trail of Tears.  She gave me her version of how the Cherokees who stayed behind (hiding in the Smoky Mtns.) and mingled with my ancestors.  I've always believed my mother who died when I was seven years old had been Irish.  But I can't prove either.    James Webb gives a differing portrait of General Andrew Jackson, who'd served as U.S. President from 1829-37.  His parents had emigrated from Ulster.  A combative, self-made lawyer and military commander, \\"Irish Andy\\" changed the chemistry of American politics more profoundly than any other president.  He rewrote the book on American political leaders just as surely as Nobel Laureate Hemingway remade the narrative form of novel.  He was a self-made man of the people.    Fifteen years before he was elected, in 1814, he led soldiers into lands once held by the Creek Indians to expand the new nation, moving American territory farther South to include three-fifths of Alabama and one-fifth of Georgia.  Through his efforts, an open road from western Tennessee to the Gulf of Mexico. In 1815, he defeated the British at New Orleans and, in 1818, his troops drove the Spanish out of Florida, opening up further avenues into the Deep South including the coastal areas of Alabama and Mississippi.      Tennessee had another Andrew to become the 17th president at the death of Lincoln from 1865-69, whose surname was Johnson.  I'd mistakenly put the blame for the removal of our Indians on him.  Jackson's nickname was Old Hickory and he was America's 7th president.  In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed by Congress and Jackson signed the bill.  Tennessee Congressman Davy Crockett was against the act and vehemently defended the independent Cherokee Nation located in TN and North Carolina; he left Washington, D.C., as a consequence and went to his fate in Texas (Remember the Alamo).  Others against this forced removal were Senators Daniel Webster and Henry Clay (from KY).  Sam Houston, who captured Santa Anna and won fame during the campaign against Mexicans in Texas was of Scots-Irish descent.    In 1832, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Cherokee forced migration to Oklahoma.  Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the Cherokee nation whose Principal Chief was John Ross, was sovereign -- making the removal laws invalid.  The Indians had to agree in a treaty, which would then have to be ratified by the Senate.  Four thousand Cherokee died as a result of the removal, one of the saddest episodes in American history.  Led by Chief Ross, the survivors of that brutal winter of 1838-39, arrived in Oklahoma.  The journey became known as \\"The Trail Where They Cried\\" (Nunna daul Tsuny).    The Scots-Irish culture goes from the mountains of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont on down the Appalachian Mtn. range, covering or touching 15 states.  This vast area extended 800 miles from PA to GA, several hundred miles west from the Piedmont plateau to the banks of Mississippi.    He has the opinion that everyone in the South is kin to each other one way or another.  The difference between this culture andmost others is that its members don't particularly care what others think of them, thus the ethnic slur, 'redneck.'  They were unafraid of higher authority, intent on personal honor, quick to defend themselves against attack of any sort, and deeply patriotic.  They were intensely populist and yet indifferent to wealth.  The measure of a man was not how much he made or how much land he held, but whether he would fight and could lead.  Thus the title, BORN FIGHTING.    Of the soldiers of the Confederacy, only 5% owned slaves and they fought against what they viewed as an \\"invading\\" army.  In 1850, a survey of eight sample counties in Tennessee showed that more than half of all adult males owned no land at all.      In 1983, half the land of Appalachia was owned by the top 1% of landowners; top 5% owned nearly two-thirds.  One of the culture's great strengths is that it refuses to recognize human worth in terms of personal income and assets.   As a result, the South created a three-tiered class structure which exists to this day.  It believes in the dignity of the individual in the face of power, regardless of one's place or rank in society.  Have you ever seen a poor politician?    For those Southerners whose families had been trapped inside the generations of unending poverty before the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was a godsend.  He instituted government funded New Deal programs such as the CCC to help the poor to work for their country in various ways.  TVA, created in 1933, became the most important and successful federal project in history.  For the people of Appalachian Mtns., it meant jobs, electricity, and modernity to the seven-state region, which makes up the main area of Scots-Irish settlement and influence.    The Southerner was honor-bound but frequently backward white culture which was willing to defend its way of life against all outsiders.  These were often called hillbillies.  One example in the photo selection on cover of PARADE, is Dolly Parton who has made a fortune acting dumb.    The Scots-Irish did not merely come to America, they became America.  Writers include Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe, Margaret Mitchell and Horace Greeley.    Cowboys mentioned were John Wayne, Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, and Davy Crockett.  Conditioned by a thousand years of conflict, those who stayed behind resisted the Northern-dominated structure of the civil rights movement as an invasion from the outside (see my review of the Mississippi book by Mary Winstead) just as vociferously as they had view the Civil War in such terms.  Confederate leaders are Stonewall Jackson and Nathan Bedford Forrest.    Entertainers included Robert Redford, performers of the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville, Jimmy Stewart, Ava Gardner, and George C. Scott who portrayed George S. Patton.  Warriors were Audie Murphy, who was the most decorated soldier of WWII and also an actor, Alvin York, most remembered hero of WWI, and David Hackworth, America's most decorated veteran from Korea and Viet Nam.      At least twelve presidents have a Scots-Irish ancestor; some are Bill Clinton, Andrew Jackson, Chester Arthur, Woodrow Wilson; also Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan (through their mothers) and Ulysses S. Grant.  Also there was NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and golf legend, Arnold Palmer.    After writing six novels, this is James Webb's first nonfiction effort.  He's an Emmy-award winning journalist (now a PARADE editor), a combat Marine of Viet Nam War, and served as Navy Secretary under President Reagan (also Assistant Secretary of Defense).  He is a filmmaker and college lit. teacher.	2004-12-20

Jack Stanton, as a public defender in Washington, D.C., created a reputation as a tough lawyer who used his expertise at the Agency to give indigent lawbreakers (of the worst kind) the best defense possible.  He put aside the ethical side of law and concentrated on the humanity involved.  He felt that he had 'the gift' of winning his cases, even though he revelled in cases of incorrigible felons who had committed violent crimes.  In all cases, he got them off, scot-free -- luck of the Irish.  However, he paid with his integrity, as many lawyers do in the end.    All lawyers have to do a bit of acting and manipulating facts as they represent their clients.  Some are better at it than others, but the successful ones are really good actors and debaters.  I worked for a few lawyers in a small town and came to know their strengths and weaknesses.  Those who have to bend the truth a little or a  lot pay for it in their personal lives, as this fictitious attorney did.  One I knew turned to alcohol for false courage.  Another let his high position get him in a lot of trouble and ended up losing his license.    Jack decides to specialize in medical malpractice cases when he leaves the clinic to go into his own private law office.  He's always championed the causes for the underdog and with his charm, his success seems neverending.  But there is a high price to pay for letting all those bad people stay on the streets to commit more crimes and become a threat to society.  It catches up with him when he lies under oath.  Many do that, but he got caught.  Then, his whole world is shattered and he has to face up to the consequences, after a fashion.    The author is a practicing attorney in Maryland and acknowledges that 'the literary perceptions and insights are based on experience.'  The book jacket projects his courtroom novels on a par with John Grisham and Scott Turow.  I say he has a way to go to be in their league.    It is touted as witnessing a lawyer's worst nightmare,'a face-to-face confrontation with his own conscience.'  In the small town, I found only one attorney with a conscience.  It took a mental patient bent on revenge and her plight to bring him down.  It was a hard fall.  He became caged by his ambition, his relish for competition and winning, and his ability to twist the truth.  He was more than adequate in what he chose to do, but I couldn't label him as \\"good\\" counsel.	2004-12-18

The best part of this book, in my opinion, was at the end:  The Constitution of the U. S.; all ten sections, 7 Articles, 27 Amendments (newest in 1992)  The first ten Amendments, in effect since 1791, make up the Bill of Rights.      One thing almost caused me to bypass a book written by Ken Starr, who'd been Supreme Court clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger, was because of his harassment of Bill Clinton (when he was president) who wanted to use his office as chief executive \\"immunity\\" to postpone a controversial personal civil case until he had finished his term.  Also, Starr seemed to be the main accuser in the Whitewater investigations as independent counsel.    This highest court in the land is composed of nine justices (guess that's why the committees and boards in Knoxville City government have only nine members), most of whom are remote from American society.  They speak to the public through their written opinions.  With this august group, you can't beat around the bush or stall for a better moment.    One critical issue in our last presidential election was who would choose the next person to sit on this important Supreme Court.  He declares Sandra Day O'Conner, appointed by former President Reagan, as the most powerful and recognized of the present group.  He calls Clarence Thomas its most original thinker.  And, the most influential justice in the 20th century was Earl Warren.  President Clinton appointed Ruth Bader Gingsberg in 1993.      In 1983, Ken Starr was appointed to the U. S. Court Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, where he served more than five years.  He gives a short history of this highly respectable and venerable group; created by the Constitution in 1789.  At times, it has been referred to as a \\"revolutionary\\" court and upset a lot of people when the public schools could no longer allow students to say prayers or recite Bible verses, and insisted on a stricter separation of church and state.    Our Constitution which has governed laws and citizens' rights for 216 years also created the Congress and the presidency.  Elections of the people decide who sits in Congress and occupies the White House.  These nine justices, by contrast, are appointed by the president who is in office at the time of a vacancy, subject to Senate approval.  The chief justice is answerable to the Senate.    The Court's 2000 decision in the presidential election litigation was criticized as exceeding its appropriate and legal authority by an \\"unelected\\" branch of government.  It was regarded as activist by liberals and conservatives.  Al Gore won that election but, because of a technicality decided on by the Supreme Court, he was not allowed to serve.  These justices, most of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, overstepped the reason for their being -- to resolve legal issues, not policy-making.    Since 1986, William H. Rehnquist has been Chief Justice.  During the Iran-Contra affair, his Court upheld the law through a balancing and weighing process.  We may elect a president, but his Court can control him.  The judiciary, not the two political branches, can weigh matters in the balance and then come to a judgment.    The Supreme Court's role as the authoritative, final voice in the framework of representative government (such as overturning affirmative action) makes it the 'first among equals.'  Ken Starr teaches constitutional law at New York University and George Mason University.  This book was a Main Selection of the Conservative Book Club.	2004-12-18

Written by a Britisher, America is lambasted in this little treatise but, in a way, we are noted as a leader of the 'new civilization' with all its faults.  It is villified in odd ways.    America persists in identifying modernity throughout the world in relation to itself.  The prophet of today's America is not Thomas Jefferson or James Madison.  Still less Edmund Burke, though we do like to quote him on occasion.  In his long ramblings about the Cold War and the Soviet collapse, he calls Newt Gingrich a radical from The Right.  Ronald Reagan, when U. S. President, was not, he says, any kind of liberal and could not foresee the economic counter-revolution which occurred.  During his presidency,much of American industry was kept afloat by subsidies, condoning economic inequality.  So, what else is new?  He calls it a 'deregulated' economy.    He quotes Henry Kissinger about our national interest, calling it military-led and 'protectionistic.'  His understanding of 'the American Creed' and the founding of the Constitution is an 'embodiment of universal truths whose future is assured by history.'  The cover of this hedonistic British slap at USA has the \\"all-seeing eye\\" on a dollar bill (US currency) used in the film, NATIONAL TREASURE.  That's all they have in common.    He dwells on free market and 'laissez-faire,' saying that \\"liberalism is dominant in the U.S. only in the sense that genuine conservative philosophy no longer exists.\\"  I disagree.  Then, he goes on to say that \\"to be perceived as a liberal is a political liability.\\"    This British John Gray called former U.S. President Bill Clinton a political shaman, causing an underclass which has no hope and an overclass who denies civic obligations.  \\"Remolding American society to suit the imperatives of free market has involved the use of corporate power and federal government to bring about levels of economic inequality unknown since the 1920s.\\"    He accuses America as an arrogant 'utopian' place where its faith in being a unique country, 'the model for a universal civilization' which all societies are fated to emulate.  According to him, \\"America persists in identifying modernity throughout the world in relation to itself.\\"    He points out the tragedy of family breakdown and the lack of extended family support.  He blames it on deregulated labor markets, divorce,  and the incarceration rates where he compared Britian's \\"fewer than one in a thousand\\" to America's \\"one in a hundred\\" being behind bars.  His thesis that over a million people would be seeking work if American penal policies resembled those of any other western country.  My question is \\"where are the jobs?\\"  Should we create another Australia and empty the prisons?    The high rate of crime and incarceration in the U. S. are on a par with large numbers of lawyers and the huge levels of litigation.  America's incarceration rates run parallel with its rates of violent crime, which this author blames on the U.S. abundant gun culture.  Throughout human history, wars have arisen from territorial conflicts and economic interests.    Again, where are the jobs?  Many U.S. factories continue to use other countries to manufacture deficient products by using cheap labor elsewhere, causing unemployment to skyrocket.  Huge conglomerates like Wal-Mart (with their cheap merchandise) force smaller chains to fold or merge, and so they profit by using other places at the expense of the willing workers of America.    John Gray is a professor of European thought at the London School of Economics.  He is considered one of Britain's leading public intellectuals and an important conservative thinker.  His far-fetched opinions that 'the movement toward free markets, goods and ideas is not a naturally occurring process but rather a political project that rests on American power\\" is just passing the buck.      After all his 'put downs' no way would I believe that he feels America is a 'flagship of the new civilization.'  We can learn by studying the failures of the old civilizations, and not place blame.	2004-12-16
422600:US	35985708	RRIB3VJZBJ0YN	1568956169	226907422	Talking to Heaven: A Medium's Message of Life After Death	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Let's Have Peace on Earth."	This is part spiritual memoir, but it is also the 'blending of thoughts, ideas, experiences, and lives' of those he writes about in this guide.  This was his first books and very well received; he has followed up with REACHING TO HEAVEN and HEAVEN AND EARTH.  He appears to be a 'medium' as in the book, ROSE RED. <br /> <br />He discovered he was a psychic in the first grade of a Catholic school.  He writes, \\"We are all born with some level of psychic ability.\\"  At the age of eight, he had his first clairvoyant experience when he saw the illuminated hand of God coming from the ceiling.  Though the impact was impressive, he did not tell anyone.  He did not feel afraid, quite the opposite: peace, love and joy.  \\"I began to understand that there was much more to life than what I had been taught and what I could see through my physical eyes.  It was my secret\\" -- this revelation from God, as he felt that no one would believe him anyway. <br /> <br />He gives meditations to follow the relaxation exercises, which must be standard procedure for psychologists.  I learned the basic relaxation concept from Dr. Gregory Forman, PhD, to help with a chronic nerve pain.  It is similar way except for this addition: \\"As you exhale, imagine any negativity, stress, or anxiety that has been pent up in your body slowly leave...\\"  I like knowing that, as I used the basic inhale,exhale prior to a recent foot surgery.  I learn something useful from every book I read, it seems. <br /> <br />For his meditations, you need to use the visualization technique as well.  If, however, you just want a quick way of relaxing from a day's stress, you can do the relaxation exercise by itself.   His three major meditations are: Saying Goodbye to Loved Ones and Sending Them on Their Way, Forgiveness and Reegrets, and Rediscovering Your Power. <br /> <br />Love celebrates life, an emotional expression of the human heart.  We should be aware of what we were, what we are, and what we are yet to become in a never-ending journey.  Rich Levine reminds you that 'dreams are not a waste of time; your imagination is where your future begins.\\" <br /> <br />Since I've been against the death penalty for a long time, I was interested in his 'take' on capital punishment.  Like me, he believes that the confined person suffers more from the loss of freedom and being treated as less than human.  He advises everyone to look at the situation from a spiritual point of view and not from an emotional standpoint.   <br /> <br />His thesis, which I find frightening, is that \\"when a spirit of an individual is forced out of the body by capital punishment, the personality of the criminal remains exactly the same as it was prior to execution.\\"  According to him, the soul roams endlessly throughout the lower astral world with other like-minded souls; these tormented ghouls (my word) carry a mind-set of anger and hatred, seeking revenge for their untimely deaths and search the earth for weak humans whom then can mentally influence to kill or hurt others.  This is a scary thought, but I'd rather not dwell on this possibility. <br /> <br />Sylvia Browne expounds the 'life after death' part as a happy experience and has many devoted followers.  I sent one of her books (in audio form) to Ken Young for his birthday last year -- when he was going through a rough time -- which he said he would share with his mother, a devotee of the psychic. <br /> <br />Guess I'm a skeptic as I read for the information and not the consolation.  This I found very interesting: Psychic energy in plant and animal kingdoms.  Plants are extremely sensitive and often thrive when they sense a gentle and friendly environment where they feel loved and well-cared for.  Once, while visiting a friend, he \\"heard\\" a high-pitched sound and \\"felt\\" a screaming vibration.  He noticed that the house plants were dried up and dying, screaming for water.  It was verified that they had not been watered in over two weeks.  Maybe he saved some of them by being there.  The magic of life comes in all forms, shapes and sizes, even plants. <br /> <br />Animals have a sixth sense and can sense a disaster before it strikes, often hiding in a closet or underneath furniture.  They are highly sensitive to human anxiety as well.  It's not a coping mechanism but an inborn instinct they use to protect themselves. <br /> <br />Sometimes, humans need this instinct.  So often in life it is our desire to be loved and we tend to fall victim to our own making.  Because we believe it is what is expected in order to have the love of someone else, we compromise who we truly are.  We create a false image.  When I read the book BEEN THERE DONE THAT, I lost faith in my \\"first love\\" (I was president of his fanclub in Knoxville.) and was told by Chick Watkins, \\"You believed in his image.\\"  We have given our power and a piece of ourselves to the person we love.  We have left our centeredness and given away a part of our self-wholeness.  We can never be truly happy until we live our own lives. <br /> <br />This book has something for everybody.  Since we are all distinct individuals, we seek different interpretations in books like this.  It has certainly been a popular item.	2004-12-15
423150:US	35985708	R1Z98CT3TF1QVI	0786209313	842292252	Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away With Murder	Books	4	6	7	N	N	An Honest Appraisal By A Pro.	I've been a fan of Vincent Bugliosi since he wrote HELTER SKELTER (the best-selling true crime book in publishing history) and can't hear the Beatles' song of that title without thinking of the crime it was used to signify.  As I recall, it was the first book I can remember reading every word, as it was so hard to believe he was writing such horrendous things about real people who appeared to be under the influence of the Devil.  The real life demon was a drug-crazed Charles Manson who mesmerized his women followers to kill indiscriminately in California, for no reason.    Here, we find an impartial account of another monster who felt he was bigger than God (and had a reason), and had learned from those crazy movies he was in how he could get away with murder.  His timing was off, his alibi unsubstantiated, and all the incriminating evidence proved he did it.  No one else was even questioned seriously except perhaps that silly Kato Kaelin (who had no reason) who seemed such a blockhead, didn't know his right hand from his left.    According to this book, some of the most vital pieces of evidence was never presented to the jury by the harassed prosecutors.  Amazingly, it took this jury of his peers only four hours to come up with the \\"Not Guilty\\" verdict.  The whole world knew he was guilty.      I'd watched 95% of the t.v. coverage and had wondered what had been in the suitcase he had when the police met his return plane and Robert Kardashian took from him.  This is called tampering with evidence.  When it turned up later empty, no one investigated -- or at least, the public was not informed.  It had to hold his bloody clothes which vanished into thin air.  Many people felt that he had an accomplice.    The way he thanked his saviors (the jury) made me feel they had been 'bought.'  I've never been able to figure out why the son of O.J. broke into sobs when the verdict was read, and wondered at the time if he'd been the accomplice.  He was escorted out of that courtroom pronto before reporters could ask why he'd cried.    The last picture shown in the photo section showed the disbelief and abject horror on the faces of viewers in the electronics department of a Sears store in Jackson, TN, when O.J. basked in his victory over death.  The photo above was gross -- a waitress named Neely and a Chicago sales rep. cheered in a bar on the southside, where my eldest son was living as a student at the University of Chicago at that time.  How can people react so differently to such an unjust decision by an uninformed group of jury members who'd fought among themselves?!    Called the Trial of the Century, it proved to be a farce over which a tyrant of a judge presided and pandered to the defense, always castigating and fining members of the prosecution team.  Even though I knew O.J. was guilty, I thought Johnnie Cochran's closing argument was a classic.  As a young mother, I had worked as secretary to some smalltown lawyers and learned from that experience, but I had never heard such rhetoric as in his presentation.  I believed Mark Fuhrman and felt that he had been unjustly treated by the media.    Only an experienced prosecuting attorney could have come up with the five reasons why O.J. Simpson got away with murder.  He shows how there could have been and should have been a different verdict.  O.J. somehow was exonerated and free from a lifetime in prison, but his life changed drastically.  No more movies or t.v. ads, no high-flying personna people could admire.    Bugliosi won Edgar Allan Poe awards for HELTER SKELTER and TILL DEATH US DO PART.  His AND THE SEA WILL TELL was #1 on New York Times bestseller list.  I read all three (thoroughly researched) and watched the movies made for t.v., but it was hard.  I felt \\"let down\\" by the system for a long time after the O.J. fiasco of a trial and the outrageous, unbelievable verdict.    A smalltown police chief once told me, \\"Don't you know, there ain't no justice.\\"  This trial makes me believe him.	2004-12-15

This book is partly autobiography and parly inspirational, depending on what you get out of it.  It was published by Thomas Nelson Publishers, a Christian firm in Nashville, TN.    While country singer/songwriter Ricky Van Shelton was pursuing his dreams, the dutiful wife waited at home on their 150-acre ranch outside Nashville, in Davidson County.  He'd collected fifties model cars, Coca-Cola signs, cowboy memorabilia, and a life-size cigar store Indian, but his absence hurt.    Bettye had earned a degree in music business from Belmont University, (called Ward Belmont College for Young Ladies initially) in a beautiful setting where a strange-looking metal statue of a phoenix has its home hid behind some magnolia trees there (almost unnoticed now) on campus.  When my son Zach was a student of creative writing at Belmont, he introduced me to this mythological character which had arisen out of its own ashes and it was fairly new at that location.  Perhaps Bettye thought of this statue as she tried to rescue her marriage from ashes (almost).    Before he became a star, they'd enjoyed happy, fun-filled, but simple, life.  Afterwards, it became a struggle and turmoil in her personal life which threatened to destroy their marriage.  She had the courage to endure and fight for what she knew was worth keeping.    She confided to a woman she scarcely knew who was engaged to her husband's producer.  They became close friends and Andy Landis wrote: It was a privilege to have been called to your side; \\"I wouldn't have missed it for the world.\\"  I wrote those same words to a person I met three years ago, quite by chance, and value enough to try to tame some of my innate impulsiveness and enthusiasm.  James Van Praagh wrote in his book TALKING TO HEAVEN:  \\"So often in life it is our desire to be loved that we tend to fall victim to our own making.  Because we believe it is what is expected in order to have the love of someone else, we compromise who we truly are.  We create an image.  We have given our power and a piece of ourselves to the beloved.  We have left our centeredness and given away a part of our self-wholeness.  We can never be truly happy until we live our own lives.\\"    With the help of her new friend, Andy, Bettye discovered this and worked hard to salvage what she could from the ashes of a slightly-chipped (not broken) marriage to the person she truly loved.  This intimate story shows that there is a way to 'heal an unmended hurt.'      It portrays a woman (two women, really) who have intelligence, compassion, integrity, and enough grit for 'tough love.'  It takes a strong person to endure and perservere.   Bettye's 'angel in the flesh' confesses to being a 'late bloomer.'  So was I.  It is as much her story as the Sheltons, as we follow her own personal demons and triumphs.    'She Stays' is a featured song on the 'Common Ground' CD (a duet sung by Andy Landis and Ricky Van Shelton), as they pay tribute to Bettye's courage and commitment to her marriage -- which she saved through the pain of forgiveness.  The song was written by Allen Shamblin in collaboration with Andy Landis.  It was included in this CD of 'Songs of Faith, Love and Inspiration,' a compilation including other country music singers.	2004-12-14
423866:US	35985708	RS97WSKSNJUTJ	0786863943	300971212	The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: The 25 Year Landmark Study	Books	3	10	19	N	N	Love sometimes dies, but not for the children.	In thesis, this ambitious study set out to explore perceptions and experiences of family members, particularly the children, following divorce.  Called the 'largest such research project ever undertaken,' it started in 1971 with sixty families of white, middle-class members, married nine years or more and had at least one child.      Based on the Children of Divorce Project, it included five assessments, initial, 18-month, 5 yr., 10 yr., then this '25 Year Landmark Study' but the conclusions are still up in the air.  Most of these adults were well educated, with 80% having a B.A. or B.S. college degree and 30% had gone on to receive a grad degree.  Forty percent had some college, and 42% had a high school diploma.    A clinical psychologist and specialist on divorce and its after effects on the children, Judith Wallerstein attempted to show how these children who survived the upheaval and turmoil of a divided family often had to raise themselves.  Many had to learn about true love for another person can be achieved through trial and error.  There will always be failures and successes in every phase of life.  Divorce is not the end, sometimes it's a beginning to a better world of freedom where they can find their heart's desires.  I've found that for many of us, we never end up marrying our first loves.  Why's that?  Maybe divorce is the answer.    People who were younger when their parents divorced looked less competent overall 25 yrs. later.  This was most notable in girls who had been pre-schoolers and in boys who had been early school age when the divorce occurred.  Of those, 60% fall below average in their functioning in social relationships.  Some reject their parents when they grow up and refuse contact after they have families of their own.    They regard their parents' divorce as a terrible failure and feel they'll end up doing the same.  Many adults stay in unhappy marriages just to avoid a divorce.  The proper time to begin helping 'children of divorce' learn how to choose a mate is during mid-adolescence, a time when attitudes toward oneself and relationships with the opposite sex are beginning to gel.  This is the time when worries about sex, love, betrayal, and morality take center stage.    At a recent play performance of 'The Lion in Winter' at the Black Box theater, the parents set the worst possible examples for their three sons with plodding and conniving to harm the other.  They were prime subjects for divorce but, being Catholic, could only contemplate annulment in their mid years -- as they basically disliked each other and the three grown sons, who wished them dead.   Sometimes, it harms the children more to watch such pain and maneuvering by unfaithful and unloving parents.    Teenagers need to see a healthy way to resolve tensions.  The question is, can an educational intervention such as this Study replace the learning that occurs naturally over many years within the family?    In the studies for this project, the children took many paths, but all changed in the wake of divorce.  Since these youngsters' character and conscience were still being formed during the post-divorce years, the new roles they assumed in the family had profound effects on who they became and on the relationships they established when they reached adulthood.      They will always wonder what motivated their parents' decision to divorce and if they were the cause for it.  Sometimes, love dies -- but life goes on in a different form.  That is the 'unexpected legacy of divorce'!

This book is filled with short accounts of diverse \\"American Moments\\" grouped in ten areas.  This is a sampling.  Each reader would do a completely different review as there is so much to choose from to make an interesting account. <br /> <br />The Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, built in 1914, was a beautiful railroad palace through which half the soldiers of this country passed Dec. 7, the day word came of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The interior, from the insert photograph, looks a lot like the magnificent station in Washington, D.C.  Back then, the idea was to create grand buildings for everyday citizens.  At the street entrance, there on the sidewalk, stood a tall ornate black clock like the one which graced Knoxville's Gay Street for several decades.  Ours was recently moved by the owners of a jewelry store to the new location west of town, a lavish edifice, and yet the clock has yet to be put up.  They claimed it because it had stood in front of the downtown store.  There is now a campaign to replace it there among the brew pubs, martini bars, and loft apartments where the downtowners hang out.  Somehow, it will lack the 'dignity' of the original. <br /> <br />There are two photos of Becky Davis of Tennessee making cotton candy at a Fair.  Invented in the 1920s (Karault says by a dentist), it is sticky spun sugar in pretty colors.  It takes experience to flip it just right to keep from being covered by the gooey stuff.  He wonders what folks ate at fairs and carnivals before cotton candy came along.  In the 1980s, funnel cakes made an appearance at the World's Fair in Knoxville.  I have yet to eat my first one (not even a taste), though I was tempted at the 2004 Fair -- missed the chance as time was short and I had to run to catch a bus. <br /> <br />The country's smallest p.o. is shown free-standing about the size of a well house in Ochopee, Florida.  It may be tiny but has its own historical marker on a stand right outside on the road; a regular size postal drop box is beside the building wher it is encouraged the customers use for mailing their post cards and envelopes.  Inside, of course, Naomi Lewis will be glad to sell stamps.  From the photo, I see they had room by her counter for the \\"most wanted\\" criminals pictures, a staple of post offices everywhere.  Our smallest here is at Knoxville Center mall in a corner beside the offices where you can get your driver's license and car tags.  It even has room for packages which I usually mail there, as one of the two 'old' postal clerks told me, \\"here, you can be first in line.\\"  Now, that's a plus. <br /> <br />Before that, U. S. A. had The Pony Express which began in St. Joseph, Missouri, to deliver mail overland all the way to California, 2,000 miles in ten days.  At the Pony Express Museum, on the wall is an early want ad:  \\"Wanted -- Young, Skinny, Wiry Fellows.  Not Over Eighteen.  Must Be Expert Rider.  Willing to Risk Death Daily.  Orphans Preferred.\\"  This enterprise lasted only a year and a half until the completion of the telegraph.  There is a bronze statue of a young rider on a horse (in flight) there at St. Joseph where Gary Chilcote, director of the Patee House Museum, explained: \\"they rode through Kansas and Nebraska, dipped into Colorado, and across Wyoming, Nevada, Utan and dropped down into California. <br /> <br />This historian tells the story of Jesse James' demise.  Jesse was the first outlaw in the American West, right after the Civil War.  He and his gang robbed trains and banks.  There is a photo of the small house where Bob Ford, one of the gang members, shot Jesse behind the right ear as he attempted to straighten a picture on a wall on April 3, 1882.  Kuralt wrote, \\"Die a law-abiding citizen and you will be remembered for a time.  Die a desperado and you will be remembered for all time.\\"  The last of Jesse James, killed by one of his own gang, was an American Moment to Remember. <br /> <br />It looked bigger than life in the movie version.  A hatmaker he interviewed shows a bow being put on a cowboy hat for which the movies made popular.  \\"All self-respecting cowboy hats have bows on them\\" (similar to those little things you see on the front of most bras).  They have to or you're not a cowboy.  That's as close as you can get to the meaning of this symbol in a word.  A cowboy hat demands respect.   <br /> <br />My favorite cowboy, Lash LaRue, included me in his program at the East Tennessee Fair when Al Curtis brought him here (a big thing back then).  Lash dressed in black and always wore a black hat.  Our local cowboy, Marshal Andy Smalls, advises his t.v. fans to 'wear a white hat, so we will know the good guys.'  I've always yearned for a blue one, but bought it for my little cowboy (Justin at age 4 or 5) whom the girls all liked at the library costume party. <br /> <br />This fact-filled book, published after Charles Kuralt's death (7-4-97), was edited by Peter Freudlich, his friend and writer-producer for CBS News, where Charles worked for 37 years.  He won many honors for his \\"on the road\\" journalism, and I enjoyed his features on 'CBS Sunday Morning.'  In the Foreward, written by Charles Osgood, he calls Charles Kuralt, native son of North Carolina, an 'explorer' as he covered the back roads of this country to find real Americans and their unique stories.	2004-12-13

Actually, in this 87th Preceinct series #46, it's the name of a play in an imaginary town called Isola, full of fictitious people and places.    The play in which Michelle Cassidy is rehearsing the lead is about an actress being pursued by a stalker.  One evening, a little after seven, as she is leaving rehearsals at the Susan Granger theater, she actually is stabbed by a man wearing a black coat, a black wide-brimmed hat, and black gloves who lunges out of an alley with a knife.      At the Morehouse General Hospital, the red-haired actress was interviewed by t.v. reporters who didn't realize she had been the former child star of ANNIE on the road.  She'd been stabbed in the shoulder, inches away from the heart.    The ER intern who'd admitted her said \\"had the stab wound been two iinches lower and a bit to the right, she'd be 'playing first harp in the celestial philharmonic'.\\"  That very afternoon, she had made a report at the precinct about receiving threatening phone calls from a man sounding like Jack Nicholson, saying he would kill her with a knife.    Like the Knoxville police, they don't consider that a crime (to threaten bodily harm) but wait until it happens to show any interest.  One thing which made it sound 'fishy' is the plot of \\"Romance\\" where the actress is stalked and stabbed.  She told reporters she felt it had to be someone familiar with the play.    Her theatrical agent, Johnny Milton, arrived at the hospital as the two police dectectives started to interrogate her and became suspect #1, even though the show's stage manager knew all the details such as Miss Cassidy's being released from the hospital later that very night.    During their investigation, it is discovered that Milton had a reservation at a nearby restaurant (a 5-min. walk) for 7 p.m. (alibi) and told the cops he thought Michelle had 'planned' the scene for publicity.  Later, he said they'd had a disagreement over the phone.  Someone she knew did come to her apartment and demanded to be let in, while she was home alone.  And, she was relieved when she saw who it was through the peephole, took the chain off, and unlocked three different locks to meet her fate.    Johnny Milton had no reason to kill her, as the stabbing in the alley had accomplished everything he wanted to happen.  His client suddenly became a 'star,' as the stabbing had put both her and the play on the map because of the media coverage.    It was unusual for real life to mirror a role in a play; this one called 'Romance.'  So why kill the golden goose?  Where's the motive:  love or money.  Possibly it could have something to do with the leading role's lovely understudy, Josie Beals.  Or, could it have been Chuck Madden, the stage manager, who had a handwritten note on his machine:  \\"Dear God, please forgive me for what I did to Michelle.\\"    Author of THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE in 1954, plus a multitude of novels as Ed McBain and his real name, Evan Hunter, he earned the title Grand Master from the Mystery Writer's of America.  He has to his credit short story collections, a few children's books, also screenplays and teleplays of some of his books.  He's still grinding them out.	2004-12-12

As a sixteen year old victim of rape, torture, and attempted murder by Robert Willie in Louisiana, Debbie Ceuvas survived the brutality this killer used to subdue her during the kidnapping.  After fifteen years of remembering the nightmarish ordeal, she was able to overcome the trauma and start speaking out. <br /> <br />Her appearance on the t.v. show, 'Frontline,' to tell what really happened to her as opposed to Hollywood's version of 'Dead Man Walking' proved a pivotal point in her recovery.  It served as a turning point whereby she was invited to speak at conferences where other participants had endured their own form of confinement and torture. <br /> <br />At the Cleveland, Ohio, conference in 1997, titled \\"Forgiveness in a Violent Society,' she shared the platform with Beirut hostage Terry Anderson.  At seminars directed by Terry Hargrave, a therapist and psychology professor from Amarillo, Texas, she learned the steps to inner healing through forgiveness:  insight, understanding, remorse, compensation for past hurts, through two areas, salvage and restoration. <br /> <br />Though she was never mentioned in the film, her testimony led to Willie's conviction.  In FORGIVE AND FORGET by Lewis Smedes, she found the section, \\"Forgiving Monsters\\" relevant to her experience.  Refusing to forgive meant submerging the pain, shame, and self-pity. <br /> <br />Forgiveness seems so hard and you wonder, \\"Is it really worth it?\\"  She learned that by forgiving that human monster, she was able to trust again -- to experience the giving and receiving of love.  She married Conner Morris and is now a mother. <br /> <br />She writes, \\"People often ask how I feel about the death penalty now?\\"  Her response:  \\"Justice didn't do a thing to heal me.  Forgiveness did.\\"  I've always been opposed to the death penalty due to the fact that so many 'criminals' on death row are there through revenge and lies. <br /> <br />This is the previously untold other half of \\"Dead Man Walking,' themovie starring Sean Penn, which depicted the death row relationship he had with spiritual advisor, Helen Prejean, author of the book, DEAD MAN WALKING.  Sister Helen, though she tried to save the life of a killer, admires Debbie's refreshing honesty as she dealt with the 'traumatic aftershock and the long, painful road to become whole again.'  This true story of the young woman whose testimony sent Willie to the electric chair is one of courage, faith, and forgiveness. <br /> <br />This book is Debbie's \\"walk\\" on an incredible journey which was life-changing.  THE DAILY VARIETY describes her as 'a woman who is Prejean's equal in strength and virtue.'  We are asked to contemplate, \\"Is there any crime, any hurt, any person beyond the power of forgiveness.\\"	2004-12-10

In Congregation Ezrath Israel, called the Actors Temple (located near the Broadway theater district), the rabbi had been celebrating a midnight observance of Yom Hashoah, the Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust.    Thus begins this 'holy' adventure of Adcock's erstwhile Detective Hockaday as he investigages the murder of this young rabbi before a group of fourteen elderly eyewitnesses, all proclaiming that the killer was a 'shadow' (however, this one was no ghost, as there was a distinctive smell).  The figure in a dark cloak was suddenly there, then vanished into the Hell's Kitchen; like a shadow he appears and passes away, and no trace is left of his footprints.    There is a photo of the death chapel at the synagogue and also of the Holy Cross Catholic church where seven parishioners were slain on Good Friday, on \\"Grief Street.\\"  In a letter to a tabloid newspaper reporter, a script was anonymously sent in which these victims were supposedly the most devout and charitable residents of Hell's Kitchen -- 100 years ago.    There were also thirteen other black and white photos scattered throughout the book of this area where Al Capone had been born.  The one of a partial skyline had a tall skyscraper similar to the 'Batman Building' (BellSouth) in Nashville without the two antennas.  The apartment houses with the outside fire escapes were all similar, but the fenced in place called 'Bob's Park' looked like one I saw in Chicago some years ago.    Ollie's Diner, Noodle Shop & Grille on W. 44th St. was one of my favorites, as were Stardust Dine-O-Mat near Times Square on 42nd St, and the Grill at The Savoy were odd but effective.  He calls the philosophical Father Morrison a hermit Jesuit priest.  Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan where the 'other-worldly' crime occurred is two blocks (and a million miles) from Broadway, he says.    It is a compelling but strange story which features his Irish hero detective.  For some reason, I can't picture Collin Ferrell asplaying the lead if a movie had been made.  He's written others featuring Hockaday, such as DEVIL'S HEAVEN, DARK MAZE, PRECINCT 19, and SEA OF GREEN.	2004-12-09

Israel had been in existence only a decade before this historic trial.  A special law had to be instigated for this heinous crime called the Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law; it passed and was used as the basis for the process of trying Adolf Eichmann. <br /> <br />He had grown up in Austria, but considered a failure by his family and himself.  At the age of 26, he joined the Nazi Party, received SS military training and, in Berlin, he worked to establish a Freemasons Museum. <br /> <br />He became an expert on Zionism and was sent back to Vienna to rid Austria, then an annexation to the Third Reich, of all Jews through forced emigration.  For the first time in his life, he was a success -- by forcing 116,000 to leave that country.   <br /> <br />He worked up to the rank of colonel in the SS before the collapse of the Third Reich.  He worked his kind of magic again (in Hungary) where his efforts had half a million of Hungarian Jews deported less than a year before the defeat of Nazi Germany.  At first, the Jewish people were sent to eastern Europe and later to the extermination camps. <br /> <br />He was never a policy maker, but carried out his orders to rid the Nazi controlled territories of those born Jews.  Taking the alias Ricardo Klement, he was joined by his wife and children where he went from Europe to Argentina nine years until his capture.  It took two and a half years for the inner workings of the new country of Israel to get its information confirmed as they were doubtful that an important Nazi would choose to live in such a poor, low-class neighborhood.  He was turned in by a half-blind Jew. <br /> <br />Almost a year after his capture in Argentina, a 4-month trial was held in Jerusalem, then four months transpired before the sentencing.  There was an appeal by his German defense counsel three months later; two years after his capture (two days after the appeal was refused) this 'arch-criminal' was hanged at the age of 56.  This writer wasable to interview the German Attorney who broke his 35-yr. silence to talk with her for this book. <br /> <br />The graphic testimony showing the horrors of the Holocaust revived all the pain and abhorrence toward such by the whole world.  At the time of his capture, it was assumed he had been a top leader.  Nothing could have been farther from the truth.  He had obtained a visa from the Vatican to relocate to Argentina. <br /> <br />He was what might call a \\"petty\\" (nonessential) officer and, to upset the modern world twenty years after the war atrocities had occurred, on such a minor player in the scheme of things was a mistake by the independent state called Israel.  Things are never quite what they seem. <br /> <br />During the 1950s Israel was a society in the making and the Holocaust survivors were an important element of the culture of this settlement.  Due largely to their demographic attributes, the survivors there in Israel were active and influential group of immigrants.  The author thought that this trial symbolized 'the beginning of Israel's coming of age.' <br /> <br />Many people remember in great detail what they were doing at the moment they learned of Eichmann's capture on May 23, 1960.  Few events in the life of a nation leave a permanent impression on the lives of its population, events of the kind that make people forever remember where they were and what they were doing at the exact moment of its happening.  This is what happened with the survivors of the Holocaust who lived in Israel. <br /> <br />In the USA, it was November 22, 1963, the day John F. Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullet to his head which will forever stay in American's memories.	2004-12-08
435608:US	35985708	R3T51SDFR7PC4X	0813335604	110627306	The Fateful Hoaxing Of Margaret Mead: A Historical Analysis Of Her Samoan Research	Books	3	5	37	N	N	Live and Let Live.	Margaret Mead's decision to become an antropologist was her belief that a scientist could make a useful contribution to knowledge.  In 1924, at the age of 23, she was the youngest participant to go to remote parts of the world where their ways of life were vanishing due to 'modern civilization.'  She believed that it was imperative to record those unknown ways of life before they were lost forever and was determined to go to the field as soon as she could.  And so she agreed to study adolescent behavior in Samoa, where letters descended on her in intermittent downpours, sometimes 70 or 80 at a time, as they traveled at a slow pace back then.    As a consequence, her 1928 book, COMING OF AGE IN SAMAO, was a bestseller and widely popular with college students of the 1960s.  It was full of photos of the natives, mostly undressed (as was their custom).  It became the best-selling anthropology book of all time, a classic with her assertion of the sovereignity of culture over biology.    This was a drastic change from Barnard civilization in 1922 to the primitiveness she encountered out in the field.  As she wrote in her autobiography, BLACKBERRY WINTER (1972), fifty years later, she did have difficulty learning the language even though she'd \\"studied\\" Latin, French and German in high school.    Her research in the South Pacific made her the best-known American anthropologist of the century.  In her letters, she had characterized Samoan adolescence similar to the \\"free love\\" of the '60s, which she ascribed to 'permissive childrearing' and 'tolerant sexual attitudes.'  I'd say it was due to their lack of clothing.  She'd thought they had been free from the stress associated with more cultured people.    In an earlier book by this author, MARGARET MEAD AND SAMOA (1983), he tried to prove the opposite of her writings.  An Australian professor, who spent years of fieldwork and research there on his own, found the opposite with 'restrictive regulations against premarital sex.'He asserted that she had \\"poor preparation\\" for the field (having grown up in a white, upper-middle class background in Philadelphia, PA, with an authoritarian father) and, most likely had been duped by her adolescent informants.  Could be, she didn't understand their verbal language and based her scientific 'findings' on their body language.    In this book, he tried to prove (with the help of Ms. Mead's traveling companion of 1926) that one of the most influential anthropological studies of the 20th century was unwittingly based on the mischievous joking of the investigator's informants.  He's made a lifelong study of the people of Samoa (maybe he could speak their language fluently?) researching the Margaret Mead Samoan fieldwork of 1925-26 onsite and in the Library of Congress.  During all this time,(six years spent in Samoa, 1965-68, and 1981) he spent over 40 years teaching the subject at an Australian University.  Could be he's a male chauvinist.    He claims she'd neglected to fully investigate the problem assigned her and relied at the last moment on the tales of two native traveling companions who jokingly 'misled' her about the sexual conduct of Samoan girls.  She'd been a precocious American girl who admitted in her biography that she \\"loved the babies.\\"    Calling her findings a hoax and giving his account of how it (possibly) took place, he puts the blame on her lack of training (and maturity) which 'set her up to be hoaxed.'  He waited until after her death to use this means to influence the public that her famous study was based on a hoax.    Calling her 'classic' book a myth, he worked many years in various locations to refute her findings, exploring the history of both anthropology, using Darwin's ORIGIN OF SPECIES as a reference, and biology to bring public awareness of what he calls a 'major 20th century myth.'      He went to the island with a formal traveling party from which the Samoans Margaret Mead studied had migrated, just to prove her wrong.  Why was he so determined after 24 years to write a refutation?  He went to a lot of trouble to prove this highly respectable woman wrong.  His aggressiveness and determination to soil her reputation will backfire, and her most famous book may someday be valuable enough to be an item in the Smithsonian Institution, if is isn't there already.      He certainly traveled around those parts on an officious errand but he's only a teacher of Social Studies (1999).  He calls this thesis a 'step toward rethinking the foundations of social science.'    Just as the UT professor who plans to \\"re-do\\" James Agee's Pulitzer prize-winning novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY to include the author's additional handwritten notes and place everything in chronological order, it only makes them look the \\"fool\\" to attempt to parody a classic.  I told him, \\"You can't ruin this book.\\"    Now, Freeman has published two books sixteen years apart trying the same thing.  I hope he is proven wrong, as you should never change another writer's work -- for any reason.  Even if he thinks he is right!	2004-12-04

Our bodies hold on to painful episodes from the past.  Early trauma and deeply buried feelings become woven into the fabric of our physical being.  These echoes from the past cause disruptive patterns in life and relationships.  Our bodies can hold the knowledge of situations and events we have forgotten, yet are deeply rooted in experiences of the past.  Memories exist within the body's nervous system.    Harmful events long since slipped beneath the surface of awareness are lodged in our brain and surface at unexpected times with symptoms such as emotional swings, panic, feeling helpless and powerless, fear of the future, along with physical ailments, like greater susceptibility to colds, 'low energy,' changes in sleep patterns -- even nightmares.  Sometimes symptoms develop when aspects of a person's past history are so stuck in your body and psyche that they erupt endlessly into current day existence.    Many are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, once considered to be related to military combat malfunctioning, but is not at all uncommon these days.  The latest scientific findings show that 60% males, 51% females had signifigant PTSD as adults, some trauma going back to parental neglect during their childhoods.  In the aftermath, studies show that women are more than twice as likely to suffer needlessly, as the aftereffects can persist for years undiagnosed and untreated.    Mrs. Scarf uses narratives to tell the secret stories of 'volunteers' willing to share their secrets (shame-related, motivated by love and loyalty, those kept from Self, etc.).  She writes:  \\"for what could be more secret, more mortifying and shame-ridden, than those painful, sometimes overwhelming remembrances of the past that most of us don't want to examine candidly, even think about, much less reveal to other people?\\"    As Peter Fonda put it in his memoir, DON'T TELL DAD:   \\"I would prefer to never again think of the dark parts of my past.\\"  He's not alone in wishing the painful episodes could just disappear.  This book shows they never do.    She recognizes Dr. Bessel van der Kolk in Boston to be the 'father of present-day research in this field.'  The author admits experiencing painful symptoms when she wrestles with contradictory memories of her mother.  She interviewed so many doctors, therapists, and psychologists for this book, it's as if she was receiving \\"free\\" therapy as a result.    Trauma can be caused by a threat to the physical integrity of another person, according to the DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL to which she refers.  She lists 'Acts of Violence' and 'Emotional and Economic Attacks' in Appendix 2, listing and giving examples of what affects us all.  Some are Intimidation, Threats, Disrespect (putting you down in front of other people), Destructive Criticism, among others.    She  attended a writing class at Yale taught by Susan Cheever, so she would be able to present her findings for the ordinary person to understand and be able to learn from the admissions of others.  The people interviewed by Mrs. Scarf knew the secrets they revealed would be used in a book.  She expresses her appreciation for their candidness and willingness with this statement, \\"I have wondered about you, worried about you, admired you; above all, learned from you.\\"    She has received several National Media awards from the American Psychological Foundation, has written three previous books, and is a contributing editor to 'The New Republic.'    The reader can learn things from her research, such as \\"one can't eliminate childhood memories, but can see those things in perspective as what they are, more finite in size.\\"	2004-12-02

Otherwise, we won't have noney to eat.  And all this excess pollen will kill us all.<br /><br />Set in the lush and colorful American South in 1964, the year of Civil Rights Act and much racial unrest, this first novel coincides with her adolescent life in a small town in Georgia.  She incorporates her own remembrances of growing up in a 'Mayberry' atmosphere while, all around, segregation dies an uneasy demise.<br /><br />She tells of her experiences buying a nickel cherry CocaCola in the local drug store.  At Reeve's in Pulaski, TN, you can still get a small glass of Coke for only five cents.<br /><br />She had lived an idyllic existence with her very own nanny who used snuff and had a distinct manner of spitting, which she gave to Lily's nanny.  I remember, as a girl of eleven, how I hated the vines behind the porch swing at my grandmother's as she had that annoying habit and that was her favorite place to spit.  Yuck!<br /><br />Saying that these characters were not modeled after real people, she admits using trivial details from her adolescence and some of the sayings her own nanny (who had a colorful way with words) used, and a few borrowed traits -- in a civil rights backdrop.<br /><br />A motherless girl who sets off on her own to find a mother, it doesn't matter to Lily the color or age, and discovers herself and more than she was expecting.  \\"In the photo by my bed my mother is perptually smiling on me.

Her harsh father had made her believe that she was responsible for the death of her mother.<br />This being a fictional account, she could forgive her mother for leaving her alone, seeking for what was taken from her.  She longs for and goes on a search to find the single thing her heart longs for. This is truly a forgiving story for the motherless child in all of us.<br /><br />Lily and her black nanny set out on a search for an unfettered existence in smalltown South, a town which holds the secret to her mother's past.  There they are taken in by an eccentric trio of what she called the 'calendar' sisters (named May, June and August) who keep bees.  As she enters a mesmerizing secret world of bees and honey, she comes to terms with her destiny.<br /><br />Bees were considered a symbol of the soul, of death and rebirth in legends going back to ancient times.  There's a mystique about bees, a kind of spell they weave over you.  The queen bee is the mother of the hive, never leaving her prison.  If something happens to her, the colony is left motherless and will die unless a new queen is introduced, and a most extravagant change happens.<br /><br />In her research, the author found medieval references (500 years ago) associating the Virgin Mary with the queen bee.  The worker bees are all female while the males go out to collect the nectar.  A bee's life is short, usually four or five weeks of busy foraging to make the honey.  One of the blurbs about this novel states \\"its lyrical narrative voice and comforting message are a 'honeyed delight.'<br /><br />She tells of her experience when visiting a bee hive and watching as the beekeeper lifted the lid off the hive.  It was a heady and courageous business.  A purring noise, low and vibrating, a sound you could almost mistake for a cat, precedes the swarm and the sight was a spectacle.  They disappeared as mysteriously as they had appeared, an invasion and retreat.<br /><br />This is a story of a young girl's journey toward healing and a search for the truth.  It proves that a family can be found in that magical place where you find love.  With the 'calendar' sisters, she used stories she'd heard during her growing up years (amophous memories) of the black women of the area.  August was given the wisdom, compassion and strength of one she would have wanted to find if 'I'd been in Lily's complicated situation.'<br /><br />This is a story of redemption that promises to fill some of the holes life has gouged out of us.  It creates a rich, maternal haven in a harsh world. She remembers the early sisters in the South as a world of paradoxes.  This novel began as a short story published in the literary journal, 'Nimrod,' which she read at the National Arts Club in New  York.  The whole idea for the novel, which took three years to develop, was the comment her husband made about waking up to find bees flying around the room at her parents' home, the unearthly sound vibrating off the walls.<br /><br />Previously, she'd written two memoirs, THE DANCE OF THE DISSIDENT DAUGHTER and WHERE THE HEART WAITS, based on her own life as narratives.  She felt that writing memoirs is a work of wholeness.  She won a Katherine Anne Porter Award, among others.  Two of ther fiction stories were selected as 'notable' in a collection called BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES.  Her new novel is THE MERMAID CHAIR, to be released in April, 2005.<br /><br />Throughout this book she uses quotes from some of the reference books at the beginning of each chapter.  The one I liked best was on Chapter 13.  These included MEN AND INSECTS (2), EXPLORING THE WORLD OF SOCIAL INSECTS (1), THE HONEY BEES (2), THE DANCING BEES (1) and THE QUEEN MUST DIE: AND OTHER AFFAIRS OF BEES AND MEN (5).

With this book, I have found another who spent the night in the Clinton White House.  Previously, I reviewed YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR NEXT ONE by Mike Medavoy, a movie producer, who with his wife Irene also had that honor.  Basking in the success of his third book, STRESS, DIET AND YOUR HEART, reaching #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.  And yet he felt unsatisfied, discontented and lonely.  So much for success!    At the age of nineteen, he was clinically depressed and used his research into diet and heart disease to pull himself out the depths of despair.  He met his sister's yoga teacher at a time when he needed direction and heard him proclaim, \\"Nothing can bring lasting peace, but you have it already if you just stop disturbing it.  It is there always.\\"  So he decided he had nothing to lose and studied with this spiritual teacher, Sri Swami S., who also influenced him to switch to a vegetarian diet.  \\"Discovering truth was one thing.  Understanding it and integrating it into my life was another.\\"    In 1984, twelve years later, he founded the Preventive Medicine Research Institute and was co-founder of the Center for Integrative Medicine in San Francisco (with Dr. Haile T. Debar and Lee Goldman, M.D., at the University of California School of Medicine).  Dr. Dean Ornish was the first to prove the reversal of heart disease by changing lifestyles.    In this book, he promotes the theory that love and intimacy are powerful healing forces.  Andrew Weil, author of SPONTANEOUS HEALING, describes this research effort as \\"enhancing wellness by attending to the nourishment of our real hearts.\\"  John Gray declares in glowing terms that Dean Ornish demonstrates the power of intimacy in healing.  \\"Relationships bring freedom and joy\\": I think he's proven that in his own books.    Loneliness and isolation, aleination and depression increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, infectious diseases, even arthritis and ulcers.  He feels that the real epidemic in today's culture is this emotional and spiritual 'heart' disease.    Love and intimacy are at a root of what makes us sick and what makes us well, what causes sadness and brings happiness, what makes us suffer and also leads to healing.    There is a time and place for drugs and surgery.  Even when these are necessary, they are just the beginning.  He counsels that we can then ask, \\"What can be learned from this experience?  How did you get in this position?  What can you do to help keep it from happening again?\\"    That which seems the most soft -- love, intimacy, and meaning -- is, in reality, the most powerful.  He says that this part of his work is the least well understood, and perhaps the most important.      Emotional and spiritual heart disease is caused by the breakdown of social structures which used to provide us with a sense of connection and community.  These profound feelings which increase our health problems are the \\"root of the illness, cynicism, and violence in our society.\\"    Suffering of any kind can be a doorway for opening our hearts in ways that might not otherwise have occurred.  I call this the demise of a caring family.  A connection with family can influence your total health.    Many people nowadays walk around in varying degrees of chronic emotional pain.  Perception is reality.  I myself have suffered greatly from a chronic nerve pain since 1994.  Being alone and feeling unloved (losing the one you do love) can bring on debilitating physical pain in many forms.    It has been proven that psychosocial intervention can significantly reduce anxiety, depression and pain.  Having someone even just to talk with and hug reduces the pressure and could possibly prolong your life in addition to conventional medical care.  Hostility, manifested by loneliness and isolation, caused by repressed anger, can lead to premature disease and death.    Lack of loving relationships compromise the immune system, causing those lacking social ties to be more proneto debilitating illnesses.  Diversity of relationships was of major importance.    Believing that the world is a dangerous place helps to make it so in a self-fulfilling prophecy.  How we perceive relationships can affect our health and our survival.  How we view ourselves in relation to others is important, as we all have different life experiences based on our level of mistrust and suspicion.    There is a strong tendency toward selfishness, isolation and individualism in our society.  We need to learn how to manage anxiety and deal with anger.  The indivicualist orientation is a part of this country because of the sense of ego in American society.  As the Constitution begins, \\"We the people...\\"    A romantic relationship is only one arena for commitment which deepens over time.  You may commit to your child, job, friends, country -- to anything.  We define ourselves by our commitments.  And, we all need somebody to love.  There are only four questions of value in life:  What is sacred?  Of what is the spirit made?  What is worth living for?  What is worth dying for?  The answer to each is the same.  Only love. (Mtn.Wings)    A Public televison series (PPS) was based on this book, and his audio book SIMPLE CHOICES, POWERFUL CHANGES is from the t.v. broadcasts with a Question & Answer session for each program.  His latest book is about being overweight and how to go about losing some of those obnoxious pounds by eating properly and exercise -- something sadly lacking in today's obese people.	2004-11-22

Because of this book, I was looking forward to the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation in which Peter Fonda was featured.  I don't know whether it was the character he was playing, or if he is sick, but it was difficult to watch.  Maybe he thinks that's how a college professor acts.  I was married to one and have two sons, one with a PhD, who are college teachers, and none were as stiff as he appeared.  It must have been the character, or directing, as he won an award for \\"Ulee's Gold.'    He is best known for the movie, 'Easy Rider,' which he co-wrote with Dennis Hopper in the 1960s.  I was shocked to see the year he was born which means we were growing up at the same time, in the most disparate ways life could be.  Here I was in this backward town of Knoxville, TN, enjoying a short singing career on radio, t.v. local talent shows, and stage -- as innocent as a baby.    There he was pretending to be James Dean on a motorcycle (he was the 'wild thing') hobnobbing with Marlon Brando in Rome (on location?), 'hanging out' with Salvador Dali, taking drugs with the British singing group, the Beatles, and suffering through the suicides of his friend, Bridget Hayward (after whom he named his daughter, the actress) and his best friend, Stormy.      He speaks freely of his drug use as if it were the thing to do -- no apologies -- as he watched others \\"fall into the abyss of abuse\\" and be pushed \\"over the edge,\\" explaining that he survived because he didn't have an 'addictive personality.'    In this fascinating memoir, he relates how he'd promised his sister, Jane, that he'd never tell of their growing-up escapades and coming of age exploits (also of their living through child abuse, as did so many of the children of movie stars of that time, example MOMMIE DEAREST about Joan Crawford and the pain of Bing Crosby's older sons as they lived with a harsh, cold father.)  Now, Dean Martin's daughter is claiming a similar life in her new book.    Thus, the title 'Don't tell Dad.'I can just hear them telling each other that during their teen years.  There were several suicides in his life, the hardest to bear was that of his mother.  He tells how the family tried to hide it as if it were a 'taint' on them.      His mother, Frances Seymour, had been born in Ontario, Canada.  He traces his heritage on her side of the family to Richard Seymour who settled in this country in 1639 and his link to Lady Jane Seymour, King Henry VIII's third wife.  Could be that is where his sister Jane got her name, as her nickname was Lady Jane.  Frances had been married to George Brokaw (who'd just divorced Clare Booth Luce), an alcoholic from Old Money and into sailing when he died.  Thus, a link in ancestry with Tom Brokaw on NBC.  Her father, Eugene Ford Seymour, a superior court judge, had also been an alcoholic.  Guess he could say that his tendency to try drugs was in the genes.    His father, Henry Fonda, has a heritage going back to 13th century Italy, then 200 years in the Netherlands before leaving Amsterdam for America in 1651.  Peter's parents had met on a luxury liner bound for England, she on vacation while he was on his way to a movie set and were married in 1939, after which he had a wartime stint in the Pacific in 1943.    \\"Few things have been perfect in my life, but there is no way I'd desire to 'do it over.'  I would prefer to never again think of the dark parts of my past.\\"  Wouldn't we all!    Peter was born in New York City but lived with his dad in Brentwood (L. A.) in a mansion near his grandmother's house.  His step-grandfather was Oscar Hammerstein.  There are some similarities between his life in California and that of Chuck Southcott (he's six months younger than Peter), who is my soul and inspiration on the radio.  Just this afternoon, he played Michael Feinstein's version of WISH YOU WERE HERE.  Thanks, Chuck!    The photo section is fantastic, full of what I call the 'beautiful people.'  Peter was a cute little boy and looked likemy youngest son, Justin (who also played soccer as a youth).  I was pleased to learn that he named his son Justin.   Though I've never known him, there is that connection.    Though he lived the 'high life' to which he was born and, my goodness, he led an interesting life and learned his acting in New York.  He didn't just 'follow in his father's footsteps.'  He made some of his own in many films including 'The Rounders,' 'Race With the Devil,' 'The Wild Angels,' 'Hawkens Breed,' 'Futureworld,' 'Blue Water Hunters,' and 'Tammy and the Doctor'(with Sandra Dee).    In the end, he learned that \\"it is all about forgiveness and, most importantly, I have learned to forgive myself.\\"  That makes him a big man.  He was able to forgive all those who hurt him 'deep in his heart,' he said.  That's something I cannot do.    I hope he will forgive me for the criticism at the beginning of this review.  What do I know about acting anyway?  At a recent one-man performance about Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth in a tiny \\"box\\" theater, the actor said after the play, \\"I enjoyed playing off you.\\"  I'd emphathized with both roles throughout his credible acting and kept my eyes on him.  I've seen many plays and an enormous number of movies, but I have never acted.    His ending leaves the reader feeling that Jane was the 'chip off the old block' with her stern reprimands and orders to her younger brother, even as adults, and her entreaty, \\"Don't Tell Dad.\\"    I do believe he had a love affair with the motorcycle.  In the photo on the back jacket cover, he could be Evil Kenevil.  He was a handsome lad.  His mother, had she survived, would be so proud of her son and his achievements.	2004-11-22

In ANY WOMAN'S BLUES, you can learn (if you pay attention) the 'Rules of Love,' the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the 'Key to Serenity,' typical of the high-life of the nineties.  I'm glad mine wasn't played out on that level.    Willie Dixon wrote, \\"the blues ain't nothing but the facts of life.\\"  She quotes a lot of old 'blues' lyrics from the twenties and even 'Down in the Dumps' from 1958.  We all have moods intermittently.  She felt that every character in every book is a part of that mysterious mosaic we call our 'self.'  For the most part, I believe this, too, but usually associate it with first novels.    In 1973, Erica Jong wrote her debut novel, FEAR OF FLYING, in which she taught us how to fly -- her way.   Seventeen years later, here she comes again but this time, she shows us how to land.    In between, she had five poetry books and five other novels published.  In them, she dared to explore realms which other writers were afraid to explore.  She's had a following of devoted readers who appreciate her wit, insights, and ability to tackle important and difficult subjects such as divorce, adultery, and miracles.  Serenissina (about Venice) is one of her best novels, in my opinion.  Some of the poetry, I found a little hard to understand, as in WITCHES.    To say she is a complicated writer, praised by John Updike, Margaret Atwood, Henry Miller, and other notables is putting it mildly.  If you've read Updike, consider a female verison on similar themes.  Later, she wrote about Henry Miller in THE DEVIL AT LARGE, and INVENTING MEMORY about Mothers and Daughters.    In this one, she goes from highs to lows emotionally and almost loses her grip on sanity and self-destruct on alcohol and co- dependency.  I was codependent once but not in the way her artist/mother is.  Not on a younger lover, but on my youngest son who was my 'whole life,'  You can never put that burden on another person; then when they are no longer there, you feel you can't survive alone.  But you can!    The young stud Donezal leaves her feeling worthless, betrayed and empty.  That's the folly of loving a younger man.  This woman has lived the high life (as opposed to my meager existence in a small Southern town) from glittering parties in East Village nightclubs with celebrities to unusual and the bizarre.  Guess that's what drinking people do when drugs are involved.    This book is about obsession, as in my previous review by the Canadian writer.  She, too, daubled in poetry.  I've never had an obsession per se, though I have had 'attachments.'  My husband had a different kind of obsession.  As far as I know, any obsession is a form of illness.    She learns, however, that the secret of happiness was not to be found in the illusion of 'the perfect man' but rather in finding strength within one's self.  Its theme surrounding the artist's search for a way out of addictive love and toward self-love is characteristic of this writer, I've found.      Most writers use this means of creative expression to resolve conflicts at the particular time through which daily life takes him or her.  Since this volume of smush (my word), she's written a mid-life \\"memoir\\" and other involved stories.    This tale has no end.  Like Chinese boxes within boxes, like Russian dolls within dolls, we go on revealing our hearts in the hope they may never stop beating.  If you want a mantra, repeat \\"thank you\\" 104 times (which she does) to feel more grateful, more and more alive.  Who else would have thought of doing that?  It's certainly original.	2004-11-17

You must first be who you really are; then, do what you need to do -- in order to have what you want.  Sounds good, takes work and effort.    Using six diverse principles: gratitude, harmony, order, simplicity, joy, and beauty (not in this order) lead the author in her profound introspection period as she searched for wholeness.    After much soul-searching in her goal for happiness plus success, she went from distress to contentment and confidence.  She'd been unhappy, frustrated, resentful, envious and angry (these are her adjectives) at the duties life had dealt her.  Thus, she set out on a life-changing metamorphosis by writing her essays (one for each day of the year) as advice to other women who may need a bit of inspiration.    After two years of working on this project, she learned that everything in her life was significant enough to be 'a continuous source of reflection, revelation and reconnection.'  She came to realize that abundance and lack are parallel realities.  In 'Simple Abundance,' you find the sacred in the ordinary and the mystical in the mundane.  At the heart of the journey is an awakening of one's Soul.    January is the month to dream, to look forward to the year ahead and the journey within;  February is heart month, searching for the grateful heart;  March shows stirrings of hope in the inner garden;  April (Dogwood month in Knoxville when beauty is abundant in all areas of the town.) is the Angel of the months when Spring flowers burst with color to grow gracefully, creatively and joyfully;  May casts a magic spell (in CAMELOT, it's the lusty month of May;  June brings forth a feast of roses and strawberries -- life's enrichments;  July has summer heat, as a melody that tune of contentment to hum as the days begin to beautifully blur;  August is too hot to be anything but receptive and reflective;  September's song  is a two-part harmony as summer's light-hearted serenade ends and a deeper melody begins -- beauty to reap the rich harvest that Love has sown.  October dresses in flame and gold like a woman afraid of growing old; who can ignore October's bright blue sky;  November's beauty radiates from within; and  December -- the month of miracles and joy as we celebrate custom and ceremony.    The author calls herself a perfectionist.  Halfway through the calendar of days is this quote: \\"Perfectionism is self-abuse of the highest order.\\"  Picture-perfect anything is image, illusion, make-believe, not the real McCoy.  There may occur 'perfect moments' but to strive for personal perfection leads to misery instead of pleasure.    I expected to find some nuggets of wisdom in her short November inspiration called \\"Amazing Grace.'  I chose it because I've never liked the song with that title and hoped this might change my mind.  It didn't.  What she deems 'grace' in a daily occurrence, I consider 'good luck.'    A house is who you are, not who you ought to be.  She admonishes, \\"Like it or not, the personalities of our homes are accurate barometers which reflect through our surroundings where we have been, what's going on in our lives now, and who we are -- though not necessarily where we're going.\\"  We express our Real selves through the way we care for and decorate our homes, which reflect our personalities.    Consider the role color plays in your life.  I heard a comment on radio (perhaps one of Wink Martindale's witty sayings); \\"If everyone in the world dressed in gray, this would be a dreary place.\\"  I am pleased to read that gray is one of the classic colors for fashion.  The others I have already tried in different phases of my life, but now I enjoy the silver-gray to match my hair which grabs people's attention, as it is in a transition period just as I am.  I notice that others are wearing more gray now, and letting their hair color go 'natural.'  It is better to dress in colors and styles which please you, then you are projecting a vision of your authentic self.In the October 1925 issue of 'Good Housekeeping,' the author found a novel remedy for weariness called 'The Poetry Cure.'  Poetry connects you to your inner self.  Longfellow has been my favorite poet ever since my d.j. at a growing-time of my life used it as his sign-off:  \\"And the Night shall be filled with Music....\\"  I went through a poetry stage, but only reading and enjoying, never able to write it.  I have a friend named Jack who's written a couple of poems calling me his \\"lady.\\"  Only in his imagination!  But he's learned to live with that.    For me, music is a much better way to express feelings -- not the bells, drums and rattles a shaman uses for medical therapy, but beautiful instrumentals and 'pop' voices like Michael Feinstein, Eddie Fisher, and Linda Ronstadt.      Recently I had a rather long wait in a doctor's office and the \\"relaxing\\" video playing continuously (over and over) for almost two hours had the opposite effect for me.  After a while, I made the comment \\"that thing is giving me a headache; if I had to listen to that sound on a daily basis, I'd go crazy.\\"  It was not music, not relaxing, just a nuisance I didn't want in my life.  Another person in the waiting room confessed it was giving him a headache, too.  So much for the power of persuasion.  I was wishing for Music Of Your Life to perk me up, as my local radio has inserted Christmas music much too early.  When they go 'all Christmas,' I'll have to find another 'favorite' station.  It makes me wish for three years ago at this time when I had both Westwood One, Adult Standards format, and Music Of Your Life to brighten my world.    This daybook can brighten your life.  Four years ago, reading the daily passage as a ritual helped me through a very difficult crisis in my life.  It can do the same for you.  This book is a treasure; I'm glad I found this beautifully bound hardback at a local church bazaar.  The author has gone on to write four others in this vein, and A MAN'S JOURNEY (which I've already reviewed).	2004-11-14

Edmund Burke wrote, \\"Nothing tends so much to the corruption of science than to suffer it to stagnate; these waters must be troubled, before they can exert their virtues\\" at the beginning of this book.  In the book, WHY ENGLAND SLEPT, Churchill was quoted when describing the 1930s as the \\"years the locusts have eaten.\\"  This book explains in detail what he meant.  Afterwards, in total chaos and bewilderment, as to 'what hit me'    In the Bible (book of Exodus) are stories about plagues of locusts.  But I had no idea of the enormity of this problem in U. S. history.  Jeffrey Lockwood uses this common insect to tell the story of a nation in transition from a most unique perspective, seen as a possible divine punishment.  In 1876, Congress declared the locust as 'the single greatest impediment to the settlement of this country.'    Swarms of this hungry insect swept across from Texas to the Dakotas, Iowa to California, devastating farms and turned noon 'into dusk', so vast and aggressive were they in destroying crops.  The farmers were thought to be morally weak to have such havoc attack their lands, causing a national crisis.    Religion did indeed play an important part in trying to deal with the 'sixth plague'; the Bible provided a source of insight into this problem but was ambiguous.  In ancient times, starlings appeared to devour these pests in Asia Minor. Learning this pleased me as the newcomers to Knoxville (downtown dwellers) started a campaign this summer to get rid of starlings in the decorative, small park.  They inserted a large, artificial owl in a tree (hid from view) with terrible screeches to scare away all birds in the area.  My friendly blue jays flew away home, returned to their natural habitat.    Locust swarms tend to move around.  About every seven years, we hear their loud sounds, mating calls?  One insect can leave behind 99 eggs.  There have been legal controversies concerning these (are they creatures of God or the devil?) locust plagues andreligious disagreements.    They appear as a whirling, glittering eerie cloud which leaves a desolate wilderness behind consuming all vegetation, kinda like a dust storm in a swarm strong enough to rustle the cornstalks they consume and fast enough to lift a yellow-brown cloud of soil.  In the introduction, he tells of an actual attack by locusts on a farm in Nebraska in 1875, which left total devastation.  When a locust infestation became a national crisis, a commission's findings started the field of entomology, launching 'a golden era of discovery.'    Jeffrey Lockwood wrote an earlier 'bug' book, GRASSHOPPER DREAMING.  In this volume, he seems to see the locust and grasshopper as the same menace.  Because of his work with the Rocky Mountain locust which had simply 'vanished' and he set out to discover why, he wrote for 'American Entomologist' about the locusts' demise.  It was used in 'Orion,' 'Wild Earth,' and 'High Country News' earning the 2002 John Burroughs Award.    After further research, it turned into a book-length project.  He was swamped with source material, historical insights, biographies, political debates, religious significance, even insect remains and information about glaciers.  Many 'experts' from a dozen states and Canada shared their expertise with him.  He has another book called PRAIRIE SOUL about people, environment, and religion in the form of essays.    There are still yearly 'locust plagues' in Africa with red species who can destroy a whole year's work in a matter of minutes. Theirs prefer palm and olive trees, basil, grape leaves, and grass. In the lower part of Israel, near Egypt and Jordon, some workers consider these insects a 'delicacy.' They are warned to grill them until they turn yellow, turning them to cook well done.   Why didn't the folks out West try that? Maybe Jeffrey Lockwood knows, but forgot to inform us.	2004-11-11

Usually, there is an explanation for the disappearance of a ships's crew, either from mutiny or piracy; on occasion, crews were kidnapped and forced to work on other ships as slaves.  However, none of these are appropriate for the fate of those aboard the MARY CELESTE prior to December 4, 1872.      Likened to the doomed skeletal ship in the classic poetic verse of Samuel Taylor Colelridge, \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,' this abandoned vessel appeared 'out of nowhere' 400 miles from the coast of Portugal on that date, to go down in infamy as being a 'ghost ship.'  Other nautical anomalies included the FLYING DUTCHMAN, apparition off Africa's Cape of Good Hope in the 1580s, a legend which baffled historians, and Edgar Allan Poe's \\"Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym', both with supernatural connotations.    One hundred thirty years after the sailing, this author found his 'theme' as he read old letters preserved in the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MASS.  He'd visited six or more states doing his research in museums, libraries, newspapers, the National Archives, even Nova Scotia.    The MARY CELESTE was a small merchant ship in the Fall of 1872 and had only four seamen, first and second mates, cook, and the Captain (also his wife and daughter) on board.  The son, Arthur, was left behind in school.  Seems like a small crew but turned out to be rather large to all fit in a small lifeboat -- if Mr. Hicks' theory is true.    Built by Joshua Dewis as AMAZON, the name was later changed to the MARY CELESTE.  Robert McLellan was Amazon's first captain.  Gilman C. Parker was the final captain of the Mary Celeste.  When discovered floating adrift, there was no trace of a struggle, and yet the decorative sword in the captain's cabin had a reddish stain on its blade.  Strange.      The last entry in the left-behind logbook was made ten days before and placed the ship more than 300 miles west of the spot in the North Atlantic where seaman John Johnson on board the Nova Scotia freighter, DEI GRATIA, discovered an empty vessel, bobbling erratically in the ocean.  The crew had vanished without a clue as to the tragedy onboard, a puzzle as to how it could have traveled so far on its own.    Captain Benjamin Spooner Briggs, was the second of four sons and two daughters born to Nathan, patriarch of a notorious seafaring family, and Sophia Cobb Briggs.  Others of the sons had suffered similar fates in their ocean voyages.  Born in 1835, he would have been 37 years old at the time of his disappearance and the father of two children, one on board with her mother, Sarah Elizabeth.  Little Sophia Matilda, 2 years old, named after her grandmother, Sophia Cobb, was lost.  The form of a sleeping child was imprinted in the wet mattress of one bunk.    No one could figure where the crew had gone, or why.  It's as if they had been swallowed by Jonah's Whale.  Letters home showed Briggs' despair with the profession his family had fostered, and he longed to give  up sailing.  Personal belongings (even pipes) were left behind like perhaps they'd decided to explore an island or go for a swim.  They clearly expected to come back!    Their foul-weather gear which would have been worn during a storm was still there, and other peculiar things, such as the opened barrels of alcohol.  Could the crew have gotten drunk and killed the family?  Hardly.  Thus, a mystery was born.  Some said that there was an abandoned cat on board.  Lord, have mercy.  There was evidence that 450 gallons (nine barrels) of alcohol had burst open and flooded the ships's bilge.  This is surmised to be a type of combustible industrial chemical for use as fuel or solvents or methanol, for medical uses.  It's 94% pure leads to that conclusion (a whisky 90% has only 45% alcohol by volume).  Such a thing would have caused serious physiological effects on the crew: light-headedness, nausea, hallucinations, even strong odors like ammonia to affect the senses.    This 'mystery' evokes the sailors' most primordial fears of the sea, of vanishing 'without a trace' beneath the turbulent waves.  The old proverb that the sea never gives up its secrets may be proven wrong with this book.  They left New York sailing for Italy to deliver this load of alcohol.  This was a small cargo ship (see the good likeness on the cover of the book), owned by a major N. Y. shipping company, just another anonymous brigantine which became sensationalized by newspapers in America and Europe in 'tabloid-fashion.'    It was a 3,000 mile trek from N. Y. Harbor off Staten Island to Europe.  Bad weather, storms and savage gales, with winds of 40 mph near the Azores, prevailed that November, especially during the two weeks Mary Celeste was at sea.  When found, all the hatches, skylight, etc. had been left open, a ship left to 'air out.'  The rope they used as a towline had broken, leaving the nine adults and one child in a 20-foot lifeboat at the mercy of God and the elements.  Theory is that the old rope \\"snapped\\" during a fierce storm all described in 'Without A Soul\\" in this book.  It began its bizarre journey into infamy and the occult on a desolate beach in Nova Scotia more than 140 years ago.    Arthur Conan Doyle, who later penned the Sherlock Holmes stories, wrote about the Mary Celeste riddle (J. Habakuk Jephson) in such detail (he even mentioned the untouched lifeboats and a spool of thread balanced on a table -- pure fiction) that it sparked investigations by the U.S. and British governments.    Other books have been written about this subject: THE SAGA OF THE MARY CELESTE: AN ILL-FATED MYSTERY SHIP by Stanley T. Spicer, THE SHADOW OF THE MARY CELESTE by Richard Rees, and LOST AT SEA by A. A. Hoehling, all in the 1990s.  Numerous magazine articles in the eighties and other treaties back to the fifties.  Books published in the 1920s and 1940s also proliferated and expanded on the mystery, odyssey, hoax, shadow, ad infinitum.      This author recommends, as valuable resources, these three:  MARY CELESTE, written by an executive of the ship's insurance company in 1942, and MYSTERY SHIP -- both contain accounts from sources which no longer exist, he says.  Also, IN THE WAKE OF THE MARY CELESTE (1944) by James Franklin Briggs, which was published by the Old Dartsmouth Historical Society; it is packed with many 'gems' otherwise unpublished.  He says that 90% of newspaper accounts of this mystery are good only for documenting the growth of a 'legend' -- most of them inaccurate.    Oliver Cobb, cousin of the captain (younger by 32 years), seemed obsessed and haunted by what had happened so that he wrote a 'memoir' of this doomed family which had a curse on it.  ROSE COTTAGE is his account as he was there when the last of these seafaring bothers disappeared.  Could be, they all hated the sea.    Clive Cussler speculated on the Mary Celeste in THE SEA HUNTERS (1996) and THE SEA HUNTERS II (2002).  His crew from the National Underwater and Marine Agency located the final resing place (the wreck) off a coral reef in Haiti (where voodoo is the dominant religion) in 2001.    Brian Hicks is a reporter for THE POST and COURIER in Charleston, SC.  He researched and co-authored a book about the Confederate submarine, RAISING THE HUNTLEY.  Could this finally be the 'truth' or just another (albeit well documented) 'theory'?  How will we ever know?	2004-11-09

The book itself is not new, but it was new to me -- just found it.  And to say that he had to have friends in high places to get it published is putting it mildly.    It's not like he'd never been 'published' before.  Twelve of these little anecedotes previously appeared (at intervals, I'm sure) in THE NEW YORKER Magazine.  Of the 23 short 'bursts of at-random thinking', the piece in which he eschews 'celebrity', \\"The Nature of Matter and Its Antecedents,\\" appeared in The New York Times Magazine.  My goodness, he even had a crazy thing in the op-ed section of that same paper entitled 'Mars Probe Finds Kitten.'    This is a short book and it takes very little time to get all the way through to the end.  The title tells it all, it's \\"pure drivel.\\"  After being off the screen for three years, busy in New York on other projects like 'several' plays, a 'handful' of sketches, two screenplays, and these thoughts of his.  He calls it 'intense retrospection' as he sat in his rose garden with his computer enjoying the feel and pleasure of watching his fingers on the keys.  It didn't matter whether everything came out as typo-gibberish or actual words -- all the same to him.  He had editors.  To him, he was being creative, reading a story in each rose.  I'd say he was intensely depressed.    The good thing about writing is the knowledge of being able to change, fiddle with, re-think, and deny words.  Who said that a picture is worth a thousand words?  He says, \\"painters don't have that luxury.\\"  Actually, compiling these short vignettes was for material matters since he had a new wife and two young children at the time -- I'd say he needed money to pay his philosopher/lawyer.    He thinks 'writing is easy,' tell that to a real writer.  One of my favorites has decided to take a year off from the grind and pressure in the publishing world (with all their deadlines and demands for more) to be with his young family and recoup.  No. it's not 'writers' block,' just a respite and a determination to be with those he loves for the holidays this year.  More power to him!    For Steve Martin, it turned into three years before he got his creative juices going again.  He'd had successes in several films; my favorite was THREE AMIGOS! and PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES.  I will take this opportunity to apologize for the bad review I gave of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN almost a year ago!  I didn't know the pressure he'd been under.  I'm sorry, Steve.  It wasn't you -- it was the movie which I felt wasn't funny.      He wrote scripts for some of the movies he appeared in, like the famous BOWFINGER'S BIG THING with Eddie Murphy.  He was in David Mamet's film THE SPANISH PRISONER and received a jacket blurb as a result.  He certainly has friends with a strange sense of humor, like Mr. Mamet and Victoria Dailey.  These are certainly unusual people.    He calls writer's block a 'myth.'  Tell that to a real writer.  I know one who moved to Middle Tennessee from Boston, Mass. after a successful career with two or three series (Fletch, Flynn, etc), write half a dozen at the most, and his life changed drastically.  Now, if that's not 'writer's block' I'd like to know what it is -- he was in limbo.      One of my favorite writers for many years who taught me a lot of different things with his varied themes, had travel books, novels, screenplays' success after success for a long time.  Then, nil -- only two or three after returning to Cape Cod from England.  If you run out of story lines, or ideas, you can always go traveling (like Bill Bryson) and write about it.    One of his New Yorker pieces was heavy with characters named Socrates and Plato, and friends -- pure drivel.  He played around with words at the end a little bit, so I think I'll call him a 'sedate' Alfie.  What's it all about?  He wrote SHOPGIRL, PICASSO...AND OTHER PLAYS, THE PLEASURE OF MY COMPANY, CRUEL SHOES, SOLD! (with Gary Colleran).  It appears he has found a new career.	2004-11-06

Apropos of this day, I decided on this book written by a former national security advisor to President Clinton (who apparently was too engrossed in his personal problems that he failed to take these possibilities seriously).  Not only were his predictions ignored, he compared the barren 'low-tech' White House Situation room as symbolic of America's position in addressing threats to our nation's security.<br /><br />\\"We are embarking on a new century with the mental furnishings of the century past,\\" he wrote five years prior to 9-11.  During the Clinton administration, they were more concerned with chemical or biological terrorism, preceding the Atlanta Olympics scare.  Mr. Lake challenged the procedures on dealing with a nationwide basis and there were no answers, only silence.<br /><br />He was in a position to see firsthand that our military and diplomatic strategy had not kept pace with our hardware.  Today, in Iraq, it is not the military who are losing their heads but innocent people who look American and are in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I've lost count of the number of be-headings there (it's got to be a 'given' thing and our government has done nothing to help our civilian casualties in the God-forsaken war.)<br /><br />In this book, written before Bush 'bushwacked' the electoral college four years ago and took the office of President away from the victor of that election, he predicts that threats to America's security are based on 'globalization' and 'to meet them we must anticipate, help to shape, a world of change.'<br /><br />As events have played out, his advice was ignored as if he were talking to the wind.  Of course, he was from the wrong political party (a year later) and I doubt that his reports were ever read by the new administration.  If they had been, we'd have been prepared as he clearly states how the Internet could be used by terrorists to hatch their plans and hide their tracks.  Which they did!  But, I'd like to know how they got into this country unobserved to perpetrate their dastardly deeds.<br /><br />He blames globalization on America's downfall.  It eroded our government's ability to act on behalf of the people as they sought to placate other countries.  He calls it the 'devil's work.'  The neutral reaction to seek refuge within the familiar and not be aware of the enemies' abilities to infiltrate is dangerous.  \\"The natural reaction is not always the smartest,\\" he writes.<br /><br />He lists his six concerns of what would culminate in an actual nightmare.  We are living that nightmare now.  How can America survive if this atrocity is allowed to continue?  Partisan politics and complacency (plus abuse by the press) has allowed this to happen -- and to continue.<br /><br />He gives some background of the Marshall Plan, United Nations, and NATO as created by America's great post-war leaders in the 1940s -- Truman, Acheson, Cordell Hull, Vandenberg and others.  They worked to lay the foundation for half a century of peace and prosperity.  At the start of the 21st century, we were reaping the returns of their farsighted vision.<br /><br />We need to strive to get that vision back.  His worries about chemical and biological weapons haven't become the worst nightmare you've ever had, but it's just around the corner. He reiterates something from the book, WHY ENGLAND SLEPT, about Churchill's description of the 1930s as the 'years the locusts have eaten.'  They've had another turn!<br /><br />Decades after Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy planted seeds of a nuclear test-ban treaty, President Bill Clinton was the first world leader to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, which was supposed to be a historic milestone toward reducing nuclear threat and building a better safer world.  That treaty wasn't worth the paper on which it was printed.  It's one thing to sign a bill or 'treaty' and another to act on it.  Partisanship got in the way.<br /><br />McCarthyism was more evil than thepre 9-11 days but it was part of a debate about an issue of great consequence -- how to pursue a Cold War in which our very existence was at stake.  Politics has become an end in itself.  Now, the only test of victory is whether an adversary's moral standing is thoroughly shredded and destroyed -- mostly on the national level.<br /><br />Knoxville's mayoral race was exactly the opposite with courtesy and kindness exemplary action by the winner over an unprepared, but 'nice', female opponent who didn't know what hit her.

In the latest issue of the journal, 'Nature,' there is an account of a fossilized \\"human\\" on an island near Java. Only three feet tall with a grapefruit-sized brain which is 2/3 smaller than a human brain leads me to conclude it was a chimpanzee instead of an adult dwarf, as they claim.  The description of the teeth which survived for 18,000 years in a limestone cave surrounded by coffee farms confirm this.    It took research teams forty years to find this skeleton (actually not complete as the hands and feet are missing).  It was uncovered thirteen months ago by teams from Australia and Indonesia, and the article leads one to believe this discovery will 'rewrite evolution,' according to a spokesman for London's Natural History Museum.  From this group of bones, the paleontologists could determine there was hardly any chin or browline.  Now, we know that our ancestors had prominent brows.  If, in future excavations, they find claws, we'll know it was a monkey as other parts signify ape-like features.    This is either a bogus report of they more than likely found a baby orangutan.  This article claims we had a \\"real-life Middle Earth\\" as in 'Lord of The Rings' in which the dragons were simply giant lizards and elephants as small as ponies.  Who are they putting on?  I need more proof before I will accept this as truth.    This book is about Clarence Darrow's next case after he defended Thomas Scopes in Dayton, TN, called the Monkey Trial.  After suffering through the indignity of a Tennessee non-air conditioned courtroom in our TN withering heat and humidity, and losing the case by a bare margin (though he did lose), a nominal fine which humiliated those opposed to his theatrics in the courtroom drama.  Since  he was defending the young teacher who chose to instruct his students about the scientific evolution, he became an icon for justice for the 'under dog.'      I don't agree that the outcome was a triumph or \\"transcended race in the name of justice\\"; he erroneously felt that courts and the law could tame injustice.  His childhood hero had been John Brown, the abolitionist who led the attack at Harper's Ferry, West VA.  He thrived on taking controversial cases, and advocated for justice and the rights of the downtrodden.    Though he was noted for his eloquence, humor and satire (all put to good use in his defense tactics in the Scopes trial), he couldn't distinguish between two dark complexioned Jewish attorneys and \\"colored people\\" and lacked tact with remarks to Walter White, the assistant secretary of the N. Y. City NAACP.  Being from the Mid-West (born in Iowa), he knew nothing about racism, made blunders due to his illlusory misconceptions and myths based on race.    In 1925, there were twelve million blacks living in Detroit and one Dr. Sweet put them all in jeopardy by exerting his \\"right\\" to live in a white neighborhood.  According to this author, a white former teacher at the University of Michigan, Phyllis Vine, this decade (1920s) was the only time in American history our nation came close to an outright race war.  I disagree.    She talks about Jim Crow, lynchings by the KKK, kangaroo courts, desecration of the American Dream, and so-called tolerance of racial violence in the U. S.  A death incurred during the commotion of Dr. Sweet's 'thumbing his nose' at American society; as a result, he and ten others were on trial in Detroit for murder.    Darrow was old (69 yrs.) by then and tired, thoroughly exhausted by the trial in Tennessee (prefacing this case), but was enticed into taking this case for the notoriety.  He and I have one thing in common, being against the death penalty.  He had the ability to influence juries to decide on prison sentences instead of the electric chair.  He'd just lost the TN Monkey case but, perhaps as a consequence of his courtroom tactics had caused the death of William Jennings Bryan, his opponent.    When finally persuaded by the NAACP to take this case, he'd decided on 'self-defense' as the cause of the shooting to death one of the rioters.  He and his TN co-defense counsel, an attorney from New York, obtained the services of other white lawyers seeking national press coverage.  The whole case was on the premise, the \\"old principle of a man's right to protect his home as his castle\\" and the failure to prove a \\"conspiracy to commit murder.\\"    The Epilogue was the most interesting part of this book, to see how this case brought prestige to some of the principals (the judge was appointed Governor of the Phillippines, a U. S. attorney General, and on the United States Supreme Court by FDR) and disgrace to others (Dr. Sweet ended up as a suicide after failures on all sides of his personal life after this incident).    James Johnson, executive secretary of the N.Y. NAACP, came to Fisk University (where my son Zachary taught English for five years) to teach and died in a car/train collision.  While in TN, he wrote five books which were published, incuding an auto-biography, ALONG THIS WAY.    Darrow's co-counsel went on to defend Sacco and Vanzetti, who were executed for murder, based on questionable evidence, and assisted in the famous Scottsboro trial of nine black Southern men who raped two women on a train.    Detroit was declared the 'wickedest city in U.S.' and that house on Garland Avenue where this murder was perpetrated is now on the National Register of Historic Places.  That should please Jack Neely.  With his aid, we have so many old dilapidated downtown structures with those markers, and I am wondering what the signifigance of all this nonsense will entail.  Just because something ununusal or notorious happened at that spot does not make it 'historic.'  Tell that to the preservationists.  We need progress in this town and this nation, not living in the past.	2004-10-29

In the meantime, he ran for state legislator and lost.  His sweetheart died in 1835, and he had a nervous breakdown the next year.

In 1860 Abe Lincoln was elected president of the United States.  The rest is history.\\" (Mtn. Wings, 10-26-2004)    This is a most interesting and researched history of a group of unsung United States' heroes.  Called the 'forgotten heroes' because the government refused benefits, recognition, parades, medical and educational aid, simply because they were civilian seamen.  Though they have been around since Revolutionary War days (they actually formed the first Navy of U.S. in colonial times when more seamen died during that war than did the soldiers of George Washington's Continental Army.), they received no compensation and had duties which put them in peril.  During WWII, their casualties were so high it was kept a secret.    And yet, the members of the U.S. Merchant Marines, civilian 'fighters', they were called, were vital to the Allies' victory.  Using diaries, interviews with surviving 'veterans.' government records, and historical documents, they are shown to have performed innumerable 'feats of extraordinary bravery' as they delivered food, fuel, even the troops which were deployed -- every essential needed in wartime to assist in our victory.  Many perished at Pearl Harbor where their transport ship was the first to be torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.    They even performed rescues of British Royal Air force fliers from life rafts in the Mediterranean during WWII.  The SS Martin Van Buren ship was torpedoed off the coast of Nova Scotia.  There is an account of Merchant Marines actually freezing to death.  They fought along with military servicemen over a period of more than 200years.  Their motto has always been \\"Deeds, Not Words.\\"    The were called the lifeline of the Allied Forces and were sent into war zones to transport troops, bombs, tanks, planes and their fuel, torpedoes, munitions, and other dangerous war material.  The photo section displays these activities.  In 1936, the government declared the Merchant Marine ships as auxiliary military vessels.  They suffered more deaths per capita in WWII than any of the American armed forces.    Because of their cargo of delivering war supplies to our overseas troops and transporting the soldiers into battle zones, the Merchant Marine ships were targets of German U-boats and Japanese kamikaze planes.  Their petroleum tankers were blown up, and the merchant ships carrying ammunition which were torpedoed had explosions so immense that no traces of the vessels or their crews were ever found.    In 1984, Michael Pare starred in THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT which depicted this very thing.  In it, he looked like my high school sweetheart, Jim Darling.  Since then, he has made more than forty films.  For me, though, this was his best!    Written by the son of Frank Herbert, whose novels about DUNE influenced my son Zach to write science fiction, he is aided in this research by a Merchant Marine vet, Dean E. Beaumont of Arizona.  They'd met by chance on the ocean liner, Queen Elizabeth II and he'd regaled Brian with incredible stories of the Merchant Marine exploits and bravery under fire.  Stanley Hildbreth of Oregon was injured on a Liberty ship (photos and drawings of which are included in the photo section), in the invasion of Sicily, told how he went on to take part in the Normandy invasion directly from the hospital.  \\"I didn't want to miss the big one,\\" he'd said.    It was my good fortune to know an actual Merchant Marine who told fascinating accounts of all the places he'd been and things he'd seen, leaving out the dangers he'd been in.  Robert Wrisley of Pulaski, TN, had led (in my opinion) a glamorous career and had many memories to share.  Many times I encouraged him to write a book, but he seemed more interested in making up limericks to entertain his friends.  Perhaps his glossing over the dangers he'd endured as a young man in the name of our country was his ploy to try to forget the actual happenings.      This book is full of valiant heroic deeds and accounts of so many survivors and their families who had suffered immensely.  The losers in the war, Germany and Japan, were treated better by the American government than the men of Merchant Marines.  These vanquished foes received billions of dollars in reconstruction aid.  The Merchant Marine vets were lucky to receive cardboard medals which they had to request by mail.    They were treated similar to our Viet Nam vets (only without the monetary benefits) from a government who wanted to sweep them 'under the rug.'  There were no victory parades or \\"welcome homes\\" for them, either.  They were considered as 'disgraces' and treated as such.    Finally, forty years after the end of that war, they were awarded minimal, extremely limited benefits -- which were of little use to most of the aged survivors.  To this day, they have never received the recognition they deserve.  What is wrong with American politics?  These 'legitimate' heroes have been dealt 'a terrible wrong' by the greatest nation in the world -- their own homeland.    He's written several science fiction novels listed on New York Times Bestseller lists and received numerous literary honors including being nominated for the Nebula Award.  One of his early books, THE DRAGON IN THE SEAS, was similar to the actual happenings in the real MERCHANT MARINES.  He published some follow-ups of the DUNE series himself and co-authored MAN OF TWO WORLDS with his famous dad.  Last year, his biography of his illustrious father, DREAMER OF DUNE, was published.

From the Preface: \\"Coca-Cola began simply, as so many things do.  Filled with sparkle and 'democratically' priced, it was as American as baseball, as accessible as jazz.  It cost a nickel, which almost anyone could afford.  Before long it was everywhere.\\"    It is described as being the most ubiquitous soft drinks.  It started out as 'the drink of the people' available at places all across the land for such a long time now.  In 1886, when it was formulated in an Atlanta, GA, drugstore, it was touted as a 'brain tonic' to ease headaches of a South enduring Reconstruction after our horrific Civil War which pitted brother against brother and splitting up families in America.    It originally contained a small amount of cocaine (thus the brand name Coca-Cola), folks believed it did indeed cure what ailed them.  Everyone drank Coke from Santa Claus, soldiers 'fighting the good fight' and other 'heroes' Americans would like to emulate, even presidents of the U.S. and rock stars.    My youngest son, Justin, used to bring an assortment of 'friends' home and would invariably ask what I like to drink.  Being a teetotaler all my life, he got a kick out of their reactions when I admitted, \\"I always prefer Coke.\\"        Back then, Coca-Cola was available in almost every corner on earth.  For a long time, CC stood for free enterprise and runaway success in a 'curvaceous image.'  Just last year, a stranger told me I had the figure of a Coca-Cola bottle and I did not know what he meant.    Abroad, CC was considered a 'bottle of optimism,' the liquid a substitute for liberty.  If only things could be so simple.  It was Marilyn Monroe and the Statue of Liberty in a single package, tantalizing and familiar all at once, 'the world's best-known brand of soft drink.'    When CC was bottled and no longer available only at soda fountains, it wasn't as 'special' or considered 'essential for one's ailments,' actually wasn't good for health as first thought.  The bottlers became a power untothemselves by the 1920s, the closest thing to an equal the company could ever know.    Resentment began to penetrate the headquarters in Atlanta with a fire yet to be contained.  A lapse in judgment in the past caused a revolution within this huge empire.  They managed to re-invent the bottling business to their advantage, and yet the in-house bickering and quests for revenge almost brought our beloved Coca-Cola formula as a thing of the past and the corporation to its knees.    I was hoping for a  photo section of the Coca-Cola boy posters we now see in some movies.  The picture on the front cover is more modern but acceptable as it evokes feelings you had back then.    Using a journalist's investigative skills, Constance Hays' research and in-depth reporting for the 'New York Times', where she covered the food and beverage industry for three years, and she has been since 1986 (CC's 100th anniversary).  This book leaves little to the imagination as it is a history of this product and its impact on the society it deceived.  It went from a drink with no nutritional value into a remedy for whatever ails you, a refreshment for the body and spirit, to the world's best-known 'brand name.'  Art Buchwald said in his 'YOU CAN FOOL ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME\\" it is always the 'pause that refreshes, because every American knows that things always go better with Coke.  Now, the whole world knows.  And it is good to settle a queasy stomach.    Fooling around with formulas almost put an end to our favorite drink as the 'New Coke' lacked the kick of the original.  Thus it was transformed back into 'original formula'.  I've yet to taste the Vanilla Coke which was introduced at the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, TN. (have no desire for such a combination).  I do remember drinking a Cherry Coke as a teenager but only as a novelty.  Today we have caffeine free -- what's the purpose of that? -- and Diet Coke.  I've observed overweight people of all persuasions order Super Size meals and then insist on Diet Coke.  How dumb can you be?!  As if that drink will counteract against all the fat in the fries and burger.  I can only shake my head.  Being 5'1\\" and 97 lbs., I can enjoy the original CC I've always preferred, and I never order Super Size anything.    This book is full of nostalgia for the past when things were simple and life was good, free of strife.  Today, instead of producing a drink people love, the company is torn into factions interested in 'share prices' and 'stock market' listings.  It is now a corporate entity with ever-changing and diverse executives, no longer solely American -- trying to restore lost prestige and restore the 'luster stolen by time and circumstance.'    After all, they still have the original formula. There is a town in Peru below the Machu Picchu Inca ruins along the Andes Mountain range which is accessible only by railroad; along both sides of the tracks, Coca Cola is available -- at the pizza shop and the Deposito office which has a large Coca Cola sign hanging aabove the tin roof.  This photo in my local newspaper was taken by a Knoxville lawyer who took a group of hikers on the Inca Trail this past summer.  It is far from civilization, and yet Coca Cola is there.  Amazing!    She makes reference to an earlier history SECRET FORMULA written by Frederick Allen as a resource, providing important information as well as fascinating detail.  Let's hope THE REAL THING continues to be 'the real thing' full of pep and optimism.  Recently I learned accidentally that Warren Buffett owns Coca-Cola.  Now, I see why no one is reading this book.  He also bought the cheap manufacturing housing owned by Jim Clayton.  Soon, that man will own the whole country, production wise.	2004-10-25

Since this is one of those special over-size books, I was expecting just a beautiful keepsake, a coffee table item.  Its glossy exterior gives that impression.  And yet the in-depth stories are chock full of historical facts and modern happenings as a result of what had happened before.    The \\"Boulder\\" feature held my interest as it is steeped full of music history.  Even used a bit of political humor as background.  John Adams, the 'voice of self-control' in 1787, as the Constitution was drafted was used as an example.  His sense of happiness came from benevolelnt qualities and 'virtue'; he was concerned about the high percentage of the population back then who were succumbing to alcohol intoxication, extravagance, vice (gambling?) amd folly.  I had thought that was just the way of life those folks had to show they were 'somebody.'  He pushed for more government control to stem this corruption.  Washington and Jefferson, on the other hand, espoused the consumption of wines.  Today, drugs are considered worse than that national \\"disease.\\"    The early American humor included making fun of backwoodsmen (like Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone), the minstrel shows (black-face) and the Yankee.  In the South, we still feel that way sometimes about the latter.    In 1904, the Yankee Doodle Dandy performed by George Cohan on Broadway led the way in the first 'truly American' musical, LITTLE JOHNNY JONES.  James Cagney portrayed him in the movie named after the song.    There is interesting information about how \\"You're A Grand Old Rag\\" was changed to the classic, 'You're A Grand Old Flag.'  His inspiration was by a chance-remark he had overheard by a Civil War veteran who survived Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg.    It was Irving Berlin's 'God Bless America' which was revived (from Cohan's time when 'Over There' was used to rally the American soldiers in foreign lands) for the next war by Kate Smith.  Now, I guess it is 'God Bless the U.S.A.\\"    Oscar Hammerstein II's lyricsin SHOW BOAT and OKLAHOMA left a legacy for future musicals.  His grandfather, the first Oscar, was involved in vaudeville in New York.  Clifton Fadiman (everyone has heard of him) compared the Hammersteins in the area of theater to the Adams family (John, John Quincy, Charles, and Henry) in the political arena of American life.    Jerome Kern and Richard Rodgers' music brought the words alive with simple, democratic messages.  \\"Song is nothing more than speech in the form of lyrics; drama nothing more than a staged representation of ordinary life\\" in the musicals these greats produced.  They came out with CAROUSEL, THE KING AND I, and SOUTH PACIFIC after their previous successes.    Lerner and Loewe followed in their tracks with CAMELOT, BRIGADOON, and MY FAIR LADY while Frank Loesser scored with GUYS AND DOLLS.  Hammerstein went on his own to produce CARMEN JONES, an Americanized 'opera' version of Bizet's 'Carmen' with an all-black cast.  His protege, Stephen Sondheim, paired with Jerome Robbins for WEST SIDE STORY, an 'American' adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet.'  Sondheim wrote the music for GYPSY, FOLLIES, and A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM, one of my favorites.  In fact, I love most of these musicals as movie versions.    The sheet music brought back memories of taking mine, which I had bought in the records department of Woodruff's store (on the mezzinine), as I took part in 'Your Show Time' on t.v. 'Teen Time' on the stage of the Tennessee Theater which was also broadcast over a local radio station, and other local talent shows when I was young.  The photos of the composers was great.    The other 'feature' which spoke to me in particular was concerning the Scopes trial in 1925.  This was America's first nationally broadcast courtroom drama, not necessarily because of the subject matter but due to the lawyers involved.  Clarence Darrow beat William Jennings Bryan in this case, \\"a turning point in American history.\\"      John Scopes was the 'radical' young teacher who bucked the system to test the law in Tennessee which banned the teaching of evolution in public schools.  The fine was nominal, so in effect it was a hollow victory.  In South Carolina now, a scientiest has turned the tables (again) and causing quite a stir with a self-published book, 'Oatmeal with Raisins,' promoting the biblical interpretation of the creation of life.  Coming from Florida, he seems intent on changing life in another state to suit his beliefs, as outsiders are prone to do.  In Tennessee, we have that problem, also, as the 'new' property owners want to take over and change things.    He was upset by the University Theater production of 'Inherit the Wind.'  My son's acting role was as one of the children in his dad's college-directed play at Martin in Pulaski, Tennessee; it was a learning experience for him.  And no criticism whatsoever from the public.    These are just a couple of the well-researched 'stories' in this fantastically put-together book by these two television editors.  They have previously been successful with 'The Century' and 'The Century for Young People.'  I am the proud owner of this volume and even bought two extras to give as gifts.	2004-10-17
494875:US	35985708	R2UROHRH34CYZU	0786244712	219114128	The Bondwoman's Narrative [Large Print]	Books	3	7	34	N	N	An unpublished masterpiece?	As background for this slave's narrative, we are introduced to John Hill Wheeler, writer, who had published HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF NORTH CAROLINA, 1584-1851), who served as assistant secretary to the U. S. President Franklin Pierce (always one of my favorites) in 1854.  There is a good photograph of Wheeler and a painting of his wife, Ellen, with her two sons by Thomas Sully who made the youngest look like a sleeping angel.    There is also a photo depiction of the abduction of his slave, Jane Johnson with her family, off the Steamer Washington on July 18, 1855, in Philadelphia \\"by force\\" by a gang of Negroes led by an abolotionist.  Since he was unable to locate and reclaim his servants, Jane was subsequently replaced by Hannah -- who escaped in the Spring of 1857.  He must have been a hard taskmaster.    One interesting thing (for me) was a mention of John Brown's (of Harper's Ferry, West VA fame) hanging in Charleston, VA.  It was observed that he died as he lived, \\"game.\\"  He certainly was no coward.    I found too much redundancy in the introduction by Henry L. Gates, Jr., and the narrative itself.  Absorbed in finding and preserving black culture in written form, he spends a lot of effort propounding on his conclusions, instead of the facts.  Like a local writer involved in uncovering ancient history, he uses too many \\"that's\\" proving he is not scholary.  To me, it shows a definite lack of education and too much emphasis on self promotion, so that whatever is printed will be thought or taken as the truth, the whole truth and nothing else.    As with all autobiographical material it is hard to tell what is fact and where the fiction begins.  An old acquaintance now deceased who had been in the Merchant Marines in his younger years and received much enjoyment in bewildering strangers with his detailed stories, told me how he manufactured \\"truth.\\"  Add a few relevant facts which can be substantiated and names of real people and presto! it's history -- not fiction.    As with science, the individual authors are expounding on their own theories, not facts per se.  It's the same in any field and any \\"case\\" history.  Mr. Gates wanted to prove this narrative was authentic; therefore, he spent more effort with his \\"proof\\" than the slave's account itself.    Something that old can never be proven beyond a doubt.  Now Clifford Irving's bogus biography of Howard Hughes was ill-timed.  Had he waited until after the person's demise, there would always be doubt and nothing to prove he was a liar.    I don't believe a slave would know some of the words used by this writer.  By including family background and descriptions of events, it is taken as the authentic tale of a real Hannah Crafts.  He did too much surmising \\"what if's\\" to have run down the actual writer to New Jersey -- to have been the runaway slave from North Carolina.    I found the marked out words and phrases to be distracting (also detracting).  It would have helped to have the edited parts left out; the 21 chapters would have sufficed without so much explanation and additions (in brackets).  Instead of making this clearer, it befuddles the story itself.    I'm not a user of the word \\"that\\" which is grossly overused in newspapers today.  About ten years ago, I typed the lengthy \\"memoir\\" of my ex-husband, a college English professor, and edited at intervals throughout.  Of course, he proof-read every page before having the entirety copied and bound to distribute to members of his family.  Sometimes, he agreed to my \\"clarifications\\"; at others, he'd say, \\"but we didn't talk that way.\\"  Growing up in a tiny hamlet between Shelbyville and Chapel Hill (where he'd been born) in Middle TN, and being about fifteen years my senior, he'd experienced things and feelings totally opposite to what I had in Knox County (East TN).  My reasons to \\"edit\\" were for the benefit of those who'd be reading his memories, not to change events -- and he finally agreed with me.    Perhaps I should have left things exactly the way he expressed them, no matter how grammatically incorrect they were, as now that is what I am wishing Mr. Gates had done with this manuscript.  The things he marked through seemed inconsistent vocabulary for such a young, uneducated woman confined in \\"the peculiar institution\\", and I'd have preferred not to have to think about them.    The textual annotations did not add to the story and were a bit too detailed.  You can analyze a situation \\"to death.\\"  Some things are better left to the reader's imagaination.    This story is as old as the hills.  Didn't he see the similarities between characters of this narrative and those in SHOW BOAT?  Sad but true.  Life is not always easy for those without power or money.	2004-10-10
495900:US	35985708	R1TDF6RWCYUV9R	0399147837	991985349	Shadow Warriors: Inside the Special Forces (Study in Command)	Books	3	3	7	N	N	Special Forces in the Shadows of Wars.	A most prolific writer, Tom Clancy has led his followers on seven Guided Tours with his nonfiction series, one inside The Special Forces of U.S. military.  This is the third in-depth study he cooperated on with a retired general who had expertise of that aspect of war.  Previously, he examined a study in command with Fred Franks, Jr., and 'Every Man A Tiger' (I like that title) with Chuck Horner.    \\"Shadow Warriors\\" was a detailed endeavor to explain special operations forces by a specialist from the top ranks.  Carl Stiner, a resident of LaFollette, TN -- a town made famous in James Agee's A DEATH IN THE FAMILY -- had served as Commander in Chief of SOCOM.  He relates in terms a civilian can understand the purpose and working of Green Berets of Viet Nam (who would ever forget that dramatic song performed by an actual member of the Green Berets, Barry Sandler, making it more authentic -- not just a musical interpretation of an unimaginable event?). Navy SEALS, and other specialized units.    The shadow warriors were an unknown undercover group starting out small in the 1950s which has evolved into the largest, most complex of missions in the U.S. military.  They not only fight the wars but rebuild settlements, clean up afterwards, save lives of innocent civilians, rescue hostages (wish they were more effective in 2004 Iraq), and work in reconnaissance among other 'special' duties.    Specially trained to deal with situations where the traditional soldiers would be ineffective they comprise an elite group.  Lt. Col. Bill Yarbrough's phrase \\"there are itches that only Special Forces can scratch,\\" a metaphor for getting to impossible places to achieve the impossible.    Kinda like the itch of a healing injury under the bandage you are instructed not to remove after foot surgery (which I've just endured), or the place across your back after having all those needles inserted in a row (to aggravate the nerve endings) to discovre allergies which four years later you can'tsee or reach but they still itch.  Of course, Yarbrough's 'itches' are more serious but no less irritating or easily remedied.    Carl Stiner has the hands-on experience to inform us of some of the situations and, as we all know, no one else is better able to put it in the storytelling manner Tom Clancy uses so masterfully.  I remember when Helen Booth reviewed his first novel, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, for our literary group, The Magazine Club (a historical endearment of Pulaski, TN) and looked directly at me when she declared, \\"You'd enjoy it.\\"  Me?    He's come a long way since then with a dozen achievements in the same vein and on the highest level of writing.  He not only informs the reader of important military practices throughout the years but makes mundane, serious matters understandable and interesting, sometimes exciting.  Movies have been successful of his books, PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and RED OCTOBER.    The insignia of the Shadow Warriors imbedded in the binding (underneath the book jacket) makes this book about Special Forces \\"special\\" in its own right.  In \\"Shadows in the Storm,\\" Saddam Hussein was in his prime as a conqueror, a far cry from the defeated man who was found hiding in an underground bunker in 2003, a la Hitler -- only alone when discovered.    This chapter was about the 'other' Gulf War in which General Norman Schwarzkopf was described as \\"a good example of senior officer who did not understand Special Operations and was afraid of it.\\"  He did appreciate the ability of these soldiers to speak the languages of both sides, calling it \\"the glue that held the coaliton together.\\"  Egypt was an ally in the coalition, and Cairo is the Arab Media center, their \\"Hollywood.\\"  America used this center to combat propaganda and inform the world of Saddam's 'character.'    Even then, Colin Powell warned that \\"Saddam is making threats about waging a worldwide terrorist campaign\\" which was kept quiet.  And we thought in 2002 it was Bin Laden (whatever happened to him, I wonder).  History in the making, some interesting and some not so interesting is the basis of this book.  There's even a \\"Bat Cave\\" involved (p.454).    Tony Koltz has contributed to Clancy's book, BATTLE READY, and this one.  He was also co-author of UNTITLED on Special Forces with John Gresham.  He was author of various \\"choose your own adventure\\" series of childhood books published by Skylark in the 1980s using spies, mind control, dictators and such.  Makes him quite capable of knowing what goes on in the Special Forces of U. S. military!  In that series, the #59, \\"Terror Island,\\" was his exclusively.	2004-10-09

This recollection of his writing (books and screenplays) varies from the personal to his gripes about the movie business.  He admits that he is not a moviegoer, mainly because he is not comfortable sitting in dark rooms with a lot of strangers!  And yet he devoted many years and frustrated efforts to get his novels filmed, using his own screenplays. <br /> <br />He speaks of his friendship with Salman Rushdie, author of THE SATANIC VERSES, to whom he dedicated his novel, A SON OF THE CIRCUS.  He relates his experiences in India researching children who'd been sold to be performers in the circuses there.   He was particularly interested in the dwarf clowns.  It took him five and a half years to finish the novel; had no luck with getting the screenplay accepted. <br /> <br />Of his published books, the three most popular made into films were THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP (starring Robin Williams), which I thought was pretty weird, THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE (Jodie Foster) and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (Tobey Maguire -- the reason I watched it). <br /> <br />He gives an in-depth account of the making of this movie and his involvement in every aspect except the advertising.  He worried over what the poster would show.  In the movie, he portrayed a train station master (that is his costumed acting on the front cover of the book), where an old steam engine similar to Knoxville's Rambler was used. <br /> <br />If you saw the movie about an abortion doctor and his protege, looking at the large photo layout in the middle of this book lets you re-live the emotions.  It is based on his grandfather's practice in Boston as explained in his biography, SAFE DELIVERANCE, about the nationally Lying-In Hospital.  His grandfather wrote nonfiction as opposed to John's novels based on his family background.  Guess he used his imagination a bit. <br /> <br />He made demands that they use the reading of Charles Dickens' DAVID COPPERFIELD to the children in the orphanage.  I think perhaps he livesin the past too much as he reminisces not about the good things but the negative which happened. <br /> <br />This was not one of my favorite movies (the subject matter is still a controversy which may never be resolved), but I did learn how to find a person's unlisted phone number:  'say you are calling about a death in the family.'  It happened to this author when he lived in New York and asked a caller \\"how did you get my number?\\"  Now, this I found interesting.  That's the joy of reading -- you learn something in every book no matter how insubstantial the subject matter.   <br /> <br />It's not exactly what I would call a \\"memoir\\" as it focuses on this film almost exclusively.  The rest is peripheral.	2004-09-29

Being the son of Alexander Haig, he is proud of his military prowess and uses fiction to expose dubious activities in U. S. government in this, his first novel.  Who else would have the courage (or, in today's world, foolishness) to follow through on his convictions. <br /> <br />It appears that he's entered the mass market paperback arena for most of his succeeding books; he's been on a roll, so to speak, and some sound inviting.  He's really gone high tech with digital versions; apparently, he has 'publishing savvy' to get so many out to the public in only two years.  Could it be he has a ghost writer as an aide? <br /> <br />A West Point grad, he served as special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  That's heady stuff, but as a career military strategist this was his destiny.  Though his dad showed gross arrogance during his stint as Secretary of State, the son -- due to his military lifestyle, no doubt -- is more down-to-earth. <br /> <br />I didn't care for his use of \\"Yep,\\" \\"Un huh,\\" \\"Nope\\" and such as dialogue, his story line moves along satisfactorily.  Actually, it was two stories in one -- a major scandal of a government coverup involving our special forces called Green Berets and the resultant botched investigation, and a crime closer to home as a consequence. <br /> <br />A vast conspiracy to keep details under wraps by devious political leaders and maneurvering generals at the Pentagon seems to have roots in the Oval Office.  Living that close to the inner workings and observations of those in power, he knew first hand of the secret \\"wars\\" kept from the public.  Where was Dan Rather then?!  It's best (and safer) not to probe too deeply into military affairs, especially those chosen by officials not to pursue.  The system has rules and everybody has to obey them. <br /> <br />There were references to Hollywood movies, 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and 'The Caine Mutiny' to show how the underlings rebel at times of great stress.  That's life.  He inserted some references to Delbert of the comics and Johnny Carson/Ed McMahon spiels (also Ed Morrow) on t.v. to relieve tension from so much military \\"justice.\\" <br /> <br />This was his first novel, though some of his articles previously have appeared in national publications and the 'Harvard Journal.'  His use of mild vulgarisms seems normal for a soldier but hard to overlook by an average reader.  These multi-faceted characters were not intellectuals, that's clear, with many things glossed over. <br /> <br />Maybe his writing style is a \\"nice mix of wit and wisdom\\" as Nelson DeMille avered, but if he'd clean up his language, he might just become a first-rate novelist to match the glowing endorsements on the cover of this incredible story.  Metaphysically speaking, of course. <br /> <br />I like \\"first novels\\" as they incorporate much of the writer's personal experiences and beliefs.  If I had a military background, I would probably have gotten much more to appreciate and less to doubt the \\"searing honesty\\" as presented from that viewpoint.  I've learned that it is best to doubt until the real facts are proven and substantiated.  This is not the kind of \\"suspense\\" fiction I've spent a lot of years enjoying.  Yet, the larger print was a feast to my sore eyes. <br /> <br />This is a son one could be proud of, but he will burn himself out before his time if he continues to release his creative efforts at such a rate.  Take it from Gregory Macdonald, it is best to pace oneself in this industry.	2004-09-29

The movie studios RKO, MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, and Twentieth Century Fox (all familiar to the movie-goers of the Fab Fifties) struggled for survival by focusing on large-budget blockbusters.  Later Universal, United Artists, Columbia Pictures and others found life different after the Cold War mania in which writers, producers and directors (some actors) were blacklisted by McCarthy as pro-Communism in this country. <br /> <br />McCarthy ruined reputations and stunted careers in Hollywood in a grand style, but at what a cost -- he was the one to die early.  It's a proven fact that hurting others in any way (even by neglect) hurts the tormentor more, usually in physical health.  \\"Tough things can kill.  They kill the spirit, hopes, dreams, vision and even desire (to live).  Excessive pressure can make you explode or make you learn new ways to constructively vent.\\" (Mtn. Wings #4271) <br /> <br />The wild McCarthyrite charges of conspiracy were as common in the Fifties as they were devastating.  Some of those blacklisted by 30's radicalism had been unfairly smeared and even damaged in the McCarthy Era.  The Hollywood screenwriters were infiltrated by former Communists for the congressional investigators for the FBI.  It is sad that producers testified against some of their best writers and best friends. <br /> <br />But they continued to work on films without credit for their work at lower wages than they deserved.  In fact, they contributed immensely to the creation of the 1950's Golden Age of Television, to the dramas and sitcoms.  Some moved to New York and were productive on the stage.   <br /> <br />Technology in the form of CinemaScope, camera innovations  such as the zoom lens, location shooting, and color film saved the industry.  The Arbitron surveys killed off some special programs.  I'd forgotten about those; as we were never chosen to keep track of what  we watched.  Today, they are used for radio also and I took one myself in 2001 -- gave Nick Clooney lots of play time in the early hours of each morning. <br /> <br />These historians explain all you'd ever want to know (also some better not known) about every movie you might have seen or just heard about.  There is quite a listing throughout this volume. <br /> <br />Some brought back pleasant memories included were the Armstrong Circle Theater, Philco Television Playhouse, Studio One, Four Star Playhouse, NBC Television Theater, Alcoa Aluminum Hour, (also Alcoa/Goodyear Theater) and Ray Bradbury's Science Fiction Theater.  The best drama series of this \\"Golden Age\\" was one of my favorites, TWILIGHT ZONE.  Reruns are still on the tube today. <br /> <br />The cowboys listed were Hopalong Cassidy, Andy Devine, Roy Rogers, but not Lash LaRue (why not?) as he was great.  One year he came to our Fair and silly me, just a wisp of a girl, volunteered to stand on stage while he tore a piece of paper out of my mouth with his whip.  He was something! <br /> <br />Of course, the music shows to which I was partial and played a big part in my young life.  Bing Crosby Productions used blacklisted talents in their shows, BREAKING POINT, HOGAN'S HEROES, and BEN CASEY later in 1959.  The mini-studios brought out the detectives we all loved.  And who could forget Loretto Young and her beautiful costumes or Dinah Shore and her downhome shows to show the world that we Southerners do know a thing or two.   <br /> <br />This would make a good reference book for movie buffs.	2004-09-27

The two lines quoted on its own page preceding Contents are the epitome of despair.  \\"Short people got no reason to live.\\"  He is deficient in grammar, that's for sure. <br /> <br />At a social gathering almost three years ago now (which I will never forget) where I was invited to \\"provoke\\" locals with my 'strong' opinions, my major faux pas was saying I enjoyed to hear Alan Jackson sing that particular song.

This is the town of SHORT PEOPLE. <br /> <br />Having lived in lower Middle Tennessee, below Nashville near the Alabama line, where the heights of adults are normal, I felt petite (5'1\\", 97 lbs.) but here where even the men are short for the most part, I sometimes think of this song. <br /> <br />The 'short people' exploited in this book are children, ages 6 - 12 yrs.  It is really quite sordid.  These 'stories' were not written by the kids to be printed for the whole world to read. <br /> <br />In Pulaski, many years ago, the Mental Health director had a regular slot on the local morning radio show where he talked about the clients' \\"cases\\" without revealing names.  Even then, I felt this was unethical.  No one would go to a therapist who uses their problems to write a book, to profit from the desperate situations in which they felt trapped. <br /> <br />This book is such a travesty to the rights of these children.  There is no dignity in making a profit off the sordid aspects of life today, yesterday, and always.  These \\"short people\\" weren't mature enough to feel they had no reason to live, thank goodness. <br /> <br />Maybe Furst was at one time \\"one of them\\" and this invasive sacrilege into others' lives is his way to feel big -- to rise above the crowd.  But -- he's grown now, and should know better.	2004-09-24

From there on, he was in 'high cotton' back in the thirties when robbing banks and killing people who got in their way was commonplace.  <br /> <br />They formed a 'gang' who hit places all across the land, Florida, Midwest, Arizona, even Knoxville, TN.  They escaped across the Gay Street bridge, which is still standing after being closed for a few years for restructuring.  At least, we have some claim to fame when it comes to crime.  <br /> <br />The characters in this book are real, and most of the events are documented in old newspapers.  The relevant historical information is vague, contradictory, or in error (as is all of the old microfilm from the past).  A lot of it was made up to sell papers.  No one living today really knows what was said or how these criminals felt inside.  <br /> <br />Shakespeare is quoted in his play, Richard III, \\"conscience is but a word which cowards use ....to keep the strong in awe.  Our strong arms are our conscience, swords our law.\\"  That is okay in a play written in Shakespeare's time, but certainly not a rule to go by in America of the '30s, '40s, or now.  Conscience keeps us from hurting other people intentionally.  <br /> <br />You run out of everything when you run out of luck.  Well, Handsome Harry's luck ended with a smile, as he is led into the death chamber and strapped into the electric chair.  The rest of the gang are already gone to their reward for being who and what they were; people think they know everything about these gangsters because they know some of the facts.  These are not human beings worthy of respect.  They violated the law, not just once but over and over, thinking they were omnipotent.  No one is.  His grin was wasted under that hood, as the reporters and warders present for the execution could care less.    <br /> <br />These 'intimate confessions' are a figment of one's imagination.  I'd say he was scared as a rabbit trapped in a hole.  Handsome is as handsome does, I always heard.	2004-09-22

This is the story of hard-drinking Milo, the antihero of previous novels in this series. He appears more like an arch villian, the exact opposite of a hero.<br />The thing I liked about this book is its white binding. You don't see many in white, more so in black. White is for purity. Pure is what this book is not about.<br />Betty had her own pickup truck in this tale. There is a black Buddha who is good enough to buy Milo a drink. He, like my son Geoffrey complains of a bad back, but it doesn't slow down his pace or actions.<br />The final country is supposedly Texas, that big state which thinks it is a country of its own. Or it could be Montana, according to John Steinbeck in TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY. He seems to think that Paris is the new 'country' where he might just end up, but I'm not taking bets on that happening.<br />Using voodoo hit close to home, as did B. L.Brammer's description of it as the boondocks. I know first hand about living in the boondocks and the possibility of having the curse of voodoo alive and thriving in today's world.<br />The author, a college English teacher who gets his kicks out of writing crime novels,has previously had seven books published. He puts me in mind of Larry McMurtry who wrote a novel, SUTTREE, about my hometown of Knoxville, TN. He, too, is touted by the publishers as a good writer.  I know someone here who has met him in a bar on Gay Street and appreciates him as a fellow drinker and writer.	2004-07-18

Elizabeth Peters has been one of my favorite mystery writers for many years now.  Her Amelia Peabody series is so well written and documented.  She's an archeologist, as is her husband, who loves to explore tombs in Egypt.  she has a rather long listing of books, many containing hundreds of pages each.  She is prolific.  None are hard to read.  All are interesting.<br />I think perhaps my favorite is \\"Night Train to Memphis\\" or could be \\"The Love Talker.\\"  This one follows Ms. Peabody and entourage again to Egypt.  She not only explores antiquities in strange places, she is also a Master Investigator which gets her in 'hot water' on occasion.<br />Like me, she indulges in the daily horoscopes.  The title for this Peabody/Emerson episode comes from an ancient Egyptian horoscope:  \\"The day of the children of the storm.  Very dangerous.  Do not go on the water this day.\\"<br />This is the 15th published \\"journal\\" of Amelia encompassing three generations of an amazing family saga (35 yrs. of turbulent history) including a diary of son Ramses, named after a pharaoh.<br />Amelia was called by the natives, \\"Lady Doctor\\" while Emerson was \\"Father of Curses.\\"  Ramses accompanied his uncle Sethos as a secret agent because of his use of disguises and fluency in languages.<br />Justin had tormented Charla, young daughter of Ramses who'd waited to talk until she got ready, like her dad.  Like Eric.  Ms. Peters who loves cats almost as much as I do, educated at the University of Chicago like my son Geoffrey, never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge.<br />This is another page turner, always an exciting \\"adventure\\" in store.  You are kept in suspense about the happenings until the danger is at hand.  She is just plain marvelous with her writing abilities and subject matter.	2004-07-17

This simple financial advice book focuses on 'sin stocks.'  The writer in his portfolio states that this is a perfect world, the world of sin and corruption.  Where has he been all his life?  We read about such in the Bible.  Is there such a thing as a 'perfect world' -- not that I am aware of the possibility.    This world has been at war since the beginning of recorded history and before.  According to this web page, \\"these industries are nearly recession-proof.\\"  They will continue to experience 'significant capital appreciation' during good and bad markets.  Why not invest in vice?    He touts these illustrious sin stocks as being in Gambling, Alcohol, Cigarettes, Aerospace & Defense, and Adult Entertainment (movies, live, massage parlors, and even porn on the computers).  At a local computer lab, you can't sit down in peace to check email without porn popping up.    His version of defense is not creating weapons to invade, conquer, and destroy other nations.  What about homeland defense from terrorists from the places living in the 'old ages'?    Alcohol is a thriving thing in this town and has a history of moonshiners and illegal consumption throughout the years.  It is touted as a highly profitable business.  It definitely is here, as all the men of Knoxville think they must drink as much as they can, to drown their sorrows.  In an article written by a local journalist for the Summer '98 special, 'CELEBRATING KNOXVILLE & EAST TENNESSEE' entitled \\"Two Centuries of Growth,\\" I learned some facts  about my hometown which appalled me:      Not one permanent church here during the first quarter century;Knoxville's chief export was liquor: in the 1820s, the town had sixty distilleries; in 1906, there were 100 saloons downtown (imagine!)   It was criticized nationally as being the most sinful city in the South (after New Orleans). Saloons were banned in 1907 here, and the ban wasnot fully lifted until 1972 when the \\"city\\" reinstated liquor-by-the-drink.      Ahrens claims that our very first US President George Washington was a drinker (of malt!) -- I like malted milk, so I guess I am a drinker, oh my.  Three years ago, I was invited to a gathering at a local pub and saw first hand how alcohol affects diverse groups and I was most uncomfortable in that smoky atmosphere.  Needless to say, I was not invited back.    Lincoln is quoted as saying, \\"no vices have very few virtues.\\"  I'd suggest he read William Lee Miller's LINCOLN'S VIRTUES (An Ethical Biography).  What we need more in this world are ethics.  Now, I understand why the Knoxville I grew up in during the '50s was the \\"glory days\\" of this town. Religion apparently didn't dominate society,  but we had a background of morals which are not prevalent today.    With its lighthearted and simple approach to the vices he concentrates on for financial reasons, this is the ultimate defense in these 'trouble times' -- why not just get drunk, play the lottery (which is real big here at this time), look at naked women, smoke,smoke,smoke that cigarette, and play war games.	2004-07-16

Some of my favorite people (I especially like Dan Rather and Al Gore) are criticized in this book as being &quot;liberals.&quot;  I enjoyed Phil Donahue on t.v. as an intelligent host and learned a multitude of various informative subject matter from the Bill Moyers' specials on public television.<br />Heading the list compiled by a former speech writer for Nancy Reagan (does that make her a specialist of some sort?) is Jane Fonda.  She also worked on the campaign of Jack Kemp for president -- who's Jack Kemp?!<br />Certainly he is no Al Gore.  Just because she is a t.v. commentator on CNN (MY, that used to be Ted Turner's property, and he was once married to Jane Fonda!) doesn't give her any valid reason to call anyone &quot;idiots.&quot;<br />I am not a liberal or left wing politically, but I believe the Rosenbergs were railroaded and lost their lives as a coverup for corruption of others.  Ethel was guilty only of being a dedicated wife.  Whittaker Chambers, it has been proven beyond a doubt, lied to save his own skin. He kept his distance from McCarthy because of his guilt and Communist inclinations.<br />Alger Hiss, a high-ranking state department official, was much maligned and made a scapegoat, destroying his reputation.  All for what, I ask.  She lays blame where history has declared none existed.  Restoring old, hurtful rumors only brings us all down.<br />If Al Gore is a liberal, then I must be one as I believe in him.  When Lott was called a racist, I told others I am more racist than he could ever be.  How much intelligence does it take to be a secretary to a First Lady, I wonder.<br />And to blaspheme Ed Asner is going too far.  Maybe that Capital Gang has influenced her to be snobbish toward Democrats or people superior in education and knowledge.  Even with her index of sources, this is not factual, nor is it history in the making.	2004-07-16

This war correspondent (handsome young man) could be called Mr. Intrepid.  When hundreds of journalists and network reporters left Baghdad a year ago, Richard stayed on.  After all, he has been living in the Mid East for almost twenty years now.<br />This is nothing like Jimmy Carter's novel, HORNET'S NEST; however, they are both about war.  So many years apart, these wars but atrocious just the same.  In Carter's novel, we read about scalpings, now we know of beheadings going on in Iraq in this modern age.  Have times changed?  Not much.  There are still uneducated savages leading others just as ignorant.<br />I will always remember the first atom bomb with the mushroom; USA developed and used the first one!  Amazing!  And I thought we were educated and erudite here.<br />This Mr. Intrepid is able to survive over there because of his fluent use of their language.  He was educated at Stanford University in America.

Blue jays abound in her yard there on W. 88th St.; I have found four here in Krutch Park who pose for me to take their photos after I have fed them, of course.<br />This 18-yr-old rescues wounded birds (good for her), develops an interest in nurclear missile silos, and organizes her own group of girls against the atomic bomb at St. Ursula's School. She seemed to be obsessed with Stalin and Hitler, plus the Nurenberg trials. She is sent to discuss her concerns with the guidance counselor and they fall in love.<br />So, what else is new?  I married my college lit teacher.  But this little book brings things to today's world, how the privileged don't have enough to do with all their wealth and must find 'causes' to satisfy their yearnings.<br />She won an award in 1999 for her fiction in Indiana and has had some of her writings published in various literary magazines.

Our recent presidents have been celebrities in different ways, some in music, acting, scholars, military geniuses, former governors of states in these U. S. A.<br />Mainly this book, compiled by Alan Schroeder (has quite a lengthy index of sources he used), relates the influence of show business on politics from the top on down.  Harry Truman played piano passably and had a talented daughter, Margaret; he is shown performing with Jack Benny on the violin.<br />Richard Nixon also played the piano and even performed on the Grand Ole Opry stage in Nashville, TN  He invited Elvis Presley to the White House.  Bill Clinton played the saxophone somewhat and was the butt of jokes on several t.v. shows.  He promoted Barbra Streisand because she was a favorite of his dear Mother's.  He also invited United Artists' producer Mike Medavoy to the White House and allowed him to sit in the chair there in the Oval Office and he and his wife spent the night there.<br />Ronald Reagan should have the title of \\"celebrity\\" pres. but I think the title really goes to John F. Kennedy.  He went all out to seduce movie stars with the assistance of his brother-in-law, actor Peter Lawford.  He had an association with Frank Sinatra at the same time Sinatra was sharing a mistress with a Mafia leader.  Politics are indeed strange bedfellows.<br />Dwight Eisenhower welcomed Robert Montgomery and the pianist, Liberace, to the White House as he did his favorite (and mine) singer, Eddie Fisher, who sang 'Count Your Blessings.'  Eddie also sang with a group of other male celebrities, 'Together' to JFK, as did his favorite, Marilyn Monroe.<br />Gerald Ford, the non-President, only one to not be voted in by the populace, favored comedians off t.v. shows and John Wayne who narrated a fabulous collaboration to America and her people.  He also like Carol Channing for some reason.<br />Jimmy Carter, the scholar and chaste one, is shown with John Travolta who went on many years later to play a Presidential candidate in the movies.<br />The moviedom out in California have always had a say in politics of this great nation.  Hearst who built that marvelous mansion along Route 1 for his movie star, Marion Davises, owned the newspapers which could make or break a candidate.<br />These are interesting ancedotes naming some big names.  The photos are good.  My favorite was of the thirty-two Hollywood stars who posed with Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940.  Have things changed?  Is L.A. still a dominant influence on the nation's politics and our leaders who must represent all states, not just one.	2004-07-12

After eight previous published books written by our former U.S. president (one co-authored with Rosalynn) he has been a busy man writing an over-long novel purportedly about the South's particiapation in the Revolutionary War.  He wrote journals, poems, meditations, a primer on aging, memoirs, and some inspirational pieces.  This, however, is totally fiction (more than 900 pages in the LP version).  He uses letter to the militia to keep up morale from the Governor's agent.  He involves the Creeks and Cherokees in this eight year war (1775-1783) taken place in Georgia of all places.<br />He and Rosalynn build houses for the poor working class, and I wonder when he has time to write.  This can't compare with CITY OF DREAMS, which was based on many years of research.  He mentions the brutality of this war.  There is great brutality in any war, even when the American Indians are not the enemy.<br />His ending, &quot;For the next half century, legal and military battles would be fought over the conflicting claims for land, and the ravages of slavery and its aftermath would affect the nation for another 150 years.&quot;  His next novel, no doubt, will be about the underground railroad in which the Southern blacks were secretly moved to the North, the atrocities of the Civil War and its aftermath in the South, or maybe he will do a bit of research and write about THE TRAIL OF TEARS in which our beloved Cherokees were forced to relocate to Oklahoma.  The Creeks, I think, stayed in Florida.  Maybe his home state of Georgia.	2004-07-11

This epistle is billed as an unexplained mystery of the medieval era.  Historian, writer for the extremist publication &quot;The Economist&quot;, Ann Wroe uses her own type of philosophy to put a 'soul' in this person -- a soul she can't truly imagine as you have to look into a person's eyes yourself to see his soul.  I saw the most gentle blue eyes (fooled me) in a person who was most egotisical.  Sometimes, the eyes are those of deceit, not a person's soul at all.<br />Now, this story would make a lavish movie using the star of KING ARTHUR as Perkins Warbeck, a commoner of Flanders.  It is just the sort they are grinding out and we are being bombarded with at the theaters with reprises of old historical epics in modern terms.  It would be fun to watch a real commoner fool all those pompous royal families who know nothing except a lavish existence.<br />He was the Great Pretender and no one really discovered who theman was.  He'd influenced rulers of Spain, France, Scotland and other principalities -- the consumate con man of all time -- as the imposter to the throne of England.  For eight years, he harassed the King attempting to take the throne as Duke of York, the young Richard who had been killed with his brother in the tower of London by his uncle, Richard III.<br />He was courted by the aristocracy of several nations in Europe as THE PERFECT PRINCE because of his charisma, manners (where did he learn them if he had been simply the son of a boatman?), and his handsome appearance.  He married into the royal family, the daughter of an earl.  He'd charmed Ferdinand and Isabella, Charles of France, and Maximilian by his wit and elegance.  He was used as a pawn by the rulers of European society to get rid of the new King of England.  <br />He'd been so brainwashed by the time of his death at the age of twenty-five, it's doubtful he knew himself who he was -- only what he'd been primed (by whom?) to be -- an imposter on the highest level.  He lost his campaign for the throne on the gallows, as did so many 'enemies' of the Kings of England, as history will attest. <br />This book, however, is not history.  Using research to fuel a vivid imagination (all historians have that failing), she takes liberties as so many writers of history tend to do to expound upon their own theories.	2004-07-09

Ms. Breathnach collaborated with Michael Segell to teach us women that men actually do think and feel differently from the females in their lives.  It was through his wife, Winnie Gallagher, that the two found each other and produced this informative journal.<br />There are fifty-two diverse contributors selected and edited by Mr. Segell.  For ages we've known of the contradictions between recollections by the different sexes; this was published to bring them closer together by revealing some similarites not just the differences. It was a definite challenge.  Whatever else you could say, they are perhaps true.  I can see why they chose Mark Winegardner's \\"Like Mother, Like Son,' to get off to a good start.  It is rewarding to read how he credits his mother with his creativity.  I told son Zachary that he got his writing ability from me, but he was doubtful.  Like me, Mark has trouble \\"forgiving.\\"<br />In this series of essays, we strive to understand male emotions, their historic lack of commitment, their great pride and self-esteem from the professional lives (I wonder, did they see the new STEPFORD WIVES movie?), and the uniquely male perspective on life's problems.<br />Some years ago, I worked through SIMPLE ABUNDANCE, A Daybook of Comfort and Joy and learned what is really important to women.  Now, they attempt to turn the tables, so to speak, to educate women about the men they love but have difficulty understanding.<br />She gives her view of the creation, using Spirit as God, Eve as the first 'soul mate,' spiritual awakening; I waited to see if the Spirit was a woman who presented this version: It's not good for man to be alone; something or someone was missing.<br />Merle Shain stated it clearly, \\"There are no perfect men, of course, but some are more perfect than others, and we can use all of those we can get.\\"  Men feel they 'deserve' respect (ha), they should seek it by their actions.  <br />Some of these essays are provocative and most are complicated to a woman's sensibilities.  It's possible that some of them may move you to laughter or tears.  Men are good at faking emotions they don't  feel.  And some can act up in public and embarrass an innocent woman for something the man mistakenly assumed.<br />I was most interested in those written by Southern humorist, Roy Blount, Jr., and Reynolds Price, another Southerner with the longest bibliography.  Jake Jacobsen was the most original, listed only as a 'hermit.'  He hates women, it seems.  <br />Some are Pulitzer prize winners in their fields.  They use thoughtfulness, intelligence, and sometimes wit to get their individual points across.  I heard this on the Wink Martindale show recently on the Music Of Your Life radio network, \\"You are born an individual; don't die a copy.\\"  Men will always be men and we can value them for the creatures they are, for better or for worse.	2004-07-04

Oscar Wilde was a handsome man in 1892, as the photo of him in this books clearly indicates. He was a brilliant playwright and daubled in poetry. However, as the drawing of his arrest at the Cadogan Hotel on April 13, 1895, he was an arrogant, dandified \\"gentleman.\\" He had been accused of a horrible charge and should have accepted his fate. To crave justice from libel, he laid himself and his reputation open to scrutiny and disaster.<BR>Why his grandson would want all of this sordidness known now is impossible to comprehend. Some things are better left forgotten or not said. Wilde felt that the charge (however right it might be) called for a defense of justification. It turned out to be the opposite as the self-destructive genius only continued to lie with charm, entertaining the audience but not the court.<br />Those who start libel actions often emerge with their reputations and lives in tatters. Libel actions are meant to be cases for re-establishing reputations, confounding gossip and allowing the litigant to emerge in a state of unblemished purity (John Mortimer). The most famous libel case of all led Oscar Wilde directly to jail. He left behind a devoted wife and two sons. The grandson who released this detailed account of the trial to try to figure out \\"Why on earth did you do it?\\"<br />There are photographs of some of the persons involved and of the evidence used against him. It is proposed that perhaps he really didn't think he had done anything wrong. After all, many important people of that time got away with the same thing of which he was accussed. To learn what it is, you must read this book.<br />I'd heard rumors about his sexual persuasion previously, but this stuff went a little too far to please my sensibilities. The Judge maintained that men who could do as he did were 'dead to all sense of shame' and declared that this offence was 'the worst I have ever tried.'<br />Poor Oscar, his ego got in the way; his pride was too great to accept the fact that he had been 'found out.' In going to court, he laid open his past and destroyed his future. He hurt not only himself but his family as well. Why can't people just let the sordid past lay dormant?	2004-07-02

This is the thirteenth book written by this author.  He is supposedly a humorist, but uses some pretty crude language and that I don't care much for.  I do love humor, anything to make me laugh, but it has to be 'clean.'<br />John Gregory Dunne, related by marriage to Mr. Breslin, writes that only Jimmy Breslin would have the nerve to call a Greenwich Village Mafia social club 'The Concerned Lutherans.'  Has he never heard Garrison Keillor on public radio?  When he came to Knoxville, he let loose on the Presbyterians after someone told him that this is a Presbyterian town.  They were wrong, just because the mayor and his gang of 'good old boys' went to that church downtown doesn't mean that the rest of us do.  Personally, I am Methodist but used to be Baptist -- when I didn't know any better.<br />This is a story about gangsters, one in particular.  Fausti Dellacava, known as The Fist because he had 25 professional fights and had his photo in the barbershop window threatening anybody who walked past.  It is also the story of his namesake, his nephew (poor kid).<br />Despite their differences, on one point did the uncle and nephew totally agree: &quot;I don't want to go to jail.&quot;  The mug shots on the book jacket are caricatures of real gangsters and molls or could be they are ghouls.  They are certainly ugly and weird-looking.<br />Jimmy Breslin was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Disguished Commentary in 1986 for some of his columns in various N. Y. City newspapers.  I can identify with him in the fact that I, too, walk around town talking with &quot;the guy on the street,&quot; in the park, on Market Square, etc.  I did learn to drive a car, however, just don't own one.  I even feed the blue jays (sometimes a mockingbird) and pigeons so that I can photograph them.<br />I suppose you could calll his hilarity 'good as it gets' but I really don't find him impossibly funny.

The author of this book is a Civil War buff who had worked on some prestigious publications, the most important for this field was CIVIL WAR TIMES ILLUSTRATED.  He has written others on this subject, including ON THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR and SURVIVING THE CONFEDERACY.    In the Foreword by James McPherson, author of many Civil War books, he describes it as a war of brothers.  When asked ten years ago by a new friend from Belize to tell him about our Civil War, that was all I knew of it -- brother against brother.  Since then, I've purchased a varied selection of books on the War Between the States.  He states: \\"The war did divide families, especially in the border states.\\"  Senator Crittenden of Kentucky, whose illfated compromise proposal of 1861 failed to avert the War, had one son who became a Confederate general and another who was on the Union side.    Seven brothers and brothers-in-law of Mary Todd Lincoln fought against the army whose commander-in-chief was her husband.  In numerous cases brother and brother, uncle and nephew, even father and son chose different sides and faced each other on the battlefield.    This book follows the military careers of some of the fifty-nine members of the Class of 1846 at West Point who considered themselves as \\"brothers.\\"  Ten members became Confederate generals while twelve became Union generals.  A few of them became immortal.  At a recent talk about Nathan Bedford Forrest, a UT professor called him white trash, which I refuted most vociferously as he not only hadn't done his homework; he had Forrest as being from Memphis, and he was born in Chapel Hill, TN, (not too far from Shelbyville, home of the Tennessee Walking Horses), who proved to be one of the most brilliant officers and calvary tacticians of that war.  He was the most remarkable man our Civil War produced on either side.  General Lee called him the greatest soldier under his command.    Charles S. Stewart was #1 in this class but was never a star on the battlefield.  He became a colonel for the Union side.  James Stuart was killed in the Indian Wars in 1858.  Stonewall Jackson was the hero of this Class.    George McClellan, #2 in the class, was a Major General for the Union and fought against Lee at Antietam in Western Maryland.  On September 17, 1862, the bloodiest battle of the War was fought there in which 23,000 died.  One summer on the way to Union Bridge, my sons and I stopped off to look at this beautiful landscape where so many perished, as we traveled to visit my sister.  It was a memorable experience.  Also these two fought at Shiloh in Tennessee where I took my Maryland nephews and my sons and a friend to observe that vast area where Geoffrey and his Scout troop would camp out on occasion.  A local Scoutmaster from Knoxville took his group there, also.    George Pickett became a Major General for the Confederates!  Sam Davis Sturgis, Major General for the Union, was defeated by Nathan Bedford Forrest in Mississippi.  A young Confederate by the name of Sam Davis from Smyrna, TN, 'Boy Hero of the Confederacy' was hanged as a spy by the Union in Giles County, TN.  His last words, \\"I'd die a thousand deaths before I would betray my friend.\\"  I was told that the person who gave him the information was in the cell next to him but was spared through Sam's valiantry.    Birk Davenport Fry, dismissed from this class for some reason, became a Brigadier General for the Confederates and went on to become a cotton manufacturer in Richmond, VA.  He was a fierce fighter at Gettysburg, where I took my sons on many summer excursions.  Gettysburg, PA was the place to be.	2004-06-28

This is one in a series of THE MAN WHO which followed all those CHRONICLES OF THOMAS COVENANT,  a kind of follow through with some of the same characters.  This one is a violent man involved with the martial arts and who kills without conscience.  He had killed his own brother while drunk.  Enough said.<br />This is touted to be a 'tale of a hero's dark night of the soul.'  I feel he has no soul.  Any killer is lacking morals and any other virtue.  Most drunks lack all the needed virtues to function in this world.<br />Stephen Donaldson is one of my favorite writers for the trio he did with A MAN RIDES THROUGH as one of them.  He had a good woman in these about time travel back to medieval times.  I read his GAP series, GAP INTO VISION, GAP INTO MADNESS; I think there had to have been a third in this series.  Anyway, I read them but did not understand much, so I classed it as science fiction.<br />If this book is based on real life, it is a life I know nothing of and wouldn't want to -- I had a young neighbor boy back in Pulaski who watched KUNG FO on t.v. and would get out in the front yard and perform all those moves with a long stick.  Before I realized what he was emulating, I thought the child had gone crazy.  To me, the martial arts are too noisy to begin with and ridiculous to watch.  I suppose you're supposed to scare off your opponent by kicking high and yelling.  To me, that is the coward's way out, not real fighting.<br />Brew fits his name as he is an alcoholic whose loved ones have turned their backs on him (mainly because of the murder he committed), not his drinking.  The love of his life seems to be as seedy a character as he.<br />Donaldson, who lives in New Mexico (my daughter-in-law said she had met him when my son was a teacher in Alburque), is perfect with his use of the English lalnguage, the thing which attracted me to his writings.  Now, he is on a MAN thing, THE MAN WHO RISKED HIS BROTHER, THE MAN WHO KILLED HIS BROTHER, THE MAN WHO FOUGHT ALONE, (a new series, I guess) and A MAN WHO RIDES THROUGH (which I loved, he was not a modern man but was from the medieval times).  We need more dignity and humility as they practiced back then, even with the cruelty in wars.<br />We still have much cruelty in war.  Consider the beheadings which are a continuing thing going on at the moment in Iran.  Where has civilization gone -- to the dogs?!  A dog-eat-dog world, what a drudge for sensitive, civilized folks.	2004-06-27

William Tuohy uses this, his first book, to introduce us to the atrocities of war in various areas of the world.  He won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in 1968.  Throughout his journalist career, he was involved with presidents of USA, movie stars, and politicians plus the terrorists in the Mid East.<br />He was held hostage in Jordon, Iran, and tells of the upheaval in Iran in December, 1978.  Now there is even worse upheaval there and he was lucky the militants then did not behead their prisoners and act like savages, as they do in 2004.<br />It is now seventeen years since he had this book published, but the world is still in turmoil in the same places.  You'd think the 'fighters' would get tired of the same old thing and 'grow up a bit.'  He found himself in 'no-man's-land in Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  He had even more adventures than the famed journalist, Thomas, who was the first American allowed into Tibet and broadcast from there -- only to have a fall from a horse and break his leg on the way out of that forbidden territory.  I know of a recent journey there by a friend of Patch Adams.  My, how times have changed.<br />In Belfast, got caught between the police and rioters, reminding me of Sam Houston, a former Governor of the great state of Tennessee, who was caught in the warfare with Santa Anna in Texas when his skittish horse would not get out of the firing range -- subsequently he was shot in the ankle.<br />Tuochy tells of Viet Nam and the Green Berets, reminding us of the brave men who tried valiantly to represent the U.S. in Viet Nam and many died mercilessly and needlessly.  We should never have been there in the first place.  Just as we have stayed in Iran far past the time needed, and our Americans are being slaughtered for no reason.<br />Since this book, he has written THE BRAVEST MAN, LOVE JOURNEY INTO AMERICA, SPRING COMES CALLING showing his expertise in the art of newspapers and national magazines.  He enjoyed television toa point and was fascinated by the 'stars'  and directors, and the dolce vita scene (whatever that is).  According to the book jacket, &quot;Tuochy presents a fascinating portrait of a troubled world and the dangerous company who inhabit it.&quot;  That, he did!	2004-06-26

This is a story of two men who crossed paths at the World's Fair Exposition (the White City) in 1893, the city itself and the people concerned with the 'greatest event in the history of the U.S. since the Civil War.'  Written to read like fiction, it is based on facts as seen through the eyes of researcher Erik Larson, a former writer for the Wall Street Journal, which incidentally was started by a newsman from Knoxville, TN.<br />It covers the conflict between good and evil, daylight and darkness, the White city and the Black.  He includes a detailed index and bibliography, photos and a map of the World's Fair including Chicago and its surburbs, one of a group of architects, and one of Dr. H. H. Holmes in 1895.<br />He used letters, memoirs, and other documents from such luminaries as Marshall Field, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, and Clarence Darrow (who later brought fame and legalese to a small town in Tennessee called Dayton).<br />The World's Fair site was later transformed into the University of Chicago where my son Geoffrey earned his doctoral degree after many years of Physics and Astronomy classes and field work at Kitt Peak in Arizona.  I've been there and seen the atom developed there on that very site which enabled America to have the atomic bomb which was used to end the WWII.  My son remarked that only I and the Japanese tourists want their pictures taken with that awful remembrance, not a very pretty sight.<br />Some men choose to do the impossible; others only cause sorrow.  The main architect was Daniel H. Burham who had built many of our most important structures including the Union Station in Washington, D.C. (I've been there, too.) and the Flatiron Building in New York.  He's the good guy.<br />At the time, Chicago was a city of opportunity but also one of vanishment.  Men and women vanished in equal proportions.  A Tennessee woman, Fannie Moore from Memphis, was just one of the hundreds of victims of Dr. H. H. Holmes.  Bothmen were blue eyed.<br />The Exposition was made up of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show known worldwide, Krupp's Gun Exhibit, a Statue of the Republic (&quot;Big Mary&quot;) which was similar to our Statue of Liberty in the harbor of New York, with both hands raised, various other buildings, the &quot;el&quot; railroad (which I rode some years ago), a wooded island, and the Peristyle (appeared to be something like a promenade along Lake Michigan) and the beautiful Court of Honor.  A spectacular place nearly equal to the power of our Civil War spread out in all its glory.<br />This is a murder mystery, only the mystery was unraveled to reveal our first serial killer with the exception of the Prince in England.  It is one of beauty and one of ugliness.  Chicago today is beautiful with many such incidences but most have been overcome on the South Side of Chicago.  My kind of town.	2004-06-26

This book is another of the self-help genre, only the reader is not instructed on how to be happy but what happiness entails.  Dan Baker says that the truly happy person (man or woman) has more optimism, good humor, fulfillment, and courage.   But I feel that it takes more courage to overcome the fear he spends so much time talking about than being happy.    Happpiness comes from the heart, not the mind.  I'm relieved to learn that it is a genetic fault which causes negativity, which we all have to a great extent.  You will find more negative people in your life than the happy, positive types.    He tries to make you believe that overcoming the genetic predisposition toward negative reactions lead to a rich, happy and healthy life.  If this were so, we'd all be rich -- not necessarily happy or healthy.  Some people drink alcohol to escape from the fear in their daily lives and refuse to accept the negative as normal.  Are they happy?  I don't think so.  It boils down to the difference of perspective.  Proper outlook on your blessings will make you feel upbeat.  Focusing on the things that you don't have will make you feel beat up.  It all depends on which way you look at it.    Here's to a happy ending.....\\"This is happiness: bittersweet, often broken, a poem sometimes left unspoked -- full of longing and opportunity missed, made wise by sorrows that never last, a promise to ourselves, from deep in the past.  A future with fears which never arrive.  This is happiness -- this moment, this now -- this being alive.\\"  This is life!  Happy or not, this is what we strive for, simply being alive.	2004-06-25

It was written as a rebuff to BLIND MAN'S BLUFF written two years earlier which had exposed his activities working with the Polaris missile project. <br />Thus, he endeavors to present the facts by one who was involved from the very beginning on a four-decade program of undersea intelligence which must remain secret.<br />Our government is releasing highly classified information via the Internet, not just in Washington, but in Huntsville, AL where the Redstone Arsenal (full of missiles) is located.  I discovered this a few years ago from the secretary of one of the high offices.  Her job was to enter this information so that anyone anywhere in the world could have access to this important research which should have remained secret.<br />This book does not expound upon some of the projects, but now it is available to the public and to foreigners.  Just because the Soviet Union has fallen apart, that does not mean there are not other foes who can use this intelligence against us.<br />John Craven lives in Hawaii and has met with a group of the former submariners for a breakfast gathering the past twenty three years to recall things which are better left unsaid.  To wish it had not received the notoriety will be too late to protect this nation's safety.<br />The index helps to find the references he makes to the action taking place under the oceans.

Touted as on a par with WAR AND PEACE, also written by a Russian, this novel is red in every way.  The binding is even a vivid red, the most prominent color of the book jacket, also.  Published by Random House, this followup to a former major saga of Russian hierachy is by the author of eight previous novels.<br />He uses a lyrical manner in mingling fiction with historical characters (my favorite reading at the moment), this sequel and conclusion to GENERATIONS OF WINTER brings to life the major Russian leaders of which we have heard.  It is a game of shadows and light filled with Kremlin secrets and escapes from prison and labor camps in Russia by some of the characters, illuminating the Soviet experience with history of the Soviet Union.<br />This story follows the descendants of the Moscow surgeon Boris Gradov, who held a high-ranking medical position which puts him in the same surroundings with such as Lenin (original name, Ulyanov), Stalin who used the pseudonym meaning &quot;Steel&quot; and originally Dzhugashvili and it projects that he had six toes on his left foot, and others just as important.  <br />Nicholas II was the last Russian czar and was executed in 1918.  He is a peripheral figure, as is later Khrushchev (whom we all remember as taking off his shoe at the United Nations and hitting it on a table for the world to see).  The marvelous composer, Rimsky-Korsakov was also involved like so many others with the strange names so hard to pronounce but even harder to spell.<br />The hero of the Gradov family was termed a &quot;modern-day Titan.&quot;  Simile was the means to describe unthought of happenings; it is hard to decide whether they might have happened or are just figments of one's imagination.<br />The translators used descriptive terms and phrasing for mundane things.   John Glad had previously taught Russian literature at the University of Chicago, my son Geoffrey's alma mater.  Christopher D. Morris resided in Prague, a place where our inimitable editor of the alternative weekly paper in Knoxville, Barry Henderson, had held forth.<br />Vassily Aksyonov teaches at a university in Virginia and could not get published in the Soviet Union.  Besides writing fiction, he is a dramatist and screenwriter.  He remembers that Stalin, before becoming paranoid, used the cinema for the masses on a political and spiritual level in the spirit of socialism.<br />Sometimes the long, strangely-spelled Russian names got in the way of the story but overall it was a good eye's veiw of Russian life and politics.	2004-06-16

In this fourth installment of Jack Flippo, former lawyer turned private investigator, he's consumed with the possible conspiracy surrounding the JFK assassination in Dallas so many years ago.<br />Some dubious film has surfaced (again) which shows a gunman on the grassy knoll.  It was available back then but was covered up, thus the conspiracy theory.  All these years, the t.v. news shows have provided this 'proof'; yet, no one in government would even consider it.  J. Edgar Hoover kept all the evidence 'private' as he did the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King.<br />A friend of Jack's owns a &quot;you-are-there JFK deathmobile&quot; promoting this presence of a second gunman by taking groups of crackpots to the triple overpass there near the Texas School Book Depository where Lee Harvey Oswald was employed.<br />I still remember vividly watching live t.v. when Jack Ruby assassinated Oswald.  Was this meant to be?  Ruby was a part of the underworld of gangsters.  Was he set up as Oswald had been to take all the flak and be killed while some higher-ups in goverment got rid of our enigmatic president of the U.S.<br />At that time, as a young mother, I was doing some freelance secretarial work for an insurance adjuster by taking dictation at his home office and typing at mine.  That day, we'd been hard at work but I went down the hill in the historic part of Pulaski to prepare lunch for my family.  Around noon, ET, the radio announcement aired about President Kennedy being rushed to the hospital after being shot in the head.  I called Brandon Davis to see if he wanted me to return for more dictation and was told we'd try.  He, his wife Elsie, and I spent the next few days watching all the happenings on their t.v. set.  Needless to say, not much work took place.<br />I was appalled to see an innocent man gunned down while in custody of police, with his hands behind his back -- no way to defend himself.  In this fine country, each person who is arrested is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty and entitled to his day in court.  This 'right' was taken away from Lee Harvey Oswald with a national audience watching mesmerized.<br />Sometimes the guilty get away with murder (a la OJ) as our court system is flawed and money can buy freedom.  It's not the unknowns like Oswald, Sirkan, and James Earl Ray (all shady characters) who receive Justice.  One Chief of Police told me &quot;don't you know, there is no justice.&quot;<br />Freedom (from harming others) goes to those in power or have the money to hire important, nasty lawyers.  Jack was an honest man who was taken in by trying to prove something which will never be proved.  Lyndon Johnson made sure of that; after all, this master assassination took place in his state and he benefitted to the tune of being our most vulgar president ever.<br />Doug Swanson is a pretty good writer, but I wish he'd let Jack retire and find a &quot;Fletch&quot; (a la Gregory Macdonald).	2004-06-14

The song goes, \\"The best of times is here.\\"  I know it was not written during the Clinton years as President of this fine country.  The title of this book is deceptive (I think that Haynes Johnson did a bit of 'sleepwalking' himself through these turbulent years) as he admits later on that it was a time of lost opportunities.  How then, could these have been the 'best of times.'<br />     Far from the best, for some it was the worst.  Take for instance the debacle of the OJ trial which kept me and thousands of others tuned in to Court TV instead of getting on with our lives.  He tells in great detail starting with the stupidity played out with tv cameras showing the white Bronco merely going from one place to another.  There was no race or attempt at escape.  It was just dumb reporting. On hindsight, I think how stupid OJ was and the millions of his fans who tried to stand by him.  I too was stupid to sit day after day to learn all the details, only to be deceived with all the coverup and the final payoff when he is let go scot free.  What a country!  How could this possibly be ever a good time, certainly not a 'best' time.  It was a tragedy laid on the conscience of a country who should have let the man have his day in court without all the hoopla.<br />     Why Mr. Johnson even included Clinton in the title is mind boggling as he tore down all the man's image and laid out the dirty laundry.  Weren't we all told to keep one's sins to himself and not include innocent bystanders?  He may be a university teacher, but I wonder if he has morals of his own.<br />     He is trying to persuade us commoners that there has been a confirmation of the existence of extraterrestrial life somewhere out there.  I'm not sure my son believes that anymore, as he once did when a grad student in astronomy at the University of Chicago.  It seems we have enough intelligent life here on earth.  Why brain wash the public when nothing is confirmed?<br />     Who cares anyway whether we arealone in the vast universe?  Maybe they are true (these rumors) but suffice it to say, they (whoever, whatever they are) will not be like us.<br />     The Jet Propulsion Lab at Pasadena will not have the last word.  If you believe in God, you know that He has us here for a reason -- to love one another and to help your fellow man -- not to spend enormous sums to determine if aliens exist.  They are already here amongst us.<br />     More power to Bill Clinton who did the best he could with what he had to work with.  If these were the best of times, perhaps they were for him.  He had a ball there in the White House.  This commentator whom I have never heard or seen is clearly pro-Bush.	2004-06-05

This is a marvelous book written by a fabulous guy.  He told me the film which changed him was FRANKENSTEIN!  But I really think he was pulling my leg a little.  In case he was really telling me the truth, I'd suggest he see VAN HELSING.   This is a good addition to anyone's library if he has the slightest interest in the film world.  Nick had insider information and a life-long interest in movies.  After all, his sister Rosemary made many films, as has his son George.      The choices made for this publication were excellent and the accompanying photos added to Nick's commentary. The movie he looked for in vain has been written several times. At least,it seems like I've seen that storyline in more than one film through the years. His personal story of growing up as he did (similar to Civil War times) has been portrayed, but I'd love to see his version put on the big screen. Now that his son, George, is a producer and director, perhaps he could do the script as well and show his dad and two sisters as they were in childhood. All Nick Clooney fans would mob the theater to see the old days.    I miss Nick on the radio.  Whatever happened to his producer, Pat Monohan; guess he went to Texas.  They brought me great joy and I miss them.	2004-05-23

Of all her novels, this is by far my favorite of the McCrumb masterpieces, and I have read most (not all) of her diverse books. This one involves a woman who loves a sinner; he went to his death before he would divulge their relationship and cause her problems. Little did he know that by his actions, she would forever 'walk these hills' in a long black veil.<br />Before leaving the small town, I would call my local deejays of the morning to request the new release, SHE WALKS THESE HILLS, which gave them something to snicker about as it was an old, old song called THE LONG BLACK VEIL released in the fifties by Ferlin Husky.  I later learned that Johnny Cash also had a pretty good version.<br />Ms. McCrumb varies in her subject matter and researches her later books to some extent. This is one of her best.

Why should he put his life in danger to save others?  Was it because of the way he was 'rescued' as a child?  These are some pondering ideas to look for in this informative book.<br />Actually there are more than one rescue in this novel, the second much more exciting and dangerous though incidental to the story. Without the first, which came much too soon in the book, the psychological aspect would have been nil.<br />The 'hero' who volunteers for the fire dept. has a commitment problem to women without knowing the 'whys' or 'wherefores' -- thus had decided to become a bachelor and enjoy his friends' kids -- until he meets the inimitable Kyle.<br />They teach each other what life is day-to-day and that love conquers all. The child's mother, poor Denise, has never really known love, only one foolish, incidental sexual encounter. Her life was totally changed because of the boy's 'disability,' and she has devoted her life to teaching him. <br />That is, until they have the accident and are separated, with the hero finding them both. Romance is charmingly enunciated, causing me to smile a lot (at times) and want to hit him at others. <br />Only in a novel or movie would things work out this way. Or is there hope for happiness with a stranger. Sometimes it works out that way. When he was able to confront his past headon, he could live a normal life.  The baby made this book complete.<br />I was drawn to this book because of the child who has trouble talking as my youngest grandson also has this problem. I was hoping to learn something worthwhile in this instance and it was there past the half way point -- so it was of some benefit after all.	2004-05-22

This historical novel takes the reader on a tour of the construction of New York City from the earliest 'paths' to avenues. It's mystifying to see our theater district called The Broad Way.<br />Written by Beverly Swerling in a scholarly fashion in easy to read prose and based on extensive research in various historical collections available, it shows how life was not easy for those involved. She uncovered the 18th century 'world of wonders' preserved in a fragile condition, used actual records of the first hospital in New Amsterdam, and -- in the modern sense -- used research obtained on the Internet.<br />An old Native American belief: The old prevent the young from straying off the path of wisdom. The young yearn after the path of dreams. Between the two there is truth.<br />CITY OF DREAMS is a stirring saga of early Manhattan and the beginnings of medical science in this country. It follows several generations of the Turner Family (and their slaves), all involved in different forms of health care. Especially interesting is the way cocaine was used as a healing aid, similar to the way marijuana was touted to work some years ago. And the manner in which seaweed was used by the young Irish healer was something else. The romance between her and Morgan Turner, the pirate/rebel spy, was reminiscent of Rosemary Rogers' first impressionable novel about another Morgan, Steve, and Ginny -- way back in 1977.	2004-05-18

If this novel was intended to be a murder mystery, it surely took long enough to reach that point. For the most part, it was just mundane life of an unwed mother with a teenage son who ran away (for awhile), a sister living in a dream world, and a gay brother plus an abusive father who may have killed their mother for her money.<br />The plots came thick in a plodding way, hard to get through, with some unsavory characters with criminal pasts and suicide galore. This woman was as interested in getting involved with a strange stranger -- after all these years. <br />The only redeeming part of this sordid tale was finally learning who the father of her illegitimate son was, and why she had not married him. As in so many small towns of the South, the families get intermingled, as her lover's father had been her mother's lover. Read it to believe it.<br />The three siblings meet at an abandoned lighthouse which was in bad repair, as they had as youngsters. This book was loaded with beer talk and roughnecks at the local roadhouse where a nosey waitress heard something she should have ignored. Her interference cost this family almost all of the inheritance from the parents (both who died with days of each other under suspicious circumstances) and prompted the rejected brother to stage his own demise so they could use his life insurance.<br />The really 'bad' character had not died when he was supposed to, but it is his violent death at the end of the book which leaves the reader feeling she/he had been down among the lowlifes of this world.<br />Why she wrote this (unless it was biographical and she needed to get it out of her system) is beyond the realm of reasoning. I personally was glad to be rid of the whole affair.<br />This is as far from the scholarly writing of Beverly Swerling as you could possibly get. It is so mundane, dysfunctional, and modern in its subject matter.<br />Murder, unwed motherhood, gay brother, runaway son (shall I go on?) are just some of the sordidness in this account of an abusive father, unfaithful mother, and a lighthouse rendevous. The mother is found dead with a possible overdose of Xanax but has a mysterious bruise for which there is no plausible reason. Then the father is found dead in the abandoned, unsafe lighthouse where the siblings meet even after they are grown -- and grown apart.<br />The mother has inherited a fine home and money; the father is a banker. So, the rich don't exactly lead perfect lives or produce perfect children.<br />This story has little redeeming quality; instead of a 'good read' you come away feeling abused mentally. Miss Hightower may live in Tennessee, but thank goodness she bases it elsewhere.  We don't have lighthouses in Tennessee, but family conflict galore, ending in murder. It's always been that way here.	2004-05-18

This was one of the first books I reviewed for the Pulaski Magazine Club after a series of dull travel books.  Centering around the life of a strong, out-spoken woman (to whom I could most certainly identify) with an invincible spirit and no modesty in her letters to &quot;everyone.&quot; <br />Written in the form of letters, though it comes through much more like a diary, it spans more than half a century.  Beginning as a child in 1899 from Texas to June, 1968, in Dallas, these letters relate the tranquility and lack of opportunities in a small town to the turbulence in the city.  <br />Bess Stead Barner had a vivid personality backed with the strength and energy of a vibrant woman ahead of her time.  It is an intimate account of one woman's life which surely touches the lives of all who share it, and also those who read it.<br />In our Club, the reviewer had thirty minutes in which to explain the book without giving details; we were to induce a thirst from the members to read the book themselves.  At the time, I was the youngest member and very impressionable; I'd just started telling how this writer brought these people to life so that you felt you knew them and barely into my prepared review when the timekeeper said, &quot;five minutes,&quot; which meant I had to wrap up in a tidy manner ASAP.  <br />I was quite rattled as I had so much to tell about Bess and felt denied my 'time' in which to do it.  The timekeeper that day was a friend of mine, an old-maid college librarian who has a tendency to nod off and lose count of the time.  My other friend in the Club at the time was a college English teacher who told me later that 'Miss Barnes' really didn't know how long I had been talking and cut me short by some 10-15 minutes.  Oh well, the value of experience.<br />I'll keep this one short.  But this is one book which influenced me and my life to go on to do things a hard-headed, high-spirited young (now older) woman could do but probably shouldn't.	2004-05-01

This story concerns a failed politician who moves into a cabin in the woods to lick his wounds.  The scenery as described is absolutely gorgeous, and the lake plays a big part in the absence of his wife.  His despondency about the loss of an office he should have had and his lack of any kind of successful future leads him to do some very strange things.<br />When the loving wife is gone, he tries to lead the police astray with the idea that she took the boat out and rowed away all the way to Canada.  No body was ever found, so we really don't know what happened as the writer gives suppositions of how she would have disappeared on her own and the reasons for doing so.<br />The fact that he spent so much time in the boathouse the night of her disappearance certainly makes one suspicious of his actions.  When the heat gets too much for him, his neighbor (who loves to dauble in politics) lends him a good motorboat and a cell phone; he too disappears into the night.<br />Suspenseful and well-written, this story can be seen in your imagination as the author spins a webb of beauty in nature in the woods on the lake.  Too bad I can't swim or I might be tempted to search out such a place.	2004-04-26

Ellen relates the deviant behavior she learns from her older, disreputable husband and her unhealthy relationship with her foreign maid.<br />It also shows how a house is constructed against all odds and its deadly consequences.  Murders occur which are never explained and people disappear.<br />I want to think that this is a true story, but how could a well brought up woman write such filth?

On the cover of this book is the warning:  \\"This title may offend some readers.\\"  It wasn't the title but the language used by the writer which is offensive.  She is apparently from Georgia, a Southern state, but her resentment and low view of the wealthy and educated people show her status in life.    Even though it mentions such Confederate generals as Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate states at the time of the Civil War, (and Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States at the time), the only thing about Dixie is the theft of a diary purportedly written by a Civil War madam.    It reminds one of the movie IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL which also takes place in Georgia what with two murders by a prominent collector of antiques.  Our investigator is a 'has-been' with the police department and now cleans houses for a living.  She is crude, calculating, and not very professional.    Not at all what I thought I was getting into, but a slight diversion off the path of knowledge.  At a recent talk about Nathan Bedford Forrest, a UT professor called him white trash, which I refuted most vociferously as he not only hadn't done his homework; he had Forrest as being from Memphis, and he was born in Chapel Hill, TN, (not too far from Shelbyville, home of the Tennessee Walking Horses), who proved to be one of the most brilliant officers and calvary tacticians of that war.	2004-04-20

This book subtitled 'The Crime of the Century and Other Lost Stories' is nonfiction derived from his research which resulted in two of my favorite (of all time) novels, TIME AND AGAIN(1970) and its sequel, FROM TIME TO TIME (1986).<br />I'd never before seen illustrated novels and his first in 1970 was a classic.  It captured my imagination because of the drawings and the concept of time travel.  I mention these books in my review of the movie THE TIME MACHINE.<br />When the long-awaited sequel was released, I wanted to shout &quot;What took you so long?&quot; Now that I've met another researcher into the past named Jack (a local journalist who delves in the olden days of my hometown, Knoxville) I appreciate even more his hard work and writing abilities to bring his characters to life and make a believable story.<br />This crime is about the murder of a doctor in the 1880's similar to one of the 1900's Dr. Tarnower who was killed by his mistress.  He found pictures of the trial participants from the old newspapers of that day and actual evidence pertaining to the crime.<br />The other stories was just as interesting, especially that of Ida who was rescued from a burning building in New York by a person who later became one of his characters.  Even though she insisted her rescuer was the fireman climbing behind the bearded man (of the past), there was the picture to prove differently.<br />Jack Finney's unique illustrated novels interweaving the present with the past of the 1880's were a small portion of his numerous novels, some of which became famous movies.  He also had many in French and German.	2004-04-10

I had to cry and I read for enjoyment, not pain.  Sometimes I cry in movies like A WALK TO REMEMBER -- but that's entirely different, though it too was about a dying young woman.    When I read Norman Cousins' ANATOMY OF AN ILLNESS, I was young enough not to have chronic illnesses and appreciated his sharing his experiences.  From time to time, I have had to remember that humor and laughing do indeed help a person to heal, as he proved so well.  I could not read his THE HEALING HEART because that is what took my sister.  Thus, I really don't enjoy books which use a deadly illness as the theme.    I absolutely loved K. C. McKinnon's DANCING AT THE HARVEST MOON and have recommended it to others.  It's a love story of an older woman who fell in love with a younger man after she returned 'home' to look for her long-lost first love.  I can vouch for the possibility of love against all odds.  Even as we age, we still have that 'younger self' lurking just below the surface waiting to surface.  When the  right man comes along, whatever the age, you will know it.  But go slowly or you will scare him away with your wrinkles and lack of teeth.    This second book under this pseudonym of a Nashville writer whom I saw interviewed by John Seigenthaler on public t.v. there.  She admitted that she used her grandmother's name, so is it fair to assume that her first book was based on Mrs. McKinnon.	2004-04-10

She is a loving person and concludes in her ghostly world that it is not a state of mind but a way of being.

Why, then does he take credit for the entire book?I can't see much documented or which needs to be so.  I kept wondering what had been research and what from his imagination.<br />There was a discrepancy at the very beginning in his rendition of the Native American who was converted to Christianity.  Is it true that they regard any person not Indian as 'white'?  That's strange, to say the least.<br />We endured such savage blood-thirsty cruelty in this account of a useless war.  But, most of them are -- as they occur.  It is the consequences some years on down the road which make them neccesary at that time.<br />I was most frustrated with this writer's use of prepositions at the end of long, rambling sentences.

Our local historian does just that constantly, and most folks believe that what he is writing is the truth.<br />This most-prolific writer does just that with his childhood remembrances. Seems to me he had a privileged and good life; maybe the father moved on to create another family, but he did not abandon or forget his firstborn son.<br />I just wish he had presented more of the humanness of Rudy Winston whose specialty was the liquor business (man, he would fit in here in Knoxville where the yuppie newcomers sit out on the sidewalk on Gay Street and drink hard liquor openly -- and get away with it).<br />He was a fine-looking man, and his son is handsome enough to be in one of those movies he has collaborated on with David Lynch.	2004-03-07

Merely a sequel to HOT SPRINGS, using some of the same characters in a more exotic locale some seven years later, but his \\"Big Noise\\" is nastier and on a much grander scale.<br />Mr. Hunter was winner of a Pulitzer Prize in 2002 and seems on a downhill slide.  He does pepper this one with luminaries such as Ernest Hemingway and Desi Arnaz, and the orator/attorney Castro who went on to take Cuba and keep it.  He was clearly a man of destiny.<br />This continuing saga of Earl (a big man like J. Edgar Hoover) shows the sordidness of life in the fifties there.  Much of the action takes place at Carnival in 1953.  <br />He had settled down in Arkansas after the fiasco at Hot Springs and even come to terms with the memory of his brutal father -- so much so as to move his wife and son to the family farm and carry on with his life.  Teaching his nine-year-old to kill innocent animals, just as his dad had started him on the road to death and destruction, he is lured to another adventure from which he may not return.<br />Apparently lacking some common sense, he faces down the evil gangsters in a corrupt world of lust, gambling, Russian takeovers, and petty criminals.  Triumph, revenge, justification, and retribution were the goals of this gunfighter.  The Russians were treacherous, always ready with blackmail.  Everybody respects the warrior, right?<br />I hope Mr. Hunter will move on and get out of this hole he has made.  Everybody's a 'pawn in someone else's game' at times.

He uses poetry to describe his feelings of \\"driving through history to the future.\\"<br />However, he's not sophisticated enough to endure the harshness of the weather and the Northerners.  He is the son with the conscience, so he returns the car and takes the train on another adventure.  A year after his experiences on the Tar River, he sets out to work on his major project, which turned into a memorial for his brother Moody.  A mountaintop feels closer to Heaven, just as I felt the first time I went to Oneida, TN.<br />Morgan is poetical in his descriptions of the wonders along the way, but I wish he knew grammar a little better.

Sharyn McCrumb is the consummate storyteller, mainly based on old ballads. Sometimes, she takes an oldtime yarn instead as is the basis for this newest rendering of hers. This one could have been called the Ballad of Sam Blalock.<br />She is too young to know firsthand the dialect and oldtime sayings she uses in this book. One in particular took my attention, &quot;as the war wore on....&quot; but on page 281 I was perturbed by her use of &quot;a barking cat&quot; -- surely this got past the editors. I've had cats as pets since 1979 and have yet to hear one bark. Tosca growled like a dog when she ate when we first got her, but she had lived in the country and had to eat the same as the dogs. <br />Her versatility is beyond compare. She peoples this book with luminaries such as Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Generals Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart and the infamous Tom Dooley. Some of these folks are supposed to be real, others are carry overs from her other novels of the Appalachians (like old friends).<br />Politics are still the same, just as dirty and biased. It's good to know that today's leaders are not so original after all.<br />Using a young man as the main character is unusual for a woman writer, I think, but she gets into his mind and it comes off well. He is the real star of this book though he is peripheral and supposedly a minor character. After all, he is the one who actually sees and talks with the Ghost Riders.<br />The story is as well told as all her previous books. She is my favorite writer so I do have some of her best, others I passed on to people to introduce her style and expertise in Appalachian folklore.<br />This is entertaining and informative. She bases her stories on fact then elaborates -- as all good novelists do. She states that historians may indeed be fallible or even mendacious, but most are serious writers in their own right.	2004-01-26

This hiking book, when it first came out, was so funny as he describes how he and his friend maneuver around to get on the Appalachian Trail at intervals, not try to cover the entire thing.  He endures the great outdoors at much travail and worry of bears entering his tent at night.  They once did see a bear, but it was not a huge or overactive (so-called dangerous) animal.  <BR>He gives entertaining and amusing anecdotes about falling in the water and of the deplorable amenities at the campgounds near the Great Smoky Mountains (where they get a cab into Knoxville, and rent a car to go on up into the West Virginia hills to resume the 'hike').  He yearns for a comfortable bed at night and good-tasting food.  This prompted me to write to him about traversing the Natchez Trace through Middle Tennessee where such is not only available but plentiful.<BR>This was definitely a feel-good book, one to make you laugh with (not at) Bill Bryson and his fellow hiker-friend.  He's a good writer and should stick to this type of endeavor.	2003-06-10
