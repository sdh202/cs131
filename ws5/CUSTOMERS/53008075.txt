That's not to say it is the best western written, or that Grey is the best western writer. The book is pretty good, I rather enjoyed it. There are negatives, one is the way he portrays Mormons, though I'm not sure if it is \\"accurate\\" since I'm not sure how Mormons acted in the 19th century, but it could be considered offensive. Grey's characters are also weak. They tend to be either stereotypical or one-dimensional. And his dialog is laughable. But Grey shines in his landscape descriptions. Truly a beautiful picture he can paint with words. His stilted dialogue is made up for by his beautiful descriptive passages. The book is also rife with symbols--Grey can work (whether intentional or not) in many levels. It has it's problems, but it is an enjoyable book. Any fan of the Western should read it, and maybe even thoughs who don't visit the genre often.	2005-09-14

It has turned out to be a good choice. Sure Strobel doesn't present everything or even both sides (interviewing a rebuttal expert would have been a welcomed addition). And some of the arguements were weak, like the section on archeology (though I feel that was more the fault of his expert than the evidence out there), the chapter \\"Was Jesus Convinced That He Was teh Son of God?, the psychological evidence, the chapter on the evidence of his appearances after death, and the final chapter, the circumstantial evidence. But even after that is said, Strobel's book makes a strong case for the life of Christ as the Son of God. The book makes no apologies for being a book supporting Christianity, but then that is what it is. It's sure to be a true joy for those with faith and I think is valuable for those searching, though only as a starting place and not where you want to stop.	2005-08-22

She helped usher in a new ages of poetry, of personal poetry. She is the author of \\"Daddy\\" which is on my list of top ten poems, and found in this collection. When she died, she had this manuscript on her desk. Ted Hughes published it, but with some major changes. Her daughter Frieda Hughes (also a poet) has published the restored version, the last version Plath herself had created. And this is a very different book, not as dark, since some of her last poems, her darkest, were not in this collection originally (though Ted Hughes put them in his version). It's true we don't know exactly what the final version Plath would have published, since she was constantly revising the book, but this is a valuable book to have. And not just because of the poetry. It also contains facsimilies of the manuscript of the the poem \\"Ariel\\" and you can see genius at work. This is a valuable book and even if you have her Collected Poems (and you should), you should still pick up this book.	2005-08-08

My biggest fault with the book was that while it does contain all of his paintings, most are in thumbnails, and black and white on top of that.

As you read the six books, you can see Rowling's evolution as a writer. Her characters get fuller, the plot thicker, and her skills just improve greatly from one novel to the next. I though Order of the Phoenix was great, and that perhaps she had reached her apex as a writer. I was wrong. Book six is a great book, one of the best works of fiction I have read this year (providing, of course, you've read the first five books and have gotten to know and care about the characters--and that is something Rowling does well: makes you really care about these characters and what happens to them). It is by far the best of the series (after reading Phoenix I was ready for the next book, but had no trouble waiting, but I tell you, waiting for the final book is going to be agony, the story has gotten that good). It's also the most mature and darkest of the books, while still being appropriate for younger audiences. But it is a dark book, which I'm sure is one reason why I liked it so much. People say that a book is so good that you can't put it down, but this one that isn't just a saying, it is the truth. Especially the last 150 pages or so. I stayed up later than I had planned to because I couldn't go to sleep until I finished the book. This book is really the capstone of the series. In fact, it's so good, that I recommend reading the Potter series just so you can get to this book and read it with the full impact that is intended.	2005-07-19

That is the meaning of this happy hour: colour and I are one. I am a painter.\\" --Paul Klee <br /> <br />This book contains 48 full-color plates. They are of high quality and full page (I'm not sure the exact dimensions of the book, but it is quite large). I'm not sure how I feel about Klee's work as a whole, since there isn't a large enough sample contained here, but the paintings contained in this book are amazing, or most of them are at least. Klee was truly an astounding artist. That, though, brings up my only fault with the book, it is such a brief book that you don't get enough of Klee's work. Hopefully there are other surveys of his work out there, one that is more complete. And if not, I hope that one soon will be, from what I've seen here, he certainly deserves one.  <br /> <br />The book starts with a medium length essay by Douglas Hall, who I understand to be one of the world's leading experts on Klee. It's not as inclusive as a book-length biography, but Hall definitely gives you a fair sense of Klee's life and a good idea of how to look at Klee's work. He goes in depth on several of the paintings represented within.  <br /> <br />I believe this book is out of print so you will have to go to your local library and check out a copy, but it is worth doing so, so that you can get an introduction to one of our more important artists.	2005-07-16

He discusses growing up in New York in the post WWII years and his early years as a newspaperman, though not much time is spent on his life in the business (I wish he had spent some more time on what it has been like for him to be a reporter). It some ways Hamill fits the stereotype of the hard drinking, tough newspaper reporter, but he also breaks that mold with a sensitity and intelligence rarely seen in his line of work anymore. And this is a nice study of art, it'll give you some good artists to start with, and what it's like to struggle with being an artist. Hamill makes no excuses for his drinking or the ways that it affected his life, but unlike many other drinking memoirs, he doesn't preach, and the sole focus isn't to push a 12 step program, rather it is to warn about the dangers of alcoholism and tell the story one man's (interesting) life.	2005-07-15

It's the story of how alcohol slowly takes over, consumes, and ruins the lives of an alcoholic. But it is also the story of hope. It is the story of how one alcoholoc found help and recovery in the walls of AA and regained her life. It's an uplifting book and one that anyone with a substance abuse problem should read, though you don't have to be an alcoholic or addict to enjoy this book or get something out of it.

It took me back to my middle school days, except I learned more about politics in this book than I ever did in my school days (much as I learn more about current events from The Daily Show than I do from CNN).

Jake is back. Eddie and Susannah (formerly known as Odetta/Detta) are fully developed as characters. The story is fleshed out and much more takes place. Even Roland is a more three dimensional character in this installment, whereas he was almost a two dimensional stereotype in the other two volumes. I've said King hit his stride in volume 2, and the story really did, but this is where it gets really good and really sucks you in. It works on many levels. The only problem is the cliffhanger that King leaves you with at the end. Sort of a cheap shot, especially when you consider how long it takes King to write another Dark Tower book. Though now that the series is complete and you can read it all from start to finish, the cliffhanger isn't that big of a problem. But it sure was back then. If you weren't real keen on volume one, you have to give volumes 2 and 3 a try. And even though 3 is better than 2, if you didn't like 2, I'm not real sure that 3 will bring you into the saga. ALthough it might. give it a try.	2005-07-10

This is a very poetical book. Canty's prose is a lyrical prose. It's a melancholy book that has a certain hopeful hopelessness to it. It's the story of an over-the-hill, overweight poet who is past his artistic prime who gets a teaching position in an out of the way school. His marriage is over as is his career. He has lost his talent and his life to alcoholism. While at this school he meets a troubled young student. These two people are drawn to each other and in each other find each other's salvation, of a sorts. It's a haunting story, one that ranks with any of the finest pieces of literature written. This is a book that you simply must read. And the cover art fits the story wonderfully.	2005-07-10

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Gunslinger, but The Drawing of the Three is where the story really starts to pick up and become the classic it has become. It is the story of Roland picking up two of his three companions, the heroin addict Eddie, and the crippled, multiple personality Oddetta/Detta. King's characters are vivid, and you have to wonder, where does he come up with this stuff (come on, lobstrosities...).  Even if you weren't a big fan of volume one, you have to try volume two before you give up on your quest for the Tower. I think you'll find you'll want to continue on.	2005-07-09

Personally, I think it is his best work. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, Jake, the man in black, and the Dark Tower. It's a series of interrelated long short stories. And you can tell it is an older piece of King's, it reads like an older work of King's (even though he has somewhat revised it slightly in this latest edition). But still, even though it hasn't the narrative speed the other volumes has, it has its charm, and it is vital in introducing us to the character of Roland and Roland's quest. If you haven't started this series yet, why wait? He's finished the story. Get to it.	2005-07-09

He uses long lines--ten feet of iambic pentameter. The story is of a young mother, Iris, and her search for family and for the meaning in the poetry of Robinson Jeffers. Section one is as good as you are going to find in narrative poetry. I will admit that section two is rather weak. But he rises again in section three, wich is rather good, it doesn't rise up to what you find in section one, but then what could, but still, it is quite good. I highly recommend this book as an example of what narrative poetry should be.	2005-07-07

And April Lindner brings a nice sensibility to this project. They cover the full range of poets and poetic schools, each with header notes. And unlike many other anthologies of contemporary poetry that I've seen, this one is affordable and has one of the best mixes of poets I've seen. My only complaint is that you won't find any poems by either Gwynn or Lindner within, and both are phenomenal poets. But I understand that they had limited space and chose to cut themselves out.

You'll find some of my favorite poems: Frost's \\"Fire and Ice\\", William Blake's \\"A Poison Tree\\", \\"WC Williams \\"The Savage Beast\\", Thoreau \\"Indeed indeed, I cannot tell\\", and Dylan Thomas' \\"Do not go gentle into that good night.\\" You'll also find poems by Frank O'Connor, Yeats, Eliot, J.V. Cunningham, Snodgrass, and A.D. Hope. Section 2, \\"Nearest But Not Dearest\\" has one of my top ten poems, Sylvia Plath's \\"Daddy\\", as well as poems by Shakespeare (Lear's curse on Goneril), Shelley, Frank O'Connor, Ted Hughes, Alan Dugan, and John Ciardi's poem \\"Censorship.\\" Section 3, \\"Sexual Skirmishes,\\" while not having any truly spectuacular poems, does contain poems by J.V. Cunningham, Margaret Atwood, Snodgrass, Robert Graves, William Meredith, Anthony Hecht, John Donne, WC WIlliams, and Gary Snyder. Section 4 is titled \\"Personal Animosities\\" and contains the poets Ted Hughes, D.H. Lawrence, Jonathan Swift, William Blake, Pope, Tennyson, Robert Graves, Joyce, Ginsberg, Dickinson, hardy, SNodgrass, Cunningham, Robert Browning, A.R. Ammons, and Robert Frost. Section 5, \\"Collective Detestations,\\" has poems by Milton, D.H. Lawrence, Heaney, Coleridge, James Wright, Kunitz, and Philip Larkin. You'll find H.D.'s \\"Helen\\" in section 6, \\"Nobles, Statesmen, Prelates, and Top Brass.\\" There you'll also find the poets Andrew Marvell, Pope, Shelley, Lord Byron, Ben Jonson, THomas Gray, Tim Steele, Robert Burns, Richard Wilbur, cummings, Milton, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Siegfried Sassoon. Section 7, \\"Poets, Critics, and Scholars,\\" contains John Skelton, Dryden, Swift, Pope, Burns, Landor, Robert Browning, Hemingway, Roethke, Nemerov, Cowper, Donald Hall, and a great poem by John Frederick Nims called \\"Eminent Critic.\\" The short section 8 called \\"Offending Race of Humankind\\" contains poems by Shakespeare (Timon's curse of Athens and mankind), Milton, Swift, Nims, Housman, Levine, and Kingsley Amis. \\"Dmaned Abstractions\\", section 9 has poems by Pound, Spenser, Blake, Poe, Kipling, cummings, Galway Kinnell, Yeats, and Philip Larkin. You'll find \\"The Crow\\" a great poem by Robert Creeley in section 10, \\"This Vile Created World\\". You'll also find Shakespeare (Lear's speach to teh storm), Pound, Ransom, Shapiro, Herman Melville, and Snodgrass here. Section 11 is \\"Self-Loathing\\". This is where you'll find William Cowper's poem [LInes written during a brief period of instanity], Peter Davison's \\"The Cost of Pretending\\", and Stephen Crane's \\"The Heart.\\" YOu'll also find Whitman, Emily Bronte, Gerard Manley HOpkins, Cunningham, Betjeman, Roethke, and Robinson Jeffers. THe final section is \\"Against Hate\\" which has a great poem by Gary Gildner called \\"First Practice.\\" Also is Auden, Tennyson, John Scott, Gibbons Ruark, Anne Sexton, Bly, Harry Edwards, Yvor Winters, Linda Pastan, and ending the book is Edwin Muir. This anthology is out of print, so it may be hard to find, but it is worth it.	2004-12-26

I wouldn't have thought this book would be interesting to anyone who wasn't an English student or teacher, writer, editor, or someone else in the field. It goes to show you, you never can tell what is going to catch on. The book is well-written and really delves into matters of punctuation. One warning, it was written in England, so some of the rules are a little different than what we have over here.	2004-12-25

The first contains a handful of Wiman's shorter poems. And to be honest, there is nothing particularly spectacular about them. That being said, section two is a long narrative, the title poem. And it is pretty good. It covers the life of woman growing up in West Texas in the early part of this century. Wiman writes very well in her voice and keeps her an interesting character. The story is an interesting one and he keeps the narrative flow going quite well. While I wasn't impressed with the poems in section one, I will be buying this book for the title poem.	2004-12-16

Lumsden's early work, _Yeah Yeah Yeah_ and _The Book of Love_ contains an overall work that isn't too bad (and here is where you'll find the great poem \\"Always\\"). But it isn't enough to carry the book. The new poems are weak and trite. And the previously unpublished sonnet sequence, Cavoli Riscaldati and his collection _Roddy Lumsden is Dead_ is just plain bad. There's nothing real great here. And I had such high hopes for this collection. <br /> <br />Always <br /> <br />After the full-day's westward drive you find <br />the house familiar from a photograph, <br />its brass-hung door thrown wide. <br /> <br />A meeting party welcomes you: up front, <br />the matriarch, corn hair tied in a bunch, <br />the husband of few words <br /> <br />and, in behind two sniffly, smutty boys <br />you'll take a good few days to tell apart, <br />a gran'ma, blunt and blouse. <br /> <br />It's then that you sense her, in and down the hall, <br />so vague, at first you take her for a shadow <br />or portrait on the wall, <br /> <br />the daughter who, that night, will steal in slow <br />to visit you with kisses coarse and sweet, <br />to gift you with her heat, <br /> <br />and who through the remainder of the week <br />won't speak again, although you send her notes, <br />whose name you never know. <br /> <br />And always this will whittle at your wits-  <br />the way she gave her nightdress to the floor, <br />one finger to her lips <br /> <br />to call aboard the silence of the land <br />to forge the night-time colours in her hair-  <br />until you grow unsure <br /> <br />of what was real and what was in the wind, <br />of all that being meant before and since <br />that single word she said. <br />	2004-12-11

This book is phenomenal. Justice almost doesn't write a bad poem, and he writes many great ones. He has a formal mastery and a mastery of free verse. Justice has a way with words, metaphor, imagery, the line, with everything that makes a poem great that few of his contemporaries have. And this spans his career. You get his early great work, which includes the poems \\"On the Death of Friends in Childhood,\\" \\"Thus,\\" \\"Women in Love,\\" \\"A Winter Ode to the Old Men of Lummus Park, Miami, Florida,\\" \\"Counting the Mad, \\"Men at Forty\\" (his best poem), \\"To the Unknown Lady Who Wrote the Letters Found in a Hatbox,\\" \\"The Grandfathers,\\" \\"The Telephone Number of the Muse\\"--to his midcareer greats (my favorite being \\"My South\\"), and even in his seventies he still continuted to write great poems (see \\"Ralph: A Love Story\\" in the New Poems section). He's truly a master. <br /> <br />Men at Forty <br /> <br />Men at forty  <br />Learn to close softly <br />The doors to rooms they will not be <br />Coming back to. <br /> <br />At rest on a stair landing, <br />They feel it moving <br />Beneath them now like the deck of a ship, <br />Though the swell is gentle. <br /> <br />And deep in mirrors <br />They rediscover <br />The face of the boy as he practices tying <br />His father's tie there in secret, <br /> <br />And the face of that father, <br />Still warm with the mystery of lather. <br />They are more fathers than sons themselves now. <br />Something is filling them, something <br /> <br />That is like the twilight sound <br />Of the crickets, immense, <br />Filling the woods at the foot of the slope <br />Behind their mortgaged houses. <br />	2004-11-30

That is because Dan Brown writes a book that is gripping and interesting. His characters come to life. He is the master of the cliffhanger--each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and there are over a hundred chapters in the book. And it is full of all kinds of arcane knowledge. This is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it to everyone.	2004-11-17

So it really came to no surprise that I found myself enjoying The Taking. It is well written, full of suspense, though the characters are as fully realized as they could be. The ending is weak though and overly religious. This book does remind me of a cross between Stephen King (specifically \\"The Mist\\" and The Stand) and M. Knight Shymalan. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend the book, but for some light reading, it's enjoyable.	2004-11-06

This anthology helps remedy that. Admittedly it only gives a partial sense of what is going on over there, but still, we get a good idea. And it is filled with some great poetry. Sure there is a few bad poems and some mediocre poems, but there is a lot of great poetry in this anthology. There are great poems by Michael Donaghy (though the editors missed a couple of Donaghy's best poems), James Fenton, Carol Ann Duffy, Glyn Maxwell, Andrew Motion, and Roddy Lumsden. And at least one really good poem by Ian Duhig, Christopher Reid, Anne Rouse, and Jo Shapcott.	2004-11-02

And it is a great book. It's divided into five sections, each named after a city in Louisiana. The best by far is the first, New Orleans. I will say Natchitoches, the final section was pretty weak, except for the poem \\"On the Departure of My Guest.\\" Kane writes in form excellently. She does a lot of villanelles, and though I thought I'd get tired of reading so many of them, I didn't. She handles the villanelle very well. And, as you would guess from the title, alcohol plays a big part in this book. Many of the poems have bartender or a bar or something alcohol related in the title. But once again, you don't get tired of it because she handles it well. This is a really good first collection. If you are a fan of Kim Addonizio, Everette Maddox, or Sara Cortez, then you'll definitely like this book. Some poems to take note of are: \\"Maraschino Cherries,\\" \\"Villanelle for Thel,\\" \\"Mapleworld,\\" and \\"Booker Again.\\" Once again, this is a great book.	2004-10-14

I recommend \\"Four Secretaries\\", \\"In Passing\\", \\"A Statue of the Unknown Soldier\\", and \\"Weather Central.\\" The poems seem to be a bit longer than what he usually writes, though the rest of Kooser's characteristics are here. He still is plainspoken. He is still a simple poet. He's still a poet everyone can love.	2004-10-06

They just weren't great poems and they didn't personally reach out to me. My biggest fault with the poems was that they seemed to be held at a distance from the reader. There was a certain amount of coldness for lack of a better word. They were very musical, both in subject matter (most poems dealt with music in one way or another) and in her style of writing. Schoerke handles both formal verse and free verse very well. I think she has a lot of promise as a poet and I'm curious to see where she develops from here.	2004-10-06

He is known as a regionalist, though his poems speak to people from all over the country. And his selected poems show you exactly the skill of this poet. Kooser is the master of the short poem and of the simple poem. He is a pleasure to read. This collection contains such fine poems such as \\"Selecting a Reader\\", \\"Spring Plowing\\", \\"A Summer Night\\", \\"Carrie\\", \\"A Hairnet with Stars\\" and \\"Abandoned Farmhouses\\" (which might be his best poem). I highly recommend this collection.	2004-10-06

The poems are concise and written in that plainspoken style Kooser has perfected. And Kooser speaks a poetic language we can all understand. There are five poems that really stand out in the collection. \\"Tattoo\\" deals with the fading and aging not just of a man's tatoo, but in a way, of man himself. It's a simply elegant poem. \\"At the Cancer Clinic\\" is perhaps the finest poem in the book. Very elegant. Very simple. And wonderful. \\"A Rainy Morning\\" compares the operation of a wheelchair with the playing of a piano, which is a fresh and vibrant metaphor, at least in Kooser's hands. \\"Memory\\" is atypical of Kooser. It is longer than most of his poems and is one marathon sentence that employs more poetic tricks than one is used to seeing in his poetry. But it suceeds and very well. And finally \\"Mother\\" which I think you can only appreciate by reading. Kooser's poems speak (much like his predecessor Billy Collins) to the common reader. That isn't to say that his poems aren't worth rereading. You gain much by revisiting a Kooser poem. He is one of the best writing today.	2004-10-06

Eliot: Collected Poems, 1909-1962 (The Centenary Edition)	Books	5	40	45	N	N	Truly, one of the giants	When you think of the best poets ever, T.S. Eliot is one of those that comes to mind. His work is well crafted, intelligent, beautifully written, and has a flow to it that few poets can match. And this is a fine collection for the Eliot lover or for the reader unfamiliar with Eliot. It's divided into several sections. The first section is his Prufrock section, poems from 1917, which contains probably his finest poems: \\"Prufrock\\", \\"Preludes\\" \\"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\\", \\"Hysteria\\", among others. Then there is the Poems 1920 section which also contains many fine poems (\\"Sweeney Erect\\" and \\"The Hippopotamus\\" being my favorites). Then follows his masterpiece The Wasteland. Then The Hollow Men which is followed by the wonderful Ash Wednesday. Then the Ariel Poems (which contains \\"Journey of the Magi\\"). Then there are two unfinished poems, \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" and \\"Coriolan\\" which I thought were weak. Maybe they would have been great had he ever finished them. Then there is a section called minor poems followed by the mediocre \\"Choruses from 'The Rock.' And then there is what I consider to be his true masterpiece, \\"Four Quartets.\\" And the book finishes with some occasional verses, one of which is a sweet and touching poem to his wife. This is a great collection of poems.	2004-08-28

There is nothing I can say to top what has been said already, but what I can do is add my two cents of approval. I actually prefer this book over Turco's Book of Forms. It reads better and explains the forms better. This books covers a wide variety of traditional and experimental forms of poetry. And Finch and Varnes pulled together a diverse group of poets, from R.S. Gwynn and Dana Gioia to Maxine Chernoff and DJ Renegade. From Anthony Hecht to Paul Hoover. There's Tim Steele, Jan Hodge, X.J. Kennedy, Agha Shahid Ali, Maxine Kumin, Charles Bernstein, adn Billy COllins. You get all styles of poets and poetry within. For any serious poet, this is a must have book. And it is loaded with great examples of each type it discusses.	2004-08-27

He is pretty much unanimously considered one of the best of his generation. This book combines two of his volumes of poetry. One of those volumes is his masterpiece Life Studies--the reason why he is a giant in American poetry. This is his seminal work. No matter how you look at it, this is an important book of poetry. And an excellent book of poetry. Most of the poems are good and there are several phenomenal poems within. Life Studies alone belongs on any serious poetry connoisseur's shelf. Also in this book is arguably Lowell's second best collection (only Lord Weary's Castle might be better) For the Union Dead, which contains another masterpiece, \\"For the Union Dead\\" (and a favorite of mine \\"Hawthorne\\"). This is a book that poetry lovers of all kinds should have.	2004-08-16

And the reason is that he is a very dark poet, and a very interesting one at that. Kees is slightly outside of academia, though his reputation is getting bigger. I found his earlier work to be better than his later work, that's not to say that there isn't good stuff in his later work, just that I preferred his early work. I'd also recommend you did up a good biography of Kees, since he also has an interesting life.	2004-08-15

Roethke is one of our American masters. I found that when he was on his game (as he was in the poems above, among others) his poetry was phenomenal, but when he wasn't, his poetry could be awful. His earlier work is better than his later work, though he seems to have gotten most of his recognition for his later work. Still, for the poetry lover this is pretty much a required volume for your shelves.	2004-08-15

He has some great essays on Plath, Auden, Moore, among others. There are a few dull essays.

But I do think Whitehead is a poet that is underappreciated and not as well known as he should be. He has the wonderfully concise poems written in the most interesting of voices under the most ridiculously long titles. Whitehead is the perfect blend of colloquialism and intelligence. I do recommend you pick up his collections of poetry. They are hard to get a hold of, but worth finding.	2004-08-12

Boy was I disappointed. Fenton spent too much time trying to be political or to vague in his writing. There were a couple of bright spots in the collection. The title poem is one of the best he has ever written and there is another poem, \\"In Paris With You\\" which isn't a great poem, but it is a charming one that I think you'll find as wonderful as I do.	2004-08-12

There is something familiar about the novel. But that is because, like all good stories, it feels like coming home, to use an old cliche. It has well drawn characters, and Clayton very skillfully draws you into the drama of his people. The one weakness of the book is a slight predictability. Many times you are able to see things coming long before they happen, but still, the journey is fun, even if you know the outcome. It isn't like most Vietnam novels, and I'd recommend it.	2004-07-19

Harry Potter is the pop culture phenomenon that has gotten children to read again. And it really is a well-written, wonderful series. Quite engaging for both young and old. In fact, I sometimes wonder of those of us a bit older might be getting more from the books. As the series goes on, the books become increasingly complex (and long). This Potter book is 800 pages, but after the first couple of chapters, they just fly by as the story, intricate, complex and drawn out pulls you in. This is by far the best book in the series, and while I wouldn't stand in line for hours at midnight to buy it, I would recommend this book.	2004-07-14

It isn't like, say me for example. Gioia is extremely well informed and knows what he is talking about. So you get a really good collection of essays. But that is what this is, just a collection of essays that are only connected by the fact that they discuss British poets. Now don't get me wrong, these are great essays and you can't go wrong reading them, I just wish that Gioia had rewritten them to make them more cohesive as a whole, to really give us a picture of British poetry. Several of the essays were just reviews of books, and the Larkin essay was a review of Andrew Motion's biography of Larkin. Gioia would have done better to have discussed Larkin, Burgess, Ted Hughes, Amis, Dick David, Gunn, etc, like his opening essay (The Barrier of a Common Language: New British Poetry in the Eighties) and his essay on Fenton and Causley. These are well written and good essay/reviews. I just think that we would have been better served by something that was more cohesive and not just a collection of previously published essays and reviews. Still, they are good.	2004-07-08

The language is more or less uneventful and flat and the poems are unremarkable. That isn't to say that there is nothing good about this collection. The opening poem, about a photograph of her mother, is a really good poem (which gave me high hopes for the rest of the collection) and there is a great poem on the death of her cousin, &quot;For My Cousin, Found in a Ravine&quot;.

Not only is Hardy one of the best poets ever (easily top five in the English language), but Mezey does a great job at putting together this collection. He selects the best of Hardy's poetry and a highly representative selection as well. His introduction is very well written and highly informative. It's like taking a quick class on Hardy. The poems are very much annotated, almost too much, but the notes are at the back of the book, so they are unobtrusive. There is a chronology and Mezey includes a few quotes, some of them quite witty, from Hardy. And all for an affordable price. You really can't beat this, and Hardy is one of those poets that should be on everyone's shelf.<br />A quick list of my favorite Hardy poems: Hap; Neutral Tones; At a Hasty Wedding; The Last Chrysanthemum; The Darkling Thrush; Mad Judy; The Ruined Maid; The Man He Killed; Channel Firing; Ah, Are You Digging on My Grave?; Without Ceremony; The Haunter; The Voice; His Visitor; She Charged Me; At Tea; Over the Coffin; In the Moonlight; Near Lanivet, 1872; Something Tapped; The Ballet; A Backward Spring; At a Country Fair; A Night in November.	2004-06-24

One of my favorite books of poetry (April Lindner's Skin) won it. And now another winner has become one of my favorites. Catherine Tufariello has written a wonderful and beautiful book. It is a collection of formal poetry that shows a mastery of someone that you would have expected to have been writing much longer than she has. The book is divided into five sections. Section one contains seven well written poems. Section two contains several of my favorite poems. &quot;Snow Angel&quot; is a wonderfully written villanelle (which is difficult to do well). &quot;The Mirror&quot; is a sonnet that deals with divorce is such an original way. &quot;Ghost Children,&quot; another sonnet, takes on the inability to have children--describing the features of their unconceived children in such beautiful language that you can picture the child and mourn its loss. It's a masterful poem. One of my favorites, &quot;Keeping My Name,&quot; takes on the issue of her last name, and it is a mouthful. After all the seriousness we've had, this bit of lightness falls in perfectly here. Section three are translations of Cavalcanti, Guinizelli, and Petrarch. Section four starts with Lorenzo Lotto's Annunciation and then goes into a series of biblical poems, several of which (&quot;No Angel,&quot; &quot;Rebekah I,&quot; and &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;) are truly some of her best work. It's really a great collection of poetry and after reading it, it has become one of my favorite collections, one I'm recommending to everyone I talk to.	2004-06-24

It's longer than your normal poetry collection. It contains two of my favorite Fairchild poems, &quot;Brazil,&quot; and &quot;Rave On.&quot; And the centerpiece of this collection is Fairchild's long narrative &quot;The Blue Buick,&quot; which truly shines at some points. With this collection Fairchild proves again what kind of phenomenal poet he is.	2004-06-24

Fennelly's debut collection of poetry was one of the best collections I have read. It was really phenomenal, so when I heard that her new collection came out, I got very excited and ran out and bought it. Then I read it. This is really a bad book. The language is flat. It is syrupy. And I know children are a joy, but for crying out loud, find a new topic. It's not that they were pretty much all (with one or two exceptions) motherhood poems, it's that they were bad motherhood poems. No, avoid this book and go grab Open Houses if you don't already have it. This collection is really a disappointment.	2004-06-17

While it doesn't have anything as ambitious as &quot;The Country I Remember,&quot; it does have one of the best poems Mason has written, &quot;New Zealand Letter,&quot; in fact the best poem he's written outside of his great narrative. This book is also loaded with many other short gems, such as &quot;The City,&quot; and &quot;Winter 1963&quot; which is a great poem dealing with both the deaths of Robert Frost and Sylvia Plath. And it has one of the best things that Mason has ever written, his narrative &quot;The Collector's Tale.&quot; This poem alone is worth buying the collection for.

If you are interested in narrative or formal poetry, either in reading or writing it, then this is a great collection to read. It is a revision of the earlier Feirstein edition, one that is much more up to date. <br />There's Dana Gioia's wonderful essay \\"Notes on the New Formalism\\" (also found in his Can Poetry Matter) and his great essay on \\"The Dilemma of the Long Poem.\\" Other essays on the narrative come from Dick Allen, Frederick Feirsein, Christopher Clausen and Thomas M. Disch. Mark Jarman's essay on Robinson, Frost and Jeffers is included as is the phenomenal essay by Dave Mason \\"Other Lives: On Shorter Narrative Poems.\\" Which might be the best essay in the book and a definite must to read. You'll also find the introductions from Annie Finch's A Formal Feeling Comes which includes such poets such as Rita Dove, Marilyn Hacker, Marilyn Nelson, and Mary Jo Salter among others. Tim Steele has an essay in here, which later became a chapter in his remarkable book Missing Measures. There are also essays by Keith Maillard, Meg Schoerke, Wyatt Prunty, Paul Lake (always a joy to read), Robert McPhillips, and Brad Leithauser's great essay \\"Metrical Illiteracy.\\" In fact the only weak essay contained is the idiotic \\"The Neural Lyre\\" by Frederick Turner and Ernst Poppel. Schocking that even they could believe what they write. Still, Gwynn points out in his introduction that he has trouble resolving himself to all contained in the essays but all the essays contained are influential in one way or another. For those interested in contemporary poetry, this is one of those books on prosody that should be read.	2004-04-25

It's an interestingly dysfunctional novel with some of the most interestingly dysfunctional characters. But there is little cohesion to the story. Some of the most interesting episodes we only get the beginning of and Palahniuk doesn't finish other than in telling us later rather than showing us at the time.

Supposedly Stevenson comes down on the side of Ted Hughes, but to me the biography seems objective and fair. Even in those biographies written to make Plath look like a victim, she still comes across as tempermental and difficult to live around. I think Stevenson's biography is fair, if at times a bit ponderous to read. I'd suggest Silent Woman as a companion piece (it's a biography of Stevenson's biography). Bitter Fame has three appendices--memoirs of Sylvia written by others--Lucas Myers, Dido Merwin, and Richard Murphy. You get a sense of dread as you approach Dido's little memoir. I'm sure Plath was difficult and I'm sure Dido has her reasons, but you get the impression that she wrote her memoir just to 'get back at' Plath. To show her up so to speak, even though its tone isn't much different then what else you'll find in the book. Anyway, regardless of what type of person Sylvia Plath was, difficult or not, you cannot deny her genius, which is far greater than those who she came in contact with or have written about her.	2004-03-27

They are slightly surreal and absurd, but still believeable in an out there kind of way. Schickler's voice is one that draws the reader in to his world, and I look forward to reading more of his work. <br />The stories in Kissing in Manhattan (which is a wonderful title for the book--I can't think of anything more appropriate) all center around one odd apartment building, Preemption, and the main characters and events of one story are secondary to the next. The best story in the collection is \\"The Smoker,\\" which is an odd sort of love story that first appeared in The New Yorker and then later in the O. Henry Awards. All the stories in this collection relate to love, or sex at the very least. There is the very touching \\"Jacob's Bath\\" and \\"Telling It All to Otis.\\" \\"Kissing in Manhattan\\" is a very strange sexual tale that contains no sex. One of the weak spots of the collection is \\"Duty,\\" which is the only story that is told in first person. It is an interesting story, but it is a bit jarring to go from a certain distance between reader and narrator and then to jump in this close. It's a good story, but Schickler should have trusted the voice and distance that worked so well for the other stories. The other weak spot was the final story \\"The Green Balloon.\\" Even though all the stories in the collection relate to each other (and they add to each other by reading each other), they can be taken as seperate stories. With the exception of the final story. It wraps up events from other stories and you can't understand it or truly enjoy it without having read several of the other stories. Still, this is a great collection from one of American letters' great new voices.	2004-03-22

They've taken some of our favorite characters and turned magna on them. And you've got some of the best here. The Hulk has one of the more interesting changes--he's become a huge Godzilla-like creature, and he is what threads the stories together. The Spider-Man story is a good one. Keeps the basics and turns it samuri like. Really well done. Everyone's favorite, the X-Men are here. They are real uneven. I think a better job could have been done on them (Their Wolverine is really weak). Iron Man has recieved an update and is inhabited by Ms. Stark. And Stark Industries threads some minor Marvel characters into the story. Dr. Strange has been turned into a much cooler character than he ever has been before. The Avengers have become the Iron Avengers (a Power Ranger type team) consisting of Captain, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Vision. They combine to become Ultimate Iron Man. And they battle Apocalypse (who has a much better look) and his Horsemen: Sinister, Juggernaut, White QUeen, and Archangel, and theirs is a good transformation. America, Nemo is an megalomaniac leader of Atlantis bent on taking over the surface world. The Fantastic Four have been given a real interesting change, one that I'm not quite sure how to describe. Ghost Rider, who I normally don't like, gets an interesting theological bent and turns into a good story. The Punisher is weak. Real weak. I won't even go into her other than this: S&amp;M. And even Thor, mostly unchanged, makes a brief appearance. <br />I'll say this, it was interesting, and as a whole, quite enjoyable.	2004-03-15

Inferno also bled over into several other comics and I wish they had been included here (or maybe Marvel will release a companion volume that contains them)--those like Spider Man, Daredevil, and the X-Terminators.

And it was interesting if not great. I think he did a great job with Batman, though he's the one DC character that needs no tweaking. The Wonder Woman story was pretty interesting, though not something I'd want to see a whole lot of (though certainly better than her original version). His Superman was weak. There isn't a whole lot you can do to change Superman, so Stan Lee was sort of doomed from the start. His Green Lantern was basically Silver Surfer. Beside what can you do with Green Lantern. It was all very interesting though.	2004-03-15

Many consider it to be his finest work (it played a big part in his winning of the Nobel Prize). I put it with his finest work, like A Farewell to Arms, though his best work is found in The Complete Short Stories, The Sun Also Rises, and The Garden of Eden.<br />The novella carries a tone of depression and tiredness and a feeling of religiousity. Many have pointed out the Christ-image of the story, and make no mistake, it is there. The story divides itself into three parts of the narrative. Before he goes to sea, the battle with the fish (which is the bulk of the narrative) and the fight with the sharks--where much of the Christ symbolism kicks in. The novella is written in the type of prose we have come to associate with Hemingway: that of the tough, terse declarative prose. This is truly a classic.<br />What I wish most about this novella is that it was included in The Complete Short Stories, where it truly belongs. With the greats. To truly appreciate it read it as the ending of The Complete Short Stories.	2004-03-14

Though he worked on it for something like fifteen years, he never completed it, or at least to his satisfaction. But even in its 'incomplete' state, it is one of my favorite books. I can only imagine what it would have been like had he lived long enough to finish it to his satisfaction--another The Sun Also Rises perhaps. Still, even though the manuscript claims to be incomplete it has a solid flow of story, and pretty polished off. And while the ending isn't typically Hemingway, it is a strong ending. In fact, there isn't much about this book that is typical Hemingway. It's much closer and much more complex than the other Hemingway pieces I've read. It's more emotional. The prose flows more and has a lyrical quality. It's a sensuous story of love, sex, emotion, and madness. It's not the first Hemingway I'd start with, but definitely one of the first few you should read. It will help solidify your respect for the author.	2004-03-13

It is more personal than the other of Fitzgerald's work and covers happy days in France through the madness and alcoholism that follows. As great as this novel was, there were some weaknesses. It did seem to get weaker as it went along. Part One is the best, Part Two is weaker and weakens as it goes along. And Part Three is the weakest of all--even Fitzgerald himself admitted that. Still, it is well written and you can see why Fitzgerald is an American classic.	2004-03-13

What I've read of him has been great, but I found The Sun Also Rises to be a wondrous experience while reading it (as I did The Complete Short Stories). Perhaps I should have waited before writing this review as I am still struck dumb by the sparse beauty of Hemingway's prose. This is a tender, absorbing, gripping story of a group of American and British expatriats and their vacation in Spain for the bullfights and festivals. This has become one of my favorite books.	2004-03-11

She uses Sylvia Plath, and specifically Anne Stevenson's Bitter Fame as her example. What you get here is an interesting book that engages the reader and at times almost reads like a novel. The book is gripping and before you know it, you've finished it. Also, Malcolm claims to be on the &quot;side&quot; of Ted Hughes, but I still think she gives a fairly balanced view of the whole situation. But, this isn't a biography of Sylvia Plath.

Also within these pages are T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Marianne MooreT.E. Hulme, F.S. Flint, Archibald MacLeish, John Gould Fletcher, Herbert Read, Max Michelson, and Adelaide Crapsey. This is an important anthology because of how important the Imagist movement, and the poets involved in it, was to the creation of modern poetry. Pratt explains it best in his essay/introduction to the anthology. Which is yet another reason to pick up this book, Pratt's essay is truly one of the best about the Imagism.

Okay, but not something you'd expect to see in book form. But I think O'Brien has a lot of potential to develop as a writer. He has some talent, now he needs to perfect his craft. Which is one of the things publishing in magazines and journals does, lets you know if your work is up to the 'standards' of being published. But on to the book.<br />One of the negatives of this book were the 'interviews' which felt like fillers, as if he had to reach a certain page count and this was his 'cute' way of filling in the missing pages (and please, don't patronize us with a not at the end, those who didn't realize it was fiction probably shouldn't be allowed to read grown up books). &quot;The Writer&quot; which is the opening story had some potential, but in the end fell flat. O'Brien seems to have been trying to write some sort of parable but it didn't pull itself together at all. I'll admit &quot;How About This&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot; I didn't even finish reading. They were that bad. <br />That isn't to say that there weren't some positives because there were. &quot;How to Survive New England Weather&quot; is workshop fiction but it is good workshop fiction. And I fully didn't expect to like &quot;Existential Dilemma&quot; at all, but it turned out to be rather interesting. But on to the true gems of this collection. &quot;Dinner With Caitlin McRay&quot; is a charming story about a friendship with a woman with bulemia. And &quot;Toby Grey&quot; is the best story in the collection. It's a teen angst/coming of age story that I have little bad to say about. &quot;Dinner&quot; and &quot;Toby Grey&quot; are really the two stories in the collection that O'Brien should have kept and made sure the rest were up to their quality. But he shows potential and I'd gladly read more by him, if only to see how he develops as a writer.	2004-03-03

It doesn't ask you to starve yourself nor are you denied certain foods (and the ones we enjoy the most) for the rest of your life. It doesn't require additional excercise (though it helps). It changes your blood chemistry and since it is a cardiologist that developed the diet, it is heart healthy. Also, it does allow some carbs and unlike Atkins requires that you eat until full, but still in moderation. There are a lists of good foods and foods to avoid as well as meal plans and recipes for all three stages of the diet (stage one lasts only a couple of weeks; stage two until you reach your ideal weight; stage three after you reach your ideal weight). It looks good, but since I've just read the book, it is still to early to tell.	2004-02-26

And I read slowly so that I could savor this collection. Addonizio is a phenomenal poet--probably the best of her generation--a mix of Anne Sexton and Edna St. Vincent Millay. I will admit that this is the weakest of her collections (though it would be hard to top Tell Me and The Philosopher's Club). Even so, it is great work, especially \\"First Kiss\\" and \\"Stolen Moments\\" which are classic Addonizio. Also of note are \\"Dear Reader\\" and \\"Fever Blues\\" and \\"California Street\\" which is definitely one of the best in the book. She also writes a well done sonnenizio (it's explained in the book) and a very workable paradelle. I can never say enough good about the work of Kim Addonizio, and her latest collection is no exception.	2004-02-26

But you don't really need it. Most of what Lowell wrote after &quot;For the Union Dead&quot; isn't that great. And in the Selected you get a great selection from what is effectively Lowell's first book, Lord Weary's Castle--which is a pretty strong book. There is also a generous selection from Life Studies and For the Union Dead (though I've bought the book that contains both complete collections). Lowell was a pretty important poet, but really, the Collected just goes overboard. This is all you really need.	2004-02-16

It is a fair selection of poems. Of course it is a matter of opinion as to who is missing and who should be in there (no Hecht or Thom Gunn, which is a big loss). There are excellent selections of poems for Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Bly, Gwendolyn Brooks, Rita Dove, Alan Dugan, Robert Hayden, Maxine Kumin, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and W.D Snodgrass. There are other excellent poets in here (such as Marilyn Nelson and Andrew Hudgins), but the selection of poems isn't the best work they have. For content you might want to look elsewhere, there are important poems and poets that are missing here.<br />What I do like about this anthology is the way it is put together. Before each poet's selection there is a full page picture of the poet--so you can see what they looked like. It's not important, but it is nice to see. And they bios at the end are great. They cover the poet's life and a little critical work about the poems themselves. The Notes on the Poets is what truly makes this anthology worthwhile.	2004-02-08

This book has it all: beautiful language, a wide range of subjects, and technical prowess. She writes lyrics, dramatic monologues, and narratives. You'll find sonnets and the lesser known sapphics as well as other forms. I have no doubt that Reeser will one day take her place with those great women poets of the past and present.	2004-01-31

This is one of my favorite books in the Bible.<br />What I like about this edition is that one, it is pocket sized. Two, it contains only the Song of Solomon, so that you can read it on its own, separated completely from the rest of the Bible. And three, A.S.

Some of the greatest lines in the book are descriptions of Zenith, not the least of which is the opening lines. Lewis creates in Babbitt the total conformist and we follow him through his conformity and into thinking on his own. Babbitt is simply a man who wants to be liked by everyone. Babbitt gives expression to the glibness and irresponsibility of the professional social climber. Lewis gives us one of our modern classics.	2004-01-25

It's a coming of age story for a young black male. It's about family, death, love, and god. Sounder is at the core--not physically there, but in the boy's mind (and I don't know that Armstrong ever named any of the characters except the dog). He isn't there except at the beginning and the end. But hey, this is a great book. Get it for your kids and enjoy.	2003-12-22

Both are great stories and great books. Myth Directions deals with the game the gang plays in order to win the Trophy (...Tanda...). And Hit or Myth is truly hilarious as Skeeve has to pretend to be the king and avoid marriage. These are great books.	2003-12-20

It's sad to see all our old friends--Skeeve, Aahz, Tanda, Guido, Bunny, etc--but the book does feel like it is time. It doesn't feel like Asprin has any more to add to the series, and he wraps it all up rather nicely. This is also one of those revolving viewpoint novels, though Skeeve's pov is included. It's a nice end to a great series.	2003-12-20

Many authors couldn't handle juggling this many primary characters (not to mention the whole slew of secondary characters) and this complicated of a series. It's myth-fastic.	2003-12-20

But every now and then she'll pick a good book. Where the Heart Is is one of those good books. It's a sweet story, without becoming saccharine. It's got a great hook--a pregnant woman lives and gives birth in a small town Wal-Mart. Who wouldn't read that? Letts gives you great characters that you can't help but care for in spite of yourself. Letts does flirt with the boundaries of cliche and emotionalism at times, but she never quite crosses that boundary--too badly at least. It's a good book.	2003-12-19

That's not saying much though, since the series as a whole is such a great collection of books. This is the only one that I give four stars to. I think it is because it had been so long since Asprin had written a Myth book, and he had to refind his rhythm. And this book interrupts the sequence (it is book 11, but it takes place between 3 &amp; 4). Asprin seems to have to stretch a little with this episode, which he hasn't had to do in any of the others. But don't let me give you the impression that this is a substandard book, because it isn't. It's a great book too. And I'm glad he wrote it.	2003-12-19

In fact, Webb's introduction is a great one. I'd recommend you read it, if nothing else. Now, I wouldn't say that all the poems are great, or that even all of them live up to Webb's criteria, but you get a lot of good work in here. You'll find Kim Addonizio (two wonderful poems by her), Charles Bukowski, Lucille Clifton, Wanda Coleman, Billy Collins (always a pleasure to read), Stephen Dunn, Russell Edson, Paul Hoover, Maxine Chernoff, Dorianne Laux, Bob Hicok, Thomas Lux, Pattiann Rogers, James Tate, David Trinidad, Fred Voss, and B.H.

And it has been maybe 20 years since I've seen it. I picked it up to reread it (doesn't take long) and I found that it wasn't as strong of a book as I remember it to be. I'm not talking about the simple language, after all, it is written for a child. Rather, the characters are one dimensional. And the children seem far to quick to accept Sarah as their new mother.<br />But, it is a children's book, and doesn't have to stand up to the close scrutiny one gives an adult's book. It is a touching story about love and the creation of a family. It helps to teach accpetance, even love of a stepparent. I do recommend this for the kids.	2003-12-19

Not bad. There were a handful of really good stories and a handful of really bad, and quite a few in the middle. It's not a bad addition to reading the Best American Short Stories (especially since both Pushcart and the O. Henry Awards are weakening). I won't say this is the best selection I've come across, but it's pretty good. I look forward to next year's edition.	2003-12-19

You can imagine my surprise when I ran across the complete set in paberback at the local bookstore. Asprin was one of the pioneers in this genre of humor/fantasy books. He has great characters, well rounded and believable. He spoofs whatever he can in the genre. And he does it well. If you haven't read these books, then you need to get started. And since this is book one and two, this is the place to start.	2003-12-19

I always found the poems interesting and pretty good, if not stellar. And I've seen some good reviews for Animal Soul, so I was rather excited when I finally picked up this book. And I found it a bit disapointing. I'll admit, these weren't the most awful poems I've read, but Hicok's rambling all over the place in a single poem weakened the good work. And I found that his line breaks generally seemed arbitrary and disrupting to the flow of the poem. But the poems I've read of Hicok's that I like should be in his next book, so I'll keep my eye open for it.	2003-12-18

He's a remarkable poet, who does his thing and does it well. Picnic, Lightning is a pretty solid collection of poems, though if you have Collins's selected poems there's no need to pick this one up.

Here's this year's breakdown:<br />I'm going to say that this year's introduction, written by guest editor Walter Mosley, was especially well-written--It's a great intro to an anthology such as this. Other highlights were Sharon Pomerantz's &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, ZZ Packer's &quot;Every Tongue Shall Confess&quot; (which has appeared in a few other of these 'best of' anthologies), Nicole Krauss's &quot;Future Emergencies&quot;, Ryan Harty's &quot;WHy the Sky Turns Red When the Sun Goes Down&quot;, and, what is the best story in the collection, Anthony Doerr's &quot;The Shell Collector.&quot; <br />This year's stories that don't belong in any best of anthology were written by: Marilene Phipps, Dean Paschal, Louise Erdrich, Edwidge Danticat, Kevin Brockmeier, and Dorothy Allison.<br />Everybody else's work just isn't worth mentioning, either as great work or as poor work--it's that middle of the road work i mentioned.	2003-12-15

Last year's volume was an interesting mix of work. This year is another interesting mix of work, though I will say that it is not nearly as good as last year's volume. <br />Let's focus on the best pieces, which includes Zadie Smith's introduction (skip the weak forward by Eggers). There is also a great article by Mark Bowden (who brought us Black Hawk Down), David Drury, Aamanda Holzer (great way to tell a story, by listing songs), Chuck Klosterman, Daniel Voll, and David Sedaris, who is great as he always is. I'd skip the pieces by Sherman Alexie, Lynda Barry, Michael Buckley, Dylan Landis, Andrea Lee, Nasdijj, and John Verbos--they're pretty weak. Still, the stronger pieces do make up for the weaker ones. But I do hope Eggers is careful, or next year he'll run the risk of turning this into another mediocre Pushcart-type volume.	2003-12-15

The rumors and ideas we had of Traci Lords, and we wanted to read about it. But as it turns out Traci isn't the 'porn queen,' and little of that work can be found. Traci found her voice with this memoir. You really feel the hurt and despair the young Traci felt. We travel with her through the rough times, the porn time (which, thankfully, she didn't go into graphic detail--through it all Traci was tactful), and finally the good times, when her life turned--when she changed her life. I didn't expect this book to be all that well written and maybe not even intersting. But I was wrong. Traci wrote an engaging and powerful book. Read it. I think it will surprise you too.	2003-12-15
864660:US	53008075	R1AYFC2C0N66CN	0679602623	218725133	The Poetry of E.A. Robinson (Modern Library)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	the best of a great American poet	E A Robinson has long been respected in American poetry--by poets such as Frost and Yvor Winters. It's no wonder why, Robinson has a command over form and language we don't often get to see. Just look at poems as diverse as &quot;The Valley of the Shadow,&quot; &quot;Eros Turannos,&quot; &quot;The Mill,&quot; and &quot;Aunt Imogen.&quot; Or you could look at his three most famous poems, the poems that we know Robinson for: &quot;Richard Cory,&quot; &quot;Reuben Bright,&quot; and &quot;Miniver Cheevy.&quot; I don't need to tell you why you need to read Robinson, that should be evident already. Mezey's edition is a great one because it is an inexpensive edition that contains the best poems by Robinson--and notes to many of them. There are also three appendices. One contains various quotes from Robinson himself as well as a brief selection of comments by other poets and critics on Robinson. And as a special treat there is the introduction Robert Frost wrote for King Jasper. And Mezey's introduction is well-written and informative.	2003-12-15

We have a lot to thank Yvor Winters for. But people sometimes forget that Winters was a poet as well. Some of my favorite poems are: &quot;Jose's Country,&quot; &quot;October,&quot; &quot;Full Moon,&quot; &quot;Sleep,&quot; &quot;The Passing Night,&quot; &quot;The Fable,&quot; &quot;The Fall of Leaves,&quot; &quot;Moonlight Alert,&quot; &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,&quot; and &quot;The Journey.&quot;<br />Thom Gunn edited this addition to the great new series Library of America is putting out, 'American Poets Project.&quot; Gunn himself is a great poet, and brings a good sensibility to his selection of Winters' poetry. You get some phenomenal poems in this collection. Gunn also includes the one short story Winters wrote. And surprisingly, it is a pretty good story. This is a great edition of a poet I'm afraid that we have almost forgotten. We have to thank Library of America for creating this new series, and Thom Gunn for his selection of Winters poetry.	2003-12-15

She is certainly Emily Dickinson's equal, and in my opinion, a finer poet. When discussing American poetry, Bishop can't be ignored. Her imagery, her use of form, her command over the language is rarely matched, and this collection contains all her work. There's her first book, _North &amp; South_, which is one of the finest volumes of poetry produced. You'll find poems like &quot;The Map,&quot; &quot;The Man-Moth,&quot; &quot;The Weed,&quot; &quot;The Imaginary Iceberg,&quot; &quot;Seascape,&quot; and the masterful poem, &quot;The Fish.&quot; _A Cold Spring_ follows, containing &quot;At the Fishhouse&quot; and &quot;Letter to N.Y.&quot; &quot;The Armadillo&quot; (Bishop's poem to Robert Lowell), &quot;Filling Station,&quot; &quot;Visits to St. Elizabeths&quot; and &quot;Sestina&quot; (one of the few poems in this form that actually works) follows in _Questions of Travel_.  Then there is a selection of uncollected work (1969) before we hit _Geography III_ which contains two of her best poems, &quot;Cruso in England&quot; and &quot;One Art&quot;--which is in my opinion her best poem. The collection rounds out with some more uncollected poems, juvenalia, and some fine translations. Overall, you have an important book by one of our most important poets.	2003-12-14

Whether he was painting, drawing, or making a collage, Matisse's work will strike you--move you. And this edition is a nice, inexpensive collection of one of the master's works. There's an informative, well-written introduction and then there are 400 pieces of his art. The reproductions of Matisse's works are pretty good (though some span two pages, which always irritates me since you miss so much in the fold) and this isn't some giant tomb. It's a smallish paperback book you can carry with you on the bus or train or anywhere you wish to look at Matisse's work--even at a Picasso exhibition...	2003-12-12

He won the Nobel for The Old Man and the Sea. And he showed us his skill at creative nonfiction with A Moveable Feast. But I hadn't yet read a full-length novel written by what is one of the quintissential American authors. I chose to start with A Farewell to Arms. And this is a wonderful book. It's a beautiful, though tragic, love story set during WWI--on the front lines. We get to watch this love unfold. And Hemingway gives us what has been called the definitive antiwar novel without ever preaching. I did find a little fault with only one thing. Hemingway's language is just a little simplistic at times. But even still, it is a beautiful story.	2003-12-12

Chuck Close is a phenomenal painter, both before the onset of his disease and even more so after. You won't find many books on him, or many that contain his work. Until something a bit more 'adult' or comprehensive comes out, this is a good selection. It discusses his life and work. There is also a brief chapter on what is a portrait. They finish it off with a list of museums that have some of Chuck Close's work. It's a nice intro to a great artist.	2003-12-01

The werewolves tend to be the more dangerous to humans and the 'high-society' vampires (the werewolves are more like your trailer park trash and Hell's Angels types) hunt them. One of the vampires falls in love with a human turned werewolf (I can see Jessica Alba playing the vampire part, but they casted Kate Beckinsale; and Ewan MacGregor as our werewolf--they casted Scott Speedman, whoever that is)l There are some bright spots, but over all, it reads a bit amateurish. Now to be fair, this is a novelization of a movie (I haven't seen the movie) and they tend to be weak (except for Alan Dean Foster's novelizations of the Alien movies). What I wish is that this was an idea that a good writer had gotten, instead of Hollywood. This would make a great limited series, of say four or five books. But this is what we got, and I suppose it isn't bad for a novelization, but on the whole, it is weak. I'm not sure how the movie is, but I think you'd do better watchint it instead of reading it.	2003-10-16

He broke taboos, he did disgusting things, he used intelligence with his wicked (and twisted) sense of humor. When you talk about the greatest cartoonists and strips you mention Garfield (old Garfield before Davis fielded out all the work), Calvin &amp; Hobbes (which fits perfectly with Larson), and The Far Side (I'd also include the relatively new strip, Get Fuzzy). This book collects Larson's work, new work, and work he never showed. You have to see it to believe it, and it is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.	2003-10-08

It was a big risk because part of what makes Wolverine so popular is the mystery of who he is--his past. Jemas and crew did a great job here. It's a great story and the artwork is brilliant. Yes, it seems like just the first chapter in Logan's life, so I look forward to more like it. Jemas took one of their great characters and really filled it out.

This review is for Robert McPhillips THE NEW FORMALISM: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION, published by Volcanic Ash books. But I think the two match up somehow. So here goes.<br />Robert McPhillips has written a nice introduction to the group of poets that have the moniker, New Formalists. This is not an in-depth book on the poets or their movement, but it is a good place to start, and I'm curious to see where the criticism will go from here (this book should have been published years ago, but that's another story). <br />Chapters 1  and 2 covers the emergence of the New Formalism and just what it is--a good intro. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on Timothy Steele and Dana Gioia, respectively. And any study of the New Formalism has to include an in-depth study of them. 5 is Gjertrud Schnackenberg and the 'High Style.' This is one of those questionable chapters, I'm not sure how important she is to the 'movement.' Chapter 6 deal with narrative poetry, and McPhillips rightly discusses Dave Mason, Mary Jo Salter, Andrew Hudgins, and Robert McDowell. This is where I would have put Paul Lake, but he appears in the Steele chapter. 7 deals with verse satire and light verse, which is a very significant part of the New Formalism. Here McDowell discusses R.S. Gwynn, Tom Disch, and Charles Martin. The final chapter deals with the 'Revival of the Love Lyric.' I hadn't realized it had gone out of style, but still, this is an important chapter. McDowell briefly mentions poets that deserved more space, like Michael Donaghy, Kim Addonizio, Marilyn Nelson and Kate Light. A.E. Stallings is mention, but there definitely should have been more on her. And where was Tim Murphy? But like I said, and as the title says, this is just a 'critical introduction.' I look forward to the work that comes from this book.	2003-06-25

None of the poems have been published in a journal, and for good reason, they're not very good. It's poorly written with the intention to shock, but without the originality, skill, or edginess you find in cutting-edge poetry. Lennon goes over the top in his attempt to shock, and instead creates poor poetry. You want to read a poet who skillfully plays the edge between risqueness and over-the-top, but still staying on this side of it, then read Kim Addonizio or Sarah Cortez. Avoid this book. I  think Story Line, which normally publishes good work, published Lennon to try to give it an edge to its reputation. Let's just hope Story Line goes back to publishing quality work again.	2003-06-23

His upbringing very much shows in his work. This is the poetry of the blue-collar working class. This is very much the poetry of the west and of Texas. Fairchild writes mostly longer narratives and dramatic monologues (most with longish lines). Some of the best poems of his are: \\"Beauty\\" the 10 page narrative of the working man, and this poem is phenomenal. It is one of the best contemporary poems written. And in fact, the only modern day narrative that is better is Dave Mason's \\"In the Country I Remember\\", though not by much. There is also one of the best baseball poems in recent years (or maybe the best baseball poem ever), \\"Body and Soul\\", a great narrative that runs a few pages and touches on the truth of the human soul of the working man. Also of great note is \\"Keats\\" (it'll surprise you) and \\"Cigarettes\\" a poem that finally gives us a reason to smoke. Or at least an understanding. The other poems in this collection are also great, those four are just the best.<br />There are two signs that clued me in that this was going to be a great book (other than the finalist of the Nat'l Book Award). The first were the blurbs. R.S. Gwynn, the modern day Pope, says \\"[Fairchild] measures a world inhabited by those for whom life has made its meaning plain by constant subtraction...both real and mataphorical, that figure so prominently in this collection.\\" Dana Gioia says of this collection: \\"Fairchild boldly plundesr the territories of prose to expand the possibilities of contemporary verse...These fluent poems are amnivorously intelligent. The reader never knows what will come next; but, as deeply psychological in their probings as a novel, they alwasy cohere.\\" Tim Steele, one of the greatest of the modern metricists, says \\"Fairchild bringssympathetic insight to the people...he has a gift for focusing on those moments when lives constrained by psychological or economic circumstances are touched by beauty and significance.\\" And Wyatt Prunty calls the poems \\"remarkably textured, genrous, haunting\\" . <br />And the other sign of this books importance is Anthony Hecth's introduction. No more needs to be said.	2003-06-22

I remember the essay in The Atlantic Monthly. I liked the essay then, and agreed with much of what Myers said. So it was nice to come across the essay in full like this. He takes on the pretentiousness of today's literary scene (and I've read a lot of the prize winners, so I know [what] wins). I haven't read much of the authors he used as his examples (Paul Auster, Don DeLillo, David Guterson, Cormac McCarthy, and Annie Proulx), but it doesn't matter. Myers doesn't get into plot or characters. You don't have to be familiar with the books (though it would help, I'll reread the chapters of this book as I read the works by those authors). He takes on the language they use. And nine times out of ten, Myers is right. This essay/book should get more attention. It's the equivalent of Dana Gioia's Can Poetry Matter?, only for the world of fiction.	2003-06-19

The collection isn't uneven, I found most of the poetry to be bad or dull. There are two great poems in there: her prose poem \\"The Wind\\" and \\"West of Tucson\\" and I'd also say \\"Irish Holiday\\" is worth noting. This book is nothing like her latest, Brave Disguises, which is a phenomenal book. But I can see in this collection how she is developing the voice and poetics she now has. Be forewarned, there is little narritive or even much linear structure within this volume. The Surface of Last Scattering seems to be saying something, the problem is, I'm not quite sure what. Check out those three poems I mentioned, then just skip to Brave Disguises--you won't be disappointed there.	2003-06-19

And it goes from there. I honestly expected to really like this book. I find Stiller to be hilarious, and Garofalo is funny as well as an excellent 'social conscience' and I might have grown up with a crush on her. The two make an excellent team, and I figured between their wit, intelligence, and what they have to say, that this would be a great book. Alas, that is not the case. It's in the humor section, and the book tries too hard to be funny (unlike Seinfeld's Seinlanguage, which is Jerry writing, and without effort, being interesting and funny). I was a little worried that Garofalo's politics would get in the way, but I figured Stiller would help keep her under control, keep it from being too preachy. But the book tried too hard to be funny (and you can never quite tell if they are being serious or 'funny'--knowing their beliefs and politics). It starts with a false table of contents, which I missed at first, and after I 'discovered' it, I thought it would annoy me, but it did not. Then there is the tounge in cheek Acknowledgements, followed by a Preface by Stiller and a Foreward by Garofalo. Then the book goes downhill. There is a warning about copies the book, based on the FBI warnings on video tapes. This is one of those cases where you aren't quite sure if this duo is being humorous, serious, or some combination of the two. Then you get rotating chapters written by one or the other. They just tried too hard to be funny, and it comes off forced. And you would have hoped that their appendices would have been a little serious, to get an idea of what books, movies, etc really did influence them. But no. I had worried about it being too preachy, but unfortunately, it wasn't serious enough. There is a fine line between parody and mediocre humor. It's tough to stay on the right side of the line.	2003-06-18

The title essay is sort of a 'literary memoir', and while I expected it to be one of the better essays, it really isn't. But there are some excellent essays on Auden, Tennyson, Frost, Heaney, Louis Simpson, J.V. Cunningham, Anne Xexton, and Irish poetry. And then there are the essays meant to further the cause of the New Formalist movement. They almost sound like propoganda, but they are well written, enjoyable essays that make sense. And my favorite essay is \\"Other Lives: On Shorter Narrative Poems.\\" Mason is a phenomenal narrative poet, and anyone with an interest in narrative poetry should read this essay.	2003-06-01

It's still well crafted, like your typical Twain, and it makes its social commentary, like your typical Twain, but it does so without the biting satire that you find in most of Twain's work. It's a phenomenal piece of literature. It is his protest, his anti-war piece (written around 1905 in response to the Philippine-American War), and it is relevant still today--perhaps more so in today's world. The line drawings by John Groth add a sense of movement and urgency that works in counterpoint to Twain's words. This is an important piece of literature. And I'll leave with Twain's words on \\"The War Prayer\\":<br />'I have told the whole truth...and only dead men can tell the truth in this world. It can be published after I am dead.'	2003-06-01

He was a master of the short story, the likes of which we have seldom seen before or since. This volume contains most of his short stories, those that aren't included here are included elsewhere, where they are more fitting (such as \\"The Stoker\\" as the first chapter of Amerika). Kafka's short story \\"The Metamorphosis\\" is possibly the best short story ever written. It is certainly the most well known. But I'd like to draw your attention to a few other stories by him--examples of what makes Kafka great: \\"Before the Law\\", \\"In the Penal Colony\\", \\"A Country Doctor\\", \\"A Report to an Academy\\", \\"A Hunger Artist\\", \\"The Burrow\\", \\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\\", and \\"Jackals and Arabs.\\" Read this book.	2003-06-01

Not only is she the best poet of her generation, but one of the best of any generation. This book is amazing. Her education in Classics shows in her work. Section I takes different myths and creates the most amazing poems, like her dramatic monologues from Hades and Persephone. She takes also Apollo, eurydice and others. But there is more to this collection than just classical mythology. Just see \\"The Man Who Wouldn't Plant Willow Trees\\" to see Stallings at her very best. I will say, section II, titled A Bestiary, is rather weak. With the exception of the final poem, \\"A Lament for the Dead Pets of Our Childhood,\\" I found most of the poems weak. But despite that, Stallings technical skill, her beautiful use of language, and her all around skill makes this one of the best collections I've read.	2003-06-01

And it is no surprise, this book is absolutely great. It's been added to my list of favorite collections of poetry. Jacobik writes with a clarity and beauty, a style that brings the poems straight into the reader. I don't think you can read this book and not love it. It's just that good.<br />Section one contains poems about art. You'll find \\"Pollock's Painting\\" here whose form mimics the energy and movement of Pollock's work. Also there is \\"The Clarinetist\\" which deserves its place among the great poems about music. <br />Section two contains poems about, as cliche as it sounds, about the human condition. These poems have a confessionalistic feel to them, but not the overtalky or poorly written style you find in most confessional poems (I'm not saying these are confessionalistic poems, that's just the best way I can describe them right now). In here you'll find \\"Breasts\\" which you have to read to believe, but I couldn't have put it better myself, \\"The Tapeworm\\" another that defies explanation, and \\"The Aftermath\\". Also there is \\"The Shabby Truth\\" which is the best poem of the book, and one I feel will be read and studied (or should be) for years to come. It's about a mother's relationship with her son, and the parallel their lives are taking. It's a warning. It's phenomenal. I'd say more, but I'd hate to spoil the poem for you. (Even if you don't buy this book, you should find this poem, first published in Diner, and read it). <br />The final section is the weakest of the book. It's more of those philosophical poems. I didn't really like it much. There were two poems of interest. One is an interesting poem about the homeless folks we see standing on the corners with their signs. The other comes from a line in Ginsberg. I can't repeat the title here, but it is a good poem (page 64).	2003-06-01

It's generally not the best American poetry in any given year. Nor is 1995's volume the 'best' but it does have a higher number of good or great poems in it. Richard Howard (1995's guest editor) does a better job than most of the other guest editors I've read. You find poems by Margaret Atwood, Rafael Campo, Ginsberg, Marilyn Hacker, Anthony Hecht, Andrw Hudgins, Kizer, Kumin, Mary Jo Salter, and a great series of poems by Molly Peacock. There is also a wonderful poem by Sally Ball. I wish the series would get back up to this level of quality.	2003-06-01

The excerpts of the poems were great--fresh & exciting. So I ordered this obscure little book. Great title. Nice design. Unfortunately, the excerpts from contained in the review is all that was good about the poetry. The poetry is stale. And these little textual experiments, where the poet 'plays' with the typewriter, don't work. They seem pointless. Like he was doing it just because he could, not because it meant anything. It's an interesting look, the poems curving all over the page (I suppose in a fluid, flame-like movement), but pointless. The book does become almost good with three of the middle poems. \\"Between Two Rooms\\" has two marvelous stanzas, but instead of ending it there, the poet goes on and writes a third stanza that pretty much ruins the whole poem. Then the title poem follows, so much potential that never quite gets there. And the third poem that is somewhat interesting is \\"The Interview\\". But none of these are that good, and they don't make it worth ordering this book. Pass on it.	2003-05-28

Somone told me that Pastan was by no means a _great_ poet, but that she was a very good poet. There's no more accurate description of her work. She's not going to be another Frost or Plath or Dickinson or Bishop, but her work is enjoyable and quite well-written. There is a preponderance of religous and motherhood contained within, so be prepared. But that doesn't detract from the book. She handles her subjects well and her language well. I'll say it again, it is a good book and one I think you'll enjoy.	2003-05-21

And it's good for any level of experience. It has a lot to teach the beginner, a help to the intermediate, and even the advanced student of poetry can get some ideas from this book. The first section of the book covers some subjects for writing, including family, death, and the erotic. Most of the book discussing the craft of poetry. The chapters deal with images, simile and metaphore, the line, voice, dreams and experiments, meter and rhyme, repetition and rhythm, the villanell, panotoum, and sestina, grammr, and revision. Then they have a section titled \\"The Writing Life\\" which deals with self-doubt, writer's block, getting published, and the internet. Most of the chapters end with writing exercises, to help give you ideas for poems and practice at writing. And at the end of the book they have their \\"Tweny-Minute Wriitng Exercises.\\" Addonizio and Laux chose, in general, great poems to illustrate whatever they are discussing. And the book even has several useful appenices: Books on Poetry and Writing; Anthologies for Further Reading; Finding Markets for Your Poems; and More Resources for Writers. It's a great guide and useful teaching tool, and told in a conversational, interesting voice. It's a purchase no poet will regret.	2003-05-21

It's well worth the money and the time. But Smith isn't one of the heavyweights like Shel Silverstein or Dr. Seuss, or X.J. Kennedy, or even a Nancy Willard. There were many pieces that weren't funny or that Smith missed the punchline or the poem just fizzled out. And a few are there to show how clever Smith is.

And I love poetry. And i love literature and literary theory. But to be honest, I didn't expect much out of Paul Lake's novel. It calls itself a _literary_ vampire mystery, which is a bit pretentious (and Lake is known as a critic an poet, not a fiction writer). I thought anything that bills itself as a literary vampire story...well, let's just say I didn't expect much out of it. And pleasantly, I was surprised (though I shouldn't have been, Lake writes well-done and interesting essays, and he has a knack for the narrative poem, so I know he can tell a good story). It's a well written story with believable characters (half the fun is guessing who the characters are in real life--and believe me, you can recognize many of the poets within) and a well thought out plot. It even has a nice twisted surprise ending. The only gripe I have is that Lake spends too much time complaining about the state of contemporary poetry and how our poets are 'treated' (sometimes I got the impression that he only wrote the novel so he could complain about what all poets already know..and already comlain about). Other than that you get an interesting story that blends poetry, criticism, literary history, and vampires into a great novel (had one of the big publishing companies released this book instead of Story Line Press, more people might be familiar with the book, but unfortunately Story Line, great press that it is, has never had the money to set forth much of an advertising or publicity campaign).	2003-05-21

I had hoped with his association with Sandburg... Plus I had previously read \\"Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight\\" which is a superb poem. And \\"The Congo\\" has a great reputation. Lindsay's poetry just wasn't all that great--and I'm not saying that because of the performance pieces.

He founded and edits one of the most influencial poetry (and fiction and cultural) journals--The Hudson Review. And I think that is what he is respected for and what he'll be remembered for. His poetry isn't that great. I found his New & Selected to be, as a whole, very weak. That's not to say there weren't some good poems (his triolets, \\"Centaurs\\", and \\"From a Forgotten Book\\" to name a few), but not that many. And certainly, we expect more from someone like Frederick Morgan. His generation produced some of our greatest poets-Richard Wilbur, Thom Gunn, Plath, Rhina Espaillat, Miller Williams, Larkin, Bukowski, and of course, Anthony Hecht and Gwendolyn Brooks- but I found his work to be lacking. I will say, U of Ill Press did make a beautiful book (as his Morgan's latest, \\"The Night Sky\\"). It uses quality paper for the cover and the pages, and is bracketed by two thick, almost construction-paperlike blue pages. And the cover is Raphael's Study for the Figure of Poetry, a stunning drawing (also reproduced as the frontspiece). The quality of the book is worth the price. It actually makes up for the poetry (as do the handful of really good poems inside).	2003-05-20

I associate her with Kim Addonzio because of there manual on poetry the wrote together, The Poet's Companion, because they are friends, and because their work has a similar feel (though Laux doesn't write in meter and rhyme like Kim does sometimes). There is this raw emotion, but not just flopped on the page like so much bad poetry. In reading this collection, you see what a craftsman Laux is. Her poems feel raw, they feel spontaneous, but they are finely tuned pieces of art. <br />The book is divided into two sections, Smoke and Fire. The first section, Smoke, is the stronger section, with poems like \\"Ray at 14\\", \\"Prayer\\" \\"How It Will Happen, When\\" and others. The poems here feel like smoke when you read them. They touch you lightly, but powerfully, bringing forth all these images, sounds, smells, feelings. Like smoke, they sneak up on you, and then hurt you. <br />\\"What could be more sacred than her eyes,<BR>fierce and complicated as the truth. Your life<BR>rising behind them. Your name on her lips.\\"<BR>         --Prayer<br />\\"Death comes to me again, a girl in a cotton slip\\"<BR>         --Death comes to me again, a girl<br />The second section doesn't differ much. The poems don't come raging at you like fire. No burning here. They are much more like smoke, but it does contain some great work, and has \\"The Shipfitter's Wife,\\" a beautiful poem that was selected for the Best American Poetry 1999 by Robert Bly. I'm just surprised more of her work hasn't appeared there.	2003-05-20

For me it was poets like (to name only a few) Robert Frost, Gwendolyn Brooks, Carl Sandburg, Thom Gunn, R.S. Gwynn, Kim Addonizio, Anthony Hecht, and most recently, Everette Maddox. This guy's work is great. His poems are gritty, urban, personal, and without spiraling into the self-pit that the Confessionalists do or going off on poorly written tangents like the Beat poets do. Maddox writes like those groups, and others, wished they could. And he's relatively unknown.  It's hard to put into words what happens in his poetic world. The closest I've come to it is the work of Kim Addonizio. Maddox may be the most important unknown poet we have. If you love any of what I've mentioned--Confessionalists, Beats, Addonizio's poetry, New Orleans (no one has a better feel for the city than Maddox did), great poetry--than you have to read this man's work. Nothing is more real.	2003-05-16

And I think she is one of the best poet's of her generation. Her poetry is great, and her book, _The Homeplace_ is one of those books that everyone should own. But even great poets can write mediocre poems. This collection is a series of short poems, usually a dramatic monologue of some sort, that together are supposed to make up the story of George Washington Carver's life (it includes pictures and little biographical footnotes). Pretty much the same thing she did for The Homeplace. It worked in The Homeplace, but not here. The problem isn't so much Nelson's skill as a poet (few are better than her), rather it is Carver's life. It just doesn't make good poetry, or at least not 60 poems. I understand Marilyn wants to tell us about Carver, but perhaps prose would have been a better way to go about it (that and this book seems to be marketed for young children--I don't think they can fully appreciate the nuances of Nelson's poetry or Carver's life). That said, there are several good poems in the book, \\"Clay\\" and \\"Cafeteria Food\\" being my personal favorites. Well, not every collection is going to be great (look at Frost's later books), so I eagerly await the next book from Marilyn Nelson, be it poetry, essays, or fiction.	2003-05-16

I'm not sure how good of an introduction to visual poetry I'd say this book is. Most of the work inside I would call visual art that uses text and words in the piece. There are a few 'visual poems'. But it is subtitled 'visio-textual art' so I guess it delivers on what it claims to. The problem is that most of the work inside isn't very good. This 'poetry' isn't mainstream because of the establishment or The Man keeping them down, it's not well-known because it isn't very good.	2003-04-22

Plus it is a fairly simple game to understand and play. Some games, like Metal Gear, require the guide, others, like Grand Theft Auto, don't really need it. Now, I've only skimmed through it. I love this game so much that I don't want to spoil it by giving away the upcoming missions and actions. It has a nice intro to the game, the characters, the weapons, and the cars. I find that after you finish a few missions, it is good to go back and look at what the guide says, just in case you missed something. I haven't. What it does have that I like a lot is maps to where all the weapons can be found, where the hidden packages are, where the rampages are, and where you can find body armor, police bribes, and life.

Grand Theft Auto 3 is a fun game to play. It's not as great as Vice City, but it is still one of the better games out there. But, unlike Vice City, which I enjoyed reading about, GTA3 isn't as much fun to read about. The missions are fairly simple, and there are multiple ways to complete them, so the guide isn't the end all be all that it is in games like Metal Gear. You do get good desriptions of weapons and vehicles. And what I find most valuable are the maps to the hidden treasures, rampages, bribes, armor, life, etc. If you are having trouble completeing the game because you can't find all your hidden treasures and rampages, then this guide will solve your problems.	2003-04-10

Don't get me wrong, he started strong. I, Vampire is one of the finest books I'v read--I might be the only person to place it way up on my list of literature. He followed with two pretty good book, The Vampire Papers and The Vampire Princess, both well-written novels, though not of the caliber of I, Vampire. Then came two weak editions to his series, The Vampire Virus and Vampire Hunter. And now we have The London Vampire Panic, another weak edition to his work. It seems Romkey is running out of ideas. The first and last thirds of the book drag. The middle gets pretty good. There is the nice addition of Van Helsing--not the first time he's appeared in someone else's fiction, but Romkey throws a nice twist on the character (well done Mr. Romkey). But overall the book drags. And you can see where Romkey wants the reader to think of Stoker's Dracula. Roughly same time period, set in London, similar style, and Romkey tells the story through various letters and journal entries. But Romkey is no Stoker. I say stick with what you do best-- I, Vampire. But I think it might be time for Romkey to move on to new subject material.	2003-04-09

And nine times out of ten, it doesnt disappoint. So when I came across the inaugural edition (1986) at a used book store, I picked it up, and couldnt wait to get home to read it, especially since it included essays by Joseph Brodsky, Robert Fitzgerald, Stephen Jay Gould, Joyce Carol Oates, and Gore Vidal (among other great writers). Imagine my surprise when I read it and found that this was not a very good collection of essays. One would think that you would work especially hard to make the inaugural edition to be a phenomenal collection. But it was not. Barthelmes essay was disjointed and made little sense, and the essays by Cockburn, Brodsky, Fitzgerald, Gass, Wain, and Kennan were just plain dull. There were a couple of bright spots (well, more like dull twinkles in a sea of blahs): Gerald Earlys essay on Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Stitt was pretty interesting and fairly well written; Oates essay On Boxing; and Gore Vidals touching remembrance of Italo Calvino. What was nice to see in this collection was that the essays varied over a huge range of topics, and that no magazine dominated the collection (in fact, only The New Republic had two essays, every other magazine only had one). Id have to say the best section of this collection is Robert Atwans (series editor) forward (no, not the Introduction by the guest editor, the 3 page forward), where he eloquently describes the art of essay writing. Its a shame the rest of the essays werent as good.	2003-03-23

I know it has only been out a few years, but in every anthology, 90% of the essays are phenomenal. In the 2000 edition I thought only Wendell Berry's and Wendy Johnson's essays didn't belong (I'm not sure that you could qualify Johnson's piece as science or nature writing). Otherwise you have great pieces by Natalie Angier, Richard Conniff, Paul de Palma, Helen Epstein, Anne Fadiman, Atul Gawande, Brian Hayes, Edward Hoagland, Judith Hooper, Ken Lamberton, Peter Matthiessen, Cullen Murphy, Richard Preston, Oliver Sacks, Hampton Sides, Craig B. Stanford, and Gary Taubes (most of them I had never heard of). And they range over all aspects of science, nature, and technology. Great collection.	2003-03-23

It's Dr. Strangelove without the humor (yes, I know Strangelove was based on another book). It's a what if scenario, an accident. There is no one to blame. No one went mad. A simple accident, that starts the bombs on their way. This book is tragic, and written full of tension. But the best part is how it ends, which is too good for me to spoil here. This book is worth reading if only for the last few pages. And to make you ask yourself, 'What would I do?'	2003-03-23

Henry Awards series to be a pretty uneven collection of stories, but still one i eagerly await each year, because in each volume you find several good stories, and one or two gems. The 1999 collection is no exception. Sure I found most of the stories to be trite and dull, but hidden amongst the poorer work were really good stories by W.D. Wetherell, Michael Chabon, Charlotte Forbes, and Annie Proulx. And the second place story, Cary Holladay's 'Merry-Go-Sorry' is a great story that deserves to be anthologized many, many in the years to come. And Stephen King and Lorrie Moore's introduction were eloquently written, and a joy to read in their own right.	2003-03-22

This is a book I highly recommend. Not just becuase it is entertaining and well written, but I Am Legend is a staple of both the horror and science fiction genres. But it is more than that. It is also one of the finer Apocalyptic novels (or novellas) written. And I believe might even deserve a place (no matter how small) in the sub-genrea of Utopian fiction. Matheson does a wonderful job of helping us understand the horrors of the end of the world, being alone, and even the sympathetic side of being a vampire (all with almost no dialogue). It's a beautifully written book.	2003-03-22

It's the story of the last days on Earth as experienced by the innocent Australians. It is a sad book, down to the core. And you will find tears welling in your eyes as the characters of the novel attempt to deal with their upcoming fate. It's a story of love, hope, redemption, sorrow, and peace. this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone.	2003-02-26

What I do is glance at the editor and at the authors included within. This year's edition is edited by James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential and the rest of his L.A. Quartet). And it has a story by Joe Lansdale, \\"The Mule Rustlers\\" --which is a great story, with a nice, humorous twist at the end-- (Lansdale is the greatest Texas writer whose name isn't McMurtry); and a story by Joyce Carol Oates, \\"The High School Sweetheart\\"--which is a story very much in her style, and somewhat 'experimental', but isn't as good as what she normally does. The best two stories in this year's volume is Brendan Dubois' \\"A Family Game\\" (great twist of an ending) and Daniel Waterman's \\"A Lepidopterist's Tale\\", which really only kicks in at the end, and reminds me of an Oates story. Stuart M. Kaminsky, Fred Melton, Annette Meyers, Michael Connelly, Thomas H. Cook, Sean Doolittle, and Joe Gores also have good stories within. What detracts from the collection: the fact that while these may be good stories, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to them; John Biguenet's dull story \\"It Is Raining in Bejucal\\"; David Edgerley Gates' mediocre \\"The Blue Mirror\\"; James Grady's unreadable \\"The Championship of Nowhere\\"; amd F.X. Toole's story \\"Midnight Emissions\\", which I was unable to finish. When reading the collection you'll notice an unusual amount of sports stories--mainly baseball and boxing stories (or maybe not surprising since Otto Penzler edited the two books those stories came from). <br />If you are looking for really good 'mystery' stories, you probably want to move along, but there are 11 really good stories (that's over half) to read. Some you would call mystery, some you wouldn't.	2003-02-26

And they cover the range of fields. <br />Anthropology - Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's \\"Mothers and Others\\" <br />Biology - Frederick C. Crews' \\"Saving Us from Darwin\\" originally published in The New York Review of Books (Crews attacks every form of creationism and the blending of science and religion, including Gould, but offers us no alternative idea or solution-that's what kept this essay from being an instant classic); H.

You pretty much have to watch the mini series Rose Red in order to really enjoy this book. It's written in a diary form, and is presented as the real thing (edited by fictional characters created by King). It's not really that poorly written, it's just not that great. Nor does it add to the experience of watching King's mini series. I'd say pass on it, even for the hardcore King fans.	2003-02-13

But it is a great book, one I've read several times. Romkey takes the vampire tale and gives it a new twist. The first half of the novel, when David Parker first becomes a vampire, is a very lyrical novel. And the second half turns into more of an action sequence. And the two halves work well together. Romkey brings back just about every important historical figure, but it does keep it interesting. I've read most of what Romkey has written, including the other books in this 'series' and nothing else he has written reaches this level (that's not to say that his other book aren't enjoyable, most of them are good). I can't recommend this novel enough. It's great, and I think it should be one of those few books that everyone should read.	2003-01-26

It's more that his life is rather dull. Most of the book focuses on his childhood in Coney Island, where he has no bad memories and no exciting ones. The Depression didn't affect him. His father's death didn't affect him. Nothing affected him. And not much happened. As a result, the memoir tends to drag out. Chapters 8 and 9, titled 'Peace' and Psychiatry' respectively, were very good. That's the period of the war and afterward. Those are the chapters that get into his writing, and this is where the memoir picks up (though it drags again in the final chapter, when we go back to Coney Island and more discussion on what happened to the people he grew up with--which is to say, nothing interesting). And there is little insight into Catch-22 (and if you are Joseph Heller, Catch-22 is the most important thing you've done, an instant classic, and what everyone knows you for--there should have been more of a focus on it), which is truly a shame.	2003-01-26

It is such a great book (check out my review for it). Zelazny created an interesting series with the Amber chronicles. It's well-written and highly entertaining. There are 10 books, and they divide into 2 groups of five. The first five books deal with Corwin and his adventures in Amber. Theseare the better of the books. The last of the books deal with Merlin, Corwin's son, and what happens to him in Amber. You can tell that ther were some years between Corwin's adventure and Merlin's. And Zelazny's style changes. Corwin's books are in a more 'high' style, whereas Merlin's books feel more like a contemporary writer. The language changes. As good as Merlin's books are, I think Corwin's books are the best and it would have been stronger if Zelazny had stopped writing before he took up Merlin's saga. But still, this series is highly imaginitive, well written, and very entertaining.	2003-01-26

Not to worry though, Metal Gear Solid is a classic game (still good even though its sequels and a new game system has come out). It has a great story, great gameplay, and great graphics. Because it doesn't matter how good a strategy guide is (it could be the Holy Grail of strategy guides) if the game [isnt great]. So, onto the guide. This is a great strategy guide. It's good for the beginner (and will walk you through the game) or for the more advanced player (and will help when you get stuck). It has maps, tips, hints, backstory (and it is a good one), and discusses the characters. There's an interview with the creators and the upper levels are in a sealed part of the book, so you can't accidentally see it if you don't want to. This is the Holy Grail of strategyguides. If you have a Playstation or Playstation 2 (and you should by now) or any system that has this game (I'm not sure if others do), then you need to get the game and the guide.	2003-01-24

And it is much better performed than on the page. I could go on slamming him and his work, but I'd rather focus on the three poems in the collection that I actually liked.<br />\\"Driving to Town Late to Mail a Letter\\"<BR>This first poem has no meat to it. But it is a nice image, and sort of gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling inside. It's actually short enough to quote it in full here:<br />It is a cold and snowy night. The main street is deserted.<BR>The only things moving are swirls of snow.<BR>As i lift the mailbox door, I feel its cold iron.<BR>There is a privacy I love in this snowy night.<BR>Driving around, I will waste more time.<br />see, warm and fuzzy.<br />\\"Waking on the Farm\\"<BR>This poem is by far the best in the collection. It feels like Bly's attempt at being Frostian. You get a nice image of the farm, and once again Bly evokes a warm and fuzzy feeling. He also gives some great lines: 'how the stubble,/ A little proud with frost' and 'Breathing seemed frail and daring in the morning.' That's good poetry, and it is a shame that more of Bly's work isn't like that.<br />\\"The Resemblance Between Your Life and a Dog\\"<BR>This poem, my least favorite of the three, but still one I like very much, does just what it says. Compares a person's life with the actions of a dog. It's both funny and a little sad.<br />I'm going to say that you could easily pass on this book. You can find the best of Bly somewhere on the internet and print it up rather than spending the money.	2003-01-13

It's not exactly that. What it is, is a collection of essays and fiction collected by Wolfe and thrown together. Nothing wrong with that, but I want to make sure no one is fooled like I was. That being said, it is a pretty good collection of work. It's divided into five parts. <br />Part 1 (Hooking Up) contains the title essay, one which deals with sex and courtship, then and now. Wolfe doesn't deliver anything new or shocking here. <br />Part 2 (The Human Beast) contains 3 essays. The first deals with the rise of Pentium and the silicon revolution. Wolfe's skill as a journalist is evident here, but the reading is a bit slow. Both of the other essays deal with the digital revolution. It's a topic Wolfe can write about, but not one that is enjoyable to read.<br />Part 3 (Vita Robusta, Ars Anorexica) contains four essays. My favorite piece that I've read by Wolfe is \\"My Three Stooges.\\" Wolfe uses his wit to poke fun at Updike, Mailer, and John Irving, who attacked Wolfe's _A Man in Full_ when it was published. It's a great essay, and you see Wolfe's talents in full. I loved it. There is also his essay \\"The Invisible Artist\\" which contains Wolfe's thought on 'modern art' and the sculptor who designed the sculpture at the Viet Nam Memorial and other works we all recognize, but don't know the artist (and even, as Wolfe points out, may not consider the works art). <br />The next section contains Wolfe's novells \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg\\", which is the only fiction in the collection, but it's a good story. <br />The final section is 'The New Yorker Affair' in which Wolfe spoofed the New Yorker by doing a profile of their editor. It's a great section. <br />The New Yorker Affair, Ambush at Fort Bragg, and my favorite essay \\"My Three Stooges\\" show Wolfe at his best, and they alone are worth the price of the collection. And I'm sureyou'll get some enjoyment out of the other pieces as well.	2003-01-09

It was one of the last projects Stephen Jay Gould finished before he died last May. Of course there are all kinds of arguments that can be made for and against certain selections being included and not included. <br />Three essays really got to me as the best of the bunch (and essays that I imagine I'll reread again and again in the future). The first is Franzen's essay on his father's decline in Alzheimer's. It's a touching essay that is well-written, humorous at times, and helps to understand the `human' reaction to the disease. The other essays is Bernard Cooper's \\"Winner Take Nothing\\" which is a very funny interplay between a father and son who don't understand each other. I remember reading it in GQ, and thinking that this essay surely would be selected for the Best American series. Nicholas Delbanco's essay \\"The Countess of Stanlein Restored\\" is a wonderfully written essay that covers the history of violin making and the restoration of one of the more famous violins, and anyone who loves music will love this essay. <br />Barbara Ehrenreich has an essay discussing her ordeal with breast cancer, and what makes this essay so good is that it isn't all the hopefulness and joy you find in others of its type, rather she deals with the real emotions she felt-the bitterness. And with an almost tongue-in-cheek humor. Sebastion Junger has his `typical' style essay dealing with the fight for freedom in Afganistan. It's well-written, like his work tends to be. Andrew Levy's essay on Robert Carter III shows why we don't know who Carter is-he just isn't quite interesting enough to write about. There's also an interesting essay by Danielle Ofri on one incident in her medical school training (this essay has convinced me to pick up her collection of memoir essays on med school). There's a great essay by Darryl Pinckney dealing with a middle-aged, middle-class black man getting busted for marijuana possession. It's funny and frightening at the same time. Typical New Yorker material though. Gore Vidal has an essay on McVeigh-which is at times well-written, but at other times borders on the paranoid and juvenile. It is an interesting read though. And the final essay of the collection is Wolfson's \\"Moonrise\\" which is another autobiographical essay dealing with the illness of a relative-this one of her son. It's a touching essay that fills the reader with sadness and joy. <br />Some of the weaker essays are: Jacques Barzun's \\"The Tenth Muse\\" which is part biography of Clifton Fadiman and part question on culture, but doesn't ever say anything. And there are the group of obligatory 9-11essays, though not the best I've seen. Amy Kolen has an extremely dull essay, \\"Fire,\\" which I found so boring, I couldn't even finish it.	2003-01-09

And after reading this collection, you can see why it is Doty's best. It's a grim collection, focusing on death and grief, but an elegant one. \\"Bill's Story\\" alone is worth the price of the book. This is a book for anyone who loves poetry or has had AIDS tough their life. Good work Mr. Doty.	2003-01-09

He's written some great novels and short stories, and his Dark Tower books and the Bachman Books I place on my list of greatest works written, but this novel was such a disapointment. This really would have been a better idea for a short story than a novel. The story kept building to something, and then it would fizzle, before it tried to build again, before ending on a fizzle. King tried too hard to keep this from being Christine, and he suceeded there. This is a substandard story. It's an example of trying to hard to be something it isn't. It's an interesting premise--one that should have been handled in the short story format, or novella at the longest.	2003-01-09

The House on Mango Street is a series of interrelated vignettes (keep that in mind: these are not short stories, they are vignettes) that captures the love, joy, family, sorrow, and both hopefullness and hopelessness of growing up a Latina girl. This collection has already been accepted into the canon, and can only become more loved and respected as more young people come across it.	2003-01-09

I missed the expatriat scene of Fitzgerald and Hemingway, the Beats, and Kesey and his counterculture scene. Wolfe's book may not be as good as being there, but it does help those of us born far too late to understand and enjoy the scene. Wolfe writes sympathetically and pretty much from the point of view of the Pranksters, as if he had been there for all of it (he wasn't). Wolfe is a fine journalist, and he does a great job here. I think this is a very important book, and I recommend it along with: Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; Babbs' On the Bus (a nonfictional account of the bus trip); Burroughs' Junky; Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums; and Hunter Thompson's Hell's Angels (which I read right after Wolfe's book). Together they might help the late born Beat understand and live in the world they missed.	2003-01-09

Martin has a formal control over his poetry that isn't seen much today, and his use of language is exquisit. The selection contains translations, poems on pop culture, poems that touch on the deeper levels of being human, and selections from his long narrative 'Passages from Friday' (the Robinson Crusoe story told from Friday's perspective). These poems are not only a wonderful selection of poems, but great examples of technical skill.	2003-01-09

Hunter Thompson brings us gonzo journalism. But he can be serious, while not losing that 'underground' quality. No, Hell's Angels isn't the wild ride Fear and Loathing was, but a more serious study of the Hell's Angels, and who and what, and more importantly, why they are. There is plenty of drugs and alcohol in the book, but not is the style of writing. Thompson writes very straightforward, very serious (and very entertainingly). You can tell he took his topic seriously, and wants us to do so as well. All the way through his 'ending': the beating he took that ended his time with the Hell's Angels. If you are interested in outlaws, or if you are interested in Thompson's work, or if you liked Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests, then you'll love this book. I highly recommend it.	2003-01-09

If you love Murnau's Nosferatu, then this slim volume will only increase your understanding and enjoyment of the film. It covers background and story information, discussions on the filmmaking process, and various interpretations of the film. It's a wonderful book for the film.	2003-01-09

You can't go wrong with the writings inside. <br />There is some great (and at times surprising) fiction inside, which includes: an excerpt from Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man, Kafka's \\"In the Penal Colony,\\" Sylvia Plath's story \\"The Fifteen Dollar Eagle,\\" and Flannery O'Connor's \\"Parker's Back.\\" O'Connor is always a joy to read, and this story is an especially good one. There's even a piece from Herman Melville (selected from Typee). Steve Vender has a most interesting piece on meeting one of the gang members he is to defend--this is a fascinating piece. And there are also vignettes scattered throughout where people discuss their tattoos, as well as other pieces of fiction. <br />And there's poetry by Thom Gunn, Kim Addonizio, Bob Hicok, Mark Doty, Cheryl Dumesnil, J.D. McClatchy, Tony Hoagland, Brenda Hillman, Laura A. Goldstein, Garnett Kilberg Cohen, Michael Waters, Joseph Millar, Katharine Whitcomb, Eliot Wilson, Bruce Bond, Virginia Chase Sutton, Lissette Mendez, Dzvinia Orlowsky, and Denise Duhamel. <br />Not only does it look impressive, it reads very, very well. I'm not surprised that Addonizio put together such a strong selection of work. I can't think of any other person who would have been more suited to this type of anthology. It's a great collection, one I'm sure everyone would enjoy reading.	2003-01-09

He was also one of America's greatest authors--he gave us two of the finest books written, _On the Road_ and _The Dharma Bums_, but _Big Sur_ shows that even he could write poorly. Big Sur is a stream of consciousness novel ... that deals with his alcoholism--though looking at the way Kerouac died, writing it taught him nothing. It doesn't contain the energy or the story that we find in On the Road of Dharma Bums. It's Kerouac's attempt at postmodernism and at showing us what his alcoholism was like. Kerouac is successful in that the confusion and nonlinear narrative does effectively show the confusion (...) of his alcoholism, but as a work of literature, it just fell short. I suppose the book is important in its portrayal of alcoholism and as a piece of Kerouac's work, but it just wasn't that enjoyable, and I was happy when it ended. <br />A final note, Kerouac closes the novel with his (too) long poem \\"Sea\\" which was written when the events of this novel took place. It's a bad poem... <br />On the back cover Ginsberg says some wonderful, and true things about Kerouac's writing. But Big Sur doesn't seem to fit the bill.	2003-01-08

So many of our great writers use Bovary as an example of the novel at its finest. I don't think I'd go quite that far, but it is a great novel. The characters are really nothing special--which is what makes this novel so special. Flaubert manages to write a novel about ordinary people, and yet captivates us. It is a story about love and happiness, or lack thereof. It is a story of adultery, though not as racy as I expected, considering all the controversy it caused. And it is the first story of credit card debt (ah yes, the story of my life). It's well written, though it slows in the beginning and ending of the novel. It's a great work of art.	2003-01-08

I never finished the series (i only got about half way through), but it was something I knew I'd pick up at a later date and read (and now I've purchased the Great Book of Amber, which contains all ten books in the saga, and I'm currently reading it). Zelazny published the first book, Nine Princes in Amber, in 1970. And it turned out to be not only well written, but one of the most original ideas in the world of fantasy (like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series, Jordan's The Wheel of Time, Weiss & Hickman's collaborations, the Dark Elf books of R.A. Salvatore, and so on). The book deals with a family fighting for control of the known world, Amber, and all other worlds, which are 'shadows' of Amber. The reader visits many different worlds, we get swordplay, intrigue, and a cast of great characters. And Zelazny writes in the first person, told from one the brothers, Corwin. But in the beginning, Corwin has amnesia, and doesn't know who he is, or the story of his family. It makes for a great voice and helps keep the reader in a state of suspense and 'knowledgable' confusion, that isn't seen elsewhere in the series, or in many other books. The chronicles of Amber is a highly original, well written series, and Nine Princes of Amber is the best of them.	2002-11-22

Her work is tough, sensual, and very sexual. Her job as a cop and her Latina heritage flavor her poems. This is a beautiful piece of work from a poet who has a lot of potential to be great. She has the flavor of those 'bad girl' poets (like Kim Addonizio, Dorianne Laux, and their matriarch-Edna St. Vincent Millay). This is a strong collection, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.	2002-10-08
1385455:US	53008075	R2IXNBP7C91K64	0618246940	988312797	The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2002 (The Best American Series)	Books	4	17	20	N	N	The Inaugural Edition	This year the Best American Series created a new volume: The Best American Nonrequired Reading. Michael Cart (My Father's Scar) is the series editor, and Dave Eggers is the guest editor. And considering it's Eggers, this volume should do well. It contains some good stories and articles. What hurts it the most is a lack of continuity. It's hard to figure out just what falls into the category of 'nonrequired reading,' even after reading the introductions and the collection. It is a combination of fiction and essays, and seems to have a humourous and experimental slant. It also seems to be directed, as the editors say, to the younger generation, those that fall between 15 and 25 (but good essays and fiction are good for all ages). Most selections come from 'alternative' sources, but there are a few that first appeared in The New Yorker and Esquire and the likes. Still, it is tough to figure out exactly what the criteria for being chosen for this volume is. Even so, it is a good volume of work, well worth reading (like the Best American series tends to be). <br />The essays/articles in the volume cover a wide range. There is humor (Jenny Bitner's \\"The Pamphleteer\\"; Seth Mnookin's \\"The Nice New Radicals\\"; \\"Jiving With Your Teen\\" by Seaton Smith; and two selections from The Onion). There's an essay (\\"Generation Exile\\") about Tibet, drugs (\\"Speed Demons\\" which concerns methamphetamine use in Thai), illegal aliens (Kamber's \\"Toil and Temptation\\") and their adjustment to America. Sara Corbett's poignant essay \\"The Lost Boys\\" (from The New York Times Upfront) about refugees from Africa, and their culture shock and adjustment of coming to America (Minnesota no less). Eric Schlosser's \\"Why McDonald's Fries Taste So Good\\" is here. And there are the essays that don't quite fit (Finkel's essay from the New York Times Magazine about the battle in Afghanistan- pre Sept 11; Gary Smith's \\"Higher Education\\", which is an article from Sports Illustrated about a high school coach who comes to a small Mennonite community and opens their eyes and hearts ). Overall the essays shoot for a younger audience and one that is more Eco or Libertarian. I found the essays to be pretty weak, overall. There are some good ones, but these feel like rejects for the sister publication, Best American Essays. <br />And for fiction there is Sam Lipsyte's \\"Snacks\\" about a youth's alienation because of obesity; Elizabeth McKenzie's great story \\"Stop That Girl\\" which covers a child who feels she is being replaced by her mother's new husband and baby, and this story has a great ending; Keith Pille's \\"Journal of a New COBRA Recruit\\" from McSweeneys.net, which is a hilarious short about a youth joining COBRA (from G.I. Joe) and his training, and this one is very funny; Rodney Rothman's \\"My Fake Job\\" from The New Yorker is a hilarious account of a man pretending to work somewhere-you have to read it to truly appreciate it (and it caused a bit of controversy from the New Yorker; David Schickler's \\"Fourth Angry Mouse\\"; \\"Blood Poison\\" by Heidi Jon Schmidt (which contains a dark undercurrent, probably of molestation); the always hilarious Dave Sedaris with his \\"To Make a Friend, Be a Friend\\" from Esquire. The final two selections, both fiction, of the volume definitely fall under the experimental. Adrian Tomine's comic, \\"Bomb Scare\\" from Optic Nerve #8 is here. It is somewhat disjointed and the title doesn't fit, but it is a story of troubled teens. And then there are selections from \\"Please Don't Kill the Freshman\\" written by a h.s. freshman girl, who goes under the pseudonym `Zoe Trope.' This one is self published and pretty bad. Very disjointed, and once again, troubled teen. The fiction runs the range from the bad to the really good, but most fall in the middle range. They seem like the selections that didn't quite made the Best American Short Stories cut (except for Sedaris, Rothman, and Pille). <br />And there is just bad work in here: Camden Joy's \\"Hubcap Diamondstar Halo.\\"<br />But the volume is only [$$$], and for your money, you do get some good reading in.	2002-10-07
1390545:US	53008075	R1J0TY24MXI04U	0060930187	802369838	The Bell Jar: A Novel (Perennial Classics)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	a confessionalist novel	Let me first say that in rating this novel, I waffled back and forth between 4 and 5 stars. I finally decidedo n 4 stars, but it could just as easily have been 5.<br />Sylvia Plath made a name for herself with her poetry and this, her only novel. She was one of the confessionalist poets, along with Anne Sexton, she studied with Robert Lowell. The Bell Jar carries her confessionalistic work into fiction. This is based pretty heavily on her life. The Bell Jar is like a Catcher in the Rye for girls. It's pretty well written, though you can tell it is an inexperienced novelist. It is a shame she killed herself so young, because not only was she a great poet, but she had such potential to become a great fiction writer. Plath successfully carries us down into insanity with her protagonist. The narration works very well in keeping the reader as disjointed as our heroin (It's similiar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in that matter, only not to the extreme--and it paints a prettier and more approving picture of the mental health system of the time). We never get a good idea as to why the breakdown occurs, but as in real life, these matters are often confusing. My biggest problem with the book isn't the somewhat juvenile style of writing, but it is the ending of the novel. It seems a little to pat. We don't feel that the narrator has worked through her problems, or that her mental health should be better, it just sort of becomes better. Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending. But it is a fine novel, one that I enjoyed.	2002-10-02

I won't go into too much detail of the stories that make up Twice-Told Tales (I'm saving that for the Library of America edition), but I want to take a minute to talk about this Reader's Digest Edition. It only contains the 'Twice-Told Tales', but those are some of Hawthorne's best known stories: 'The Minister's Black Veil' and 'Dr. Heidegger's Experiment'. It's a well made volume with nine illustrations  that aren't very well done. Really, you are better off getting the Library of America edition of Hawthorne's Tales and Sketches. It's more complete, better crafted, and doesn't have those horrid illustrations. What is interesting about this edition are two reviews contained. One by Poe and the other by Longfellow. Unfortunately they are here 'in an adapted form' which is a problem Reader's Digest seems to have. It's nice to have them here, but it would be nicer if they were in the original form. I give a five for the stories, but a 2 for the Reader's Digest edition. So I've settled on a three for this review.	2002-09-30

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the greatest novels written. Certainly Kesey's best and the best to come out of the counterculture movement of the 60s. The book is told from the point of view of Chief, who has schizophrenia. This causes the pov to be skewed, and a certain amount of distrust in the narrator (is Big Nurse really that bad, or is it Chief's illness?) It's a heroic story, McMurphy being our (anti)hero. There's so much going on in the book, you could write a book analyizing it. I will say that if you liked the fiction of the Beats or Hunter Thompson, you'll definitely like this novel. It is also told in one of the most intersting voices - along with novels like Huck Finn, Great Gatsby, Catcher in the Rye. This i definitely one of the best novels written.<br />I have the Viking Critical Edition of the book. Besides a great introduction, a chronology of Kesey's life, and the text, there are also three other sections, topics for discussion and paper, and a selected bibliography. <br />Section 2 contains letters from Kesey, and selections concerning Cuckoo's Nest from Kesey's Garage Sale. There are Kesey's sketches of what he visualized the characters to look like and an early draft of the opening sequence of the story. There's also an excerpt from Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.<br />Section 3 contains literary criticism of the the novel, and these are some great selections of the work done on Kesey's novel.<br />Section 4 is called analogies and perspectives. It contains scientific articles on lobotomy and shock treatment. It's a great addition to a critical edition, and one that you don't see done elsewhere. There are also excerpts from Dale Wasserman's play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ellison's Invisible Man (chapter 11), Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, and Jack Kerouac's On the Road (where Sal and Dean meet). And there is a sketch of Neal Cassady written by Kesey (taken from Kesey's Garage Sale), which is great to comparewith Kerouac's Dean Moriaty. <br />Cuckoo's Nest is one of the masterpieces of American literature, one everyone should read. And the Viking Critical Edition is a great edition to have. I'd recommend getting this edition of the book, but if not, at least pick up another edition. This is great stuff.	2002-09-30
1392742:US	53008075	RUTWBVPJB1456	0767902890	852411699	The Things They Carried	Books	5	2	2	N	N	stunning work	I had high expectations for this book. The reviews are all good. Everyone who I know who's read this book has loved it and said it was great. The excerpts and stories from it I've read were great. The expectations were so high, I was afraid it would be another let down. But it wasn't. O'Brien's book is great (I've added it to my list of best books ever written). <br />The Things They Carried is a series of related short stories that create a novel. They all concern Alpha Company, which is the fictional O'Brien's company in Viet Nam. (Just to take a moment to clarify here, this book is in the fiction section of book stores, and O'Brien calls it a work of fiction rather than a memoir. I don't know how autiobiographical the stories are, but until I hear Tim O'Brien say otherwise, I'm assuming it is a work of fiction) At times the stories narritive flow is in such a way that they could be chapters of a novel, and at other times the individual stories are outside one another (the final story of the collection 'The Lives of the Dead' has the narrator telling us, after the war, about something that happened to him when he was a child of nine year. It doesn't fit with the others action wise, but thematically it is a nice capstone to the collection). Overall these stories fit together nicely. Most are told in first person. A few in third. A few are first person, but O'Brien is listening to another member of Alpha Company telling him about an incident that happened when O'Brien wasn't around. The stories patch together in an interesting, original, and highly effective way. The book was a finalist for the Pulitzer (beat by Updike's Rabbit at Rest) and the National Book Critics Circle Award, and won France's Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger (Best Foreign Novel) and the Chicago Tribune's Heartland Prize (I can't believe it didn't win the Pulitzer or National Book Award). The stories appeared in Esquire, Playboy, GQ, 'The Things They Carried' appeared in the Best American Short Stories 1987, and two stories appeared in the Prize Stories, The O Henry Award anthologies: \\"Speaking of Courage: (1978) and \\"The Ghost Soldiers\\" (1982).<br />All of the stories were great, but in a collection of great stories, two stuck out as phenomenal stories. \\"The Things They Carried\\" is the opening selection, and introduces us to the characters, Viet Nam, and O'Brien's talented writing and the great voice he uses to pull you into his fiction. \\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\\" is an almost surreal story of one a soldier who was able to smuggle his girlfriend into Viet Nam. It's a haunted story that shows how Viet Nam changed people. And it has a surprise and disturbing ending.<br />This is one of those truly great books, that only comes along once in a while. I've only read 30 or so books that I could place on par with this one (check out my 'Official Book Club' to see what else). This is a phenomenal piece of art.	2002-09-30

I will read this anywhere.<br />Now, the very thought of eating something like green eggs or green ham makes me nervous...food poisoning and all... But in Seussland green food doesn't mean food that has turned. <br />This is a classic children's tale (and the only children's book that has made my list of best books ever) that teaches children about keeping an open mind (and not just with food, this lesson extends to people and other activities). It's well written, and the rhyme and repition not only makes the book fun to read, but also helps in memorization (yes, your children will be able to recite it along with you).

But it didn't quite live up to what I expected it to be. Philip K. Dick is a great writer. And DADES is a great book, but I just didn't think that was all it was said to be.

I loved Junky, and it is one of my favorite books, but queer was a let down. It takes place after junky ends and we follow William Lee around with his fascination with Eugene Allerton and his trip to South America. But the story isn't that interesting. There is more of a plot here than there was in junky, but I found Lee's struggles with heroin much more fascinating than his obssession over the boring Allerton. queer is told from an outside narrator rather than from Lee's perspective, and as a result, the voice that helped make junky so great is missing. It just doesn't match with the standards Burroughs set when he wrote Junky. If you are a Beat scholar, then this is a book you should read (it is one of Burroughs important works) or if you study gay literature, then you should read this. If you're just looking for a good book, reread Junky...	2002-09-24

And while it hasn't made my list of greatest books written, it is a good book to read. It's tough to give a synopsis of the book, since like so many other British writers there isn't much of a plot, more of a portrait of a group within society. I guess you could say it is the story of Larry Darrell's search for God. But it only touches on spiritual matters. It doesn't go into the discussion we hope for. (If you're looking for a treatise on spirituality, read Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Kerouac's The Dharma Bums, and Anne Rice's Tale of the Body Theif) Maugham himself is a character and narrator of the book. He sort of reminds me of Nick in The Great Gatsby, but only a little. Maugham is a part of the action, but still separate from it. What this book reminds me of is a work by Jane Austen, but written better (I'm known for my dislike of Austen's work). I don't really get into Brit lit from the 18th and 19th centuries, but this book reminds me of that period. But written in such a way I found I enjoyed it. There isn't much linear structure to the novel. A lot of the action takes place in flashback, or in stories told in flashbacks. But Maugham keeps the reader from being confused. The book reads like a book. You know how some stories draw you in, to the point where you are a part of the story? The Razor's Edge isn't like that. You always feel like you are reading a book written by the narrator or that the narrator is telling you the story. There is a distance between the reader and the narrator and the narrator and the story. I think that is what holds the book back.	2002-09-24

Regardless of whether or not he'll be remembered a hundred years from now, and regardless of some people's opinion of the content of his verse, he is a good poet. He is one of the few who successfully use humor in his poems. His poems are easy to understand, but still have a literary backing to them. You don't have to have a doctorate in English to understand what he writes, but you can tell Collins is intelligent and well-read. You find yourself chuckling at some poems, and many times wishing you had come up with a phrase or an idea he uses.

He has edited the definitive editions of both Thomas Hardy's and E.A. Robinson's work. And the man knows more about poetry than most people. But I found his own work to be uneven. The Collected Poems contains some good poetry, and as a whole it is an enjoyable read. But there were sections of the book that didn't seem up to par with the rest. I especially found the clerihews, couplets, and 'prose and cons' to be weak, and they invaded (a little) some of the other sections. Light verse is a joy to read, and a valuable form of poetry, but it seemed to me that Mezey didn't take them serious enough (no pun intended) to make them come off successful. But the first half of the collection I found to be really good. Mezey's Collected Poems is, overall, a good collection, and one worth reading.	2002-09-18

And when you think of the best short story writers, you think of Ernest Hemingway and John Cheever. Cheever has been called the Chekhov of the American short story. Cheever's stories deal with suburban life, but with a bit of surrealism in it. And this Pulitzer prize winning collection is a must have on any list. It contains two of the best short stories ever written, \\"The Swimmer\\" and \\"The Five-Forty-Eight.\\" Some of the other of Cheever's best are: \\"The Enormous Radio\\", \\"Torch Song\\", \\"The Cure\\", \\"The Sorrows of Gin\\", \\"O Youth and Beauty!\\", \\"The Housebreaker of Shady Hill\\", \\"The Worm in the Apple\\", \\"The Country Husband\\", \\"The Scarlet Moving Van\\", \\"The Music Teacher\\", \\"The Brigadier and Gold Widow\\", \\"Artemis, the Honest Well Digger\\".

The first is a series of essays and self-interviews that discuss Orwell's 1984. These are a great group of essays that really throw some light on Orwell's novel. Anyone who likes 1984 should read these essays. The second half is a novella of Burgess titled 1985. The dust jacket gives the impression that it is supposed to be a sequel of sorts. It isn't. It is a dystopia that takes place in 1985 (written in 1978) and is supposed to be a (more) possible scenario at the time. It isn't very entertaining, and a lot of ideas, characters, themes, etc aren't fleshed out the way they should be. But I suppose that could do with the shortness of the story. And Burgess should have been more careful with his title. Burgess's 1985 isn't a frightening or as well written as Orwell's 1984, and Burgess drawing the reader to make a comparison only hurts his story. After the novella is a short chapter on Worker's English (WE) which is Burgess' version of Newspeak. The problem is that WE isn't used much in the story, is really nothing more than a little slang, and I understand that Burgess only has the chapter/essay because of Orwell's explanation of Newspeak, but it is dull and unnecessary. Then Burgess finishes out the volume with another self-interview which discusses the possibility of his future. All this in only 270 pages. Still, the discussion of Orwell's 1984 that the first half is comprised of is excellent and the book is worth finding, if only for that.	2002-08-08

Orwell wrote a novel warning us of what could happen if political power went unchecked, and his warning was especially to his contemporaries living in the post-war England. Orwell does a brilliant job of capturing the despair and dinginess of life in his 1984. In fact he does it so well that if the reader is not careful the general mood of the novel could invavde the reader's life (it did mine). This book has been called one of the few masterpieces of modern literature. The third section especially so. Rarely have I read anything as great or powerful as part three of 1984. The dangers that Orwell warns us of leap forth in this section--the loss of free will and the total breaking of the human spirit, which we all would like to believe always survives. But it doesn't.	2002-08-05

I don't know that you could call this much of a memoir, it doesn't go into great detail, and just sort of skims over his years in Paris. It was definitely written by an older Hemingway, one who was full of himself and bitterness. The style of writing seems different. This isn't the Hemingway I know from his short stories. The narration seems almost child-like, and definitely not written as well as his short stories. But don't let me make you think I didn't enjoy this book. Hemingway is still the greatest and A Moveable Feast was a wonderful book to read, if only for his portrait of Scott Fitzgerald. And there is a lot more humor used here than in his short stories. This book didn't break into my list of favorites, but it came close.<br />(As a sidenote, if you enjoyed reading this, or want more like it, pick up Scott Berg's biography of Maxwell Perkins, _Max Perkins: Editor of Genius_, who was Hemingway's and Fitzgerald's editor at Scribner's.)	2002-08-05

I didn't buy this book to pick out baby names. As a writer, names are important, essential to the meaning of my work, so I knew I'd need to pick up a name dictionary eventually. It took me a while to figure out that I 'name dictionaries' are 'baby name books.' So I searched through the baby section at my local chain bookstore (which is nerveracking for a 25 year old single male with no children, no pregnant women, and no desire to have children) trying to pick one out. Most didn't quite give the information I was looking for. I only found two that filled my needs. This was the one I decided to go with. It's published recently (1998), covers many cultures, and has almost 700 pages of names. It's cross-referenced, gives a definition, some famous people with the name, variations on the name, origin of the name, and so on. I have found a few innacuracies, some major (Jubal, which means 'father of all' is said in this book to have an uncertain meaning possibly based on a musical instrument), some only minor. Still, it is a good reference for the general information needed. And I didn't find a better one when I was looking.	2002-08-03

It's what I like about Laux's poetry, she is sensual, sexual at the same time a tough woman. Her poetry is much like Kim Addonizio's, who is one of my favorite contemporary poets. And they are friends, so it is no surprise that Addonizio has lead me to Laux. Dorianne's poems range from poems about the innocence of childhood to the raw, sexual poems that close the volume. Dorianne Laux writes the kind of poetry that I love to read. I highly recommend her work, especially if you are a fan of Millay, Addonizio, Kate Light, or April Lindner.	2002-08-03

And if you thought Heinlein had a lot to say in Starship, wait to you hear what all he has to say in Stranger. It's the story of a man, Valentine Michael Smith, who was born on Mars, grew up among the Martians, and then came back to Earth. This is the story of how he learns and what he does. And it is Heinlein's theological treatise. I found I liked parts 1 and 2 better, where Mike learns about humans and their culture. After that the book goes real heavy into the religion Smith creates. There it bogs down a little, feels a bit dated, and has the tendancy to be somewhat hypocritical of itself. But those are just a few minor flaws. This book is well-written, and one of my favorites.	2002-08-01

What makes this such a powerful piece, and why, like all classics, it will last for all time, is the interactions and relationships of the characters, both with others and within themselves. The fact that Fort Repose was not destroyed in the nuclear war forced people to make a choice. Survive or give up. Who digs deep to become a leader? Where do all those silver spoons go? And will all the disaster, can you still be a moral man? Alas, Babylon has always been a quick read for me. Not because it is simple (it isn't) but because of the authors skill with narrative and characterization.	2002-07-27

And if this isn't _THE_ Great American Novel, then it comes close to being so. It's a simple story of a love triange. But it is so much more than that. Fitzgerald captures the period of The Jazz Age, and is considered to a certain degree, a social historian, by himself if no one else. What strikes me most about this book is the voice Fitzgerald uses to tell the story. There are a handful of narrators in American fiction whose voice stands out as so good, that it lifts the story above being merely good. Examples are Huck Finn, Holden Caufield, and Nick Carroway.	2002-07-27

I think that regardless of your opinion of the novel, you have to admit its importance to our culture, and just how many people it has touched. It's because Salinger works it on many different levels. When I read it first in my early teens, it touched that teen angst that we all seem to be filled with. But as I got older, and as I re-read the book, I begin to see that it isn't normal teenage feelings. As I age, I can understand the sadness, the despair, being lost like that. This is not just a book for young people. It transcends age (though you may be reading it in secret).<br />The other thing about this book that grabs you is the voice of the narrator. I've always felt that voice awas one of the most important aspects to any story. Those with an interesting voice, like Huck Finn or Nick Carroway or Holden Caufield, last forever. Regardless of your opinion of J.D. Salinger (and I'm no big fan of his), you have to admit, The Catcher in the Rye is a a great book.	2002-07-27

And if this were like most books on the subject, it probably wouldn't tell you.\\" I think this is like most books on the subject. You leave this book still unsure of what Postmodernism is. I suppose Postmodernism is too complex a subject to really get a grasp on in such a short format. The book takes a lot of different divergences, and in the end you know little more than what you started with. It is a good book to help you figure out what to read and look into for an explanation of Postmodernism. I'd say it is more of a guide as to where to go to learn about Postmodernism than an explanation of Postmodernism. It does get interesting at the end when it discusses Postmodern Artifacts (including cyberpunk, Madonna, and MTV). I'd say go ahead and pick it up. It won't teach you what Postmodernism is, but it'll give you an idea of where to go.	2002-07-18

Rhina Espaillat is a wonderful formal poet. I highly recommend her last book, 'Where Horizons Go.' This latest collection is easily as good. Once again she shows her mastery of meter and form (and this one is also loaded with sonnets) and she has a graceful use of language. The subject material of this collection seems to be a bit more serious. <br />The best I can do for this book is to briefly look at my three favorite poems. \\"Retriever\\" is a dramatic monologue where the narrator is a dog. It's a touching poem about the love and devotion of dogs towards their people. The essence is in why dogs do this: \\"...Why/ do I serve him? Who else would recover/treasures hes always losing? \\" It's a touching and humorous poem. \\"Unto Each Thing\\" takes the topic of death, and life. Where a neighbors garden blooms more beautiful the spring their child died. We like to think that life and beauty in the face of death can help. But \\"too much, smell wearied, skin recoiled/from silk and velvet leaves to touch\\", and Rhina shows us it does not. The final stanza really sticks with you: <br />and mind ached with the gardeners back<BR>bent to the clacking of old shears<BR>over big, heavy-breasted blossoms<BR>gathering earthward like slow tears.<br />\\"Three Versions\\" is a poem where the narrator dreams her own death. It contains lines such as: \\"I settled in the mould, but begged them to/take word of me to those my death would wrong\\" and \\"I woke to the third days inhuman chill,/rank with the scent of mould. I smell it still.\\"<br />This collection spends a lot of time delving into death and other more serious concerns not seen as much in her earlier collections.	2002-07-02

And it is a brilliant collection. This year Murphy's second collection, Very Far North, has arrived. Murphy still writes mostly short poems with short lines (dimeter and trimeter). And he does it well. He has a tremendous wit, and even more impressive is the seriousness and quality of his verse that you don't normally see in lines and poems this short. Murphy is a regional poet (much like our greatest regional poet, Robert Frost) who speaks of local and global concerns. This collection isn't quite as good as his first (which would be hard to top), and like the first collection it does get a little weaker towards the end, but this is a marvelous work and one I highly recommend.	2002-07-01

I've found her to be a wonderful poet. In her own language. Rather, translated from Romanian. I very happily sat down with this collection, ready to dive into poems that are beautiful, musical, and important pieces. What I found were trivial poems that tried to be playful and musical, but came across flat. They struck me as trite, and what is really sad is that I probably give the book more credit because of my respect for her and her earlier work. I say pick up _Life Sentence_ because that is the Nina Cassian we all know and love. (Oh, this collection does contain her translation of Jabberwocky into Romanian, but since I don't know how to pronounce the Romanian alphabet, it is just something to look at and not something you can really appreciate hearing. There is also her poem \\"Impreciation\\" in something called \\"English Spargan\\" which is her Jabberwockish made up language, and instead of being fresh and interesting, it seems rather embarassing. Maybe it comes across better in the origianl \\"Sparga Romana\\".)	2002-07-01

Tim Murphy is different from the Formalist poets. Murphy has masted the short line--the dimeter or trimeter. Murphy's poems are metrically sound, without being sing-song. More often than not his rhymes are original and flow with the poem. And though the short line is often used for light verse, Murphy shows that it can be powerful when used seriously. Murphy's poems are the poems of the farmer (a highly educated and well-read farmer) and are easily accessible. The few poems that are of longer line length are also well done, showing that Murphy can write in pentameter as well. I didn't like the final section as much, titled \\"Early Poems\\" which I'm guessing he wrote in his youth. The poems are classical in nature and subject, their line lengths are longer, and though they are good, I think can see them as the poems he wrote while trying to find his voice. And I'm glad he did, because it is a strong voice. These poems are a joy to read, and I look forward to reading his new book. (My favorite poems: \\"The Peg-leg Pig\\", \\"Jasper Lake\\", \\"Lonesome Peak\\", \\"The Quarrel\\" and \\"A Dog Young and Old\\")	2002-06-16

This is just the type of book that wins these types of awards. Goldbarth's poems tend to be prosey and verbose. He has some good ideas behind the poems, and a few good lines. But that isn't what we read poetry for--ideas. Where are the images that can't be forgotten? Where is the play that language does so well? This is a poet like Jorie Graham, one who tries to say something, then gets bogged down with free association. There is some good stuff in the poems, but as a whole they are a let down. The opening poem, \\"Library\\" happens to be a poem where this works, but it is a list poem, and you can get a little wordy in those. The book runs a little long for a poetry collection (over 120 pages). Goldbarth could have used a good editor cull it some.	2002-06-16

Rather boring cover, and for once the cover predicts the book. Touchwood is divided into three sections. The poems in Section one are generally dull. Davis switches between pretentious phrasings to what can only be described as prose written as verse. I found most of the rhymes to be predictable, forced, or just bad. Section two gets a little better. As an epigramist, Davis is pretty good. The short nature of the poem suits his style, and brings out a wit that the first section is completely void of. The bitterness that comes out in Davis writing is well suited for shorter poems, that and if the poem ends in only a few lines it doesn't have time to bore you. But towards the end of this section two the quick, witty epigrams we had been reading disappeared and the final four or five poems revert back to what was seen in the first part. Section three is a long narrative poem, \\"Esther,\\" which retells the story of Esther and Mordacai. Now, normally I like narratives. But in the longer poem (and this one goes on for 17 pages) Davis loses control of his story, rhyme, and interest. It's a book that had a lot of potential to be great, but fell short because Davis lost touch with what he is good at. Of note, Davis defines the word touchwood: 'decayed wood...used as tinder'. Fitting I think.	2002-06-15

It does tend to gloss over or mock his philosophy at times, and there are quite a few illustrations that don't emphasize the point and that won't help you remember, that just seem to be there to fill space. But it does give the basics of his philosophy and the time he lived in. I wouldn't try to substitute this for reading the actual works written by him, but it can't hurt you. Nietzsche is tough reading, and this can only help.	2002-06-15

I've found that the books that win this prize are generally good one. And Diane Thiel's book is a good one. She writes formal poetry with great attention to the rhythms and language of the poems. They are graceful poems and more often than not, the endings are stunning. And it's no wonder that her book won the award. If you look at the acknowledgments page, you'll see it runs a page and a half. It looks like just about every poem has been published in a journal, and several in award anthologies. <br />The book is divided into four sections. Section one, \\"Kinder-und Hausmarchen\\" deals with her father and her German heritage. It reminds the reader a little of Plath, but Thiel doesn't have the extremes that Plath thought she had. The poems are darker and hint at a rough childhood for the narrator. \\"He brought them with him--the minefields./He carried them underneath his good intentions./He gave them to us--in the volume of his anger [\\"The Minefield\\"] And one of the best poems in the book, \\"Love Letters,\\" is found her. It's a poem about a woman learning German to understand the language of her husband and children. And the coldness returned sums up what this section is about--a distant father.<br />Section 2, \\"Memento Mori\\" (which is a reminder of mortality, failures, or mistakes) contains the best poem in the collection, \\"Memento Mori in Middle School.\\" It's written in loosely rhymed terza rima and is about the narrator's oral (with visual aids) project in middle school. Thiel takes us through each of Dante's circles from both the child and the poet's understanding. This poem alone makes the collection worth buying. The rest of the poems in this section also deal with childhood.<br />Section 3, \\"Distance\\" is more loosely themed around adult love and loss. \\"South Beach Wedding\\" (about a couple strolling onto a movie set wedding)and \\"Bedside Readers\\" showcase Thiel's wit. <br />The final section, \\"The River Blued\\", seems a sort of catch-all for the left-over poems. There is no theme running through it, but there are some interesting poems. \\"History's Stories\\" is a twelve lined poem that echoes itself at the end of the line. And the echoed words create a phrase that sums the poem up. I forget the name of the form, but she does it well, and it doesn't seemed forced. She closes on the title poem, which seems fitting as the narrator walks through a hwaelweg (noted as 'whale-road, Old English kenning), and brings the whole collection into completion and touches on all themes in the book. <br />Echolocations is a well thought out, well written book. It's an impressive collection of poems, much less being a first book. It's a book I highly recommend, and one I think you will enjoy (especially if you enjoy the work of Kim Addonzio, Kate Light, April Lindner, Morri Creech, or Dana Gioia).	2002-06-14

Her poems aren't constricted or artificial, but come out with an elegance not often seen in poets today. Every poem in this collection is evidence that she loves language, poetry, and the challenge that comes in writing in rhyme and meter. The subjects of her poems range widely, though there does seem to be a high ratio of poems about poetry. There is also an interesting essay at the end of the collection that discusses growing up bilingual (Espaillat is from the Dominican Republic, and Spanish is her native tongue), which leads into a discussion of the beauty of language. Both the poems and the essay make this a book to treasure.	2002-06-14

Nine times out of ten it doesn't work. This is the tenth time. Gaylen's photographs are beautiful images that mesh well with the elder Morgan's poetry.

Though with this collection it is tough to see why. Most of the reviews are fair and pretty accurate reviews. He doesn't get too rough on the poets, though you can see in some of the later reviews where his reputation as a tough reviewer begins. Over all most of the reviews were done in an uninteresting way, but then Logan himself admits that this is all the apprentice reviews that he wants to save. The collection starts off with an essay \\"The Prejudices of Aesthetics\\" which is interesting. The center essay is a poorly written essay on Auden (\\"Auden's Images\\"). One of the more interesting pieces of the collection is the interview with Logan at the end of the book. Otherwise there are reviews, some written poorly and others well written. As to his reputation as the most hated man in poetry, I'll have to read his later reviews to see where it comes from. This book is interesting as a history of William Logan, but nothing that demands to be on your shelf.	2002-06-13

But lately it seems that Longman is coming up and taking over. First there are the pocket anthologies edited by R.S. Gwynn, better than anything Norton has. Then there is the Longman Anthology of Short Fiction edited by Dana Gioia and R.S. Gwynn, which should take the place of Norton as the standard that all other textbooks should be compared with. And finally there is the series of anthologies edited by X.J. Kennedy and Dana Gioia. <br />The Introduction to Fiction is an excellent anthology written by one of the best poets of this generation and one of the best poets of the older generation. Kennedy's years of experience in the literary world, and his years of experience writing for children (making things easy to understand), and Gioia's take on literature from outside the world of academia have given this anthology an ease of understanding that you won't find in anything Norton has put together. They write clearly. They have chosen good stories, and ones that help understand the topic of the chapter. As well as a `writer's perspective' which adds understanding to the story. They also have added two new casebooks on Raymond Carver and Flannery O'Connor. <br />I'd say that without any doubt Longman will overtake Norton with this anthology. In fact the only Fiction anthology that I find to be any better than this one is the Gioia & Gwynn Short Fiction anthology, also put out by Longman.	2002-06-13

More controversy, and all collected in this slim volume for us to take in. It starts with Gioia's essay \\"Fallen Western Star\\" which chronicles San Francisco's fall from it's height as the second largest literary center in the US. Like most of Gioia's essays, it is well-written, well-though out, and pertinant. It applies to more than just San Francisco, but discusses the danger we are in of losing all regional literature. And from there it was a hornet's nest had been poked. There are some well written discussions from Jack Foley (who edited the collection) and Richard Silberg (who opposes Gioia). Silberg makes a good case and writes almost as eloquently as Gioia does. I leave it up to the reader to decide which side is right. There are also well written responses from Dave Mason, Jonah Raskin, Micheal Lind, and Scott Timberg. There is also a letter from Howard Junker, which really doesn't belong here because it is a rant against Gioia, which is not thought out at all and clumsily written. The book is one that is essential to understanding the state of American literature. As usual, Gioia is in the center of some flurry of anger or controversy, but as usual Gioia makes a point that all of us need to understand to help save the state of American Letters.	2002-06-13

This is not some sort of surrealist or postmodern collection. Paul Lake is a poet very much grounded in narrative and form. The book is divided into three sections. The first section is the weakest of the book. Lake has several good narrative poems throughout the collection ('Thorn' 'Inspectors'). Included in the first section is the narrative \\"Walking Backward\\" which is a great story told by a draft dodger or his draft dodging and of life's treatment of people. Section 2 only contains the long narrative poem \\"Seeing the Elephant\\" which is a great poem about a survivor of the Donner party. Section three, the strongest in the collection ends with one of the best poems, \\"Two Hitchhikers\\" which is not only a great ancedote, but has a hilarious ending. The collection has some very well done dramatic monologues, but where it weakens is in the lyric poems. \\"Pieces\\" and \\"Revised Standard Version\\" are pretty much the only lyric poems worthwhile. The rest bring down the collection as a whole. I wish that Lake had just included the narratives, a few of the dramatic monologues and those two lyrics. Perhaps to round the collection out more he could have included another narrative poem, which seems to be his strong suit.	2002-05-31

Though a bit dated, this is a wonderful book (i have the 1989 paperback edition, so i don't know if he has updated the book). I love the tongue-in-cheek humor that Fussell uses throughout the book. Especially dealing with the middle class. You'll find yourself laughing out loud. And the book is surprisingly relevant. You'd think that a 20 year old book about class in America wouldn't be relevant, but there is a lot to be taken from this book. Like I said, it is a bit dated, but any intelligent person (which most of you reading this book are) can make the changes. And after reading most of the book, and you can't seem to figure out which class you belong to, Fussell introduces, in the final chapter, the \\"X\\" people. Those that don't belong to any class, or create a category of their own. Yeah, not all \\"X\\" people fit all the criteria of Fussell's, but then part of being an \\"X\\" person is that individuality, and not necessarily filling every 'criteria.' This is a great book, if not for Fussell's social statement on America, at least for the humor he uses.	2002-05-31

It's well written and Williams chooses great example poems, and he divides the book seven sections, three appendices, and a glossary, which makes the book very accessible for the reader.

Don't get me wrong, it's probably the best book on prosody out there, but it can be difficult reading. The book is loaded with information, and Steele's knowledge on the subject comes through. But it isn't the book I'd start with. But if you have a general idea of form and meter, then there is no better book to strengthen and teach you. Part One, on iambic verse, should be read by any serious poet. The only problem I found with the book is that Steele uses a lot of Old English, Middle English, and foreign language examples, where I think something we all can sound out would have been a better choice. Still, for anyone who is serious about poetry, this is a book that should be read and studied.	2002-05-28

But don't let Bill Clinton's opinion that Maya Angelou and Miller Williams are in the same class. They are not. Miller Williams is a far, far superior poet than Angelou. What strikes me most about Miller Williams is how 'American' a poet he is (he reminds me much of Carl Sandburg in this respect). Williams is one of the best loved poets of his generation, and for good reason. Of course he has poems that don't quite reach the potential he has, but the vast majority are good poems. I can think of no better way discuss Williams' poetry than by taking the eight best poems he has written. \\"The Caterpillar\\" is the best known and most anthologized of his poems. It's one of his earlier poems that discusses the endless circling of a caterpillar on a bowl, where it continued until it died. One would think it a poem in futility, but the final lines, \\"I think he thought he was going/in a straight line\\" sums it all up, not about futility, but about purpose and nature. \\"The Book\\" is a poem about joy changing to horror. \\"The Curator\\" is a touching poem about a Russian museum in WWII, where the paintings are taken down, in fear of bombing, and the curator describes what the painting are rather than the patrons viewing. It shows what are truly is, especially when the blind come to 'see' the paintings they never could before. \\"Thinking about Bill, Dead of AIDS\\" is a poem about love, even in the face of an unknown, deadly disease. How we love those close to us, even at our own risk and how we protect them, \\"not knowing anything yet,/we didn't know wha tlook would hurt you least.\\" \\"The Shrinking Lonesome Sestina\\" is one of the few good sestinas that exist among the thousands of sestinas out there (much like Elizabeth Bishop's and Dana Gioia's sestinas are worth reading). \\"Personals\\" is one of the funniest poems I've seen in a long time, and I will quote in full:<br />Like a challange? Male, 45<BR>could pass for 60, at least twice divorced,<BR>heavy smoker, sober now and then,<BR>living in trailer home with no water,<BR>looking for female with good job.<br />We may have no more need for half our doctors<BR>and every talk show will fold flat<BR>when we can understand why there are people<BR>who will enclose a picture and answer that.<br />\\"Ruby Tells All\\" is a beautiful poem about a strong woman, that you have to read to fully appreciate. And finally, a poem with one of the most interesting titles I've seen, \\"Why God Permits Evil: For Answer to This Question of Interest fo Many Write Bible Answers, Dept. E-7\\" followed by the epigram \\"ad on a matchbook cover\\". It's a great poem on God and life.<br />What I really like about Miller Williams is his subject matter, which ranges from the mundane to the profound and that he writes in both formal and free verse. He is a treasure to American poetry and one we should all read at some point. After reading his work, it is no wonder that he is as well liked and respected as he is.	2002-05-26

And I've heard both sides of the argument, but if you have read _The Gods of Winter_ than you cannot deny his excellence as a poet (and if you haven't read this collection, then you definitely should go and buy it now). The book is divided into five sections. Section I contains seven of his better poems. \\"All Souls'\\", \\"The Gods of Winter\\", and \\"Planting a Sequoia\\" are here. The poems in this first section are about loss, even \\"Planting a Sequoia\\" which is also about life. Section II contains the longer poem \\"Counting the Children.\\" The poems in Section III are poems more about place rather than the loss of sections I & II. Section IV is the long narrative, \\"The Homecoming.\\" It's a dark poem, Frost-like in its nature, about a troubled boy and what happens when he goes home to his family. The final poems, in Section V, while still dark, leave us with a bit more hope than found in any of the other sections. <br />Gioia's use of language and choice of words is exceptionally beautiful in this collection. And the heartbreak of losing a child if felt throughout. This collection leaves the reader a little sad, but with much to think about.	2002-05-19

She writes the kind of poetry that I really love, poetry that is sensuous, poetry that you can feel across the skin as you read it (her work reminds me very much of Kim Addonizio's and Kate Light's in this respect). In addition to the sensuality of her poetry, Lindner has a real feel for language and meter. Lindner's place in life as a woman, mother, and wife is very much felt in the subjects of her poems. And her word choice is astonishing. You get some great phrases in her poems(`the sky a blade/against my naked throat' -Midtown; `How smoothly the body seduces the mind.' -Condom). The middle section is a series of poems about Alma Mahler, told in a narrative sequence. This is a great first collection, and judging from the quality of these poems, I think we'll be hearing more of April Lindner in the future.	2002-05-19

This collection of 22 stories, her first collection, very much fits in her literary world. None of the stories are very long, in fact a few would be termed 'flash-fiction', but all are well-written and deal with sex to some degree or another, though none are graphic enough to call these stories pornographic. The stories that stick out the most are those that deal with troubled women and their self-destructiveness (which I suppose is just about every story). But before you assume that all is grim, there are stories (such as \\"A Brief History of Condoms\\") that successfully use humor. Might even make you laugh out loud. I am a huge fan of Addonizio's poetry, so it makes me happy to say that as a fiction writer she is pretty good. I look forward to reading more stories (and novels if she chooses to write them) from her.	2002-05-18

Nelson's poetry is good by any standards, but _The Homeplace_ stands head and shoulders above her work, which says quite a bit. I've read her new and selected poems. They were very good. The only complaint is that they weren't divided by volumes, so it wasn't until i picked up _The Homeplace_ and read it that I realized just how good the poems in this volume are. Because _The Homeplace_ isn't a collection of short poems, rather it is one long narrative poem. It's divided into two sections. Section I tells the story of her mother's side of the family, going back five generations to her great-great grandmother, Diverne. The story of this family goes through slavery, the turn of the century, wars, and up to the point where her mother and father meet. It's a heroic and touching story. Section II is the story of her father's time as WWII as a Tuskegee Airman. _The Homeplace_ contains everything good about poetry, and everything that poetry should be: story, form, meaning, love, and a wonderful use of language. This isn't a book you should pass over. It should be read--slowly and again and again.	2002-05-16

Like Richard Wilbur and Anthony Hecht, the New Formalists have much respect for him. And for good reason, as this collection shows. Kennedy writes skillfully in meter and rhyme, and is one of the few poets who writes successfully in light verse (another poet who skillfully uses humor is R.S. Gwynn). Kennedy has also written children's books and textbooks, but this collection shows that his reputation as a poet will never wane.	2002-05-16

This collection, much like the lates one \\"Color Wheel\\", shows why Steele is considered one of the best poets writing formal verse. Every line, every word is well thought out.

It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best.

Heller's brand of absurdist humor creates some of the most poignant moments in literature and some of the most hilarious (there are many, many laugh out loud places here). It is basically the story of Yossarian, a bomber, in the closing months of World War II. He can't understand why thousands of people he hasn't met yet are trying to kill him. And it goes from there. Loaded with absurdist humor. It does turn darker towards the end. This is a very densely packed book, every page loaded with information. It's not a book you can lose concentration while reading. But it is well worth the time and energy it takes to read it. Definitely one of the best books ever written.	2002-04-30

Hemingway's stories covered all range of topics, but mostly he deals with the human heart, in its relation to nature and with others. There is no need to talk about his style of writing because his 'tough, terse' style is legendary. I do wish that \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" were included here instead of by itself. I tried to pick my favorite Hemingway stories and I couldn't narrow it down to any less than 21.  \\"An African Story\\", \\"The Battler\\", \\"The Butterfly and the Tank\\", \\"Cat in the Rain\\", \\"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place\\", \\"Fathers and Sons\\", \\"Fifty Grand\\", \\"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\\", \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\", \\"Indian Camp\\", \\"The Killers\\", \\"The Last Good Country\\", \\"The Light of the World\\", \\"My Old Man\\", \\"One Trip Across\\", \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\", \\"The Snows of Kilamajaro\\", \\"Soldier's Home\\", \\"The Three-Day Blow\\", \\"A Train Trip\\", and \\"Up in Michigan\\".<br />There are few writers that I've found that can handle the short story as well as Hemingway. If you are interested check out the short fiction of Franz Kafka, John Cheever, Shirley Jackson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Mark Twain.	2002-04-20

They've done a lot to bring back narrative poetry (McDowell is the founder of Story Line Press). They wrote these essays together, and weren't afraid to say what they thought--they weren't afraid to make anyone mad (they remind me of Randall Jarrell in that way). Meg Schoerke's introduction and the first Reaper essay introduce those of us who are unfamiliar with The Reaper. \\"Navigating the Flood\\" takes on criticism, and they aren't afraid to name names. Their essay on Wallace Stevens discusses his impact on contemporary poetry and the narrative. Two essays, \\"The Reaper's Non-negotionable Demands\\" and \\"The Elephant Man of Poetry\\" (which is about Robert Frost) are the two best essays in the book, and two of the best essays about poetry. They attack the state of poetry with satire and humor in \\"The Reaper Interviews Jean Doh and Sean Dough\\" and \\"The Dogtown Letters\\", and both essays will make you laugh out loud. The sad thing is that it just as easily could have been real. In addition to four other essays, there is also a guide to writing narrative poetry. This collection is so great that you wish that The Reaper was still in circulation, and you hope that one day Jarman and McDowell will collect a \\"Best of\\" and release it soon.	2002-04-17

Not only is it's title *Best* American Poetry, but the a quick glance at the contents shows these names: A.R. Ammons, Ashbery, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Bly, Creeley, Rita Dove, Thom Gunn, Donald Hall, Paul Hoover, Andrew Hudgins, Donald Justice, Koch, McDowell, Merrill, Pinsky, Charles Simic, Louis Simpson, Snodgrass, Gary Snyder and Richard Wilbur. It's an impressive line up of names. But this collection was a let down. Sure, there were some really good poems (such as the one by Elizabeth Bishop), and there were a lot of ok poems or other poems worth noting, but it isn't worthy of being called the best of any given year.	2002-04-13

I was surprised at how much I liked it. There were a few that I didn't like that much, but most of them were good stories and most were well written. They ranged from ok to good, better, and on up to great stories like Shel Silverstein's story, Edward Lee's twisted story \\"ICU\\", and what i think was the best, Robert Girardi's \\"The Defenestration of Aba Sid\\", which is his 'anti-Grisham' story. A great deal of the selections here come from books and there is no surprise that both Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine both had three stories in here (the most from any one place). I suppose it's because there aren't many genre magazines anymore, but a few of these stories first appeared in literary magazines. The book is a little longer (around 480 pages) than those in The Best American Short Story series, but mystery stories need a little time to unfold. It's a good selection for the mystery reader (no matter which 'type' of mystery story you like) and for those of us who don't normally read the genre.	2002-04-10

It's an ambitious treatment of evil, cowardice, love and family, wrapped up in an great western tale (of the spaghetti type). The Bad Man destroys the town and everyone in it in the first few pages. After that the human spirit thrives (sort of) as a few attempt to rebuild the town and their lives. And look for redemption.	2002-03-31

There isn't much of a story here in the narrative sense, though 2/3 through the book one sort of happens with Coalhouse Walker. This book is more of a portrait of the times and of a slew of interesting characters, which include both real figures (J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, Houdini, etc) and imaginary. Doctorow dips into people's lives for a moment then moves on. One of the faults of the book is that many of the interesting vignettes aren't carried out to completion, rather he just moves on. At the center is an unnamed family (they go throughout the book called only Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, sometimes Younger Brother for short, Grandfather, and the son) that is somehow involved in everyone's life. It doesn't have the social/political importance that _The Book of Daniel_ has, nor the compelling story in _Billy Bathgate_ but it is still a great book to read.	2002-03-29
1603340:US	53008075	R3NU9I2EKSJE59	0743235150	796500127	Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales	Books	5	7	8	N	N	One of King's stronger works	It's been a while since King has put out a collection of short stories, and usually when he does they are more like short novels than short stories. I've said before that I feel King's strong points aren't in his short stories, that he needs a couple hundred pages, at least, to really get a good story going. But this collection of 14 stories was astonishingly good. Maybe even some of his best work. It starts with a short introduction in which King pretty much just defends his e-publishing and other \\"gimmicky\\" ventures. The first story, \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" is the standard `I'm not dead, though everyone thinks I am' story, almost straight out of Twilight Zone, with an interesting King twist on the end. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" is his O. Henry award winning story (first place), and yeah, it's a good story (though I think others in this collection are much better) about a child meeting the devil. Very Hawthorne-ish. Next is one of the best stories in this collection, \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away,\\" which I first read in The New Yorker. Not a typical King story, and proof that he can write outside his genre. And do it well. It's a story about a man who is unhappy with the choices he made in life and ready to kill himself. And King keeps the ending very ambiguous (which he does quite often in this collection), and that may be what really tops the story off. \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" is another story I first read in The New Yorker. This one reminds me somewhat of \\"The Body\\" in that it isn't horror and surprises you that Stephen King wrote it. It's a about John Dillinger. \\"In the Deathroom\\" is a story of torture in Central America (very good). \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" is the capstone of the collection. It is a story about the Gunslinger that takes place before any of the books and early in his quest for the Dark Tower. It deals with the Little Sisters that appeared in Black House and is a bit of a love story. By far the best in the collection. Next is \\"Everything's Eventual\\" that almost takes us back to Firestarter with it's secret government agencies. It's a story about self-esteem and moral choices made in life. \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is a wonderfully touching story with a horrorfying ending. The reality of this story makes it what might be one of King's most chilling pieces. The humor of the story doesn't prepare you for what comes at the end. Previously, King released this as an audiobook, and I think it might be interesting to hear him read it. \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" is a typical King short story. Nothing great about it, nothing spectacular, very mediocre. \\"Lunch at the Gotham Caf\\" is about a divorcing couple (that just happens to get put into a bad circumstance). It's entertaining. A little funny. And a good story. \\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French\\" is King's existentialist story about hell. One that you almost wish he hadn't wrote. Could be the worst in the collection. It's too repetitive, which I know was the point, but it doesn't carry well. \\"1408\\" is a ghost story of sorts. The haunted hotel story. It started off in a way that made me think I wouldn't like the story too much, and even though it never reached the level of the best stories here, it turned out to be a good read. \\"Riding the Bullet\\" is King's e-book. (And shows that a little patience pays off, for those of us who waited and didn't download the story) It's an excellent story about love, guilt, and choices wrapped in King's mean little world. I'm not sure if the point to the story was ever made, at least not the way he intended it, but this story makes you think about the choices you would make if you were in the same situation. At what point does your life become more or less valuable than your mother's? The final story is \\"Lucky Quarter\\" which is really a touching little story. No horror, just a lot of feel-good. This collection contains both of King's audiobooks (Blood & Smoke; L.T.'s Theory of Pets) his e-book (not The Plant, but then he never finished that for us), the story from his computer program F-13 and stories he's published elsewhere (everyone here has appeared somewhere else before). It's a solid collection. Every King fan will own it, and even those who aren't fans of King or his genre will find that at least half of the stories will be to their liking. This collection shows King's skill and maturity as a writer and should further add to the literary respect that is finally coming his way.	2002-03-27

The essays come from magazines who focus on the general reader rather than the scientist. The essays are informative. They teach the reader quite a bit and point out things that come to a surprise to most of us (such as the state of the earth's water supply). And they do it in an entertaining way. Above all else, the essays collected here are fun to read and not loaded with jargon the layman can't understand. A special note: Bill Joy's essay on technology and our future should be read at least twice and thought on long and hard.	2002-03-25

For 25 years Bill Henderson has been doing a noble thing with his Pushcart Prize Anthologies. Looking at the list of previous winners, you see quite an impressive list, and while not every writer of merit is represented, many are. I'm not familiar with the previous editions, but this year's selection seems a bit week. There are 40 poems, and like the entries in the 2001 Best American Poetry, they aren't the strongest choices. There are only three essays (one on apples--bad; one on Milton--great; and one by Seamus Heaney--ok), and you would think there would have been more in this selection. There are 24 pieces of fiction that range from the really bad to the pretty good. And then, a cross between the essay and fiction, there are 10 memoirs that also span the range. Looking at the contributing editors  you'd think Henderson's choices could have been stronger. But we take what we have.	2002-03-23

She has the potential to become of one of the horror genre's great writers. This book dealt with two psychopathic murderers (Andrew and Jay) meeting and joining together. The book is told in rotating points-of-view, between first person Andrew, and the rest third person, Jay, Tran (a boy they set their sites on) and Luke (Tran's ex-boyfriend). I think the book suffers a little in this form. It's too short (less than 250 pages) and the action too fast to sustain rotating between that many points-of-view. The sex scenes can be a bit much at times. There are a few that are there only for gratuitous reasons and not to advance the story. I wish she had spent a little more time on story development than on showing us how good she is at writing homoerotic sex scenes (and why is it that women seem to be the best at writing sex scenes between two males?). But she has an interesting mind and can create some very good scenes and characters. I'll be interested in seeing how she further develops as a writer.	2002-03-18

It's an excellent story about a boy coming of age in the 20s and 30s as a sort of member of Dutch Shultz's gang. He learns lifes lessons from these men. Doctorow's prose is lyrical, a sort of irony when you put the beautiful language Doctorow uses with the violence and moral ambiguity of the characters. This is a great culmination of Doctorow's work.	2002-03-17

Looking at his other books, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But it certainly wasn't this. Doctorow's work has the feel of Kerouac, Burroughs, Heinein's Starship Troopers, Kesey, and Kafka. He takes an incident from one of the most turbulent and trying times in our nation's history and spins a story of a young man trying to understand the life and death of his parents (executed for treason). Doctorow takes on religion, Disney, and the political and social attitudes of America. And he does it well. Daniel is a man who is both confused and very knowing. He's a radical but not like any you've seen before. Doctorow's style is a little disconcerting the first few pages (he jumps between first and third person, both from Daniel's point-of-view, sometimes in mid-sentence), but after you adjust to it, it seems the only way this story could be told. This is a book you have to read. I didn't put it on my list of \\"best ever\\", but it was definitely short-listed for it.	2002-03-15

While not quite as good as his first collection, _Rose_ (which is one of the better first books i've seen), it comes close. Lee has a lyricism and depth that continues to raise the bar for contemporary poets. The central theme of the mythic-hero father that was in Lee's first collection does not dominate this latest collection. Instead, we have poems that try to understand origins from both the father and the mother. _Book of My Nights_ is another poetry collection that deserves to be on your shelf.	2002-03-12

He does not disappoint. The poems have great images and a wonderful use of language. There are some beautiful passages in this collection. The rose is prominent throughout (and the long poem in the second section is about roses) both in the traditional meaning, but more in a different way to look at it. The other prominent figure is the father. The collection seems to be working through the myth, the reality of the hero-figure that is the father. Great work here that you can return to time and again and find something new.	2002-03-11

Henry Awards	Books	3	1	1	N	N	the o henrys are better than this	William Abrahams says in his introduction: \\"the twenty-three stories collected here are not offered as a further refining or pruining into a kond of 'best of the best'\\" and \\"it would not have been difficult to compile an alternative and equally impressive talbe of contents from among the 165 other O.Henry Award stores of the decade\\" and after reading the stories collected here, Abrahams is right. these stories are not the best of the best and it would have been easy to compile a better group of stories. Most of the twenty-three stories here are bad or mediocre, only eight of them were really good, and it isn't surprising to find out which eight. Joyce Carol Oates, \\"The Dead\\"; John Cheever \\"The Jewels of the Cabots\\"; James Alan McPherson, \\"The Faithful\\"; Raymond Carver \\"Are You a Doctor?\\" (though there are better Carver stories, this one seems to be a little ambiguous); Tim O'Brien, \\"Night March\\"; John Updike, \\"Separating\\"; Woody Allen, \\"The Kugelmass Episode\\"; and John Sayles \\"I-80 Nebraska, M.490-M.205\\", which was my favorite of the book. No, this wasn't a best of from the 70s, and I know the O. Henry Awards are better than this sampling.	2002-03-08

It's nice to see the side of Kerouac, Cassady, and Ginsberg that didn't make it into the novels. I'm sure Carolyn's viewpoint is skewed a little, but so is what we read in On the Road. Between her work and their work we can get a picture of what they were like, not as legends, but as men. <br />There are times when Carolyn bogs down with too much detail, or too much whining, or patches that just aren't great writing, but all in all it is a good biography, autobiography, and novel.<br />If you want to know more, here is a good place to start, along with these books, though you probably have read them by now: Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums; Cassady's The First Third; Perry and Babb's On the Bus; Ginsberg's Howl	2002-03-02

With only a few exceptions (Junot Diaz and Marilyn Krysl), the stories in this collection are excellent. Amy Bloom's story, \\"The Story\\", which i think is a great title, is an interesting story about writing, about the characters in the story, and it is a story about itself.Michael Byers has a great story about obsession and attraction rather than love (though he does go on a page or two too long). Ron Carlson has a wonderful story about about happiness and the ways you can get there. It is one of the best of these stories. There is a story from Raymond Carver, and it is as good as anything he has written. Kiana Davenport's story deals with abuse and family. Everett's \\"The Fix\\"  is the best story in this anthology, which it's allusion to Christ, in a sort of Kafka-like way. Gautreaux's story about atonement is a winner as always. I remember reading Gurganus' story, \\"He's at the Office\\" when it was first published in the new yorker, and i remember thinking at the time that it had to be one of the better stories i'd read that year, so it was a pleasure to see doctorow select it. Aleksandar Hemon and Jhumpa Lahiri both have well told stories about being a foreigner in this country, though one has an uplifting feel and the other is more bleak, but both are a pleasure to read. Annie Proulx's \\"People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water\\" is a story you should read. but don't let the title fool you, it doesn't fit the story. Sherwood's story about loss is weak and a better selection could have been made, but it wasn't dull like the two mentioned earlier. i could go on about the stories i haven't mentioned, but there is a space constraint. i've only read best american short stories 2000 and 2001, so i can't say if these selected are better or worse than what is normally picked, but i can say that there are 18 stories here that are fine examples of what a short story should be.	2002-03-02

'arc of flesh, ascending' 'the serpent' and 'a tinkling cymbal' fall far short of quality storytelling. the shift to first person narrative in the final story is a bit abrupt, doesn't close the sequence the way it should. all in all, cook has a lot of potential as a texas writer. i'll keep watching what he produces to see where he goes from here.	2001-12-19

(sorry to say i really haven't read any of straub's work, so i can't really compare to the rest of his work) and let's be honest, anyone who enjoys king's dark tower series definitely wants to read this book--the similarities are obvious. it does bog down a little at the end, and they do use the talisman as a convenient plot piece to get jack and richard out of trouble, but the rest of the book overpowers the weak ending.	2001-09-30

There is an essay by allen starting the book. what should have been a highlight is a big dissapointment. allen spends little time talking about his father and more time trying to discuss the meter of the poems, and it becomes obvious that allen knows little about meter. there are a couple of good poems in the collection, but over all it isn't worth the effort of finding the book, unless you are a ginsberg scholar.	2001-08-31

The story moves at a much slower pace than most of wilson's books. And while it does pick up its pace after the first 100 pages, it never quite reaches what wilson usually writes. The plot is almost paint by the numbers. Wilson usually gives a few good twists and turns in his books, but not so much here. And one of my favorite aspects of his writing is the interesting characters he creates. But in this book none of the characters are that interesting, except for howard and blue, but wilson never really goes inside them. If you are a fan of charles wilson, then I'd say definitely pick up this book, but if you haven't read anything by him, you'd be much better off starting with embryo (which contains all the elements that I like about his writing.	2001-08-20

The plot is simple, two men on the run, chased by a ranger and a girl. there are times when the plot falters a little and cook's believability is uncertain. His characterization is a little shaky. you have della, who is just an uninteresting character, but that isn't unusual for a male to have trouble writing female characters. Ray Bob is too over the top, which does help you root for Eddie, because even though he is a bad man (trying to go right, a little cliche), we have Ray Bob's rabid behavior to make Eddie look good. at the last quarter of the novel, cook tries to show that Ray Bob isn't all bad and that maybe we could sympathize a little with him. but it is too little, too late. perhaps next time cook will humanize his villains earlier in the story. and finally there is the texas ranger, Rule, by far the most interesting character, but by no means a saint. Cook has a great ear for dialect and his locales are dead on (i live in beaumont and i know the places mentioned). _robbers_ shows that cook has huge potential as a regional writer. <br />the book lost stars because at times the story dragged. part of this is cook's lack of quotation marks. i'm not sure what his purpose was here, but it made the story confusing at times and slowed it down at other times. a writer shouldn't try to be experimental just for the sake of being experimental. the book was a bit predictable (i can just see tarantino reading the book saying, 'gee, i'd like to make a movie of it, but i've done it already'). and what has to be the biggest flaw is the ending. the tidy little ending that wrapped everything up so nice and neat. over 350 pages and the reader is cheated at the end. <br />still, the flaws and the good points of the novel balance each other out. i look forward to cook's next novel. i see his potential and i know his sophmore novel will only be better.	2001-08-17

Karl's adventures remind me of Huck Finn's, but without a Jim. Until the last chapter, where the story spirals away from what it had been into substandard work.

I was a bit surprised to see it, since so many of the great poets aren't represented (pound leaps to mind). I had to read it to see what kind of poet bradbury is. He's an excellent fiction writer, i think Fahrenheit 451 is one of the better books written. His poetry, on the other hand, is horrible. When he rhymes, he rhymes poorly. He tends to drag his poems on a bit (the only poet i can think of who has a greater fear of ending a poem is ginsberg, but the only howl you'll find in this collection is the one coming from the reader). His `ode to ty cobb' is a great example. The poem starts off ok, and has a lot of potential, but bradbury beats the idea to death. Too long (reminds me of one of the poems in the book `too much' `Too much beauty/Too much delight/ Too much of sun' /Too much did he write). You will find some interesting titles, such as `Shakespeare the Father, Freud the Son' (ah, the potential that title has) and `Good Shakespeare's Son, the Typing Ape.' and you'll actually find the line `Hark, we muttered.' i can only hope that mr bradbury decides to stay away from poetry and stick to fiction for the rest of his career. other bad poets: joey froelich (but his work i like in some sick way) and, oh, leonard nimoy, and jimmy stuart.	2001-08-09

I think he might have done better to put &quot;The Country I Remember&quot; after the shorter poems. &quot;The Country I Remember&quot; was such a great poem, that the shorter poems (except &quot;Song of the Powers&quot;) couldn't match up to. &quot;The Country I Remember&quot; is divided into twelve sections, each section told by an alternating point-of-view, between Lt. Mitchell, a Civil War veteran, and his daughter, both at the end of their lives. Mason's skill at the narrative poem is phenomenal. You forget that you are reading a 'long' poem because the story keeps the reader moving forward. Mason writes in both voices extremely well, and at no time are the two distinct and separate voices confused.

I had never heard of her (actually, i remember seeing her name on the poet's companion, but i had never read her poetry), and i ran across her at a reading in west chester, pa. and i was stunned by it. i picked up philosopher's club, and wasn't dissapointed. the poems inside are sensual poems that radiate sexuality. she works just as well in formal verse as she does in free verse. it is hard to believe that this is her first collection. there is nothing like hearing her read her work, the sensuality of the poems truly comes out when she is reading, but since you can't have her reading every day (unless she comes out with a spoken word cd- we can always hope), this collection should be purchased, and to truly experience the poems, read out loud to yourself.	2001-06-15

The poems, mostly formal, use language in a sensual way. you can feel her training as a musician the way the words float over you, melodious is the word that comes to mind. her poems tend to deal with love, but she manages to pull back before she reaches sentimentality. many of the poems deal with music as well. furthermore, the cover art is most fitting for the collection within. and i happen to know that she picked it herself. great collection. count me as a big fan, and i'm waiting for her next book.	2001-06-15

You see his intelligence, formal skill, and love of language in his poems. &quot;Nocturne&quot; is Hecht's succesful villanelle, which is one of my favorite formal types of poems, and when it is well done, and it is well done here, it can be one of the most successful forms of poetry. bravo mr. hecht. &quot;Sacrifice&quot; also sticks out in the book. it is a poem in three parts, juxtaposing the story of abraham and isaac with an incident in 1945, which is just chilling. hecht has several successful translations. I was dissapointed in the lack of war poems, which few do better than hecht, and the overabundance of religous poems. the dual picture on the cover lead me to believe that the subject of this collection would be both wwii and religion. i would hope next time knopf would do better in designing the cover.	2001-06-12

Gwynn's new and selected poems, to publication. And it was worth the wait. It's well-known that Gwynn is one of the best of the New Formalists, and now more people can see why. The collection begins with an introduction by Gwynn's friend, and another of the best of the New Formalists, Dana Gioia. Followed by If By Song, Gwynn's new poems, which contains several of my favorites (&quot;1-800&quot;, &quot;The Classroom at the Mall&quot;, &quot;West Palm&quot;, and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Deadly Sins&quot;), as well as other poems that showcase the poet's wit and skill with poetic form (such as &quot;Black Helicopters,&quot; which holds your interest both in what it says as well as the form it says it). A section covering translations (which I was unaware Gwynn did any translating) and parodies. Once again, Gwynn shows his skill at humorous verse with &quot;Versions for the Millennium&quot; &quot;The Professor's Lot&quot; and the charming &quot;Why They Love Us&quot; (his tribute to the dog). Selections from &quot;The Narcissiad&quot; follows next. This is Gwynn's mock-epic about a poet who battles other poets in the effort to be the only surviving poet. (It's a great poem, I only wish it were still in print, so that I could pick up a copy) And the final section of the book is selections from _The Drive-In_, which is loaded with great poems, such as &quot;Among Philistines&quot;, &quot;Anacreontic&quot; and &quot;The Simplification&quot; which are three of my favorites. It's such a strong selection, that I wish _The Drive-In_ weren't out of print so that I could pick that one up too (I'll be busy searching the used bookstores for copies of these two books). <br />Why should you purchase _No Word of Farewell_? I leave with what Dana Gioia said in his introduction: &quot;I should probably also note two other obvious qualities of Gwynn's poetry. First, he is ingeniously funny. Second, he is an effortless masterof verse forms. No American poet of his generation has written better sonnets, and very few can equal him in the ballade, couplet, rondeau, or pantoum-not to mention the half dozen new forms he has invented. But, to be honest, it was neither Gwynn's considerable formal skill nor his wicked humor that first attracted me, though those qualities surely added to my pleasure. Instead, it was his depth of feeling and intense lyricality.&quot;	2001-02-19

I'm not saying that carver's work is not worth reading. it is. he was an important figure in american literature, and he is not a bad writer, I just find other authors, such as cheever, hemingway, and hawthorne to be the true &quot;masters&quot; of american short fiction. In fact, stories such as &quot;so much water so close to home,&quot; &quot;where i'm calling from,&quot; &quot;what we talk about when we talk about love,&quot; &quot;a small good thing,&quot; and &quot;they're not your husband&quot; to be excellent stories, and they alone make this collection worth purchasing.	2000-11-07

I have several &quot;how to&quot; books on writing, so I know what to expect out of one. This book surprised me. King spends less than 100 pages on the mechanics of writing. The first part of the book is a memoir of (certain parts) his life. And he follows the on writing section with a commentary on the accident that almost killed him. But just because he doesn't spend much time discussing how to write doesn't make this book unworthy of reading. In fact, it is one of his better books. Unlike his previous work of non-fiction, _Danse Macabre_, king's voice comes through. It's almost like you're sitting at a diner drinking coffee while stephen king talks to you about his life (and who wouldn't take a few hours from our lives to talk to the king). It's entertaining and informative. Anyone who is a fan of his will love this first section (titled C.V. and i'm still trying to figure out what it stands for). One of my favorite aspects of a writer is his/her voice in the work, and king has fully developed his voice for this one. And the final section, on living, is haunting. The conversational tone king used throughout the book is gone when we get here. Instead it's a more disembodied voice, almost like he wasn't involved in the accident and is just reporting it. I never realized how serious the accident was until I read this. This section touched me more than any other work king has done. He wraps the book up with a list of books he has read the past couple of years (and it is not surprising to see the range of his tastes) and an example of the revision process, from one of his own short stories. <br />I say you definitely have to pick this book up. It is his best yet.	2000-11-07

Almost every type of sonnet is found in this collection. The sonnets are a form of devotional poetry, unlike what has been written before, such as Donne's sonnets, which is why Jarman wrote Questions for Ecclesiastes and Unholy Sonnets, as a response to Donne. Jarman's sonnets are a different type of devotional poetry. He doesn't just worship God, but asks questions about the nature of God and spirituality, thus the title unholy.       One of the things Jarman does in these sonnets is to question God with lines like &quot;Soften the blow, imagined God, and give/Me one good reason for this punishment&quot; from sonnet 3. And sonnet 6 where he questions his relationship with God. And Jarman's poetry continues on this way throughout the entire sequence, fifty sonnets dealing with prayer, judgement, religion, and even science versus religion.       Most of the sonnets in the sequence are pretty good, though a few, like sonnet 1, 3, and the prologue sonnet stand out as excellent poems, and there are a few that are truly horrible like 27 and 35 which are unclear and the rhymes are either sound forced or just aren't very good. But the well crafted sonnets outweigh the poorer sonnets.	2000-10-19

There no doubt that it is a  difficult book to read, Hawthorne requires the reader to think as he reads.  everything is symbolic of something in this book. Hawthorne has a mastery  of the language that you just don't see anymore. think this is one we  should re-read every few years, as we mature. I got the Norton edition,  which helps a little with understanding the story, but most of the articles  were not that helpful.	2000-01-23

Some very nice art in here, though i think most of the  poetry and some of the prose wasn't all that great. i do wish that  lucie-smith had put the art of those he talked about in the text together,  so that the reader can see an example of what he is discussing.	2000-01-23

You realize a few things about the poet. One is that I don't think the man knows how to write a short poem. The second is that he is extremely critical of the  human species, and America in particular. You can see his theology  background (his father) in the religious tones in many of his poems.  There's also a lot of hawks in his poems. It seemed like every third poem  or so there was a hawk. I also suspect that he wanted to be a sculpture.  There are a lot of sculptures and stones in his poems. The preachy tone  does get to be a bit much, and you get real sick of hawks by the time you  are finished, but there are some really good poems in the collection.  &quot;The Stone Cutters,&quot; &quot;Contemplation of the Sword,&quot;  &quot;The House Dog's Grave,&quot; and &quot;Roan Stallion&quot; being the  best he has to offer.	2000-01-22

I'm not sure why I picked it up, because when I stared reading it, I wasn't expecting much. One interesting  thing I noted, was that the book was first published in 1978 (the  re-release coincided with Dolly). And I don't know what the status of  cloning was at that time, but it seems remarkably ahead of its time. It  struck as a book like The Hot Zone, a book written (in a somewhat  fictitious way) of something that really happened, though I know that this  book didn't. Still, that is the way it read, and I found it enjoyable to  read that way. But don't be taken in by the synopsis on the back of the  book, which made the clone sound like he was the evil, when in fact, it was  Alfred (who the clone came from) who was more evil. Though I don't think  I'd necessarily call him evil, just cold and way too driven by science. I  don't know how the science stacks up, but if you are looking for a  relaxing, entertaining read, go ahead and pick this up.	2000-01-22

As a poet, he was one of the best, and it is out of sentiment and respect that made me want to like his final poems. But in reality, they  do not stand up to his former work. I almost find it hard to believe that  this is the same man who wrote Howl, Kaddish, and others. It was  interesting to see what Ginsberg's state of mind was at the end. It would  appear that it was mostly scatological thoughts and political ravings. Not  that I mind those types of poems, if they are well written. But still, it  is a collection that I would recommend for your personal library, if only  because it is Ginsberg's last. Though there were some good poems and  interesting thoughts in this collection. We will miss Ginsberg.	2000-01-15

Her poetry isn't as bad as I was expecting, but it wasn't that great. She seemed to be stuck on theme, love, or rather a loss of love. Which is fine for some poems, but when all but two or three  of your poems turn out to be sappy, broken-hearted whining, it's time to  find something else. She had a lot of good ideas and lines but the total  package was disappointing. The prologue was nice.

This book had an interesting spin on it because of the way the world ends. The northern  hemisphere has destroyed itself in nuclear war. The radiation slowly drifts  down to the southern hemisphere. This book takes place in southern  australia, one of the last places to get the radiation. It's not so much  about the end of the world, but how you deal with the knowledge that you  are going to die, and you know roughly when and how. Excellent book, even  if you aren't a fan of sci fi or end of the world/nuclear holocaust  stories, this one should be picked up because it is more a story of human  nature than science fiction.	2000-01-13

Perhaps if I hadn't known who her parents were I might have  read this differently. She's not a bad poet, just not that great of one.  The poems give off a feeling of repetition, and I just don't know if a  kookaburra is something I need to see in 20 or so poems. And by the end of  the collection, i'm a little tired of hearing about foxes. i would have  liked to have seen more poems about growing up the daughter of sylvia plath  and ted hughes and what her life was like and her issues with her parents  to have come out in the poems. She had some good lines and some really good  ideas, but she just couldn't seem to pull it together. There were a couple  of good poems in there though.	2000-01-13

I started reading it Friday and finished that night. it was a pretty good book. i think it is different from most of king's work. in fact i don't know if i'd call this book horror. the things  that are horrific about the book could be just in her mind, and that's what  i think they are. (well, the location, near TR90, makes me wonder about  that though). it was interesting the way i read it. i had gotten off of  work, and i was tired from the day before as well as work that day. i had  to take my two hour train ride to get home (after walking 45 mins to get to  the train station). when i got there, nobody was home, and i hadn't had a  key to the apt at that time, so i sat on the steps (very uncomfortable  steps) for 4 1/2 hours waiting for someone to get home to let me in. let me  tell you, when you are tired and hungry and sore and very uncomfortable and  you are reading a book about a lost girl who is tired and hungry and sore  and very uncomfortable...well, it adds something to the book.	1999-05-30

I appreciate what he tried to do here, a novel of short stories, and it was a good idea, but it just seemed to fall flat. I could never quite see the connection between  the stories. But it fell short. And I was surprised that this wasn't that  great, because Winter put together _Prime Evil_, which I truly enjoyed.   <br />Clive Barker's wraparound story wasn't very good. It had some  interesting parts to it, but really, not his best work.  Landsdale, who  wrote the first story (each story took place in a different decade...but I'm  not sure when barker's story took place) wasn't too bad. David Morrell's  story I'd say the same about. F. Paul Wilson's story about Nazi Germany was  excellent. Probably the best in the book. Poppy Z. Brite and Christa  Faust's story was a good one.  charles grant's story wasn't bad. Whitley  Streiber wrote an unintelligable, very bad story for the 50s decade. I  never really caught on to what was happening. Elizabeth massie wrote what  would be the second best story in the book, it too was excellent. Matheson,  who I know is a good writer wrote some garbage for the book...it sucked.  David J. Schow and Craig Spector wrote a story for this book that was okay,  it was almost good, but something is missing from it (hmm...I wonder if  that'd be Skipp).  And since at least half of this book was bad, I was  worried when I got to the last decade/story which was written by ramsey  campbell. Luckily he wrote a pretty good story.	1999-05-19

(anyone ever even heard of this book?) and i have to say it was just awful. i don't quite know why i continued to read  it. the plot was a standard plot. the story was not well written, the  dialogue was cheesy. the most interesting characters, the two main  vampires, were not explored at all, while the reader learns about the main  char and her family, and these people are boring and not at all believable.  the ending was predictable. and the main char's ex-husband comes back into  the picture, and i know that i was supposed to root for these two to get  back together and triumph over the vampires, but all i wanted was for the  vampires to kill them...i mean put me out of my misery. and jeff (the ex)  was such a whiney baby...i don't know what the main char. saw in him. talk  about whipped...anyway, if you haven't read it...don't. trust me.	1999-05-17

The science of the book wasn't that great, and a bit outdated.  The science of the book became laughable when they finally met up with the hominids.  Surprising since some of Darnton's  reference sources are from good people.  But it is fiction, so there are  some concessions that can be made if there is a good story.  The problem is  that the story wasn't all that great.  I admit, I didn't want to just throw  it away, but it wasn't great.  It was mediocre.  I'm surprised that it made  The Book-of-the-Month Club main selection.  at best, this is a mediocre  story about unintersting characters.  Matt and Susan's reintroduction into  their romance was just not believeable...maybe it was because there really  weren't any other sapiens to chose from. Kellicut's character was...awful,  a horrible portrayal.  Sergei really wasn't a character.  The hominids were  either too pacifistic or to evil.  They are closely related to humans (or  even the same species) so they would be a little more complex than Darnton  made them.  The most interesting characters were those in the institute  (except the marines which really could have been left out.  did they even  have a part?), but even they weren't that great.  All in all, I'd have to  say two thumbs down Mr. Darnton.  Stick to journalism and don't torture us  with this kind of drudge anymore.	1999-03-28

I loved the first Rogue Warrior.  Both of Marcinko's business books were excellent, though one was enough).  Red Cell was pretty good, but after that they began declining in quality.  I mean, there is the obvious formula  to his books (which a commentor below mentions, it's amazing how he can  never parachute out of a plane without something going wrong with his  chute.  I mean, I understand that things go wrong, but every time?  And the  things the character Marcinko does, I mean, there is no way that he would  get away with it that many times.  I respect Marcinko for who he is and  what he has done, but I think he and Weisman need to get together and  change things up for the next installment, or maybe write something  different (i know i'd like to see more nonficiton like Rogue Warrior).	1998-11-26

This book was an enjoyable book and entertaining, but it didn't really discuss too much of how the Irish saved civilization.

I'm a fan of Anderson, and (as I've stated in my review  of the first three books) I know Anderson can write exceptionally well.   Which he wasn't doing for this series until now.  Definately the best of  the series (so far).  Hopefuly this means Anderson has decided to write  this series the way he can not the way he has been.  Highlights:  we learn  more about Tenel Ka, and her relationship with Jacen seems to be  progressing.  Plus a big surprise that happens to her.  Downside:  the last  couple of chapters were lacking.	1998-09-20

Zekk is a pale attempt at  a Han Solo if he had turned the wrong way, whereas Jacen is a pale attempt  at Han Solo turned...well, the way he did.  I've noticed that if the empire  was characteristic to the way it normally is (in the adult books), we'd  have seen the death of Lando and Ackbar, and probably quite a few others.   Basically, Anderson tries to write for a younger audience, but he cannot  quite seem to pull it off...he lowers the quality, not the subject matter.	1998-09-16

I know Anderson is a better writer than this book, and that is taking it  into consideration that this is a book for young adults, but this book was  not up to his usual standards (read the first in the series, and you'll see  he can write a young adult fiction well).  First of all, I cannot believe  that with the twins being kidnapped, Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and Lando (and  remember, he is somewhat responsible) sat back and did nothing.  That  doesn't even fit with their character at all.  I think the idea of the  Shadow Academy is something Anderson should have used for his next  trilogy...there was so much more that could have been done with this idea  that just wasn't.  I am greatly disappointed that ANderson let such a good  story idea fall so flat.	1998-09-15

After reading this, Chewbacca seems more human, not so much a  big...wookie...and just Han's sidekick.  It was nice to see someone explore  the character of Chewbacca.  But there were two parts of the story I had  problems with.  One was Luke's part of the story, I mean, how much power  does this guy need?! The other major problem i had with the trilogy is all  the time spent with characters we don't know, don't want to know, and  aren't that important.  I think the author could have spent more time  developing the plot lines of the characters we know (such as Han's capture  or how Leia dealt with it, which really wasn't touched on a whole lot).   But they (other than Lando) didn't seem to have a huge role in the trilogy.   All in all, if you keep up with the star wars universe, this trilogy is  worth the time.	1998-08-26

I've seen many reviewers complain about the technological accuracy or whatever in this book.  Remember:  it is fiction, written by an english teacher.  Keep that in mind and you could enjoy the book.  It has an interesting plot and lots of action.  The sequences in Spain are humorous.  Sure the characters are a little underdeveloped and certain aspects of the plot are ludicrous, but it is an enjoyeable read.  Mind candy.  I just can't believe that nobody has heard of the NSA.  I've known about them since I was a little kid.  My biggest problem with the book is the code at the end, which I can't seem to figure out (I guess cryptology isn't my area).	1998-05-03

It was pretty well written, but there were a few problems.  Vicky Wade's character seems pointless.  I don't really see her role in the story, and there was so much potential for growth.  Some of the plagues are a bit of a stretch.  Hubbard's character was lacking something.  I didn't like the way the author sold out in the end and set things up for a sequal (the book was good, but not enough for a sequel).  Berger's character wasn't developed.  And finally, you get really tired of ProMED real quick.  But still, it had an interesting idea behind the story, and it had plenty of good points.  check it out.	1998-04-30

Unfortunately there is no credibility.

But once again, Salvatore produces an excellent story.  There was one problem with the trilogy, and that was the fact that it was a trilogy.  The third part of this story (the dragon king) could have been written as a trilogy by itself.  It seems Salvatore spent too much time with TSR (or whomever) writting the forgotten realms books, and it would appear that now he thinks everything must be a trilogy.  I wish someone would tell him that there is nothing wrong with writing a series of 4, 5, or 6 books (or even a story that can be told in one book).  I really think he could have lengthened this epic story and increased the pleasure of his fans.  After all, parts of this book flew by with little or no detail.  But all in all, it was an excellent story.	1998-04-19

I thought it wasn't going to be that great, anthologies tend not to be, especially after some of the excellent work I've seen done in the Star Wars novels.  Admittedly, some stories were better than others.                                         WE DON'T DO WEDDINGS by Kathy Tyers:  the first story in this anthology was dull, boring, etc. etc.                                                GREEDO'S TALE by Tom Veitch and Martha Veitch:  I'll be the first to admit it was interstesting to learn the background of Greedo, probably one of the most memorable bit characters in the series, he only had a walk-on part and he was dead.  I like the fact that the authors made Greedo out to be a bumbler and not some hot-shot bounty hunter.  It shows that some people (aliens) are just too full of themselves, though what it seemed mostly was that Greedo just wanted some acceptance.                                    HAMMERTONG by Zahn:  well, i didn't like it.         PLAY IT AGAIN by Crispin:  nothing spectacular, but a good story                                     THE HAMMERHAND'S TALE by dave wolverton:  it was nice to learn about the alien who you only get a glimpse of in the  movie (and that's it), but still he is one you don't forget (i think there was even an action figure of him).                   BARTENDER'S TALE by Bischoff:  Excellent story.  And he was a somewhat central character throughout most of the stories.                      NIGHTLILY by Hambly:  It was an okay story, but I really liked how it ended.                          EMPIRE BLUES by Moran: such passiont this Devoronian shows towards music, that I can understand, but still, I think they could have found a more interesting story, but then again...                                                       JAWA'S TALE by Anderson:  I'm surprised, Anderson doesn't usually disapoint me, but he did this time.  I know I don't find the Jawas interesting to begin with, and thestory just didn't grip me.                                                      TRADE WINS by Moesta:  the only point to this story was to flesh out Anderson's.                   THE STORMTROOPER'S TALE by Doug Beason:  This was probably the best story in the collection, in fact I'd like to see more of this character and what he did to help the rebellion.                   SOUP'S ON by Roberson:  by far the worst tale in the collection                                      AT THE CROSSROADS by Jerry Oltion:  I liked this one.  I got a kick out of it.                                                      DOCTOR DEATH by Kenneth Flint:  Another excellent tale.  Once again I got a kick out of the ending                                                      MOISTURE FARMER'S TALE by M. Shayne Bell:  Another excellent story, though I really haven't figure out his connection to the cantina             ONE LAST NIGHT by Garfield and Judith Reeves-Stevens:  Like Anderson, these two rarely disapoint me, but they did here.  I don't know, it felt like a cheesey cop out (like the star trek time travel stories).  One of the worst stories in the collection.                           All in all it was a good anthology and I recommend it.  But you do get tired of reading about Ben's fight in the cantina and Han blasting Greedo.  If you don't mind this repetition (and it is usually only a sentence or two) it's okay.  I did like the wayt the stories all fed off of each other, many thanks to Anderson for that.	1998-04-17

What I especially like about this book is Salvatore's description of the battle scenes (although they were a bit lacking compared to the rest of his work).  I just have no idea how he can be that descriptive in his battle scenes.  Makes you wonder if he was a medival hero in a former life.	1998-04-09

I think that this is one of the best books I've ever read (and I don't give out 10s that easily).  But from reading the reviews below, I think people are missing something.  Holden is a very troubled boy.  I think it is rather obvious that he has some psychological disorders (depression for one, maybe a few others).  And as someone who has experienced a few of those breakdowns, I can tell you that a lot of what Holden feels is a lot of what I felt.  Sure there is teen angst involved in this story, and I'm sure it is an excellent social commentary, but what strikes me most about Salinger's story is how accurately it portrays the thoughts of a person with depression.  If you really want to understand how a person with depression or anti-socail tendencies feels, read this book.	1998-04-06

Outside of the entertainment value (excellent character development, good plot) it was an excellent source for philosophy, politics, and sociology.  This novel made you think.  In some ways Heinlein's future world is better off than our own (though there are some rather obvious flaws).  This book is so thought provoking.  It'd make an excellent subject for discussion in any philosophy, political science, sociology, or anthropology course.  This book not only set out to entertain, but to make the reader think.

The other gem in this book is Bradbury's short story, &quot;The Sound of Thunder&quot; which is the story that started this series.  And believe me, after reading Bradbury at the end, you realize just how 'average' Stephen Leigh is.  But it has made me curious enough to read the next book in the series.  I'll let you know how that one turns out.	1998-03-13

This book has an excellent idea behind it (what do you expect, it comes from a Ray Bradbury short story) and the world created is very interesting.  But, it seems kind of juvenile.  The language and culture of the Mutata seemed to have taken little thought.  Peter and Eckles aren't developed at all, for that matter neither is Travis.  The very idea of Mundo's world (and Mundo himself) is ludicrous.  But I saw hope for the series (just 6 books).  Towards the end of the story the writing picked up.  I saw a lot of room for improvement, but it got better.  So, I'll try the next book in the series and see how it goes.  Perhaps all six are worth reading, maybe I won't finish the next.  It all depends on where Stephen Leigh takes the story.	1998-03-12

The main characters are well developed  (like Ray, Ramsey, and Leigh Ann). The plot has more twists and turns and surprises than I think I have ever seen in so short a novel.  (One might say he has too many twists, but I would disagree, I hate a predictable book).  The only fault I find with this novel is the underdevelopment of the minor characters such as Red, the Lutter boy, the Julie's parents.  I hope Wilson keeps turning out books with the quality of this and Nightwatcher.	1998-03-10

I am also a fan of the comic books that have been written as novels (I've read the death of superman, a couple of spiderman books, and golden's first book in his x-man trilogy) and I've found most of them to be excellent.  Especially the X-titles.  But this book just didn't have it.  The characters were never developed (they spent most of the time moping around), the plot was weak.  The drawings were good though.  There just didn't seem to be a purpose to this story.  I know the authors can do better work, and I hope to see them do better in the future.  This book makes me want to only read a comic-book-turned-novel if it has Chistopher Golden's name afterwards. But, if they write another X-book, I'll give them another try.  I see room for potential.	1998-03-08

More of a suspense or cop story.  I like the interesting moral dilemma this book poses..would you pay a half million dollars in ransom for a child that is not your own?  And what if paying this ransom ruins you?  What would you do?  I think McBain could have spent more time on this aspect of the novel.  Also, this book contains some of the best dialogues I've seen.  I could picture a couple of good actors acting this out on the big screen.  The biggest problem i found with the book was McBain wrote it 'soft.'  I would've expected more swearing and adult content from kidnappers, but all in all this book is a must.	1998-03-08

I cannot quite place my finger on what was missing, maybe it was the 'explanation' that didn't sit well, but Anderson did redeem himself with a fast pace, excellent ending.	1998-03-05

The email format of the novel was an excellent idea.  You get to watch Edgar grow as the story (email messages) go on.  Teller raises some interesting questions about the ethics of AI if they ever reach their goal of a &quot;human&quot; computer.  I also liked the way Teller made both Edgar and Alice have their breakdowns together.  The only problem a reader might have the boo is that it is just email messages.  If your mind isn't open to the philosophies of AI you may not find this book interesting	1998-03-04

The only problem i have with this novel, and the only reason I gave it an 8 was the fact that zahn puts no suspense in the mind fo the reader with the re-emergence of thrawn.  he should've held off on that information til the end of the second book.	1998-02-25

That's because even though this book is very good, it is lacking in a few areas.  I must agree with the reader below that there are more interesting things that could have been done with Callista than just have her fade away.  I felt cheated (unless they have something spectacular for her in a future novel and I don't believe Luke and Callista should get together, just something that could help the character of Skywalker grow).  It was a nice touch to see Leia struggle with her heritage.  The droids adventure was good.  The two areas where this booked lacked was in Han, Lando, and Chewie part of the story.  I felt it was weak, and the only reason it was there was to include these characters in the novel.  The other weak area was the ending, the 'mysterious life-form.'  It was weak.  As was the character of Dzym.  And the Hutt could have been further developed, it was interesting to see a Hutt with Jedi skills.  And what about Taselda?  Did she have a point to the story, because her character certainly wasn't developed.  I think Hambly should have spent a little more time and a few more pages to develope this story the way it should have been.  But overall, I'd say this is a good novel, and an excellent addition to the saga.	1998-02-19

I beleive that the Dark Tower Series will be hailed as a classic a few years down the road.  It contains two of my favorite genres, horror and apocalyptic fiction, it's an epic fantasy, a western, and now King has written his first &quot;romance novel.&quot;  I think that before this ends, King will have included every genre possible in this series.  What I like is how he draws his other books into this series as well.  I've read some complaints down further about the flashback.  I felt it was a beautiful story and helped to explain why Roland is the way he is.  People also complain because they don't know what happened to Sheemie, Alain, or Cuthbert, well, it looked to me that Roland was going to explain it later in the series.  As I'm sure Rhea will.  Another complaint I've read is the Wizard of Oz ending.  Why wouldn't one of the greatest sagas include a little bit of our classic quest?  This series is one of my favorite King novels (along with the Stand and Salem's Lot).  You don't even have to be a King fan to enjoy this series.  Now, go buy the book.	1998-02-07

I mean you don't become one of the most bestselling children's authors if you have no talent.  And there is no doubt Stine can write, especially young adult fiction.  But stepping into the world of adult fiction is a little different.  Stine added lots of profanity, gore, and sex.  That seems to be all that separates this from his earlier work.  That and a few hundred extra pages.  I got the impression that Stine deliberately extended this story to almost 400 pages because he felt that would make it more adult like.  Unfortunately the story wasn't a 400 page story.  Stine would have done better to cut out the uneeded parts and tell the story the way it needed to be told.  I think he would have done better to write this the way he normally does, for young adults.  But it was pretty decent (not comparable to King, Koontz, or Barker, but who is) and it was his first shot at an adult novel.  I would recommend this, and I would pick up the next adult novel he writes because with experience, i think he'll learn the craft of writing for adults.	1998-01-19

Koontz is normally one of my favorite authors, but this book...just wasn't up to par, even after the rewrite.  In fact I feel the only reason he rewrote it was to through in some current names (such as Winona Ryder and Deep Blue) and to mention the internet.  The plot was weak, but not as weak as the characters.  The computer (who told the story) just babbled.  I could cut half the words out of the novel and still not lose the story.  The other two characters in the story were not developed.  I could tell that this was one of Koontz's early works, I'm just surprised it got published (twice).  The only plus this story had were the themes of male attitude towards women.  Now this would make a good book to analyze for an english class, but not a whole lot of enjoyment.	1998-01-10

He starts off well, but as the plot moves on...he begins to lose it.  The plot gets worse and worse as the story moves on.  He starts off with an excellent idea, but he just cannot seem to clinch it.  What starts off as a Crichton type novel finishes with a weak alien sub-plot.  Like I said, great idea, but Wilson just cannot seem to pull it off.  Better luck next time (or at least I hope so, because I purchased Extinct and Fertile Ground at the same time).  If you want to read this novel, check it out, it isn't quite worth the money, purchase a Crichton novel instead, and head to your public library for this one.	1998-01-08

It was an interesting story idea.  Unfortunately I couldn't help but compare it to the Green Mile, and we all know that you just cannot compare Saul with King.  He doesn't even come close.  In fact, reading this series made me think of what King said in Danse Macabre (if you don't know buy the book and use the index).  All in all this is a pretty decent book(s), but it just seemed to me a cheap marketing strategy to sell more books.  I didn't see why he felt he had to write this story in the way he did.  Just copying the master I guess.	1998-01-06
