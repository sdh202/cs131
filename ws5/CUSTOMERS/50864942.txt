Diane Carey is capable of being one of the best writers of Star Trek stories in paramount's stable; she is also capable of being one of the worst. It all depends on whether she (or her editors) manage to curb her tendancy to try too hard for novel, exotic, clever, \\"creative\\" use of the language. When they succeed, it is possible to see that she is a fine writer, with a good sense of pacing, characterization, and (where applicable, when she isn't simply adapting an already existing plot to book form) plot. When they fail, it is virtually impossible to see anything past the flurry of distractingly WEIRD uses of perfectly good words in places that they simply aren't appropriate.<br /><br />In this book, they partially succeed; it isn't nearly as bad as her worst work (\\"Descent\\", \\"The Search\\") but her tendancy is still present enough to be distracting. The plot, of course, isn't hers; it is the work of Stephen Behr and Hans Beimier, who wrote the episode for TV, and it was a fine episode and makes for a fine plot for the book. Unlike in the above-mentioned books, Diane Carey doesn't completely ruin a fine plot with her writing, but she does detract from it.	2005-09-23

I never have cared for the character of Shelby, and I still don't (although there was a scene in which she was absolutely marvellous, an indication that David's actually allowing the character to grow) and the ending was more of a downer than I expect out of Peter David. But in general, the \\"main\\" plot was interesting enough, though by itself might not have quite made it to four stars. But the flashback scenes to Calhoun's days at Starfleet Academy were marvellous, even if I still don't understand what he's EVER seen in Shelby, or what she sees in him, given how little she respects everything that he's about. That relationship has always struck me as just too artificial, something OBVIOUSLY forced by the author for cheap plot conflict, rather than something that grew out of the characters naturally.<br /><br />I think this may actually be the first book in this series that can actually stand on its own; granted, we had a bit of a teaser for the beginning at the end of the last book, but that's rehashed at the beginning of this one, and it actually has a full story (TWO full stories, from one way of looking at it) complete with ending.

This book can be thought of as a sequel to two separate canonical Star Trek stories; it is a follow-up to the episode \\"For The World Is Hollow, And I Have Touched the Sky\\" (never one of my favorite episodes, and not only because the title is far too wordy) and chronologically, follows immediately after \\"Star Trek, The Motion Picture\\" (also not one of my favorite stories; it always seemed far too derivative of the episode \\"The Changeling\\".)<br /><br />In spite of being most closely connected to two of my least-favorite canonical stories, however, and being pretty faithful to both of them, this book is an excellent story, taking a much more nuanced look at the ramifications hinted at in both of those stories. The characters are handled well, the plot moves smoothly, the writing is excellent if unspectacular, and the basic idea is intriguing.

If, like me, you read P.J. and enjoy his wit even though you frequently find yourself disagreeing with him politically, there is a great deal of material in this book that you will find very funny. However, if like me, you occasionally find that he goes too far and simply becomes insulting without bothering to be witty, you will find a great deal in this book annoying and unfunny. In this, it is not unlike \\"Republican Party Reptile\\", although it's not quite as funny and a bit more irritating. In quality, it's about on a par with \\"Bachelor Home Companion\\", although that book was less political and thus less annoying when it failed to be funny. As such, it's nowhere near as good as his best work: \\"Parliament of Whores\\", \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Holidays In Hell\\", and \\"Give War A Chance\\", in (more or less) order from best down, but it's miles ahead of his worst books, \\"The Enemies List\\", \\"Modern Manners\\", and \\"Age And Guile...\\", in order from worst up.<br /><br />If you actually enjoy P.J. unconditionally and agree with his politics more than I do, you may well find this book more enjoyable than I did.

The three star rating is rating this book as compared to other Shakespearean plays; if rated against the general run of material out there, it would doubtless rate at least four stars. This is reputed to be one of his earliest works, and it shows. It's still quite good, of course; it's Shakespeare. But compared to his other plays, the language isn't quite as lovely as a fan of Shakespeare tends to expect. Also, the plot is rather trivial and silly (which isn't necessarily unreasonable, given that it's a comedy, but in his later works, even his comedies have more meat to them than this). One thing that this play DOES have going for it is that in the end, love does not automatically conquer all, as it usually does in Shakespearean comedies. It is forced to prove itself, rather than being taken at face value, a novel and much preferred concept to what became his usual take on the matter.	2005-07-09

It's still a fairly good read, lively, suspenseful, generally worthwhile. But there are two major flaws that bring its rating down considerably. One is that the main romantic interest is NOT the \\"damsel in distress\\"; that position is occupied by a thoroughly unsympathetic character, one who McGee is manipulated by in ways that we rarely see. The other is that, while it isn't uncommon for some aspect of this series to seem rather outdated these days, generally, the main character's attitudes seem remarkably reasonable if a bit old-fashioned; in one scene in this book, he is demonstrated to be completely clueless and utterly unsympathetic towards lesbians. While I wouldn't have been surprised or offended had he proved somewhat clueless and condescending, his attitude in that scene (and clearly, that of the author) were neolithic and downright hostile enough to really grate on my nerves. Really ruined what otherwise would have been a pretty fair to middling book.	2005-07-02

As with all of Shakespeare, the concept of love at first sight is given far too much credit, but other than that, this is a delightful romp filled with much amusement. The language is as beautiful as one expects in Shakespeare, but is somewhat less difficult for the modern reader to follow than in some of his plays; I found myself being more distracted than helped by most of the footnotes. As with most Shakespearean comedies, it was easy to see that this play was intended for the amusement of the common people; the similarities in style between the plot here and in much modern pop culture were striking (the sexual innuendo to be had when a woman passes for a man and finds another woman falling in love with her, for instance). If it had a flaw, it was that the ending was just a little TOO pat and contrived, even for a comedy, but that's just a minor quibble.	2005-07-02

Like the first book in this series, this is a marvellously well-written fragment of a story; as suggested in the \\"Book 2\\" in the title, it is not a complete story unto itself. It starts in the middle of the action, book one having left us hanging on a cliff; this one picks up from there and rides the story through to an (apparent) ending. We also get a preview of \\"Book 3\\", just to let us know that the story ISN'T actually over yet, but at least the current immediate plot is tied up nicely.<br /><br />Between the two of them, books one and two make for a five-star Star Trek novel, with excellent characterizations, good action, and a fine plot with many interesting convolutions.

The writing in this book is fair-to-middling, at least as good as we've seen before from Shatner. The characterizations are pretty good, especially the handling of Kirk (what a surprise). But the plot is basically an entire book of lead-in for the next book; very little is accomplished here, and considering that the overall plot was introduced LAST book, we ought to have made more progress by now. I'll admit, it wasn't quite a case of the book having no beginning or ending; the beginning was sufficiently separate from the teasers in the previous book to stand on its own, and we did tie up a FEW loose ends at the end of this book. But the main conflict, far from being resolved, is MORE tangled at the end of this book than it was at the beginning. If you LIKE books with continuing plots and cliffhanger endings, you'll doubtless love this one. If, like me, you prefer a book, even one that is part of a larger story, to conclude a major plotline within the larger background plot, this book is only marginally satisfying.	2005-05-26

Shatner's previous novels, while interesting and fun, had a bit too much of the tendancy to make \\"his character\\", James T. Kirk, into a superhero/demigod. This tendancy is hardly unique to Shatner, but it's even more unbecoming when coming from a mature man who clearly identifies with the character (for the rather obvious reason that he played it on TV and the movies) than it is when coming from an immature hero-worshiping fan. This book largely avoided that problem, and if some fans of \\"The Next Generation\\" will feel that Picard came off looking rather pale by comparison to Kirk, that was more because Picard was given somewhat short shrift than because Kirk was made to look too good. And it isn't entirely unfair to make Picard come across as stodgy and dull by comparison to Kirk; he IS.<br /><br />There are really two stories here; one is set on post-Dominion war Bajor, where Kirk and Picard are \\"vacationing\\". The other is a flashback, told mostly by Kirk to Picard (although not in his own voice; we get it in standard third-person narrative while Picard is hearing it directly from Kirk), a story of his first real adventure on the Enterprise, many years ago. The transitions between stories weren't always entirely seamless, and some of the excuses used for returning to the flashback story when Kirk WASN'T telling the story to Picard were somewhat weak, but the story itself was extremely good, showing some of the tensions between Kirk and his crew (particularly Spock) before they became acquainted well enough to trust each other's style and judgement. We also see a cameo of Uhura's first taste of bridge action, which was handled very well.<br /><br />The other story, the \\"current\\" one, wasn't quite as good, in fact started quite slowly, but actually picked up quite well by the end. By itself, I probably wouldn't have given it more than three stars, but it would have been a high three stars, almost good enough for four.

This book, a sequel to \\"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone\\", is the second book in a proposed seven-book series following the adventures of one Harry Potter as he advances through Hogwart's School of Wizardry. In the first book, he was eleven years old, a first-year student; in this one, he is twelve and a second-year. This is to be the pattern for the series; each book is to be one year in his school career.<br /><br />Like the first book, this one is a wonderful tale which has deservedly captured the imaginations of most of the fantasy-reading populace (and a fair number of people who DON'T generally read fantasy.) It has all of the elements of a traditional story, with an evil villain and main characters who are good people struggling against that evil and doing heroic things in the process, but it is far from a stereotypical story. The characters have very definite life, and Rowling is a fine writer with a deft touch at a clever turn of phrase, who never lets her desire to show off that talent become distracting, as some lesser authors do. What's more, the books are competently edited and proofread, something of a rarity these days in mass-market paperbacks; I didn't notice a single typo or poor word choice or grammatical error throughout the entire book.<br /><br />This series compares favorably to C.S. Lewis's \\"Narnia\\" series, with which it shares some elements, and if I can't QUITE bring myself to rate it higher than Tolkein's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" saga, that's only because it would seem sacrilege to suggest such a thing (besides, it isn't finished yet; maybe by the time it's done, who knows...)<br /><br />If you have ANY interest in fantasy at all, DO NOT miss this series.	2005-04-22

This book is superbly written, like most of Ms. Graf's Star Trek books, and like many of her books, it focusses not entirely on Kirk and Spock, as so many Trek books do, but on Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov. In this case, the spotlight is particularly on Uhura, as the Enterprise is dealing with a strongly matriarchal culture (the Elasians, as seen in the episode \\"Elaan of Troius\\") and so Kirk puts Uhura in charge of the landing party dealing with them, letting them think that they're dealing with a female leader. It makes sense, and the story flows from that point.

And I'll admit that it's difficult to swallow the concept that that much evidence has been handled that poorly by accident; it's tempting to assume that if the evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone is consistently so flawed, he must not have, and the botched evidence trail must be the work of a massive conspiracy and coverup.<br /><br />But that conclusion doesn't NECCESARILY follow; none of the botched evidence actually PROVES anything other than that there were incompetents thick on the ground in 1963, and that is certainly true (as is the fact that there are still incompetents thick on the ground in 2005; it's a fact of life: people are stupid) regardless of how Kennedy was killed, or by who. Whether one chooses to believe that it's more likely that there was massive stupidity in all aspects of the case, or that there has been a massively successful conspiracy, is largely a matter of personal taste; as Ronald S. White points out in this book's Postscript, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively answer that question either way.<br /><br />But consider: if you were the head of a conspiracy to asassinate the president back in 1963, would you choose to do so in a crowded, massively public setting with hundreds of witnesses? Unlikely; there'd be many more attractive opportunities, especially if you had government connections. But if you were a single nutcase with a gun, and this was likely to be your only opportunity to get within shooting range of the president, obviously, that question doesn't apply. Of course, it's POSSIBLE that the plan was to use Oswald as an assassin, and/or frame him for the killing, and so one had to accept the setting in which he could plausibly have had opportunity. But then, the conspiracy theories almost all posit additional gunmen scattered around the area, presumably there to finish the kill if Oswald missed. But if you're going to have to use other gunmen anyway, why bother with an agent as undependable as Oswald at all? Clearly, if this was a conspiracy to kill the president, it was a stupid and incompetent one; itself not an unreasonable hypothesis (as I said, people are stupid, and that certainly potentially includes conspirators) but if the conspiracy is stupid and unsubtle enough to have chosen to kill the president in public with an agent as incompetent as Oswald, thus requiring backup firepower and the requisite amount of coverup to hide that backup firepower from discovery, AND far-reaching and powerful enough to have done so, with sufficient pull in the media and law-enforcement to squash any discovery and/or revelation of these facts, WHY are the people writing for this book still alive? Wouldn't it have been trivially easy to kill them and/or suppress their work without ever letting it see print? Yet that hasn't happened, and while it's possible to posit a sufficiently subtle conspiracy that would realize that allowing some inconclusive claims on the subject would tend to cause people to make the very argument I'm making, thus discrediting the whistle-blowers without the need for killing them, it is impossible (at least in my mind) to imagine that a conspiracy clever enough to do that would have been stupid enough to kill the president in public in the first place.<br /><br />Further, we're supposed to believe that a conspiracy smart enough and widespread enough to get its hands on the Zapruder film almost immediately and to be able to edit it before re-releasing it, could and would edit it so badly that amateur photography buffs would be able to spot the fabrication; if they were good enough to lay hands on the film, and capable of editing it, doesn't it seem likely that they'd have been aware of the limitations of their editing, and if so, wouldn't they have simply destroyed the film and \\"lost\\" it, without ever letting it be seen again? Probably, although it's possible that this is again simply a case of \\"people are stupid\\", but it simply seems to me that I'm being expected to accept the hypothesis of a conspiracy that is at once supremely clever and subtle (so that only the authors are clever enough to uncover hints of it) while at the same time stupid enough to leave evidence behind that (as in the case of the autopsy x-rays, as described by David W. Mantik, Ph.D., who established that his young daughter could do so) a five-year old could spot it.<br /><br />I admit it; it's possible. But I find it easier to believe that the trail of evidence was corrupted by incompetent handling at all points than to believe in a massive, incredibly clever, incredibly stupid, un-subtle and bungling conspiracy which has nonetheless managed to keep at least an official lid on the truth for 40+ years.hey'd have been aware of the limitations of their editing, and if so, wouldn't they have simply destroyed the film and \\"lost\\" it, without ever letting it be seen again?

What we have here is a traditional courtroom drama, set in the Star Trek universe. There is only a brief cameo appearance by the crew of the Enterprise; mostly, the book centers around Sam Cogley, the lawyer who defended Captain Kirk in the TV episode \\"Courtmartial\\". The book is well-written and interesting, but if you read \\"Star Trek\\" books for the characters of the Enterprise crew, this book is not for you. Similarly, if you enjoy courtroom dramas, but don't care for science fiction, this book is probably not for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy both science fiction AND courtroom drama, this is a definite must-read.	2005-03-26

It also has a great many mediocre points; it doesn't really have any BAD points.<br /><br />This, like Taylor's previous \\"Voyager\\" novel, \\"Mosaic\\", is a frame story, in which we have flashbacks to the background lives of the \\"Voyager\\" characters framed by a \\"current\\" \\"Voyager\\" story. In that book, the flashbacks gave us some insight into the life of Captain Janeway; in this one, we get somewhat shorter bios of Harry Kim, Chakotay, Tom Paris, Neelix, Kes, and Tuvok.<br /><br />The backstories are what make this book worth reading (as was the case in \\"Mosaic\\"); the actual \\"Voyager\\" story is rather weak, as is the excuse for giving us the backstories; ostensibly, the characters are taking turns telling each other their life stories. (Kes is the exception; only Neelix \\"hears\\" hers, and that's either in a dream or a telepathic contact, since this story takes place after she has left the ship.) This concept would have been much more plausible, and have been much more impressive writing (albeit certainly more difficult to write) had the chapters involving the characters' histories been told in their own voices, instead of staying with omniscient (and impersonal) narrator. Granted, had the story been written that way, it would have been hard to convey SOME of the information that was conveyed, but it would also have done a MUCH better job of giving insight into the personality of the characters.<br /><br />All in all, it was interesting to hear the backstories, but the framework in which those backstories were told was rather weak.	2005-03-18

The \\"Star Trek SCE\\" series is written about the \\"Starfleet Corps of Engineers\\", which are the topnotch engineers sent in to solve puzzles that have stumped the engineers on an individual ship. It's an interesting idea, very much more traditional science fiction rather than the space opera that is commonly seen in most \\"science fiction\\" these days; more attention is paid to the science, without sacrificing plot or character developement.<br /><br />On the down side, I wasn't quite as taken with the stories in this book as I was with those in the first two entries in the series; on the up side, while book one ended on a cliffhanger and book two therefore started in midstory, this book did not resort to such cheap methods of keeping us interested; it began and ended as a self-contained set of stories.	2005-03-15

Peter David writes extraordinarily well, and the characters in this series are quite enjoyable. But his tendancy to have all books in the series end on cliffhangers has been annoying from the very beginning of this series; this book, while it actually has an ending for a change, outdoes even his usual style in that the cliffhanger ending from the previous book isn't even ADDRESSED until 284 pages into this one, and then the tale is told retrospectively. If you don't dislike the classic movie serial storylines that have neither beginning nor ending to call their own, you'll doubtless enjoy this book. If, like me, you believe that a novel may have carryover subplots, but that the main plot should begin and end in the same book, you will find that aspect of this book to be a major distraction from a very good storyline.	2005-02-27

As always in this series, the character of Anita Blake is a delight to listen to; the series is told through her very colorful first-person voice. As usual, there is a fairly high amount of violence in this book, and those who object to such things should avoid it. This book also has a bit more blatant seuxal content than the previous books in the series, so those who don't mind a bit of bloodshed but who are uncomfortable with descriptions of sexuality may also want to steer clear. But for the reader who enjoys seeing adult themes handled in an adult fashion, who enjoys compellingly complex interpersonal relationships between characters, and who enjoys a legitimate moral dilemma or two being handled with nuance and subtlety, this book is a can't-miss pleasure. Book six of a superb series, this book may very well be the best of the best so far, and there's every indication that it's only going to get better from here.	2005-02-24

This is a wonderful story, one of the best of the \\"Enterprise\\" series to date. Unfortunately, the novelization was given to someone who is a rather sloppy writer, and the editing failed to catch his numerous atrocities committed on the English language. This isn't Diane Carey, trying to be clever; her assaults on the language are more egregious, but at least have the excuse of being an attempt at creativity. This is simply someone who will write \\"...before the yelling got so out of hand that they ending the gathering in disgust.\\" or who will use \\"pouring\\" rather than \\"poring\\" when talking about reading books, or \\"annunciating\\" each word (rather than \\"enunciating\\") or \\"Archer watched as the collection of...parts began beginning to take shape...\\" or \\"hundred of years ago\\" rather than \\"hundreds\\" or \\"heading in the opposite direction as Reed\\" rather than \\"from Reed\\" or \\"as Reed had\\". This is just scratching the surface; there are errors like this on about every fifth page on average.<br /><br />If you're someone who doesn't notice stuff like this, and thinks I'm being overly picky to dwell on it, then you'll find much to enjoy in this book; the plot is enjoyable, and the pacing and such are excellent. But if, like me, you cringe when reading something by an allegedly professional writer that would have numerous red marks if it were handed in as a seventh grade project, steer clear of it.	2005-02-24

He's a very GOOD writer of comic books, but at least in this series, his comic book writing background really shows through; there is never a tidy story, with a beginning and ending in the same book. There is always a continuation from issue to issue, but he doesn't just write 300 or so pages and then stop; like a good comic book writer, he always manages to end at a point of high drama to make the cliffhanger ending more compelling. Some people like this sort of thing; myself, I find it annoying.<br /><br />But where the comic-book background REALLY comes into play is his inclination to keep the continuing storyline going when he writes a New Frontier story that's out of the general numbered sequence. Therefore, as a public service, I'll let you in on a (not very) closely kept secret, but one which I was baffled by until I saw the list of New Frontier books in the back of this book: do not read book seven of this series after reading book six; after book six, read \\"The Captain's Table #5\\"; then read \\"Double Helix #5: Double or Nothing\\", which is actually a Next Generation book (#55). THEN read #s 7-11 of this series; THEN read \\"Gateways\\" #s 6 & 7; THEN read this book and then \\"Gods Above\\".<br /><br />Peter David writes quite well; he has fine characters, fine plots, and a nice grasp of the language. But none of the books in this series stands by itself. Don't start the series unless you're interested in continuing to read the series, and tracking it down even when the story line crosses over into other series. Reading any one book in this series will leave the reader unsatisfied.	2005-02-24

Like all the books in this series, it won't stand alone; if you haven't read what went before it, the beginning will seem rather confusing. But at least it (mostly) actually has an ending, which is rare for books in this series. (There is a teaser for the beginning of the next book's plot, but no major plotline left unsettled.) I suppose if I must choose between a book with no beginning and a book with no ending, I'll settle for one with no beginning, and this book is the finale to one of the best stories in this admittedly very good series.	2005-02-24

Or seventeenth, if you don't count the spinoff series centering on Olivia and Madeline, two secondary characters introduced in the Saint Germain series proper.<br /><br />This is one of the best of a very good series. The series is historical fiction, set at various periods during the \\"life\\" of a 4000 year old vampire (4000 in the twentieth century, that is; in this book, that makes him about 2500, as it's set in the sixth century.) The historical background in this one is the eruption of Krakatoa, which caused two years of almost continuous winter virtually worldwide, as volcanic ash blotted out much of the sun's light. As usual, the historical research seemed, to this novice, to be very thorough, and the writing was quite good, better than in some of the other books in the series which were somewhat sloppy. The characters, as always, were quite compelling.	2005-02-24

For anyone who picks it up because they enjoy \\"Winnie The Pooh\\", and figure anything that relates to that favorite should be a good read, but who HASN'T plenty of experience dealing with literary criticism, it will be fairly hard going, and much of the humor will be lost as they won't recognize the schools of academic thought being pilloried.	2005-02-06

Or sixteenth, if one doesn't count the two offshoot series, one centering around Atta Olivia Clemens and one around Madeline de Montalia, both vampires who came to the undead life by way of Saint Germain.<br /><br />Like all of the books in this series, this is a historical novel, set during a period in the unlife of Ferenc Ragosky, Count Saint Germain, a vampire who has lived since approximately 2000 years BCE. Unlike most of the others, however, this one is set fairly recently, in the period between World Wars I and II, and uniquely to this point (discounting a couple of the short stories in \\"The Chronicles of Saint Germain\\") is set in the United States of America.<br /><br />Like all of the books in this series, it is a fascinating look at a fascinating character; Saint Germain is always a delight, although to some fans of more standard vampire fiction, he's too much of an unmitigated hero; there isn't enough of the dark, brooding antihero to him for some tastes. There may be some fans of the seiries, too, who prefer the more distant historical settings, and who find the twentieth century too current for their tastes in historical fiction.<br /><br />Unless either of these quibbles sounds like something that would resonate with you, however, this book is highly recommended. Both the character and the history are very well-handled, and in addition, we see a character from a previous book; the love interest, Rowena Saxon, is a carryover from \\"Writ In Blood\\", which was set in the period immediately before the first world war.	2005-02-01

This book is clearly a primer, intended for beginners and disbelievers. As such, it does what it sets out to quite well; if it is a disappointment to those who expect advanced tracts from Mr. Greer, as some of the other reviews suggest, the problem is with their expectations, not with the material at hand. One wouldn't rate a first-year calculus book poorly simply because it fails to increase one's understanding of differential equations.<br /><br />For those inclined to learn a bit about the lore of occult creatures, whether or not they actually believe in the reality of said creatures, this is a very good book. Even if one doesn't believe, and is somewhat put off by Greer's unapologetic stance that magic and occult monsters are real, nonetheless, one must concede that he is very practical in his approach; he repeatedly reminds the reader to consider all other explanations before assuming true occult activity, including hoaxes and simple misunderstanding of \\"normal\\" happenings. He states repeatedly that true paranormal activity is much rarer than such other happenings, and is clearly attempting to discourage people attempting to live out their Fantasy Role Playing Games in the real world, a phenomenon that he is obviously all too familiar with.<br /><br />For those who ARE inclined to believe in the possibility of the occult, this is a very good beginning text on the subject.	2005-01-25

Granted, the \\"biological warfare\\" plot device has been used before, and as recently as the \\"Next Generation: Double Helix\\" miniseries. Still, it was handled well in this instance, and we got a well-written, moving, enjoyable story featuring an elderly Nyota Uhura, an even more elderly Leonard McCoy, a very young Lt. Benjamin Sisko, and somewhat ageless Dr. Selar and Tuvok. The only real flaw I could complain about was that even given the state of the art gerontology available in the 24th century Federation, which allows people to live to the age of 150 or so, Uhura seemed awfully spry for somebody 120 years old. No, spry isn't the word. Spry I could have believed. She seemed downright youthful, and that just didn't seem right. I don't mind her aging gracefully, but I object to her not aging at all by that point. It just didn't seem plausible.	2005-01-24

(A good example would be his \\"thing #6: There is no health care 'crisis' \\". However, there are other things he says that I find absolutely true and very insightful; \\"blacks are more racist than whites\\", \\"white condescention is as bad as black racism\\", and \\"the war on drugs is Vietnam II\\". But always, whether I agree with him or not, his arguments are always thoughtful, interesting, and articulate.<br /><br />This is not to say that they are without flaw; at one point in his chapter on race, he recounts his uncle telling him of how badly he had been used by whites when growing up in the deep south in the middle of the twentieth century, and how he pointed out to his uncle, essentially, \\"That was then; this is now,\\" to make the point that one can't live in the past with regard to such things, and refuse to recognize change. But then just a few pages later, he complains of the fact that blacks almost universally vote democratic, when, after all, it was Lincoln and the Republican party that ended slavery, and southern Democrats who had perpetuated it, and who continued to fight segregation well into the sixties and even seventies. And I wanted to shake him, and say, \\"Yes, but that was then, and this is now; you can argue with the assumption that the Democratic party is better than the Republican party for black people now, but whether they were or not 30-130 years ago has no bearing on the argument.\\"<br /><br />Still, this is a very valuable book, not the least for the fact that it was written by a black man. Much as he would hate to admit it, when a black man says some of the things he says here, they are less easy to dismiss out of hand than they would be if they were written by a white man. That may be an unpleasant reality, but it's reality nonetheless.	2005-01-15

If there's a flaw with it at all, it's that he withholds a bit of the information that his main character has for just a chapter or two, so that the reader has no chance of solving the puzzle before the main character spells out the solution.

It is well told, with good pacing, excellent action, fine characterization, and only a few places (fewer than the average mass-market paperback) where it could have used a bit more proofreading to eliminate sloppy errors in language. The only thing that keeps it from a five-star rating is that, as far as I'm concerned, the ending was a bit too easy; it's difficult to explain why I feel that way without giving away too much of a spoiler, but I feel that it was never sufficiently explained how Kirk solved ONE of the problems he was faced with. It was just assumed that once the other problem was solved, that one would go away too, which seems to me highly unlikely.	2004-12-24

Sherman, her lover for the story.<br /><br />For a third thing, the writing in this book is better than that in \\"Out of the House of Life\\", or at least the proofreading is less sloppy. There are only about a half-dozen instances of sloppy proofreading here, as opposed to the two dozen or so in that book. (\\"How strange that you should call white men them to me...\\" for instance.) Also, in this book one of the conventions of the Saint Germaine series that I've always found moderately annoying has been adjusted in a positive manner: the correspondence that has always come before and after every chapter has been replaced by entries from Madeline's journal, and instead of getting one and only one entry right where we would expect it every time (which always struck me as rather a contrived style) we get one, or two, or several; whatever better advances the plot at that point, which seems a much better system.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the basic concept behind Yarbro's vampires, a few quick points are in order: 1) they are not (neccessarily) ravening monsters. 2) they do need the blood of the living to survive, but very little of it, little enough that they need not kill or even injure anyone to get it. 3) although mere blood itself WILL suffice to keep them going, it would be a very unsatisfying life, like a mortal living on bread and water; to truly have a satisfying \\"meal\\", they must feed on the blood of a lover. Most of the time, they make do with lovers who they hypnotize into having amorous dreams of them, but even that is barely acceptable fare. What truly nourishes them is the blood of a willing lover who knows them for what they are. Not surprisingly, this sort of fare is very rare; they may go decades between such nourishing sustenence. 4) Other than immortality and somewhat exceptional strength, stamina, and speed, (and, of course, the hypnotic ability previously mentioned, which is a very mild power not at all useful in an offensive capacity) there is little to set them apart from mortals in a positive manner; on the other hand, they are more able to offset their vampiric drawbacks than many literary vampires; so long as they have their shoes lined with their native earth, they can move about unhindered during daylight, only slightly more susceptible to sunburn than a normal person, they can cross running water with only mild discomfort (again, as long as their soles are properly lined); the only real problems are that they do not eat normally, which consistently makes for awkward situations socially, and they do not reflect in mirrors, which can also prove awkward.<br /><br />If you like traditional vampire stories with lots of supernatural powers, blood and gore and seductive evil, this novel and all of the related books from Yarbro may not be to your taste (although there is plenty of blood and gore in the scenes relating to the war, of course.) But if you enjoy historical romance and are intrigued (or at least not upset) at the prospect of a main character that is a somewhat untraditional vampire, you may find the Saint Germain series fascinating, and this book is one of the best of the lot.unsatisfying life, like a mortal living on bread and water; to truly have a satisfying \\"meal\\", they must feed on the blood of a lover.

The plot of this play is exactly the kind of thing for which the term \\"madcap\\" was coined. More so than many of Shakespeare's plays, the humor has survived the many changes our culture has undergone since his time. It's easy to see the similarity between this plot and any number of sitcom plots ranging from the \\"I Love Lucy\\" show all the way up through \\"Sabrina the Teenaged Witch\\" and \\"That Seventies Show\\". In fact, the plot device of twins causing mistaken identity was a VERY frequent device in the old \\"Patty Duke Show\\" back in the sixties (functionally as antiquated as Shakespeare's time to most young people). In fact, the semi-modern comic style that this play MOST reminds me of is \\"Abbott and Costello\\"; I can VERY easily envision Bud and Lou as the Antipholuses and Dromios, respectively.<br /><br />All of which just goes to prove that Shakespeare wasn't, at least in his comedies, writing \\"literature\\". He was writing pop culture, and in some ways, pop culture hasn't changed a bit in 400 years.	2004-11-15

The characterizations are compelling, the pacing excellent, the plots, if somewhat far-fetched, interesting.<br /><br />On the down side, this is not a novel. It is, similar to the previous book in the series, two subplots in search of a plot. We are simply following the serialized adventures of the characters who were established back when there actually WAS an overriding plot that tied the stories together; there no longer is. One half of this book is a novella involving the continuing romantic conficts inherent in the relationship between Burgoyne and Selar; at least THIS subplot, while having its beginnings earlier in the series, could possibly be followed by a reader who hadn't read all the previous books, and an \\"ending\\" at a satisfactory break-point in the story. The other half of the book, however, (told in alternating chapters with the previously mentioned half) isn't even a self-contained novella; while it starts at a reasonable point, it continues David's extremely annoying habit in this series of having almost EVERY book end with a cliffhanger, as though he doesn't trust us to be interested enough to buy the next installment unless he leaves us hanging. This half of the book follows Robin Lefler and her mother, Morgan Primus, who we've previously established is actually an immortal, a genetic freak who doesn't age and who instantly heals almost any injury.<br /><br />On the plus side, at least to a fan of the original series like me, we have a somewhat more than cameo appearance by Scotty.<br /><br />On the down side, much to my surprise, David doesn'tr seem to do a very good job of writing Scotty's brogue; he generally transcribes \\"my\\" as \\"muh\\" rather than \\"m'\\", among other flaws. It's a tiny thing, but annoying, and I expect better of a writer of David's abilities.<br /><br />Also on the down side, there is VERY heavy hinting that Morgan Primus was once actually Christine Chapel; Scotty recognizes her, and she him, although she's able to convince him that he must be mistaking her for someone else. Sorry, I just don't buy it. That strains my ability to suspend disbelief WAY past the breaking point, for a number of reasons.<br /><br />All in all, the plusses ALMOST match the minuses, and certainly, if one has read this far in the series, it would be a shame to stop now.

Which is really saying something, considering how good the others have been. As usual, the character of Anita is a compelling one, and the background world that Hamilton has set up is fascinating. The fact that we get the story first person from Anita's point of view works wonderfully, as it gives us a very intimate look at her engaging personality, and it also gives us a great deal of necessary information about the way supernatural things work in this world, as Anita is well-versed in supernatural lore, without knowing EVERYTHING and spoiling all of our surprises. But all of this could have been said equally about any of the books in this series; what makes this one special is getting a bit better look at the characters of Larry Kirkland (Anita's trainee in both necromancy and vampire slaying) and Jean-Claude, the vampire who has been trying to establish a relationship with her of one sort or another ever since book one. Also, we see a bit of the fay in this book, which doubtless provides a bit of a bridge to Hamilton's \\"Meredith Gentry\\" novels.	2004-10-30

It also has an interesting non-regular character who it attempts to give a semi-main role, an eighteen year old daughter of members of the crew who is recovering from autism with some help from Counsellor Troi. On the down side, while that whole sub-plot and character was a fair attempt to bring the subject of autism to our attention, it seemed rather artificial and just tacked on to the real story; it could have been excised without really affecting anything.<br /><br />Not at all a bad book, but not really as good as it could have been, either.	2004-10-18

There are flaws in the arguments used in this book, I won't deny it. Posner is far too inclined to rely on documentation from the very sources that would be the hearts of any conspiracy if there was one: the CIA, the KGB, and other similar organizations, to be completely irrefutable. Does he really believe -- or expect us to believe -- that just because he has an official piece of documentation from the CIA or the KGB that indicates that they had little or no contact with Oswald at the time, and no interest in having any more, that that necessarily means that they didn't? How naive. Also, he tends to speak out of both sides of his mouth at times, at once attacking the concept that eyewitnesses are unreliable when defending eyewitnesses who support his contention, but then dismissing as unreliable any who don't.<br /><br />For all of that, however, he does a creditable job of defending a conclusion that more or less follows the official line. I confess, I began inclined to agree with his conclusion, and after 500 pages of his book, and almost as many in \\"Assassination Science\\", a book taking the opposite stand, I find myself more or less back where I started. There are questions which haven't been answered to my satisfaction, but on balance, I'm inclined to believe that something very close to the official version is what happened.<br /><br />One point that Posner doesn't stress heavily enough, though, one that he barely hints at, but which I consider as nearly conclusive as anything could be: Assume for the moment that some one or more of the conspiracy theories were accurate; the amount of unexpected work that would have needed to be done after the fact to keep the conspiracy unrevealed would have been tremendous. Therefore, the number of people who would have to have been pulled in without prior screening would have been excessive, and many of them would have been required to have specialized skills, which could not necessarily have been found among those known to be dependable and discreet. (Editing the Zapruder film, for instance.) Any conspiracy that requires the participation of dozens, if not hundreds or thousands, of people, especially people not committed to the cause to start with, could not POSSIBLY have remained secret for this long. SURELY, by this point, SOMEBODY specifically involved in some form of tampering with evidence, whether it be the Zapruder film, or the x-rays, or some other piece of definitive evidence, would have concluded that they had doubts about what had been done and why, and decided that, whatever the risks going public might have, either it would be worth it for their fifteen minutes of fame, or possibly they'd be safer in public than remaining quiet. The fact that NO credible people have come forward with claims of being drafted into playing a part in the coverup conspiracy strongly suggests to me that there isn't one; no organization, governmental or otherwise, is that efficient.n to be dependable and discreet.

As with the first two books of this miniseries, half of the book centers in \\"The Captain's Table\\", a mysterious place that seems to exist interdimensionally, can be entered only by captains, but captains of any stripe and from any place or time period; sort of a \\"Callahan's Crosstime Saloon\\", restricted to captains instead of people who Spider Robinson finds interesting. The other half of the book consists of a story told by our main character, in this case, Ben Sisko, about an adventure that he or she has had as a captain, told to the other captains at the bar.<br /><br />As in the previous two books, both stories are very well told, and are quite enjoyable. The problem, and the reason I only rate this book three stars, is that, while I find the basic concept amusing and interesting, I continue to have a problem with the fact that the Starfleet officers DON'T have a problem with the nature of the place; they cheerfully tell stories to rooms full of people whose cultures do not seem to have warp drive capability, or worse, seem to be from earth prior to the invention of warp drive, stories which center around spaceflight and alien cultures, without being the least concerned about the prime directive. Now, perhaps they don't always understand the nature of the place, or don't fully believe it; or perhaps they conclude that the fact that the people are here in the room interacting with other spaceflight cultures and aliens already means that any damage is already done, so nothing they might say can make it any worse. But it would be helpful if this mental process, whatever it may be, was made more clear. As it stands, I can't consider any of these stories canonical, which is a shame given how interesting and well-told they are.	2004-10-07

The last few of the books derived from the old \\"Callhan's\\" series had seemed somewhat of a letdown from the older books; not that they were bad, but I didn't enjoy them nearly as much as I had the originals. I was beginning to wonder if it was me, not them; if I had changed sufficiently as I aged from my twenties into my forties that I could no longer appreciate the kind of story I'd enjoyed then.<br /><br />I'm still not sure, but this book was definitely back on a par with the older entries in the series; it was flawed (so were they, if you looked  hard enough) but it was good enough to overcome its flaws. More, it was good enough to overcome one of the flaws that really bothered me about the previous entry, \\"Callahan's Key\\"; I can't say too much without giving a spoiler, but suffice it to say that I don't expect Jake and the other Callahan's regulars to be insensitive jerks; they don't prejudge people simply because they're alien cyborgs, or sentient computer networks; it seemed wrong that they would prejudge someone just because she was (A) ugly and (B) had a silly name. The fact that they did made it pretty clear that Spider was, and that bothered me; in this book, we get his apology (via Jake).<br /><br />If you've tried the Callahan's books before and found them pointless and silly, your opinion of this one will be the same. If you loved them all, you'll certainly love this one. If you've felt that they'd been slipping for a while, give this one a try; you may enjoy it. If you've NEVER tried the Callahan's books before, then if you like your science fiction WEIRD, well-written and moving in spite of being silly, you will probably enjoy this book, but you might want to read some of the earlier entries in the series first.	2004-09-13

In this, the conclusion to the \\"Dominion War\\" series, we have the novelization of the final seven episodes of the sequence leading up to the re-taking of Deep Space Nine by the Federation, as seen in the television series. It's a very moving, very powerful, very action-packed series of episodes, and makes for an equally impressive novelization. What's surprising is that Diane Carey actually does it justice; all too frequently, she gets carried away with attempts to be a clever wordsmith and use the language creatively; usually, these attempts fall flat as she manages only to use the language incorrectly. In this book, not only does she do very little of this (I can only think of one example; she refers to Sisko's \\"magistrating events\\" when clearly she means \\"orchestrating\\"; it is true that a magistrate CAN be an \\"administrator\\", and thus, by a large stretch, one could say that Sisko was \\"administering\\" events by managing them, but the more commonly understood meaning of \\"magistrate\\" is \\"judge\\", and she was definitely not trying to tell us that Sisko was \\"judging\\" events. He was arranging them, and the proper term for that would be \\"orchestrating\\", even if that word HAS been used in that sense before and she therefore finds it boring) but in most cases, when she used words in an attempt to be creative, it actually worked. And, as usual, her characterizations, her pacing, her plotting (in those cases in which she filled in missing gaps in the plot) were all excellent. This story is a must for any fan of the series \\"Deep Space Nine\\", for any fan of Star Trek in general, and indeed for anyone who enjoys a well-written Space Opera. If, of course, you hate science fiction in general or the action-based \\"Space Opera\\" subgenre, this story won't do anything for you, but if that's the case, why are you bothering to read this review?

As any regular reader of my reviews knows, I've never been a fan of Diane Carey's writing, and while this book doesn't change my overall opinion of her writing (as her entry in the \\"Day of Honor\\" series almost did) it also doesn't do too much to reinforce it. She still has a bit of a tendancy to use words in ways that she obviously defines as \\"creative\\" and that I can only call \\"weird and distracting\\", but it isn't nearly as pronounced in this book as it is in, say, \\"Descent\\" or \\"The Search\\". Further, since this is an original story, rather than an adaptation of a TV episode as both of the aforementioned books were, it plays to her strengths, which are plotting and characterization, pacing, and virtually every aspect of writing that does NOT involve word choice, and if her plot was somewhat implausible in places, still, it was interesting and moved well.	2004-08-26

In this book, we see Will Riker as a Cadet and then an Ensign; we see his father; we see Katherine Janeway as an Ensign, and we see Owen Paris, father of Tom Paris, already an Admiral. The story centers around Will and his father, although the twain never do meet; already, they're estranged. The plot, both the main one and various subplots, are all handled well, competently and with flair. We get more insight into both Will and his father; not surprisingly, Deanna Troi is not the first potential love that Will has broken up with in the name of furthering his career, nor is it surprising that his father has trouble with relationships too.<br /><br />Not, perhaps, of interest to the reader who isn't already familiar with the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" background world and characters unless they would find a study of a disfunctional father-son relationship in which both men are reasonable, worthwhile individuals of interest, but definitely a must for fans.	2004-08-21

It's never as bad here as it is in, say, \\"The Search\\", or some of her other earlier works, but it is still noticeable that she's trying too hard to be \\"clever and creative\\", and generally succeeding only in being distractingly odd. The story itself, being mostly an adaptation of several episodes of the \\"Deep Space Nine\\" television show from the time period of the \\"Dominion War\\" of the book's title, is good, and the changes that Ms. Carey has made are as often improvements as not, and generally don't seem to detract anything from what we saw onscreen. But as of the writing of this book, at least, she had yet to learn that being a \\"wordsmith\\" (which seems to be what she wants to think of herself as) does NOT involve playing such games with the language as to distract attention from the story she's telling.	2004-08-17

I think that this book is intended to be something of a spoof, sort of like John Ford's \\"How Much For Just The Planet\\", original series #36. If so, the fact that I'm not CERTAIN that this is true is a good indication that it failed miserably. On the other hand, if it WAS intended to be taken as a serious story, it fails even more miserably. Many of the characters (notably Kira and Sisko) are unrecognisable, simply ciphers carrying the names of the characters we know, but with none of their personality. The story is choppy, entirely composed of chapters three pages long or less. The plot (Quark is in danger of being bankrupted by a lucky gambler) has been done before, and done better. The psuedoscience bafflegab is even sketchier and less plausible than usual (and in a world where instantaeous matter transport and faster than light travel are both commonplaces, that's saying a lot). And the ending is contrived, as are several of the plot twists.<br /><br />All in all, give this one a pass. It has very little to recommend it.	2004-08-17

This was an enjoyable story, better than just okay if not particularly spectacular. It's kind of weak as a four-star, but is a little too good to be just a three-star. The personifications of Major Kira and Doctor Bashir seem a bit exaggerated, a bit too 2-dimensional, and the baby hortas should have been a little easier to deal with than they were (just keep transporting them back to where you want them; you may not be able to keep them there, but there's no reason you can't keep sending them back faster than they can get away) but other than that, the story was very well handled and enjoyable.	2004-07-31

Pretty standard Star Trek fare; not as much action as we sometimes see, but a bit of moderately good drama, some alternate dimensions, Spock and Scotty's technical know-how is what separates the Enterprise from all the rest, a crackpot villain with good intentions who's sadly misguided, some annoying civilian politicos, and some Klingon bluster.

Somewhat poor execution.<br />Set in the period, as near as I can tell, between &quot;Star Trek I: The Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (based on the fact that the apparently original Enterprise is intact, and Chekov is security chief rather than navigator), the plot of this story is something of a cross between the original series episode &quot;The Immunity Syndrome&quot;, in which the Enterprise encounters a giant, energy-eating space amoeba, and the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, in which Picard and crew meet and witness the birth of alien creatures at Farpoint Station. As such, it is pretty standard &quot;Trek&quot; fare, and the characterizations are handled pretty well, but the actual writing itself (and its concommitant editing) gets a bit sloppy at times; never mind the use of &quot;suppose&quot; instead of &quot;supposed&quot; (as in &quot;what's that suppose to mean&quot;); that's such a common error I suppose I should stop bothering to point it out any more. But there are the several points at which the author demonstrates that she is unaware that the verb form of &quot;mold&quot; is &quot;molder&quot;, rather than &quot;mold&quot;, and so we're told that food is &quot;molding&quot; on tables; unless the food is sentient and sculpting something, she meant &quot;moldering&quot;. There's the point at which we are told that the doors &quot;closed quietly as his back&quot; when Kirk walked through them; unless for some reason, Kirk's back is supposed (suppose?) to be the epitome of silence, I must assume this to be a typo meant to say &quot;AT his back&quot;. We are told at another point that &quot;neither of them (McCoy and a security ensign) thought it prudent at this time to force way in&quot; rather than &quot;force THEIR way in&quot; or &quot;force A way in&quot;.  We are told that &quot;McCoy fought a smile but continued to watch the Chekov&quot;, as though Chekovs were a racial subgroup. We are told about an ensign who was &quot;undermined by baggage from his past he probably hadn't even know he still carried&quot;. There is a reference to &quot;unaccostumed energy sources&quot; (energy sources not dressed for Halloween?) and a piece of dialogue in which McCoy tells Kirk not to ever tell him again that the transporter &quot;isn't something to be worry about&quot;.<br />I realize that criticizing typos and editing, grammar and word usage in mass-market paperbacks is something like shooting fish in a barrel, but when the errors are this frequent, the story has to be better than mediocre to offset them.

If you are one of the legions of Klingon fans among the newer generations of Star Trek fans, you will doubtless find this book more to your taste than I find it to mine; it is well-written, and explores in detail some stories and characters that we've only gotten glimpses of from the canonical material, including Curzon Dax, Mogh father of Worf, and Ian Troi (Deanna's father.) But since I've never been entirely able to overcome my distaste for Klingon culture and society, even as I became more enamored of the character of Worf than I initially was (just call me an original series purist, I suppose), and since this book is essentially a look at a conflict between the Klingon Empire and the Cardassian Union (and if there's a race/culture even LESS palatable than the Klingons, it's the Cardies), it was just very hard to develop any emotional investment in what happened in this story. I rate it at four stars because I recognise that it is well-executed, but if I were to be honest, from a purely subjective sense, I'd be hard-pressed to rate it as high as three stars. It was just hard to develop any interest in this book.	2004-07-08

At risk of causing my reviewer rating to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged lovers of all things Shakespeare, I must say that I was seriously disappointed by this work; it hardly seems worthy of the Bard. 90% of this story was dialogue in which, alternately, English soldiers spoke of what they were going to do to the French, and French soldiers spoke of what they were going to do to the English. This was followed by a few fight scenes, and then the English crowing about how they'd succeeded in doing what they'd bragged they were going to do, and the French bemoaning their failure to live up to their boasts. Then Shakespeare tried to paste a love story ending onto a play that had absolutely no hint of one before then, and which rang even hollower than Shakespeare's love stories usually do. Granted, the language is typically Shakespearean, if not his most memorable, and the little bit of the story not accounted for in the preceding description was a fairly enjoyable glimpse of the character of King Henry as he was in Henry IV, part I, when as Prince Hal he was actually entertaining, but it wasn't nearly enough to rescue an otherwise thoroughly uninteresting story.<br />I cannot fathom why this is described as one of the most popular of Shakespeare's history plays.	2004-07-04

If you're not overly inclined to question the validity of the plots or your Star Trek novels, but are happy to simply read a good action-based story, root for the lead character to succeed and be happy when he does, you'll probably like this book, unless you have a dislike for overly convoluted, cloak-and-dagger type stories. If, on the other hand, you expect your Starfleet officers to not simply accomplish great ends, but to do so honorably and, what's perhaps more important, PLAUSIBLY, then you will find this book, as I did, very disturbing.<br />Because the plot to this book depends so heavily upon secret twists that the reader is not fully aware of until they are revealed, it is impossible to detail much of the problem without unacceptably spoiling the book for those who actually choose to read it in spite of my negative review; suffice it to say that while this book COULD have been a very interesting look at whether a noble goal can and should be achieved by dishonorable means. Instead, those aspects of the story were only given the most skimpy of attention; there is no real question raised as to the morality of the actions of our &quot;hero&quot;. There is no indication that he suffers any second thoughts, no indication that any of his friends would think less of him if they knew what he had done. There IS an indication that he and his friends both are concerned with the riskiness of the plan, which quite honestly was an incredible long-shot and which would have made things much WORSE than they would otherwise have been had it failed (which is another reason for refusing to accept the scheme.) But no one seems to question the idea, debatably acceptable but not nearly as much of a given as the story would make it, that lying, cheating, slandering, and committing sabotage are acceptable if they're done in the interest of preventing an interstellar war. This would have been an interesting question, but was NOT interesting as an idea presented for unquestioning acceptance.ceptance.	2004-07-01

Like the first book in this miniseries, this book is a fine action story, with a lively plot that moves right along at a fast clip. Also like the first book, if you want anything OTHER than action, this is the wrong book to pick up. The one attempt at something more than fast-paced action -- a budding romance between Ro Laren and Sam Lavelle -- is handled remarkably clumsily. This sub-plot could have been very moving and powerful; instead, it was only rather distracting. It didn't really ring true for either character, and seemed completely out of place, merely something tacked onto the main plot for the purpose of deflecting accusations of a lack of character development.<br /><br />This book is really a sequel to book one of the series; as near as I can tell, book two adds very little if anything to the storyline in books one and three. Essentially, books one and three are a linked pair, as are books two and four, but the two pairs actually have very little to do with one another and can be read independently of each other.	2004-06-11

I don't much care for 2-part stories, in which the first book has no proper ending, and the second book picks up in mid-story, which is why I marked this book (and its predecessor) down to four stars. Additionally, the actual ending was somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic, after having been built up to be a major issue, but that wasn't enough of a drawback to justify marking an otherwise excellent story down to three stars.

In this book, Diane Carey once again demonstrates what she is capable of when not attempting to show how cute and clever she can be with the language. In many of her earlier works, her writing was almost indecipherable due to a tendancy to try to find new, unusual uses for perfectly good words. More and more, in her recent efforts, she has gotten away from this quirk, and the result has been some truly fine writing; this is one of the best so far. The story itself is not as good as her story in &quot;Day of Honor, Ancient Blood&quot;, but that isn't her fault. In this case, she is writing a novelization of an existing episode, and she does a solid, workmanlike job of it. The episode is good, just not as good as the best ideas that Ms. Carey has had on her own. This story is an excellent introduction to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; characters and storyline, and Ms. Carey's treatment of it is very worthwhile reading.	2004-05-17

When rating Shakespeare, I generally rate it as compared to other Shakespearean plays; otherwise, the almost unrelieved 4 and 5 star ratings would not be very informative. This book barely rates three stars as compared to other Shakespeare; compared to the general run of books in the world, it would certainly rate somewhere between four and five.<br />The problem is that by Shakespeare's standards, it's sloppy. There are numerous places in which the language varies from folio to folio, and in various later editions, as the notes in this (the Dover Thrift Edition) make clear. And these are not just superficial alterations, but actual changes in the apparent meaning of the lines, or even attempts to insert meaning where it is almost impossible to find any in the original lines.<br />Other than that, the story itself is interesting, better than many of Shakespeare's more famous works, and if there are no immortal lines that leap out at the reader on a par with &quot;My kingdom for a horse&quot; or &quot;To be or not to be&quot;, that says more about the quality of his other works than about any lack of quality here.<br />As with all of Shakespeare's plays, this is worth the read, although even more than with some of his others, it is imperative that the modern reader get an edition with good notes; otherwise, some of the sense is sure to be lost.	2004-05-15

If the reader is not familiar with Ms. Hamilton's &quot;Anita Blake&quot; series, and goes into this book expecting simply another Star Trek book by a random author, he or she will doubtless be at least mostly satisfied. The plot is above average for the genre, and if it does have a fairly common theme for Star Trek (and particularly Next Generation) novels (inhabitants of unenlightened planet are in danger of destroying their planet's ecosystem) it is a storyline that is handled fairly well here; the plot moves, and the characters seem recognizable. The writing is a bit sloppy, with a few too many commas where there should be either semicolons or periods, but not to a truly distracting extent, and the occasional misuse of a word (&quot;breath&quot; used as a verb, instead of &quot;breathe&quot;, as in &quot;give me room to breath&quot;; &quot;suppose&quot; used instead of &quot;supposed&quot; as in &quot;what were the powers suppose to be able to do?&quot;; &quot;use&quot; instead of &quot;used&quot; as in &quot;It's what our world use to be&quot;) is annoying, but again, not so frequent as to be a really terrible problem.<br />The real problem is that, if the reader is familiar with Ms. Hamilton's &quot;Anita Blake&quot; series, he or she comes to this book expecting something truly exceptional, and that isn't at all what he or she gets. This book was published only a year before &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, the first in the &quot;Anita&quot; series, but the quality here is decades behind the quality in that book. Some of the problem, admittedly, is that we are working with established characters here, none of which is Anita Blake, and much of the delight to be found in that series comes from the portrayal of that very delightful character. Perhaps Ms. Hamilton would do better if she wrote a novel set in the period before Tasha Yar died, and wrote from Lt. Yar's perspective, as she does from Anita's. The characters are similar enough that she might truly be able to bring Tasha to life. But in this story, none of the characters, established or new, has a tenth of the spark that one finds in Anita Blake. It's unsettling to think that someone who could create such a dynamic character is a one-trick pony. Hopefully, she's grown as a writer in the last 12 years.to bring Tasha to life.

I've always been a big fan of Peter David's writing, and I seem to recall saying of the first &quot;Imzadi&quot; novel something along the lines of, &quot;In spite of the fact that I've never been that fond of these characters, the novel was wonderful; Peter David could make a recipe for tapioca interesting.&quot;<br />I can't say that about this novel.<br />I'm not entirely sure why; the style is unmistakably Peter David's usual style, which I've always maintained was the optimal style for a Star Trek novel: plenty of action, plenty of drama, but still managing to inject more than a bit of wry humor into the story. His style is reminiscent of some of the best episodes from the original series: &quot;Trouble With Tribbles&quot;, &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;, &quot;Shore Leave&quot;, &quot;I, Mudd&quot;. This story fits that mold perfectly. Yet somehow, it just didn't connect.<br />There are two possibilities as to &quot;why&quot;: either there are some stories that just don't lend themselves to this style, that need to be told straight, without the sly and ironic bits of humor (can you see the third movie, &quot;Search For Spock&quot;, being told in this style? I can't) or else his style simply gets tiresome if one is overexposed to it, and needs to be rationed. After all, the above-mentioned episodes were fun, but the series really wouldn't have been as good if ALL of the episodes were in that style. Perhaps I've just been reading too much of Mr. David's work, and need to cut back for a while.<br />I don't think so, though. I'm inclined to believe the first explanation. There are some stories that simply do not lend themselves to humor. This was one of them.	2004-04-26

It is readable by children, and interesting enough to encourage children who would generally prefer to watch TV or movies to actually pick up a book and READ. Beyond that, it's one of those delightful books that is actually as interesting to adults (at least, adults who haven't had their imaginations atrophied yet) as it is to its alleged target audience; like Tolkein's \\"The Hobbit\\", or Barrie's \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", adults can read this without feeling the least patronized. It has a writing style that is at once easy enough for the young reader without seeming simplistic to the adult reader; the same is true of the vocabulary it uses. The characters are well-developed and fascinating, both the central characters (who are children) and the adult characters with whom they interact. The villain is unambiguous, and right and wrong are likewise clear-cut, as befits a book targeted at children, but the characters do not seem in the least stereotyped.<br />Hard as it is to imagine, this book completely lives up to the hype.

Of course, &quot;Mary's Place&quot; is really just a euphemism for &quot;Callahan's Crosstime Saloon&quot;, even if the proprietor IS Jake Stonebender instead of the great one. But if Doc Webster, Eddie Costigan, Mickey Finn and company hang out there, it's really Callahan's, and as such, fans of the &quot;Callahan's&quot; series will not want to miss this one.<br />This is particularly true because in this book, we finally get the &quot;origin stories&quot; for Long Drink McGonnigle, Doc Webster, and Fast Eddie, and they are superb, some of the most powerful writing that Robinson has ever done, which is why I rate this book five stars IN SPITE of the fact that the main plot is kind of weak (Alien cyborg coming to destroy the earth? Gotta defeat it with one hand tied behind our collective, poor weak human backs? Been there. Done that) AND in spite of the fact that the beginning and ending subplot strikes me as involving rather more mockery of individuals based on physical appearance and speaking an unfamiliar language that &quot;sounds funny&quot; than I'd expect from Robinson and the Callahan's folks. The flashback origin stories are just THAT GOOD. You do NOT want to miss them.	2004-04-14

There are a number of aspects to this story that can be rated. It seems to be a fairly accurate, true-to-the-episode novelization; five stars there. It is a marvellous pure science fiction story, which leaves unsolved whether it's actually about an alternate-universe writer who is able to tap into the world of Deep Space Nine for his stories, or about Commander Sisko having temporary insanity that produces hallucinations. Again, five stars. It is a powerful, moving story about the effects of racism on a young black science fiction writer in 1953 Harlem. Once more, five stars. About the only way in which it is NOT a five-star effort is purely as a Star trek novel; ninety percent or more of this story has absolutely nothing to do with Star Trek, and another five percent is only tangentially related to Star Trek. Only the very beginning and the very end actually deal with the station and what's happening there; the plot for this tiny fraction of the story is virtually nonexistent except as a setup for the non-Star Trek part of the story. In that regard, it's barely worth two stars.<br />So if what you're interested in is a wonderfully told, powerfully moving story with some minor connection to Deep Space Nine, this is EXACTLY what you're looking for. If, on the other hand, you actually want a Star Trek novel, this may not be what you want.	2004-04-14

This book is an overview of the first five years of the strip, ranging from the early strips in which the focus is mostly on Milo, through the introductions of Binkley, Bobbi, Cutter John, Opus, Oliver Wendell Jones, Steve Dallas, and finally, Bill The Cat. Personally, I've always had a preference for the early, pre-Bill The Cat strips; I could deal with the silliness inherent in Opus and Oliver's anthropomorphic computer, but Bill just seemed one step over the line. But I know that he's very popular, and he's here, too. There are a few strips here that were reprinted from the previous three collections, but most of this material is NOT reprints. Of course, much of the humor will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who wasn't politically aware during the '80s, but I suspect that even for such a (hopefully) young person, there's plenty here to enjoy.	2004-04-13

Not one of Shakespeare's more memorable works, there are some pluses to this play and relatively few minuses, but neither the pluses nor the minuses are anything that stands out. It is nice to have yet another play told in Shakespeare's beautiful language, and enjoyable to see a love story that centers on people old enough to no longer be in the first blush of youth, even if they ARE still young enough to be beautiful and virile. On the other hand, I'd have liked to see these more mature lovers BEHAVING somewhat more maturely, instead of being just as frivolous, headstrong, and foolish as the kids in &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot;, and there really aren't any lines from this play that come immediately to mind as having entered the &quot;Quotes Hall Of Fame&quot;, as so many lines from Shakespeare's plays have. Nothing on the order of &quot;A horse! My Kingdom for a horse!&quot; or &quot;Alas, poor Yorick; I knew him well.&quot; or &quot;To be or not to be, that is the question&quot;, or so many others.<br />If you enjoy Shakespearean plays, you'll probably enjoy this one.

This book is an outgrowth of his &quot;bad song survey&quot;, in which he asked readers of his column to write in with feedback as to what they considered the worst ever pop music songs. He received a flood of responses that easily enabled him to write two full columns on the subject, and still hadn't begun to scratch the surface. So he wrote this book, and almost the only drawback I find in this book is that it is too short; he STILL has barely begun to scratch the surface, but claims that immersing himself in thoughts of these bad songs was driving him insane and he needed to bring it to an end for the sake of his sanity.<br />First, let's define &quot;Bad song&quot;: according to Dave, novelty songs don't count, because they're not SUPPOSED to be good, they're supposed to be funny (and even if they fail in that, they don't count for our purposes). So, for instance, &quot;They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha Ha!&quot; by Napoleon XIV doesn't count, nor does &quot;Mr. Custer&quot; by Larry Verne. For much the same reason, (and here I disagree with him) Dave discounts all country music on the grounds that historically, the genre has tended not to take itself too seriously, having songs such as &quot;Drop Kick Me Jesus Through The Goalposts Of Life&quot;, and thus as far as he's considered, he's willing to give the entire genre some slack and assume that any song with really dumb lyrics must be kidding. (I maintain that &quot;D.I.V.O.R.C.E.&quot; by Tammy Wynette, and &quot;Your Cheatin' Heart&quot; by, I think, Hank Williams, are examples of country songs that certainly take themselves overly seriously and which are also sufficiently appalling that I'd rather listen to fingernails on a blackboard than listen to them.)<br />Another requirement for a song to qualify for the bad song survey &amp; book is that it has to have had a LOT of airplay, and it also has to have that indescribable quality that forces your mind to remember it, against your every intention; it has to be the kind of song that if you had a lobotomy, or some other form of brain damage, sufficient that you could barely remember your own name, if this song came on the radio, you could still sing along with it,  the kind of quality that causes you, if you hear it on the radio, to not be able to get it out of your head for WEEKS.<br />Granted, as Dave is quick to point out, this is a very subjective subject; many songs that have a strong showing in the survey, he actually enjoys, and there are those that I like as well. Undoubtedly, there will be songs that you actually like that show up in this book. Sometimes, however, even for the songs you like, you'll be forced to admit that the comments are justified, and in other cases, you'll just have to decide that some of the respondants to the survey have no taste. But the book is still a scream, and an absolute must for any fan of either Dave Barry's writing, and any fan of pop music.o be the kind of song that if you had a lobotomy, or some other form of brain damage, sufficient that you could barely remember your own name, if this song came on the radio, you could still sing along with it,  the kind of quality that causes you, if you hear it on the radio, to not be able to get it out of your head for WEEKS.<br />Granted, as Dave is quick to point out, this is a very subjective subject; many songs that have a strong showing in the survey, he actually enjoys, and there are those that I like as well.

Not great, but not bad; this story purports to tell the tale of the first meeting between Kirk and his son David Marcus, as well as to establish the reason for some of the hostility displayed toward Kirk by David in &quot;The Wrath Of Khan&quot;. It establishes the character of David fairly well, but the justification for the hostility is weak at best, and the subplot involving the political machinations of the Klingons seems decidedly spurious, merely an excuse for the Klingons behaving in odd and implausible ways later.<br />A perfectly good adventure novel, which mostly fails at its attempts to a pretension to be more than that.	2004-04-07

And in the case of this book, some of those details are just devilishly WRONG. Other than those few details, this is a fairly middle of the road Next Generation novel; the pace is a bit slow at times, although it does pick up at others, and the basic plot is fairly standard Next Generation fare, so if the idea of a Vulcan commissioner demonstrating unadulterated impatience, to the point of repeatedly requesting information without allowing enough time from the previous request to pass for it to be POSSIBLE for an answer to have been received doesn't strike you as illogically emotional; if the characterization of Miles O'Brien as a surly, possessive, jealous, chauvinistic jerk doesn't strike you as completely out of character, AND if you're willing to believe that birth control technology hasn't improved sufficiently by the 24th century to make unplanned pregnancies EXTREMELY rare, but that in fact both Molly O'Brien AND Wesley Crusher were the result of unplanned, accidental pregnancies, then by all means, consider this a three star review. If it weren't for those whoppers, this would qualify as a mediocre book.	2004-04-07

This is, overall, a fair to middling Star Trek story; the action is good, the characterizations are better than average, the plot fair if not terribly original. The problem is, it is mostly spoiled by a rather wishy-washy, unsatisfying ending. Since I can't say much more about the ending than that without giving away major plot points, suffice it to say that I found both the climactic point AND the post-climax epilogue to be very implausible and to be a cheap out for the major focus of the story.	2004-03-30

I've read well over 100 Star Trek novels; this one is not a standout that I would recommend to someone if they wanted ten recommendations (or even twenty), but it is solid and enjoyable. Not surprisingly, given who the authors are, it is well-written, and (perhaps surprisingly,) the collaboration is pretty seamless; I thought that I would recognize each individual's writing style, and be able to tell who contributed what, but that was not the case other than a few places where I definitely recognized Peter David's sense of humor.	2004-03-27

This is not a bad book, and if you're in need of a fix for your DS9 addiction, there are plenty of worse choices out there. The writing itself is actually pretty good, and the concept isn't bad. (Of course, it's also not all that original; I was very strongly reminded of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and Hal the computer saying &quot;I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that.&quot; The idea of artificial intelligence, particularly accidentally created artificial sentience, becoming a threat and/or insane is hardly new, but this WAS a fairly interesting look at it.) The biggest problem I have with this story is that the main characters actually DO very little; mostly, the solutions to their problems just sort of drop into their laps after they've struggled to find a solution and failed. They are presented with very thorny problems, including ethical dillemmas, but never actually required to solve them. Thus, while the story was engaging enough, the ending felt rather cheap.<br />OK if what you're looking for is a fast-moving plot with some excitement (although on that score, the book starts rather slowly) but not recommended if you're actually looking for a book with more meat to it.	2004-03-24

There will, undoubtedly, be people disappointed with this book because it has only cameo appearances by the familiar characters; the story centers around the Starfleet Academy years of six cadets, from around the time of the episode \\"Time's Arrow\\" through slightly after the \\"Generations\\" movie. The author does a fine job of integrating the known background of the series into a story about people only marginally touched by those events, but the real story is a very touching coming-of-age story. As such, it is very different from what we've come to expect in a \\"Star Trek\\" novel, but there is enough action that anyone who reads these books for the action should be satisfied, even if the action is mostly episodic and does not provide the overarching storyline, which focusses primarily on character development.<br />What makes this book special is the two love stories it contains, both between pairs of the primary characters. In both cases, this is treated in a very unusual way (and one that I would dearly love to see more often): the people in question first get to know one another, then become friends, and only later fall in love and pair off. This remarkably sensible form of love story is doubtless considered very unromantic by some, thanks to the standard \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" love stories that we've all been force-fed since before we knew enough to resist them, in which the couple fall in love first, and only then (sometimes) get to know one another and become friends. Anyone with an ounce of sense knows that this story's take on the concept is the best way to go about things, but there are way too few people out there with an ounce of sense.<br />What REALLY makes this book special, however, is that one of the couples in question is two women. Taking the great tradition instituted by Gene Roddenberry that Star Trek is set in a world where all of the prejudices, biases, and disputes that so upset our century have long since ceased to be issues where it has never been taken before, Wright tells a love story between two women in which the words \\"lesbian\\", \\"gay\\", and \\"homosexual\\" never appear, and in which none of the characters find it at all odd or worthy of comment that the two friends/acquaintances of theirs who are in love happen to be of the same gender. In neither love story is sexuality more than hinted at; still, the pairbonding is clear and unambiguous, and totally unashamed.<br />A beautiful novel.aken before, Wright tells a love story between two women in which the words \\"lesbian\\", \\"gay\\", and \\"homosexual\\" never appear, and in which none of the characters find it at all odd or worthy of comment that the two friends/acquaintances of theirs who are in love happen to be of the same gender.

Donoghue does a marvellous job of filling in the background plausibly, making the woman seem both real and sympathetic without in any way sugarcoating her actions.<br />Like many stories that deal with some of these themes, this story can be seen as a cautionary tale of what happens when a person is deemed \\"ruined\\" when any taint of the forbidden is attached to them.

Set in the aftermath of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, this is an adventure that deals with the crew of the Enterprise as aging, post-Enterprise members of Starfleet, mostly going their own separate ways. If that, and a lot of complaints about aging, aren't your cup of tea, then there is a definite downside to this book. But it IS  handled well, so you may find it to be more interesting than you would think even if the idea DOES sound dull.<br />Furthermore, this is one of those &quot;Kirk &amp; co. save the Federation and civilization as we know it&quot; storylines, but it's handled better than I've ever seen the idea handled before. Most of the threats of that magnitude seem contrived, and the idea that our heroes can stem the tide even more so. But in this story, the threat seemed VERY plausible, and given the nature of it, the solution seemed equally plausible.<br />One of the best original series &quot;Trek&quot; books I've read in quite a while.	2004-03-11

Some readers of vampire fiction don't want their vampires to be good guys; at best, they want engaging bad boys like Anne Rice's &quot;Lestat&quot;. At worst, they want ravening demons. If you fall into this category, don't read this book (or any book in this series). You won't get what you're looking for here. In Yarbro's books, the bad guys are generally the political and religious powers that be in the historical periods that she writes about.<br />Which brings us to one of the most fascinating things about this series: the historical settings. Saint Germain is a vampire who has lived for 4000 years; as such, each novel sets him in a different time period; this one sets him in the court of Charlemagne, circa 800 CE. Don't read these books as vampire fiction; read them as historical romances.<br />One of the few negative aspects to this series is that regular readers know from earlier-written books set in later historical periods that most of the romances are doomed to tragic endings; if they weren't, the romantic interests would have become vampires, and we'd have seen them or heard them referred to in later-period books. This gets a bit depressing after a while, but is hardly enough to keep the series from being worthwhile.<br />I would put this book about on a par with &quot;Blood Roses&quot; or &quot;Darker Jewels&quot;, not as good as &quot;Writ In Blood&quot; or &quot;Better In The Dark&quot;, but better than most of the series.uot;Blood Roses&quot; or &quot;Darker Jewels&quot;, not as good as &quot;Writ In Blood&quot; or &quot;Better In The Dark&quot;, but better than most of the series.	2004-03-05

The stories are all delightfully erotic, and equally delightfully competently written and edited, a rarity in sexually explicit material.<br />It is, perhaps, telling that the stories by Anais Nin were far from the best stories in the book, either in writing quality or in erotic quality.	2004-02-11

The writing is smooth and professional, with few if any of the sloppy proofreading errors so common in mass-market adventure novels in general, and Star Trek novels in particular.<br />My only quibble is that the ending seemed a bit abrupt and pat, but only a bit.

We start with a fascinating question: In the original series episode, &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;, the villain of the piece was &quot;Garth of Izar&quot;, a former starship captain then an inmate in a mental institution for the criminally insane. By the end of the episode, Kirk and the Enterprise have successfully delivered a new drug that is supposed to cure his insanity, and it shows every sign of working. SO....if he's been cured, and is no longer dangerous or insane, what do you do with him? Surely, the Federation and Starfleet have sufficiently progressive ideals that they would not continue to penalize a man for what he did while clinically insane after he's been cured, don't they? Not to mention, they wouldn't deprive themselves of the services of one of their best captains when it was no longer neccessary to do so, would they? So if the cure worked, and Garth was reinstated at full rank, how come we've never heard of him again?<br />This book does an excellent job of answering those very good questions. And other than the fact that for the first ten pages, they can't seem to make up their minds whether his most famous exploits were at the expense of the Klingons or the Romulans (a mistake that probably comes from having two authors working together, but which it is unforgivable that no one, authors or editors, caught before going to print) the book is reasonably if not spectacularly well-written.<br />Not a great Star Trek book, but a good one; an excellent idea, tolerably well-handled.	2004-02-03

For one thing, the quality of the writing is sporadic at best, and sloppy at worst. But far more importantly, the book fails to stay even remotely on-topic. It seemed as if the author wrote entries for all of the legitimate werewolves-and-other-shapeshifters he could find, and discovered that this didn't provide him with nearly enough material for the size of book that he had in mind, so he decided to expand his definition of \\"werewolf\\" to include all bloody-handed mass murderers, regardless of whether there was ever the slightest suggestion of shapeshifting involved with the case. So we get an entry on Richard Speck, and an entry on Jeffrey Dahmer, and an entry on the Zodiac killer, and an entry on Jack The Ripper, etc, etc, ad nauseum. Now, if he'd changed the subtitle of his book to read \\"The Encyclopedia of Mass Murderers, Bloody Killers, and Cannibals\\", instead of \\"The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings\\", this might have been almost tolerable, although I still would find the claim that any sufficiently gory killer is by definition a \\"real life werewolf\\" to be rather fatuous. But as it stands, there are far too many entries in this book that, while not uninteresting, have absolutely NOTHING to do with the ostensible subject matter. Further, the author's tendency to accept at face value almost any allegedly first-hand account of mythological creatures gets old very quickly.	2004-01-29

In the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, one of the most famous and powerful episodes was &quot;Space Seed&quot;, in which the crew of the Enterprise met and came into conflict with Khan Noonien Singh, a survivor from the &quot;Eugenics Wars&quot; of the &quot;distant past&quot; of the 1990s. Now that we have, in fact, bumbled our way through those 1990s without an apparent destructive struggle with Khan and his crowd of genetically engineered supermen, the standard wisdom says that the &quot;backhistory&quot; of the Star Trek universe has become dated; what seemed like a possible future in the late '60s has failed to come to pass.<br />What this book (and its predecessor) attempt to do is to reconcile the facts given in that episode (and its movie sequel) with the actual history of the previous decade. This might seem impossible, but in fact is managed quite nicely; the machinations of the genetically enhanced would-be world conquerors mostly happened behind the scenes, and was kept out of the mainstream press, in a way that seems far more plausible than might be expected. Further, the characterizations were handled well, and the writing style is excellent.<br />The only reason that I mark the book down a star is that the &quot;frame story&quot; format, in which the first chapter and the last detail a minor adventure of Kirk and the Enterprise, simply to provide a bit of &quot;face time&quot; for the major characters who some fans might feel cheated without, was basically irrelevant to the main story. I'd have preferred to see the main story told as a stand-alone, with the secondary story fleshed out and given its own book. As it stands, it was just a distraction.	2004-01-15

As is usually the case with Peter David, the writing style is excellent; as usual, he manages to tell an exciting action-based story without losing his sense of humor, which is rare. As an added bonus, this story has its beginning in the time of Captain Pike, just after the events in &quot;The Menagerie&quot;; after a chapter or two, we move forward to a standard original-series story, set at some point after the fourth movie. (&quot;The Voyage Home&quot;)<br />But while the story is exciting, a good read, with action, pacing, and characterization that is all one could ask for, it is, ultimately, a lightweight novel. Which is not necessarily a bad thing; that's going to be true of most stories in any protracted series. They can't ALL be world-beaters; this one is a good light-reading episode with just a hint of the deeper thought-provoking concepts that make some Star Trek stories great. Not enough to be great itself, but just enough to be very good.	2004-01-08

This book may not be quite as thought-provoking as the first book in this miniseries, (&quot;Ancient Blood&quot; by Diane Carey) but it is definitely better written and more entertaining than the vast majority of Star Trek books, and worth the read for anyone not inimically opposed to reading a Star Trek book. The characterizations of the regulars seem well-handled, and if none of the minor characters really shone, they at least had an opportunity to make more than a walk-on appearance. Meanwhile, the antagonists were fairly standard, but they weren't really the point of the story, and if the concept behind the new alien species wasn't all that new, that wasn't much of a detriment to the story. It WOULD have been nice if the concept of &quot;honor&quot; was a bit more central to the story, rather than mostly being a series of plot devices that the characters had to work with and/or around. But overall, this book is very good, falling just short of the five-star mark.	2004-01-05

The &quot;autobiography&quot; of the Vampire Pandora, who has appeared in &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; as a minor character, is a fascinating look at the life of a woman in ancient Rome. It bears some stylistic similarities, and some similarities of plot and character, to the &quot;Cynthia, Witch of Syracuse&quot; stories of Dorothy J. Heydt that appear in Marion Zimmer Bradley's &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; series, but it is hardly derivative. There are also some similarities between the character of Pandora and that of Olivia, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's vampiric &quot;childe&quot; of Saint Germain. This book is delightfully well-written, and is a pleasure to read on many levels: powerfully moving story, interesting historical perspective, compelling philosophical insights, and fascinating characters. One of Anne Rice's best-written vampire novels.	2004-01-04

Not perfect; there are a couple of ways in which the characters seem a bit out of character (Sisko has a mild phobia of insects, which I don't believe we've ever seen elsewhere, and Dax demonstrates a level of discomfort with her femininity (having until recently beeen Curzon Dax, a male) that we certainly haven't seen elsewhere; a couple of attempts at character development that were good tries, but ring false.) But other than that, the characters are well-handled, and the plot is a good one. The writing itself is good, so this book is definitely recommended.	2004-01-01

First off, one thing needs to be made clear: in rating this play a mere &quot;2 stars&quot;, I'm rating it as opposed to other Shakespearean plays; if rated against the general run of books available, it would be at least three stars, maybe four.<br />The problem is, there are some very good things to be said about this story, but also some very bad things. A modern reader almost certainly takes a very different message from the story than one in Shakespeare's time, when it was perfectly acceptable to stereotype Jews as venal moneylenders, and when forcing a Jew to convert to Christianity at the end of the play could be considered to be in keeping with the &quot;happy ending for all&quot; required of comedies at the time.<br />Granted, Shylock is not a particularly attractive character, so it is difficult to feel much sympathy for him, but as difficult as it is to make him sympathetic, Shakespeare (apparently unintentionally) manages. The man is not only cheated out of his (contractually due) spiteful revenge, but is not even allowed to accept a lesser payment once it is made apparent that he dare not hold Antonio to his word. He loses his daughter; she not only runs away but steals from him in the process, and yet he is not even allowed to disinherit her. And, of course, he's forced to convert to the religion of the people who did all of this to him. He may have been unappealing, but not enough to deserve all of THAT.<br />Further, although Antonio is shown as being generous and brave enough to accept his fate when he thought it was unavoidable, he is a fool for allowing himself to be in that position to start with, and is all too quick to allow Shylock to be cheated of ANY recompense once he's given leave to do so. A TRUE hero would have INSISTED on paying the man his principle and more once let off the hook for his life, even when the &quot;judge&quot; ruled that Shylock had refused any payment other than his bond.<br />In spite of all of this, the play is not unenjoyable, and is as well-written as one expects from Shakespeare, with some interesting plot twists and some good lines (ironically, some of the best being given to Shylock, making it clear that Shakespeare wasn't COMPLETELY unaware of the humanity of the character). The language is also somewhat less obscure to the modern reader than in some of Shakespeare's work, especially his comedies.<br />Definitely worth reading, but be forewarned that the attitude toward Shylock (and to a lesser extent, toward his daughter) will be downright offensive to most in the modern audience.enjoyable, and is as well-written as one expects from Shakespeare, with some interesting plot twists and some good lines (ironically, some of the best being given to Shylock, making it clear that Shakespeare wasn't COMPLETELY unaware of the humanity of the character).

As with the previous three books in the series, this book is a tremendously fun read, mostly because the character of Anita Blake is one of the best characters in fiction since Randall P. McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;. The background world, the other characters, the plots and such are all okay, but nothing particularly out of the ordinary. It is Anita that makes this series work, and boy, does she.<br />This book was at least as good as the first three in the series, although I suspect that some fans will feel that it spent too much time (that is to say, any) on the soap opera that Anita's personal life is becoming, at the expense of the cover-to-cover action that we've come to expect. Others, myself included, will find the closer look at previously unexplored aspects of Anita's character fascinating, and will point out that there is no shortage of action here.<br />Although this is book four of the series, and I have read the previous three, I have the impression that one could read this book without having read the others without being hopelessly confused. Hard to say, though. Probably best to start with &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; and be safe.	2003-12-25

It was a borderline call whether to give this novel four or five stars; I felt that the ending was a tad too pat to really live up to the buildup, but other than that, the novel was marvellous, and the basic premise was good enough, and well-enough handled, to make up for that minor flaw. Also, this is definitely a novel for the reader who does not demand action; this was frequently true in Next Generation stories, and is definitely true here. Not a flaw in my book, but it definitely will be in that of some readers, so if you're looking for a book with a good action plot, be aware that this isn't it.	2003-12-11

There is very little here to set this play apart from the rest of Shakespeare's comedies, other than, perhaps, the fact that it has more of the usual comedic plot devices than usual. There is the cross-dressing woman who is fallen in love with by another woman, there are the twins separated, there are the usual litany of star-crossed lovers each in love with someone who doesn't requite their love (until, of course, the end; this being a comedy, everything must come out all right in the end.) All told, about the only memorable line from this play is \\"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them.\\"<br />A perfectly amusing bit of Shakespearean fluff, but there is little to recommend this play that wouldn't likewise recommend almost any of Shakespeare's comedies.	2003-12-04

I knocked the rating down to four stars only because the entire section dealing with Pike and Deena was neither especially interesting, nor germane to the story (although it WAS still well-written). Otherwise, the book is virtually flawless.	2003-11-29

Mark Twain is arguably the best storyteller in American history, and this story is one of his most endearing tales. Unlike \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", it has no claim on the title of \\"THE great All-American Novel\\", because it is not set in America, or even at a time in which America existed as an entity; at the time of this novel's setting, the American colonies were only beginning to be settled. It is, however, both one of the most moving of Twain's novels, and one of the most enjoyable.<br />Given the quality of some books that I have rated at five stars in the past, I'd have to say that if it were allowed, this book would be rated at seven stars out of five. There are few books that I enjoy rereading more than this one.	2003-11-21

Or fourteenth, if you count &quot;Out of the House of Life&quot;, a spinoff novel primarily about the character of Madeline de Montalia, a vampiric &quot;childe&quot; of Saint Germain, but also including some flashback scenes featuring an early Saint Germain.<br />Or seventeenth, if you also include &quot;A Flame In Byzantium&quot;, &quot;Crusader's Torch&quot;, and &quot;A Candle For d'Artagnan&quot;, a spinoff series about Olivia Atta Clemens, an earlier offspring.<br />Throughout the series, the best part of these novels is the character of the count Saint-Germain himself; he is an unmitigated hero, not the anti-hero that one usually sees in vampire novels, and that's a fascinating change of pace. He always explains that he wasn't always the urbane, elegant, even-tempered, kind and sensitive individual that he is now; four thousand years ago, when he became a vampire, he was a typical ravening beast, but he outgrew it. This is a marvellous and original perspective on vampirism, and a delightfully optimistic outlook on humanity: that given sufficient time, ANYBODY can grow up, even a bloodthirsty creature of the night.<br />As a result, what we have in this series is a series of historical novels, set at various points along the very long time-line of Saint Germain's life. We generally see very little of other vampires, other than occasionally seeing those who Saint Germain has made vampires in previous books. (Generally, we see even these only in their correspondence with Saint Germain; I cannot remember any book in which we see more of them than this except for &quot;Tempting Fate&quot;, in which we see quite a bit of Madeline de Montalia, and one short story in the collection &quot;The Chronicles of Saint Germain&quot;, in which we see the count in conflict with a more traditionally minded vampire.) This book is the exception to that rule, as well as the rule that each book covers a &quot;point&quot; on his time-line. This book is told in three sections, each a separate point of its own: one in the seventh century, one in the eighth, and one in the twelfth. This divergence from form is necessary in order to show the fact that interactions between vampires are by necessity very long-term things. The main conflict in this book is between Saint Germain and a woman who he makes into a vampire early in the book, and who refuses to accept him as a mentor on how to manage her new life and the powers that go with it.<br />This was an interesting change of pace, but resulted in a novel that was long on sub-plots, but had less primary plot than it might have. In addition, it made it difficult to see Saint Germain interacting with mortals as one normally would, because by definition, none of the mortals survived more than a third of the book. We did see interations, but there wasn't time to develop them as there normally would be, and that left them feeling rushed. Still, the loss of that aspect of the books was easily compensated for by the novelty of seeing other vampires, vampires who acted as vampires are expected to, for a change.<br />Not one of the best in the series, but far from the worst.separate point of its own: one in the seventh century, one in the eighth, and one in the twelfth.

Particularly given that this story was written very early in the run of the \\"Voyager\\" series, making characterization that will ring true to those who've followed the series much longer difficult, and that it involves time-travel, a very difficult concept to do well, it is amazing how well-written this story is. The characterizations feel spot-on, (except for the fact that the EMH is consistently referred to as \\"Dr. Zimmerman\\", which is the name of his creator, but not one that was ever used for the EMH himself during the entire run of the show, a very minor quibble) rare in novels written early in the run of a series, and there are only minor glitches in the time-travel concepts, which are handled much better than is usual in stories that attempt to deal with the paradoxes inherent in time-travel. I found the time-travel aspects reminiscent of Poul Anderson's \\"Time Patrol\\" series.	2003-11-05

This is easily the worst novel by Peter David I've ever read. He is generally a fine author, particularly of Star Trek novels (which is where I am familiar with his work, for the most part.) In this &quot;New Frontier&quot; series, generally, the only complaint that I've had has been the &quot;to be continued&quot; non-endings. This book continues that tradition, but I can't really complain, considering that there isn't really any plot to be continued; I've never objected to sub-plots being continued from one book to the next, and sub-plots are all this book has. Further, it seems a bit much when things as major as the destruction of the Excalibur and the apparent death of Captain Calhoun happen &quot;offscreen&quot;; book #8 ended with the teaser the the ship was going to blow up in five minutes; this book begins with the command crew, minus Captain Calhoun, gathering for a &quot;Requiem&quot; weeks later. I thought at first that perhaps the book was being told in flashback mode, and we'd eventually be clued in on what happened, but that never happened. I'm left to assume that there was another story, not part of the numbered sequence, which details the destruction of the ship, but nowhere in the book that I can find (certainly not on the back cover blurb, or anywhere in the text of the story) are we told what book that might be, what book this is a sequel to. It's not the &quot;New Frontier&quot; entry in the &quot;Gateways&quot; series; that book was written the year after this one was, and clearly happens after this one does. Sloppy.<br />What's worse, the sub-plots themselves aren't really up to David's usual standards; both Soleta and McHenry seem oddly out of character. Granted, the actual writing itself is still managed with a fairly deft touch; David is still capable of crafting a compelling story. But this book just seemed sloppy on a number a levels. I got the impression that David had gotten bored with the direction he'd been taking his characters, and decided to play games with them for amusement, much the way &quot;Q&quot; (who puts in a cameo here, by the way) would play games with lesser beings just because he could.ecided to play games with them for amusement, much the way &quot;Q&quot; (who puts in a cameo here, by the way) would play games with lesser beings just because he could.	2003-11-02

If you enjoy the detective (\\"noir\\") genre, and want some erotica that fits that category, AND if you find the kind of VERY harsh, dark sexuality that seems to fit that genre erotic, then you will probably enjoy this book tremendously. The writing is mostly very good, and the stories seem to be a good batch of examples of the genre.<br />I've never really been a fan of \\"noir\\" fiction; I own a copy of the video of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", and consider it money well-spent, but it isn't a genre that I go out of my way looking for. And much of the sado-masochistic, pain-as-pleasure, dark-side-of-the-id sex that is the mainstay of most of these stories makes me wince and wilt, rather than get aroused. So most of these stories didn't do much for me; \\"Private Dick\\", by Sukie de la Croix, a spoof of the genre in which the title character was, and indeed almost every male character in the story were, stereotypical flaming queers, was hysterically funny. \\"A Walk In The Rain On The Wild Side\\", by O'Neil De Noux, was easily the most erotic story in the book, at least to my taste. Unfortunately, it was also the most sloppily written. \\"The Gyrl With No Name\\" (Kate Bornstein), \\"Phantom Lover\\" (Maxim Jakubowski), and \\"Inside The Works\\" (Tom Piccirilli) were painfully edgy, but fascinating for all of that. Most of the others just didn't make much of an impression on me, although \\"Faithful\\" by Michael Thomas Ford had an interesting plot-twist that I just didn't see coming, and so was memorable for that reason if no other.<br />If, like me, you're tempted to pick this book up simply out of curiosity, and not because your tastes actually run to this sort of thing, I would advise against it. But if you actually are drawn to this book because this sort of thing is of interest to you, it won't be easy to find a better-executed example of what this book provides.	2003-11-01

I'm not generally a fan of the detective, or &quot;noir&quot; genre. So I find it a continually pleasant surprise that I am as fond of the character of Anita Blake as I am; she is, in many ways, typical of the &quot;tough as nails Private Investigator&quot; character. (Except, of course, that she is 5'3&quot; tall, weighs maybe 110 pounds, and is female. Oh, yeah, and she can animate corpses into zombies and make them obey her; other than that, she's typical.)<br />This is the second book of the series; I had previously read the first and the third (long story). This book is a bit better than the first, and much better than the third, but the difference is in the internal plausibility of the plot, and in characterization of the villains. Anita is just as much fun in the others as she is here, which is quite a bit, and the writing style is the same (narrative from Anita's point of view, in her voice.)<br />Word of warning: do not read this book (or any book in this series) if you have a weak stomach, or are easily nauseated. There are graphic descriptions of all-too-realistic crime scenes, scenes in which Anita, as a consultant for the police, is forced to examine the scenes of gruesome murders.

This book is well-written, with characters handled well and a plot that moves well, with a writing style that is very enjoyable to read and few sloppy errors.<br />Unfortuantely, there are two major problems with it: one is that I find the basic concept to the \\"Lost Years\\" stories somewhat dubious; if, during the time between the end of the five-year mission and the first movie, there continued to be major, exciting things going on involving Kirk, it seems doubtful that he would have become the bored and boring paper-pusher who was so desperate to get out of his admiral's office and back into a captain's chair. It seems far more likely that nothing of note happened during those years, which is WHY he became so dissatisfied. So for that reason, among others, I find that I have difficulty accepting the story here (and in its predecessor, \\"The Lost Years\\") to be canonical.<br />Secondly, there is a related issue: it may satisfy the curious to read stories told about the \\"Lost Years\\", and it has some of the same morbid fascination as watching a train wreck, but it really isn't my idea of entertainment to read stories about the years during which Kirk became a boring and bored pencil-pusher. It is enough to know that this HAPPENED, and that that explains why he would actively pursue a demotion in order to regain command of a ship later. This was an effective cautionary tale about the dangers of the Peter Principle, accepting promotions to your level of incompetence, but it seems to me it worked better as an off-screen, behind-the-scenes story. It loses some of its effect when examined closely.	2003-10-25

Some readers of Star Trek fiction might find the lack of action in this story objectionable; I'm not one of them. It is a fascinating story about the Enterprise crew doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing: exploring and making first contact with new races. I dock it one star mostly for the rather tiresome and pointless subplot involving Wesley Crusher and two of his peers; the less I see of Wesley, the happier I am, but other than that, this story was nearly flawless.	2003-10-20

When I rate this at four stars, I'm rating it against other Shakespearean plays; against the general run of literary work, it would certainly rate five. I dock it one star simply because I find the concept, which seems to be accepted as a given in the play, that if a man finds that the woman he loves is cheating on him, it's okay to kill her, and that it's only a bad idea because he might be mistaken, to be, shall we say, a less than enthralling idea which I hate to see perpetuated.<br />Some other random comments on the work, in no particular order:<br />1) The racial angle is exaggerated. Yes, Othello is black, and there are a few racial epithets thrown around by his detractors, but really, there is less sign of racism inherent in the characters of this play than one might expect in your average modern person. The main point to making Othello black was to make him an outsider; the play could as easily have been set in England, and Othello made French. (But then, since the target audience was English, they'd have been more likely to get defensive about the portrayal of their prejudices as unreasonable.)<br />2) The main point of the play is not the evils of racism, but the evils of jealousy.<br />3) Iago is unquestionably the &quot;best&quot; villain in all of Shakespeare, and one of the best in all of literature, in terms of being a well-portrayed &quot;subtle&quot; villain. It's rare to see a portrayal of a lying, manipulative scoundrel that is actually plausible and successful; usually, the audience finds itself having a hard time believing that the manipulator's victims could possibly be so dumb as to not see through him; certainly, there's a large dollop of that sentiment in &quot;Richard III&quot;. But in this play, Iago's lies are remarkably plausible, and it is very easy to see how he is successful in his plan; his machinations were excellently managed.	2003-10-17

This is unfortunate, because her strengths as a writer lie in her ability to create interesting plots and characters, abilities which do not come into play when novelizing someone else's story. Granted, she is also good at pacing and the building of tension, which DO come into play here, as does her ability to make characters come to life, if not as much as it would were she writing her own story.<br />Her weakness, unfortunately, is in her nuts-and-bolts use of the language. She tries desperately to make creative and original use of the language; generally, all she manages is to distract the reader by misusing  words clumsily. This isn't ALWAYS the case; there were very few examples of misused words in &quot;Ship of the Line&quot; and &quot;Day of Honor, Part 1&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;The Search&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot; were practically unreadable due to the frequency with which she butchered the language.<br />This book falls about midway between her two extremes; nowhere near as bad as &quot;The Search&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot;, but nowhere near as good as the previously mentioned books. Better than &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot;, but not as good as &quot;Battlestations&quot; or &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, it is probably closest in quality to &quot;Flashback&quot;, although the writing is not quite as good as the writing there.<br />Which is a real shame, because this is perhaps THE best story in the Star Trek franchise, certainly in the top ten. It deserved better than the mediocre handling it received here; it seems to me that, even ignoring Diane Carey's weird use of language, the story was much better fitted to Peter David's style, and would have worked much better if he'd been the one writing the novelization.	2003-10-13

Some readers will doubtless feel that there is too much focus on action and combat in this story; again, if the trilogy is read as one long story, this is the climactic action scene; as such, it can't help but be combat-heavy.

This is unfortunate, because her strengths as a writer (and yes, she has some) lie in her ability to create interesting plots and characters, her pacing, and other details of the creative craft, all mostly already done in a novelization of someone else's story; granted, her ability to create tension comes into play, as does her pacing (a related skill) and her ability to make her characters come to life is not without use, although it doesn't get as much use as it would if she were free to characterize without the frame provided by the pre-digested story.<br />Her weakness, unfortunately, is in the nuts-and-bolts use of the language; she tries desperately to make creative and original use of words; all she manages in most cases, unfortunately, is to make incorrect and distracting use of the language. This isn't ALWAYS the case; there were very few examples of this in \\"Ship Of The Line\\" and \\"Day of Honor, Part 1\\". Other books, such as her novelizations of \\"The Search\\" and \\"Descent\\", were virtually unreadable due to the frequency with which she butchered the language unmercifully. This book isn't quite as bad as those (in spite of the fact that it starts poorly, with THREE silly word choices on the first page) but it is much closer to that level than to the level of her better work. (To give examples of what I'm referring to, I'll cite the three from the first page: she uses the non-word \\"unassuring\\" where she intends \\"not reassuring\\", as in \\"Phaser rifles. Lightweight, efficient, somehow unassuring at the moment.\\" Later, she describes Sisko's skin as \\"resined\\" with sweat, presumably trying to capture the visual effect of resin beading (rather than simply saying the traditional and therefore \\"uncreative\\" \\"beaded\\"). Unfortunately, the property of resin that comes immediately to the reader's mind is not that it beads, but that it makes things sticky; if Sisko's sweat makes his face sticky, he is, shall we say, somewhat unusual. Then, in the same sentence, she refers to his attitude as \\"charred\\"; I'm not entirely certain WHAT she means by that, but I assume it has something to do with his patience being burned away by the frustration he's been experiencing. In any case, descriptive words that leave the reader more puzzled as to what was described than they would have been without them are poorly chosen words, and further, words that are SO creatively used as to jolt the reader's attention away from the story that he's attempting to immerse himself in are likewise poor writing.<br />The story itself is a fine one, one of the best of the DS9 stories; it's the one in which Worf moves from the Enterprise to DS9.

As with the first book of the \\"Captain's Table\\" series, this is a frame story. The story within the frame is a story about Jean-Luc Picard, told \\"in his own words\\", and is an excellent story. The outer framework of the story involves his arriving at the mysterious bar, \\"The Captain's Table\\", meeting some fellow captains, and being persuaded to tell his story. \\"The Captain's Table\\" is sort of a cross between \\"Callahan's Crosstime Saloon\\" and the cantina in the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie. It's an interesting concept, but I honestly don't think that it works for the Star Trek universe.

Or more to the point, seeing something that isn't there. It seemed to me that there were some references in this book to events that happened on the Excalibur that I haven't seen, in spite of having read all seven of the previous entries in the series; Shelby refers back to &quot;when Riker was in command&quot; in a way that I thought meant &quot;in command of the Excalibur&quot;, rather than referring back to &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode that introduced us to Shelby, but I could have been mistaken on that one; unfortunately, it also seemed to me that the relationship between Xyon and Kalinda was more advanced than it had been when last I'd seen them. (But again, it's been a couple of months since I read book seven, so maybe I'm misremembering.) In any case, I find that there IS a book that came out in the same year that this one did (1999) that involves Calhoun, and presumably the Excalibur: &quot;TNG#55, Double Helix #5&quot;. So maybe that's where the intermediate events take place, if in fact there ARE any intermediate events, and I'm not just imagining things. If so, I'm annoyed, because I hadn't planned to read that book any time soon; I'm only up to #18 in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; series.<br />But since none of the other reviewers seem to have noticed this discontinuity, it may well be that I'm imagining things.<br />On its own merits, this is quite a good book; as usual, Peter David manages a fine balance between drama, action, and humor. And if some of the drama has something of a silly tone to it (the &quot;villain&quot; is, essentially, a swarm of interstellar locusts) this isn't really out of character for a Star Trek story; it has been justly compared (by David himself, in the text of the story, among others) to the original series episode &quot;The Immunity Syndrome&quot;, which features a giant, spacegoing, world-devouring amoeba.<br />Not his best, but about par for Peter David.	2003-09-24

This book didn't seem to me to find that balance as well as others of his that I've read; the humor seemed more heavy-handed, the plot sillier and less worthwhile. It finished better than it started, but on balance I didn't feel like I was reading a real Star Trek story with a bit of humor to it; I felt as though I was reading a comedy with the gloss of a Star Trek story superimposed on it.<br />Still not a bad book; just not nearly as good as I expect from Peter David.	2003-09-21

Still, I must say that this book does a marvellous job of parodying the James Bond novels, something that's hard to do considering that the originals are so close to self-parody. How often can one claim, in all honesty, that the characters in a parody are better-developed and less cardboard than those in the original? One can here; granted, the peripheral characters, like Agents Pumpernickel and 008 and Chief \\"N\\" are two-dimensional, but not really any more so than typical characters in a James Bond novel, while Jane and her friend Simon are significantly better-rounded than anyone likely to appear in those books. And while names like \\"Pumpernickel\\" and \\"Tupenny\\" seem like sufficiently silly names to qualify for parody, are they really any sillier than \\"Moneypenny\\"? (To say nothing of names from the movies, like \\"Pussy Galore\\"; I don't know whether that one made it into the book, since I've never read the book version of \\"Goldfinger\\".)

In this book, although the characterizations are not too far off the mark from those established for the characters, much is sacrificed in order to fit the classic murder mystery plot. One must accept, for instance, that it is possible to fire a phaser on board the Enterprise without the computer being immediately aware of the occurrence, and signalling security; that it is, in fact, possible for a member of the ship's complement to replicate a loaded phaser without clearance or any record of the transaction; that there is no high-tech way to establish the identity of the person who fired the phaser, or even whether a particular phaser was the one fired at a particular time, and many other very dubious propositions.<br />Still, the book is well-written, and if you enjoy detective and mystery fiction as well as Star Trek-style space opera, it should provide an enjoyable read. It uses a very Agatha Christie-esque method of maintaining suspense and uncertainty as to the question of &quot;whodunit&quot; by making almost all of the non-regular characters behave suspiciously at one point or another.<br />Not really my style, but well done if you like that sort of thing.	2003-09-07

There were a couple of new twists, such as a sympathetic look at a Cardassian, and we were missing the requisite appearance by the Prophets, but for the most part, there was nothing really new here.<br />Still, the writing was good enough to overcome that, at least for the most part.

This book finds him in India around 1400, during the time of the depradations of the man known in the west as Tamerlane (Timur-i locally). Saint Germain is not the antihero or sympathetic villain found in much of vampire literature, such as Lestat in the Anne Rice books; he is a legitimate hero; occasionally, he will make mention of the fact that when he first became a vampire, he was a more traditionally minded vampire, but has learned in his long life to avoid such rampages and bloodshed, as he has learned how to overcome many of the limitations of vampirism. In 4000 years (3400 at the time of this book) he has actually become one of the most civilized beings one could imagine.<br />A fine historical novel, one of the best of a fine series.a fine series.	2003-08-31

There's way too much focus on Wesley (if you're actually a fan of that character, you might be able to justify bumping my rating all the way up to &quot;three&quot;, but even so, the story is weak), and way too much of the overused concept of a holodeck program gone berserk to provide the conflict. In addition, the characterizations are inconsistent; Picard is far too tolerant of Wesley given his alleged aversion to children, and we never do get an answer to the question of whether &quot;Eric Baldwin&quot; is a dashing hero having a rare lapse of nerve, or an overblown windbag riding his self-created reputation (ala &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart&quot; from the Harry Potter books, who the character reminded me of). Nor do we see any real justification for his breakdown, nor any real explanation of how Counsellor Troi managed to settle him down. The character was completely inconsistent, but not in a way that made him feel real and &quot;human&quot;, but rather in a way that made him feel entirely cardboard.<br />I've read worse &quot;Star Trek&quot; books, but most of them were very early &quot;Original Series&quot; efforts (&quot;Spock Messiah&quot;, &quot;Spock Must Die&quot;, &quot;Triangle&quot;, &quot;Killing Time&quot;, &quot;The Prometheus Design&quot;, and &quot;Black Fire&quot;, to name a few).

Was FDR one of the four or five greatest American presidents, a man who worked tirelessly to alleviate the suffering caused by the Great Depression and who was instrumental in our victory in WWII, or was he a conniving manipulator who took unfair advantage of the fact that the depression started during his predecessor's term, and played politics with the suffering of millions in order to consolidate his and his party's power base, at the cost of establishing an entitlement culture that is even now, 60 years later, still sapping the vitality from the great American tradition of self-reliance?<br />If you have an opinion on the answer to this question going into this book, your answer will determine your opinion of the book, for the book is unquestionably (and unsurprisingly; biographers only rarely take the time to study and write about a subject they dislike) pro-Roosevelt. If you had no idea that such a question existed, this book certainly won't make you aware of it, and you may well find it a very valuable and informative biography. But if you, like me, were aware that the question existed and were undecided on the answer to it coming in, this book gives very little information to help resolve the debate, because it is so unshakably favorable that it discounts, rather than attempting to refute, the arguments defending an anti-Roosevelt viewpoint. As such, it is virtually impossible to judge, based on the information given here, the value of the man, because the information is simply not produced dispassionately enough.	2003-08-27

But he gives sufficient information that it is possible, and in fact not at all difficult, for the reader to come to his own conclusions about the subject. That is the key to a balanced biography, and balance is one of the keys to a quality biography. Further, this book is quite readable, with occasional anecdotes relating some of the various humorous stories poking fun at Coolidge's not undeserved reputation for taciturnity, while at the same time demonstrating through other anecdotes that the reputation, while not undeserved, was exaggerated.<br />An excellent biography of a president most know little if anything about.	2003-08-20

These are minor quibbles, but still annoying, and when added to the fact that the book suffers from a mild case of &quot;middle-book-itis&quot;, the bane of second books in trilogies, it keeps it from being rated quite so highly as the first. Still, it is an enjoyable read, and the characterization, plot, dialogue, and pacing are all quite good.	2003-08-15

This play is tremendously fun, one of the most enjoyable of Shakespeare's plays, (and one of the easiest to read for a modern reader) but like most of his romances, it demonstrates a roughly sixth-grade understanding of romantic love. At least in a comedy, there's some excuse for this, and it's a tradition that certainly hasn't changed in over 400 years (see: &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;, for example) but in general, the characters in this play have about the depth and plausibility of, say, the Three Stooges.<br />Read this play if you're in the mood for lighthearted Shakespearean fluff, but not if you want something with some real meaning to it. This was, in Shakespeare's time, the equivalent of &quot;Three's Company&quot; or &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;. Light entertainment for the masses, not serious literature.	2003-08-12

My head says that this is a very well-written, high quality Star Trek book, a definite five-star rating.<br />It took well over half the book before it even began to really grab my interest in spite of this; I honestly don't know what was missing, but I found it very difficult to get involved with the story.<br />Similarly, the romantic interest for Kirk should have been a very moving one; the woman was not his usual casual romance, gorgeous (if you like big hair) and possibly (but not necessarily) intelligent, but certainly not a very strong or interesting person. This woman was more the Edith Keeler type, less than stunning physically, but someone with whom Kirk could really connect.<br />It just didn't work for me, and I can't figure out why.<br />So my head insists that this book was, technically, too well-written to be less than a five-star rating; my gut says, &quot;Nah, it was mediocre; give it three stars.&quot; So I compromise. And, as with all good compromises, neither side is satisfied.	2003-08-06

The skillful writing that men do lives after them; the sloppy is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Shakespeare. The great Shakespeare hath told you that Brutus, an honorable man and a friend to Caesar, did conspire in his death: if it were so, it were a difficult thing to imagine, and one would think that a writer would carefully set out the reasons for an action so contradictory to a character's defined nature. Shakespeare gives us only the bare bones of a reason, without providing nearly the developement of this difficult decision that a lesser writer would need to show his character undergoing in order to come to such a decision. But Shakespeare is a great writer, and therefore need not trouble himself with trivialities such as logical development of character, but need only give the reader a general idea of why his characters behave as they do, and the reader will supply the rest from his own imagination, for to do otherwise would be to criticize Shakespeare, and Shakespeare is a great writer. Shakespeare says that Brutus was an honorable man; not only do all his characters say it, but in every way other than the conspiring in Caesar's death, the character shows it by his actions. What would compel an honorable man to take such an action? Shakespeare suggests that it is because he believes it to be for the good of Rome, because Caesar is too ambitious, but he gives us none of the evidence that would convince Brutus of the truth of such a charge. But Shakespeare is a great writer. He hath written many memorable plays, filled with many memorable lines, and surely this is one of them. Yet Marc Anthony, too, is somewhat inconsistent as a character; mostly, he seems an excellent hero, clever enough to give Caesar his due without directly speaking ill of the conspirators, and on the winning and therefore right side in the following civil war. Yet the job he does of inciting the crowd leads to the death of Cinna the poet, and presumably other innocents as well, and he cheerfully and without a moment's thought agrees to the execution of his nephew Publius, apparently as a mere bargaining chit to convince Lepidus to consent to the death of his brother. All on their list were condemned without trial or defense, an action that seems harsh and cruel. But Anthony is a hero, and Shakespeare is a great writer. Anyone who would criticize Shakespeare's handling of his characters must surely be a churl or an illiterate fool, and I have no desire to be listed among such a crowd. The writing of great writers does not have flaws, at least none that can be detected by mere mortals. Let none tell you otherwise: this play is flawless, and Shakespeare is a great writer.of Cinna the poet, and presumably other innocents as well, and he cheerfully and without a moment's thought agrees to the execution of his nephew Publius, apparently as a mere bargaining chit to convince Lepidus to consent to the death of his brother.

This is Molly Ivins' earliest book, a collection of many of her earliest columns, originally printed in such places as &quot;Ms. Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, and &quot;McCalls&quot;. Those of you who have only seen her more recent work may not have realized that she used to be funny; this collection should remedy that situation. It's been years since I've seen a column by Ms. Ivins (who is syndicated weekly in my local newspaper) that earned even a chuckle from me; she's still frequently very insightful, even if I do disagree with her periodically, but she seems to have lost her sense of humor somewhere along the line. This book was my first exposure to her, and is the reason that I continue to at least skim her columns every time: I know what she's capable of. I just wish she'd go back to the style that she used in the columns collected here, rather than the perfectly standard, polite, &quot;civilized&quot; style that she seems to practice these days.	2003-07-29

But like in those stories, it comes close enough that one can't really accuse the teaser of lying, either.<br />As with the character in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; who claims to have been turned into a newt, &quot;It got better.&quot;<br />It was obvious early on where this story was going, and basically, what was going to happen. Clearly, we had an author with an interesting thought: how heroically would our heroes face death? And he found a way to explore that question without making any irrevocable changes; not an easy thing to do. I've never been a fan of stories in which nothing that happens matters, because it's all undone eventually. But in this case, the plot device was handled well enough that I have to accept it; a book this well-written has to be rated at five stars, regardless of whether I approve of the concept. The plot device was actually well enough thought out to be made plausible, the characterizations were spot-on, and the action was intense.<br />Not for the faint of heart, but a superb story for those who read Star Trek for the action.	2003-07-28

I've been fascinated by Adams ever since seeing the movie &quot;1776&quot;, which gives a marvellous &quot;based on fact&quot; dramatization of the writing and signing of the Declaration of Independence, and this book gave me a more thorough, more strictly factual look at the man. I wasn't disappointed on that score; he's just as interesting without the dramatic liberties taken by the movie.<br />My only quibble with this book is that the editing, at least in the edition that I have, is rather poor. There are numerous errors in grammatical structure and word choice, the kind of errors that I have become accustomed to in mass market paperbacks but refuse to accept in a scholarly historical work. Things like &quot;he requested that the Congress name his successor be named in his place&quot; and &quot;...the British ... was ready&quot; and &quot;the New England sates&quot; (rather than &quot;States&quot;) and &quot;the House of Representative&quot; (even back then, there was more than one representative in the House) and &quot;the dreary weather proved not be a herald of the months ahead&quot; and many others. I understand that mistakes happen, and don't demand perfection. But there are just too many of this kind of error in this book for me to say that it is well-written; probably two dozen, if I had to guess.<br />Overall, this is a worthwhile biography of a fascinating president. Hopefully, future editions will clean up the writing a bit more.	2003-07-27

This book probably should rate a bit higher than three stars, but four would definitely be too high for it; it is a gripping action-adventure novel, with good characterization and an interesting plot, but it is really nothing out of the ordinary as Trek novels go (although it WAS nice to see a more in-depth look at Lt. Malcolm Reed, who is usually just a background character.)<br />On the down side, this is one of those novels that prominently contains a mystery that the reader sees coming by no later than chapter four, but that the characters just can't imagine the solution to until the very end. At least in this case it isn't because the characters are being portrayed as dolts, but simply because this sort of thing is not something one would expect in real life, but any reader of fantasy or science fiction knows that in a fictional story, it is very possible; still, even if their relative lack of speed on the uptake is not unreasonable, it still makes the story very frustrating for the reader.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, but I can't say that there was anything particularly spectacular about it that would make it stand out in the crowd of Star Trek books, other than the fact that it is (at this point) one of very few &quot;Enterprise&quot; novels. If you enjoy the show, or would like a good introduction to it, this book is certainly worth the read, as it is if you simply want a good, action-packed Star Trek novel. But if you want more than that, this isn't the book for you.	2003-07-26

I have never been a fan of Klingons, or their claims to honor. I have never been a fan of subplots in holosuites. I have never been a fan of the writing of Diane Carey.<br />So imagine my surprise when I say, this is not only (by far) the best-written novel by Diane Carey that I have ever read (she only got over-cute with her word choice twice in the entire book; usually, she ruins the effect of her otherwise acceptable writing by trying desperately for &quot;clever&quot; and managing only &quot;wrong&quot;, every few pages) but may well be the absolute best Star Trek story I've ever read, by any author, from any series; Worf was handled quite well, his claims that &quot;Klingons don't behave that way; it would be dishonorable&quot; are thoroughly debunked by the fact that the other Klingons do, indeed, behave &quot;that way&quot;; the holodeck subplot involving Picard and Alexander in a holoprogram set during the American Revolutionary War managed, in spite of my general dislike for the holodeck as a plot device, to be quite compelling, and the various dillemmas involving honor were most assuredly not stock situations, but involved a great deal of very careful work on the part of the author to make the ethical questions murky and challenging. The subplot in the holodeck had perhaps the best representation of the legitimate points of view of a loyal British soldier during the Revolution that I've ever seen, and the fact that the focus of that story was on an &quot;aristocratic redcoat&quot;, rather than a more standard &quot;valiant rebel&quot; was a marvellous concept.<br />I cannot say enough about how marvellous this book is.	2003-07-24

This book probably ought to rate three and a half stars; three seems a bit low, but four would definitely be too high.<br />The &quot;main&quot; plot, involving Kirk, the Klingons, and the apparent member of the Q continuum &quot;Weyland&quot;, is obviously simply a frame hastily put together to justify the basic concept of the book, which is to put Scotty, Sulu, and Chekov back in time at key points of their own ancestral histories; Chekov meets Stalin during WWII; Scotty meets Bonnie Prince Charlie during the rebellion, and Sulu is in Japan during the Samurai period (1600). The time travel concept was reasonably well handled (although the author missed a WONDERFUL opportunity by not additionally having McCoy set back in the American south during the Civil War; the others, particularly Chekov, got to confront some of the ugliness of their own romanticized heritage, and that would have been a doozy) but nothing spectacular. The writing in general is likewise competent but not outstanding.<br />A perfectly acceptably enjoyable read, but nothing more.	2003-07-17

Or thirteenth, if you count &quot;Out of the House of Life&quot;, which is primarily a spinoff novel about Madeline de Montalia (former lover and vampiric &quot;childe&quot; of Saint-Germain), but which does include some flashback scenes to some of Saint-Germain's early history.<br />Or sixteenth, if you also count &quot;A Flame in Byzantium&quot;, &quot;Crusader's Torch&quot;, and &quot;A Candle For d'Artagnan&quot;, the spinoff series about Atta Olivia Clemens, an earlier vampiric &quot;childe&quot;. This book is, after a fashion, a sequel to &quot;A Candle for d'Artagnan&quot;.<br />The book is set in seventeenth century Rome, 30 years after Olivia's death, and somewhat more than that after &quot;Mansions of Darkness&quot;. The plot and historical settings were interesting enough, if not Yarbro's best; the love interest, for a change, was neither traumatized, killed, nor psychotic, and even the secondary female character, who WAS traumatized and a bit difficult, was at least not completely psychotic. It was interesting to see, for a change, that the diligence of the church investigators actually worked to Saint-Germain's advantage.<br />The only real problem with this book was that the writing was inexcusably sloppy. I've long since accepted the fact that there are going to be errors in any mass-market paperback, and in spite of the fact that we pay &quot;quality paperback&quot; prices for the current run of Saint-Germain books, they are basically mass-market paperbacks in Sunday-Go-To-Meeting clothes. And Yarbro has always tended to be a tad on the sloppy side about her proofreading, but I can accept a typo or three per book without getting all worked up over it. But if there aren't two dozen sloppy errors in this book (including one in which she misspells her own main character's name, as &quot;Saint-German&quot;) (bottom line of page 363) I'll be astonished. Errors that an author of Ms. Yarbro's reputation shouldn't be making; things like &quot;The courts have long preferred the claims of relatives over that of servants...&quot; and &quot;The worker have left for the night&quot; and &quot;there had been stalls for nearly a hundred horses here, and was thought a smallish enterprise&quot; and &quot;Now there were stall for twenty&quot; (those last two being back-to-back) and &quot;A few worldly slights such as mine must be seem more amusing than dangerous&quot;.

First of all, this book is NOT for fans of Mr. Spock; for reasons of her own, the author writes him out of the story early on, and only brings him back for the epilogue.

If this concept is not to your liking, you may want to take a pass on this book.<br />Secondly, the plot is a bit contrived, as are some of the minor plot points. Still, the book is reasonably well-written, and by the end of the story had actually overcome its deficiencies to the extent that I could not say that I didn't find it an enjoyable read. As is not uncommon in mysteries, the main characters seemed unduly slow on the uptake in solving the puzzle, but I suppose that was neccessary to prevent the story from being over too quickly.<br />All in all, an enjoyable book, but one that doesn't bear too much scrutiny.

This book is a very good example of just how far good writing can take a mediocre concept. I was truly unimpressed with either of the plots in this book, yet found myself being drawn into it in spite of myself due to the excellence of the writing.<br /><br />I suppose it is unfair to actually say that the plots are BAD. They do not, however, resonate with me at all. The primary plot is a detective and mystery fiction plot in which Riker has to unravel a mystery on a planet where a friend of his has disappeared, allegedly after stealing a priceless artifact. I'm not universally opposed to detective fiction, but I generally find that they don't work overwell as Star Trek plots, and I certainly don't see Riker as a viable Sam Spade type. Further, this plot just seemed rather blase, and it truly required exceptionally adroit writing to get me to care about it. In a way, I never did, but in spite of that, I found it difficult to put the book down toward the end, so Friedman must have been doing something right.<br /><br />Furthermore, the secondary plot involved Data playing \\"major league\\" baseball on the holodeck, trying out a program that Riker had written for himself just before being called away on his mission. Again, I don't necessarily object to sports stories; one of my favorites is \\"If I Never Get Back\\", by Darryl Brock. But I don't much care for holdeck stories in general, even if they are merely subplots and not the major focus of the story, nor do I generally care for the \\"Data does something offbeat in an attempt to learn more about what it means to be human, and in the course of doing so, commits many amusingly silly faux-pas\\" type of story, of which this was certainly one. In fact, I generally don't believe that baseball and Star Trek mix well; it's one of the things that cause me to grit my teeth whenever it's brought into play in Deep Space Nine due to Ben Sisko's hobby. I certainly disliked the episode \\"Take Me Out To The Holodeck\\" about as much as I've disliked any Star Trek episode in any series.<br /><br />So imagine my confusion to discover that I was actually enjoying the scenes in that subplot also, in spite of the fact that Friedman's apparent knowledge of baseball is somewhat limited, and his claim that both Data and Geordi would have difficulty understanding the concept of a curveball somewhat dubious.(I realize that for years engineering types swore that it was an optical illusion, because it was physically impossible. But those days are ALREADY behind us; certainly, engineers from three or four hundred years in the future should have no difficulty with the concept. Nor do I believe that it would be all that difficult for Data to track the trajectory of a curveball and hit it soundly.)<br /><br />I find that I can't in good conscience give less that four stars to a book so well written as to be enjoyable and even captivating in spite of a basic concept that I simply can't see the point to, but neither can I give five stars to a book with such an unattractive concept. If you find the idea of mixing detective fiction AND spectator sports fiction with your Star Trek fascinating, you'll certainly love this book. If, as I did, you find either or both of these concepts seriously dubious, you might still like it.

This is the first book of a new series of Star Trek books, focusing on the \\"Starfleet Corps of Engineers\\", basically a group of troubleshooters who go in whenever there's a mechanical or alien technology problem that either can't be handled by a regular starship, or (more rarely) that COULD possibly have been handled by the regular starship, but there's actually enough time to call for specialists (usually, these things are sufficient crises that if the regular ship CAN handle them, they have to.)<br />This book was composed of four mid-length stories (longer than \\"short stories\\", but not novel-length) each written by a different author, which together follow a continuous time-line and thus more or less make up one book's worth of story. The writing is surprisingly even, given the different authors; the handoffs from each author to the next are seamless, and the writing itself is quite good. The characters are well-developed, a good mix of minor characters from various episodes on TV and new characters (although the first book begins with the Enterprise-E and crew for an introduction, and Geordi LaForge continues through the first three stories.) The plots, while not the MOST original I've ever seen, are good, workmanlike concepts, and the basic SCE concept is in many ways a marvellous return to early science fiction concepts, where there may be action and combat, but the ADVENTURE is in the discovery and the science.<br />So why is the rating only four stars, given how much good I have to say about the book? (And in fact, I thought harder about whether to knock it down to three than I did about granting it five.) Because the \\"ending\\" ISN'T one; they cut the last story off in mid-action in order to make a \\"tune in next week\\" cliffhanger to attempt to manipulate the reader into continuing to buy the following books of the series. I will do so, because I enjoyed the book as a whole, NOT because they left me hanging.

This play, for instance, would certainly rate five stars in a general rating.<br />As it is, this play can be read either of two ways, and depending on how one reads it, it's either one of Shakespeare's better comedies, or somewhere below mediocre. Naturally, I prefer to read it the way I like it better, and so rate it highly.<br />If, however, one reads the dialogue at face value, this is a play bearing many resemblances to my absolutely LEAST favorite of Shakespeare's plays: &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. It is a romantic comedy in which the main plot device is that two people who despise one another manage, in spite of that minor impediment, to fall in love. It has the saving grace that there is no hint of Benedick &quot;taming&quot; Beatrice; their idiocy is mutual and completely parallel, but I've always hated this particular plot, and continue to do so. The continuing popularity of it has contributed to an uncountable number of mismatches in real life, as people have been encouraged by their cultural mythology to believe that strong emotion equals attraction, even when it seems on the surface to be repulsion.<br />On the other hand, in this play it is very easy to read Beatrice and Benedick's lines, right from the beginning, as more bantering than bickering (although there ARE a couple of places where it is a bit difficult to do so) and as the playful teasing of two people who actually ENJOY each other's company for the challenge of the verbal byplay. If one reads it that way, the play makes a great deal more sense, and is actually quite enjoyable. (Plus, it has the advantage of the romance being between two grownups, rather than lovestruck teenagers, as in &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;.)	2003-06-12

There are, basically, three ways to write a book that ends with &quot;to be continued&quot;: One is to simply have a basic plotline that is larger than will fit in the page allotment for the book, and to stop before you're done. That was the method Peter David used in the first four books of this series; and I don't care for that method.<br />My preferred method is to have a complete story within the scope of each book, while various subplots from one book carry over into, and perhaps become the major focus of, later books. This is the method used by Peter David in books five and six of the series.<br />The third method is the one Peter David uses in this book, and while it isn't my preferred method, it is far preferable to the first method: to overshoot the ending of the story by a chapter, thus giving a teaser into the action for the next installment.<br />As with all of the books in this series, (and indeed, almost all Star Trek books by Peter David), this book has fascinating character development, a lively plot, and a good mix of drama and humor.	2003-06-09

This book started out with two strikes against it; it was part of a trilogy, and it focused on a Klingon. Given that I'm NOT one of the multitudes of Klingon fans among current Star Trek afficionados, and I HATE I HATE I HATE stories that end \\"to be continued\\" without finishing what they started, I had low expectations here.<br />So imagine my pleasant surprise when we actually had a story that finished one full plotline, and ended at a perfectly acceptable point, even if there was an overarching continuing subplot in the background, and one that dealt with the Klingon element in a way that could almost make me, a diehard Original-series, Klingons-are-stereotypical-bad-guys kind of guy, appreciate them.<br />There are several very large holes in the basic concept, that require a bit more suspension of disbelief than I can manage: the central character, Kell, aka Jon Anderson, is a Klingon infiltrator disguised as a human, much like the character in the episode \\"Trouble With Tribbles\\". He is surgically altered to \\"appear\\" human, even to the point of having his blood's color changed from lavender to red. But he won't be able to pass any examination from a doctor, as his internal anatomy is essentially unchanged and so he has to go to great lengths to avoid sickbay.<br />Now, how many ways is this silly? Can a person really expect to be assigned to a starship and NOT get a routine physical exam within 48 hours? Given that the answer to this question is \\"no\\", would the Klingons really be dumb enough to try this scam? And if this happened BEFORE \\"Trouble With Tribbles\\", and if Kell is eventually discovered (granted, he isn't by the end of this book) wouldn't that have caused the Federation to be more diligent in finding disguised Klingons, thus making it even less likely that THAT infiltrator could have succeeded as far as he did? On the other hand, if it happens AFTER that episode, wouldn't they be even more on guard here? All of this makes the main concept EXTREMELY dubious, but it's such a fun story that I'm at least mostly willing to give it a free ride on the issue. It would have been better, though, if it had been explained that the disguise was good enough to fool a routine physical, but a THOROUGH exam would reveal the deception. That would have been plausible, and have made the suspension of disbelief a LITTLE easier.bious, but it's such a fun story that I'm at least mostly willing to give it a free ride on the issue.

For instance, if this were to be rated against the general run of literature extant, it would certainly rate five stars. Even by the standard I'm using, it's close.<br />Like \\"Hamlet\\", this is a tragedy that still manages to have some very funny lines; as in \\"Hamlet\\", this is generally due to characters either pretending to be crazy, or truly being crazy, so it's something of a dark humor, but humorous it still is. Lear's jester has some great lines doing what only a jester could get away with (and what the reader wants to do): telling the King that he's an idiot when he's done something ignorant beyond belief. Edgar, son of Gloucester, banished by his father for supposed treason, plays the part of a mad beggar to save his life, and when Lear, honestly crazy from grief, meets up with him, their conversations rival anything in Hamlet for manic nonsense that still manages to make a certain warped and poigniant sense.<br />It's a shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare's time, so that the masses are unable to enjoy and appreciate his wit; his plays were not written to be enjoyed only by the literati; they were intended to entertain and, yes, enlighten the masses as well as the educated; his plots seem to be right in line with either modern romantic comedies (in his comedies) or modern soap operas (in his tragedies). Modern audiences would love him, if only they could understand him; unfortunately, when one \\"modernizes\\" the language in a Shakespearean play, what one is left with is no longer Shakespeare, but simply a modern adaptation. Which, if done well, is not without value, but is still far short of the original.	2003-06-04

This book manages to succeed with a basic plot device that I would have expected to be impossible: McCoy in command of the Enterprise.<br />Granted, it isn't entirely plausible that McCoy would be unable to release the bridge into the hands of a line officer when one became available, but getting him into the seat in the first place was actually finessed quite well, and the scenes in which he handles a crisis were good enough for me to be willing to suspend disbelief on that previous count. All in all, this book is notable for two things: giving us a marvellous look at McCoy handling unfamiliar responsibilities (like successfully bluffing a Klingon captain) wonderfully, and quite plausibly, and giving us (as Diane Duane frequently does) not one, not two, but THREE sentient alien species none of which is even moderately hominid.

In this book (when we aren't seeing her in flashback scenes as a feral child rescued and raised by Mr. Spock) we see her as an academy cadet.<br />The characterizations, plot, and writing in this book are all excellent.

Otherewise, it's definitely a mid-range Star Trek book; better than many, but not at all high on the list of Star Trek books to read.	2003-05-21

If you enjoy philosophy, this book is doubtless an excellent resource, including excerpts of the works of many famous philosophers from the last 3000 years or so.<br />It is NOT, however, a useful introductory work that is comprehensible to the novice interested in gaining an insight into the wisdom of the ages; the selections were made with the intention of giving a broad variety of thoughts, rather than on choosing the most basic, accessible philosophic concepts. Therefore, much of what is contained in this book is, to one not already schooled in the jargon of philosophy, pretty near impenetrable, and much of what isn't impenetrable seems pretty pointless to someone not fascinated by the subject.<br />There were a few excerpts that were both readable and interesting; the section from Ayala's &quot;The Concept of Biological Progress&quot; was one, as to a lesser extent were both of the excerpts of Poincare's works, and a few others.

Given the fanaticism with which lovers of this book rave about it, one might be tempted to assume that it is overrated. This would be a mistake; it is one of the finest stories in literature, and well worth its reputation.<br />Granted, it is not to everyone's taste; nothing is. Some may find it overly wordy or pretentious; this reviewer finds some of Tolkien's other works (notably his postumously published works, such as &quot;The Silmarilien&quot; and the &quot;Books of Lost Tales&quot;) to fit that description, and granted, this book occasionally comes closer to that than its companion volume, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which is told in a much more accessible, lighthearted style. (Others may not care for the heroic-fantasy genre at all; there's no accounting for taste.) This book, however, is intended to be a more serious tale, and its style reflects that. But it only rarely takes itself over-seriously, (at least until one finishes the actual story and reads the appendices, if one indeed bothers doing so) and is a story of much grander scope and accomplishment than &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<br />This book is nothing less than THE seminal modern heroic fantasy story; everything that has come after it owes much to its influence. Just as there were vampire stories before Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot;, there was heroic fantasy before Tolkien. And as there are modern vampire stories that diverge greatly from the concepts in &quot;Dracula&quot;, so there are modern heroic fantasies that similarly diverge from the concepts in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Yet just as &quot;Dracula&quot; is unquestionably a major influence on all vampire fiction that has come after, so with &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and heroic fantasy. If any author of heroic fantasy has not read this book (unlikely in and of itself) they still could not escape its influence, because WHATEVER stories they may have read that influenced their writings are guaranteed to have been influenced by Tolkien and this book. It is simply unavoidable.<br />This is an absolute must-read for anyone with any interest at all in the heroic fantasy genre.

The external, &quot;frame&quot; part of this story is obviously simply an excuse to set the stage for the four internal stories; as such, it actually wound up being better than expected, if somewhat predictable. The internal stories are the stories of how each of Kirk, Scotty, Sulu, and Chekov reacted to the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; scenerio in their academy days, ostensibly told by each to the others to pass the time.<br />The biggest problem here is that the author goes to all that trouble to establish that the characters are telling their own stories, and then tells the stories in third person/omniscient narrator format. Granted, given that no one has ever claimed that any of the above characters are accomplished storytellers, if would have been difficult to keep the stories in their own voices, but it would have been much better if it could have been managed.<br />As a more minor problem, there are bits and pieces of each story that don't quite ring true, but that's a subjective assessment. They weren't bad, and certainly were worth reading. But none of them were quite what I would have liked to see.<br />As a whole, this book is worth reading, but not one of the best.	2003-05-06

Peter David is an excellent author, the best Star Trek author I've found. He is one of the few who can tell a dramatic, action-packed story without losing his sense of humor, as was done in some of the best episodes in the original Star Trek series (\\"Trouble With Tribbles\\", \\"A Piece of the Action\\", \\"Shore Leave\\") and has only rarely been seen since. I've enjoyed this series so far, and the characters in it (which is, perhaps, the most important thing in a book or a series). But there are a couple of caveats for those considering the series:<br />First is the one that actually bothers me a bit: I don't really care for the fact that the storyline continues from one book to the next; granted, the last two books in the series have been better about this than the first four, in that they have legitimately been complete stories in and of themselves. But I find that I prefer stand-alone stories for the most part. If you don't share this preference, you may find this a strength rather than a weakness.<br />Second is the caveat that does NOT bother me, but might well bother some people: while he never becomes EXTREMELY graphic, certainly never tasteless, Peter David's characters have always been a bit more obviously sexually active than we usually see in Star Trek; not that there was ever any doubt about Kirk, but even in his case, it was generally just hinted at, and that was even more true in \\"Next Generation\\". Granted, \\"DS9\\" and \\"Voyager\\" went a little farther in that direction, (remember the opening scene of \\"What You Leave Behind\\", the final episode of DS9, with Bashir and Ezre Dax naked in bed together?) but the constraints of network television still kept things a bit more restrained than David feels any inclination to. Certainly, most Star Trek novels follow the precedent set in the shows, and are much more circumscribed about showing what their characters do behind closed doors than he is. I enjoy this, but it does mean that people who do NOT enjoy this sort of thing can be unpleasantly surprised to see so much sexuality in a place that they wouldn't ordinarily expect it.<br />As to this book specifically, I found the story to be the best of the series so far. But really, I can't recommend it to anyone who hasn't read the previous books, so my recommendation is simply: start with Book One (House of Cards); if you like it, keep reading.

The plot and the idea behind this book were interesting, interesting enough to hold my attention in spite of the poor writing. And with a few minor quibbles, (\\"computer consul\\" instead of \\"console\\", for instance) when I say \\"poor writing\\", I'm not speaking of sloppy typos, poor grammar or word choice. What I'm talking about is characters that behave in implausible ways (no, I'm being too kind; downright impossible ways). The character interaction just rings blatently untrue. I can suspend disbelief for Warp drives and matter transportation, but I CANNOT suspend disbelief for the young, successful revolutionaries who, after fighting a long and bloody insurrection against arrogant, ruthless, bloody-handed oppressors remain idealistic enough to treat their enemies with a kind and restrained justice, yet are aware enough of the realities of real-politic to be willing to treat with the Romulans and the Klingons if that's what it takes to secure their planet's economic survival. Nor do I believe in a United Federation of Planets that tacitly supported said oppressive previous regime. There are many other examples of similarly dubious interactions in the book; some I cannot detail here without giving away too much of the conclusion of the book. Suffice it to say that the ending was far too pat, and continued to have characters behaving in ways that simply did not fit in with their established characterizations.<br />Not in the bottom ten of Star Trek novels, but close to it.	2003-04-30

Each book in the series is a historical novel set in a different time period; this one is set in Saxony (part of what is now Germany) in the mid-900s. Saint-Germain is a rather untraditional vampire, in that he is an unequivocal hero and all-around nice guy; he does not kill when drinking blood, but rather gets the most sustenance from the blood of someone who loves him, knowing what he is and accepting it. As such, most of the books in the series are historical romances of one sort or another; this one is no exception.<br />If you enjoy your vampire fiction fast-paced, brutal, and horrific, this book (and this entire series) are definitely not for you.

But not without its flaws, the largest of which is that the rear cover blurb is totally inaccurate, so if you might be inclined to pick up this book in order to see some in-depth background on the experiences that young James Kirk had on Tarsus IV (a tie-in to the original series episode, &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;) don't. The point in his past that Kirk is sent back to is a completely different one, one that does NOT form a tie-in to any episode. If I had to guess, I'd guess that the original plan was to tie in to Tarsus IV, and that original plot synopsis is what the rear cover blurb was based on, and then in the course of writing, the details were changed. Perhaps the creator of that episode objected to the use of their concept; who knows?<br />Of course, another flaw is that this book is not a complete story by itself; it is a story fragment relatively meaningless without books one and two of the series, so don't start with this one. And the third major flaw is that the concepts of time paradoxes are handled in a somewhat dubious way; but that's almost a given in the genre. It's nearly impossible to handle temporal paradoxes in a way that DOES make sense.<br />On the good side, the basic plot is fairly interesting (if illogical), there are some interesting tie-ins with various episodes from the original series which are handled quite well, and the characterization is smoothly handled and interesting.<br />As a whole, I'd say that the trilogy is worth reading for any fan of the original Star Trek series, but don't expect perfection. There are better Star Trek stories to be had, but there are far, far more worse ones.	2003-04-16

First the good news: the actual writing isn't bad, in terms of technical competence. The characters were mostly handled well, both in terms of dialogue and interaction; Major Kira was a bit too hostile, but that was fairly standard for this early in the series, and Odo displayed a variety of intelligence that I don't expect to see from him, but otherwise the book was well enough written to make two separate fairly uninteresting plots passably readable.<br />But that's the bad news: the story behind the writing just wasn't interesting; it's a bad sign when the poker tournament at Quark's is more interesting than the obligatory station crisis.<br />This book was actually written as a collaborative effort between Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Katheryn Rush. (Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym they chose for the collaboration.) If you are familiar with (and fond of) the individual work of either of these writers, you might want to try this one. But I can't say that I was overly impressed.	2003-04-14

Not as entertaining as its predecessor, &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot;, but still quite entertaining in its own way, more than half of this book is devoted to describing the experiences of Feynman as he took part in the committee investigating the Shuttle Challenger disaster. As anyone who's read the first book can imagine, setting Feynman loose on a governmental committee is not exactly a recipe for smooth interaction; what it IS a recipe for is getting far more straight answers uncovered than the bureaucrats want.<br />Not to say that this book isn't funny, but if you're looking for a chuckle, read the earlier book. If, on the other hand, you're in the mood for being reminded, in a fairly lighthearted way, just why it is that bureaucracies are not a good thing, this is the book for you. In addition to the section on the Challenger investigation, there are a few biographical anecdotes, as well as a closing lecture on &quot;The Value of Science&quot;, all of which are good reading.	2003-04-11

Peter David is one of the few authors, and just about the only Star Trek author, who can consistently manage the tricky business of writing a fast-paced, dramatic action story while still maintaining a sense of humor. This book is no exception to that.<br />Still, the story is a bit weaker than he usually manages, and also a bit more sloppily written. The character development continued the sub-plots established in the first four books of the series, and did the job reasonably well. But there were careless errors in word usage and grammer that I don't generally see in David's work, and the story as a whole wasn't exceptional enough to make me overlook the sloppiness.<br />Not a bad book, certainly; better than most in the genre. But not up to David's usual standards.	2003-04-10

Or eleventh, if you count \\"Out of the House of Life\\", which is primarily a spinoff novel about Madeline de Montalia (former lover and vampiric \\"childe\\" of Saint-Germain), but which does include some flashback scenes to some of Saint-Germain's early history.<br />Or fourteenth, if you also count \\"A Flame In Byzantium\\", \\"Crusader's Torch\\", and \\"A Candle For d'Artagnan\\", the spinoff series about Atta Olivia Clemens, an earlier lover and vampiric \\"childe\\".<br />This book is set in the years leading up to the first world war, roughly 1910-1913. As such, it ends only a few years prior to the events in the fifth book in the series, \\"Tempting Fate\\". It is one of the most enjoyable books in the series to read; the early books (Hotel Transylvania\\", \\"The Palace\\", and \\"Blood Games\\") were not as well written as most of the later ones, being more historical-romance bodice rippers than serious literary efforts, but they had the advantage of being enjoyable reading, with stories in which the hero succeeds in rescuing the damsel in distress. Starting with the fourth book in the series, \\"Path of the Eclipse\\", we have had a long run of stories in which Saint Germain has had relatively little success in that regard, and the stories, while frequently very powerful, were something of a downer to read. Finally in this book, we see what Yarbro can do with the action hero plot now that she's grown as a writer; the plot is much more similar in tone to her early efforts, but far better written. For one thing, her villains are far more three dimensional and far less cardboard cutouts than they were in those books, particularly the first.<br />If you're a fan of traditional vampire fiction, you may or may not be disappointed in these stories; there is none of the struggle with the evil \\"inherent in the vampiric nature\\" that one finds in most vampiric fiction, notably the Anne Rice vampires. Saint-Germain is an unabashed hero, neither a sympathetic villain nor an anti-hero. He has lived 4000 years, and outgrew that silliness in the time of ancient Egypt. (Bits of this were seen in the aforementioned \\"Out of the House of Life\\".) The villains in this book (and in most of the books in this series) are mortals, and they are responsible for whatever \\"horror\\" elements that there are in the plot.<br />If, on the other hand, you enjoy historical romance, and don't automatically reject the concept of a vampire as the hero and main character, you should truly enjoy this entire series, and particularly this book.rs, and outgrew that silliness in the time of ancient Egypt.

Let's get one thing clear from the start: when I rate Shakespeare, I rate it against other Shakespeare; otherwise, the consistently high ratings would not be very informative. If I was rating this against the general run of literature available, it would unquestionably rate 5 stars.<br />So what brings it down to 4, as compared to other Shakespeare? Primarily a few places where it demands a bit too much suspension of disbelief; the language is some of Shakespeare's best, and is comparatively easy for a modern reader (I found most of the footnotes to be sufficiently unnecessary to be actually more distraction than help). But for one thing, if Richard is withered, hunchbacked, and deformed, how is it that he has been able to kill so many of his victims in battle? For another thing, is it REALLY plausible that Princess Anne would be persuaded as she was by someone with nothing more going for him than Richard? To paraphrase the scene,<br />Anne: You killed my husband and his father! I hate you I hate you I hate you!<br />Richard: But I only did it 'cause I'm hot for you, babe! Wanna marry me?<br />Anne: Welll...maybe. Let me think about it.<br />(And, in fact, she marries him. Just like that.)<br />Also, there are virtually NO characters in this play that are sympathetic, save perhaps for the two murdered children and Richmond, and we really don't see enough of them to feel much connection; it dilutes the effectiveness of the portrayal of Richard's evil when almost all of the other characters are, if not just as bad, certainly bad enough.	2003-03-22

Granted, she still tries to be too cute with the language, and generally fails miserably when she does, (for example, describing the ship \\"swaggering\\" under enemy phasers, rather than the more normal (and accurate) \\"staggering\\". Had anybody else written that, I'd have assumed that it was a typo, but given Diane Carey's history, I'm forced to assume that she meant to write that.) This is the only reason that I've rated this book at four rather than five stars; if you don't object to sloppy, incorrect use of the language on occasion, consider this a five-star rating.<br />But she does so far less frequently in this book than in almost any of her other books, and on balance, less egregiously, too.<br />Further, the plot and characterization are even better than she usually manages, and that's always been her strong suit. And as an extra added bonus, she manages to refer back to numerous episodes, something that I always enjoy, and generally only see in Peter David's work. And she does it quite well, too, always plausibly and (where one can check on it) accurately. I understand that some people don't care for that sort of thing; if you don't, consider this a three-star rating instead of four. But I consider it a definite plus.	2003-03-18

The storyline for the first four books combined is a fine one, the characters are handled quite well, and the writing style maintains Peter David's usual high quality, especially his ability to tell a dramatic story without losing his sense of humor.<br />Still, this book on its own is only a story fragment; it has an ending, with just a couple of ongoing subplots (which is perfectly fine) but no beginning. And no story fragment is worth five stars. This is unquestionably the best &quot;book&quot; of the four, however.	2003-03-13

I consider Melville's more famous work, \\"Moby Dick\\", to be perhaps the most overrated book in the English language; in spite of that, I decided to try this one on the grounds that perhaps my dislike of that one was a fluke (no pun intended) and that perhaps some other of Melville's works might be more congenial.<br />This book definitely has some advantages over \\"Moby Dick\\". It's shorter, for one thing, and the digressions are both shorter themselves, and less frequent. But they are, if anything, even more annoying; if there's anything I LESS need to read than dissertations on the nuts and bolts of 19th century whaling, it's chapters in which an author steps outside of his story to defend details of his writing. What's more, while \\"Moby Dick\\" is 400+ pages of story with about 50 pages of plot, this book is 250+ pages with absolutely NO plot; all it is is episodic recitations of one character (a man of 1000 faces) swindling numerous other characters, some more well-developed than others. And if the writing style isn't QUITE as pretentious as in \\"Moby Dick\\", it's still too pretentious for my taste.<br />Still, the book is not completely worthless. It brings to mind some interesting points for debate; which is worse, the con man himself, or the people who he CAN'T swindle because they're so cynical and untrusting? Is it worth becoming that cynical to avoid being gulled by such a con man? Is it possible to retain a reasonable amount of faith in people, and still avoid being swindled? What would have been the appropriate response in (pick a scene)? I would recommend that if you are going to read it, do so as a part of a literary discussion group, or something similar, so that you will have someone to discuss it with. That's where its value lies, certainly not as an entertaining read.	2003-03-13

It is one of the best of a very good series; as usual, Yarbro's historical research is excellent, and her characters (with the exception of Roger, who seems somewhat lacking in the personality department; what does this guy do for fun? Thirteen books and counting, and I have no idea) come alive, even if I did find Saint-Germain's willingness to turn the other cheek after Dona Azul had Oaxetli poisoned somewhat out of character.<br />For those unfamiliar with the series, the Saint-Germain series is a series of historical horror novels in which the hero (and he IS a hero, not a villain or even an antihero as is so common in vampire fiction) is a 4000 year old vampire. The vampiric aspects are very subdued; he needs blood to maintain his strength, which is formidable, and is susceptible to running water and sunlight, but both of these weaknesses are significantly less pronounced than in much vampiric fiction. As long as he is wearing shoes with some of his native earth in the heels and soles, he can mostly ignore them; even without, he hardly bursts into flame when exposed to sunlight; in this book, he is crucified for two days in the Mexican summer, and while seriously injured, he survives (no spoiler, considering that several of the previously written books are set in later time periods). Basically, without his protective shoes, he sunburns extremely easily and extremely severely.

In this, the third book of the series, Peter David finally starts to really get moving. The plot, for the first time in the series, really seems to be going somewhere, and the characters are finally beginning to feel real and fleshed-out. This is the first book of this series that didn't leave me feeling disappointed; this is what I expect from Peter David. Really, the only thing NOT to like about this book is my continuing kvetch about the serial nature of the series; this book is only a story fragment, not a full story in itself. It has neither beginning nor end, but starts in midaction (due to the previous book leaving off in a cliffhanger) and ends with a cliffhanger itself. Two of them, actually. This is annoying enough when the story is legitimately too long to fit in one book; the first four books of this series are all 150-200 pages, and therefore could easily have fit into one large book, but marketing took precedence over art.<br />The only reason that this book didn't get five stars is that I will never give five stars to a story fragment.	2003-02-16

Also as usual, her plot is excellent and her main characters are a delight. What sets this book apart from most of her previous entries in this series is that her villains are much less cardboard; usually, her villains have been simply blatantly evil, from diabolists in Paris to insane worshippers of Kali the death-goddess in Persia to Nazis in Germany. Now granted, all of these sorts of people existed, but their motives generally weren't as one-dimensional as these stories have generally made them.

The truly scary thing is not that there are noticeable similarities between our political culture and the culture portrayed in this book, but rather the even closer similarities between that culture and our corporate culture.<br />After all, in the corporate world, as in the \\"Oceana\\" of this book, the \\"proles\\" (common laborers) can pretty much think and say what they want, although it IS possible for individuals to go too far. But if one wants a comfortable life in an office job, one not only has to watch what one says, but how one says it, and what one can be demonstrated to think. If one is caught in the \\"thoughtcrime\\" of being insufficiently enthusiastic about one's company, or showing doubts about whether what it's doing is right or not, one will surely be \\"disappeared\\"; one's co-workers will show up one day and simply not find you there, and if anyone is foolish enough to ask what happened, they will simply be told, in a tone of voice that brooks no further questions, \\"s/he is no longer with the department\\".

By far the most common, I'm sure, is for prurient interest; in this the book mostly fails. The entire book is basically nothing more than a description of incident after incident of sex or sexplay, but while there are a few erotic scenes in it, for the most part, the sex scenes are so repetitiously described, and so blandly described, that they are actually rather boring. As erotica this book is not very good.<br />The second possible reason for reading this book is for the<br />historical insight it provides into the sexual attitudes in Victorian London, and how those attitudes played out in practice, rather than in theory. In this regard, the book is rather more successful. One thing that struck me was the confirmation it gave of the damage that is done by a sexually repressive society; in such a society, anyone who is having sex outside of marriage at all is an outlaw, already committing an act that is totally condemned by the society in which they live. As such, they are less likely to be overly particular as to just HOW they break the societal taboos; if even masturbation is unspeakably vile, then sex itself isn't much worse. And since no \\"good\\" girl will ADMIT to wanting sex, one becomes accustomed to overcoming a certain amount of resistance, so when dealing with someone who really DOESN'T consent, one can't tell the difference. And once one is accustomed to having women without tacit consent, how much of a step is it to child-rape? If everything sexual all the way down to masturbation is absolutely, totally, vehemently forbidden, it is impossible to make distinctions of degree, and once a young man takes that first step, he's already totally lost, so there are no longer any barriers at all. Similarly, once a young woman takes that first step, she may as well become a prostitute, for the one is not noticeably worse than the other.<br />This is the mind-set we see narrating this book. It's an interesting glimpse, but the book as a whole is rather boring and repetitive.

This story can, in fact, stand on its own.<br />Which is good, because it's an extremely good story; the regular characters are handled well, a couple of new characters that are added for spice are interesting and worthwhile, and the story itself is a fast-moving, well-paced story that is very well written. It's one of the best &quot;Enterprise saves the universe as we know it&quot; stories that I've ever read; it actually manages to be almost plausible.	2003-01-18

The James Blish \\"Star Trek\\" series is a twelve book series of adaptations of the stories from the original \\"Star Trek\\" television series. Frankly, Blish didn't do a very good job of it, and most of the series is pretty weak, even for a longtime fan of the series. As far as the writing itself is concerned, this book is no exception; Blish embellishes very little on the basic plots he was given, which to an extent is a good thing; the stories are all pretty well what we saw onscreen. But he takes it to an extreme; there is little description beyond what is absolutely necessary, and little insight into character beyond what is demonstrated by action and dialogue. Further, the editing is as sloppy as one might expect from 1960s dime-store paperbacks; simple arithmetic, apparently, is beyond both Blish and his editors, as is evidenced by the following exchange, found in the first story, on page 21 (at least, in the edition that I have):<br />Spock: Captain, how much time since my brain was removed?<br />Kirk: Forty-eight hours.<br />Spock: Sir, Dr. McCoy must have told you that seventy-two hours is the maximum that my body can be...<br />Kirk: I know, Spock. That leaves us fourteen hours.<br />But beyond the sloppy editing and poor writing, this book actually DOES have something to recommend it; the first and last of the six episodes may be among the worst in the entire run of the original \\"Star Trek\\" series (\\"Spock's Brain\\", in which said brain is removed by an alien for the purpose of being used as an organic computer to run her world's life support systems, which gives us the immortally bad lines \\"Brain and brain! What is 'brain'?\\" and \\"Where is this place?\\" \\"This place is...here.\\" and \\"For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky\\", which just isn't interesting enough to summarize, respectively) but the four episodes sandwiched between those two turkeys are four of the very best episodes from the series: \\"The Enemy Within\\", in which Kirk is confronted with a double that embodies all the evil that every person keeps carefully hidden within themselves, \\"Catspaw\\", one of the better examples of the crossover between horror and Science fiction, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", the \\"second pilot episode\\", in which Kirk's longtime friend Gary Mitchell has the extrasensory part of his brain stimulated, giving him godlike powers and driving him insane, and \\"Wolf In The Fold\\", another horror crossover in which the Enterprise crew meet the being behind the \\"Jack The Ripper\\" crimes.<br />I can't say that I recommend this book in general, nor even specifically to someone who liked those episodes.

The dialogue is better than fair, and the plot moves well until the end, when it completely falls apart.<br />I don't want to say TOO much about that, because it would give away too much. All I can really say is that the day that Major Kira can't handle one lone psychopath with a broken arm who's armed only with a knife one-on-one (to say nothing of with assistance from Dr. Bashir) without having to destroy an expensive and important piece of equipment, is the day that the author truly doesn't understand the characters s/he's writing about. Granted, this was an early book, but STILL...<br />Most of the second half of this book reads like a cheap slasher movie, with Major Kira playing the part of the terrified potential victim of the near-unbeatable slasher. Problem is, we've seen absolutely nothing to indicate that he really has the kind of semi-mystical invulnerability enjoyed by Freddie and Jason; Kira should have made mincemeat of him, without so much as mussing her hair.	2003-01-09

The concept, or should I say concepts, behind this book are excellent. It's a delight to see something truly different, and a novel set during Captain Pike's tenure as captain of the Enterprise certainly qualifies; the only regulars from the original series that we see in this book are Scotty (who mainly shows up in a minor subplot) and Spock, who the story centers around. And while stories centering around Spock are hardly novel, the concept of exploring the background of the character before he met Kirk, et al, is certainly a nice change.<br />Another concept behind this book is to explore the &quot;hidden&quot; emotional lives of Vulcans. This concept is handled much less well than the background concept; those of us well-versed in the lore of Star Trek know that it is a mistake to believe that Vulcans have no emotions, and we've certainly seen Spock's emotional side before. But Vulcans in general, and Spock in particular, are FAR more circumspect about acknowledging those emotions openly than they are shown to be in this book. Disappointing, because D.C. Fontana ought to know better; she wrote for the original series, including the episode &quot;Journey To Babel&quot;, in which she showed a much better grasp of the way Vulcans display (or fail to display) their emotions.<br />The peeks into the respective personalities of Captain Pike, Number One, and Doctor Boyce was nicely handled, though. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more books from this time period.	2003-01-06

As in &quot;The Search&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot; (novelizations of a DS9 episode and a Next Generation episode respectively) Diane Carey does an excellent job of faithfully telling the story presented her. Unlike in both of those books, to say nothing of many of her other original Star Trek novels, in this book she (mostly) contains her tendancy to get carried away in her attempts to use the language in &quot;original&quot; (read &quot;WRONG&quot;) ways. There are a few places where her word choice is questionable (referring to Neelix as a &quot;thermometer&quot; of the crew's morale, rather than the more standard &quot;barometer&quot;, for example, and in at least two places using the phrase &quot;s/he bridged&quot; to convey the concept &quot;s/he said to bridge the gap&quot;) but none that are just clearly wrong and ridiculous, as has been the case in so much of her other writing. Which allows the reader to enjoy her writing without distraction, and to see just what she's capable of when she doesn't try to invent new words or find new uses for old words. And the answer is, &quot;quite a bit&quot;.	2003-01-01

But it's more than a bit preachy and overly simplistic.<br />The plot is good, (except for the deus ex machina toward the end) the characterizations well-handled, the dialogue good if unspectacular. But this is a book with a message, and its message is the same one as in Dr. Seuss's \\"The Lorax\\", and this book's presentation of that message (\\"pollution bad\\") is every bit as detailed and nuanced as the presentation was in that children's story. There is no discussion of HOW one would go about reducing the pollution and overuse of natural resources in a society, or what level is acceptable, or what sacrifices it might be appropriate to expect people to make to save the world, or any of the other difficult questions that such an issue deserves or any acknowledgement that the issue is a difficult one at all; as in Dr. Seuss, it is simply assumed that if people are poisoning their world, it is because they're too stupid to figure out that they need to stop, or to see the obvious things they need to do to stop. If they'd merely listen to wise people of good will, the problem would go away.<br />Now, obviously, I have nothing against \\"The Lorax\\". It's a marvellous children's story and conveys the danger of pollution very well for its intended target audience. As a children's story, it isn't EXPECTED to have nuance or balance. And while I'm sure that there are people out there saying, \\"This is a mass-market Star Trek novel; why would you hold it to a higher standard than you do Dr. Seuss?\\", my response is, that's true of Star Trek stories that are intended to be no more than entertaining action/adventure stories. This (again) is a book with a message. But its message conveys little or nothing; I'm reasonably sure that all us Star Trek fans are already well aware that pollution is bad. The question is, \\"what do we do about it?\\" That question isn't even addressed, much less answered, in this book.	2003-01-01

I've HAD basic calculus, albeit a LONG time ago, and I'm a tad rusty. And I have even less grounding in physics. But I'm far from mathematically illiterate, or incapable. And it isn't true that I got nothing out of my reading of this book; the sixth chapter did, in fact, answer the question that I'd hoped to have answered when I bought it. But by and large, the book was close to impenetrable. Now, clearly, this may well be due to my lack of preparation in the prerequisites for understanding it. But it definitely is NOT the first step in the process of understanding physics, as one reviewer actually called it and others implied. Read &quot;Six Easy Pieces&quot; first, and brush up on first-year Calculus. THEN consider tackling this book.	2002-12-30

The rest of it centers on Madeline de Montalia, his former lover and vampiric \\"daughter\\", in the early ninteenth century, on an archeological dig in Egypt. The plot and characterization are excellent as usual for Ms. Yarbro; the pattern begun in the previous book (A Candle For d' Artgnan) of the editing being somewhat sloppier than in previous books is continued here; these were the first two books of the series to come out in \\"quality\\" or trade paperback editions, rather than mass-market, and frankly the editing in the previous books was better. Apparently, someone considers \\"quality\\" to be defined by the size of the book and the type of binding, rather than by efficient editing.

There are a couple of major quibbles I have with the plot, however, and while it is not the fault of the book that the flaws are there (they were there in the episode) I still find that I can't rate the book higher given those sloppinesses. I don't know what I'd have done if I were making the novelization, and had to choose between diverging from the episode or making sense, but still...<br />The first flaw is in the claim that the three beams that created the anomaly were from &quot;three different Enterprises, at three different times&quot;. Nice idea, but they WEREN'T. One of them (the one in the future) was from Beverly Crusher's medical ship; the future Enterprise never sent off a tachyon pulse. The second is that the anomaly, supposedly an &quot;anti-time&quot; anomaly, moves BACKWARD in time from its origin point, yet Picard and company find it FORWARD in time from its origin point, and growing.<br />I realize that when dealing with temporal anomalies, time travel, and weird physics, anything is possible. But it would be nice if things made sense INTERNALLY; if they can't be made to do so, it would be nice if the characters in the book at least acknowledged the wrongness and their inability to explain things. These flaws went a long way toward ruining a good story for me.	2002-12-07

So if you want to know how this book rates against the general selection of books in the world, I suppose it might rate four stars; it certainly rates three. The language, as usual in Shakespeare, is beautiful. Still, it's far from Shakespeare's best.<br />For one thing, this is one of those cases, not uncommon in Shakespeare's comedies, in which the play has suffered a great deal by the changes in the language since Shakespeare's time; it loses a great deal of the humor inherent in a play when the reader needs to keep checking the footnotes to see what's happening, and this play, particularly the first half of it, virtually can't be read without constant reference to the notes; even with them, there's frequently a question as to what's being said. At least in the edition that I read (the Dover Thrift edition) the notes frequently admit that there's some question as to the meaning of the lines, and there is mention of different changes in them in different folios.<br />But beyond this, as an overweight, balding, middle-aged libertine, I object to the concept that Falstaff is ridiculous just because he is in fact unwilling to concede that it is impossible that a woman could want him. Granted, he's NOT particularly attractive, but that has more to do with his greed, his callousness, and his perfect willingness to use people for his own ends, to say nothing of his utter lack of subtlety.<br />Is it truly so funny that an older, overweight man might attempt to find a dalliance? So funny that the very fact that he does so leaves him open to being played for the fool? Remember, it isn't as though he refused to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer; he never GOT a &quot;no&quot;. He was consistently led on, only to be tormented for his audacity. Nor is he making passes at a nubile young girl; the target of his amorous approaches is clearly herself middle-aged; after all, she is the MOTHER of a nubile young marriageable girl. And given the fact that she is married to an obnoxious, possessive, bullying and suspicious husband, it is not at all unreasonable for Falstaff to think that she might be unhappy enough in her marriage to accept a dalliance with someone else.<br />If laughing at fat old men who have the audacity not to spend the last twenty years of their lives with sufficient dignity to make it seem as if they were dead already is your idea of a good time, you should love this play.

NUMEROUS lines throughout the book are missing their first (or, occasionally, last) letters; page fifty alone is missing five first letters out of 30 lines, and while most of the book isn't THAT bad, it isn't the only page that has a problem, but cutting down a rating of a story for sloppy layout is unfair; still, I'm loath to give a high rating to such a sloppy book without a disclaimer. Hopefully, later editions corrected the problem, but I wouldn't count on it.)<br />The characters were handled marvellously, especially Scotty, who is given his due in a way that he was NOT in the episode/book that brought him into the Next Generation world, &quot;Relics&quot;; the plot works well and makes sense, and the writing moves well and is enjoyable to read.	2002-11-26

There is a great deal of fascinating, and very useful information here, and if the writing style is a bit didactic, it's hardly soporific. Still, it would seem to me that an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; should be organized in some way (preferably alphabetically) that is comprehensible to the layman. Granted, there's a fairly good index that allows one to find the entry that one is looking for, but the book as a whole is apparently organized by order and suborder, which makes it impossible for the layman to pick up the book and find a given entry in a reasonable amount of time. This strikes me as a fairly serious flaw. For example, we start with ostriches, rheas, emus and cassowaries, progress through kiwis and tinamous, progress to penguins, loons, and grebes; hummingbirds are roughly halfway through the book, and we finish with crows. Jays have no entry of their own, but are lumped with crows, as sparrows are lumped with buntings, tanagers, waxbirds and weavers. It's very difficult to find the method to this madness.<br />Granted, three stars is a bit low for this book, but four would have been too high.<br />If you need a reference book on birds that has a lot of information, and are willing to spend the time sorting through the incomprehensible organization to find that information, this is an excellent choice, but if you want a quick &quot;field guide&quot; that not only gives good information but that is easy to use, this would be a bad choice.	2002-11-23

This third book in the Anita Blake series was a major disappointment after the first installment, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\".<br />Admittedly, the character of Anita is still enjoyable to watch in action, and the writing style, first-person narrative from her perspective, is still enjoyable. But for one thing, the quality of the writing wasn't nearly as good as it was in the first book; I found as many sloppy errors in this book as I've come to expect in a mass-market paperback; this, after finding NONE in the first book. For another thing, there were numerous flaws in plot continuity; what ever happened to Edward's contract on the Master Vampire of the city, that suddenly, he's fighting with Anita on Jean-Claude's side, no questions asked? Was this just a case of Edward showing faith in Anita's judgement, and he'll get back to that later on? We're never given a clue.<br />But the biggest problem I have with the plot is the concept of the super-master vampire, so old he's not even of homo sapiens stock; if a 1000 year old vampire is notably more powerful than a 500 year old, then a million-year-old vampire does NOT need any help from Anita to find and kill Jean Claude. He automatically knows the name, address, and zip code of every vampire on the continent. Nor can he be killed as easily as all that; if he can be killed at all, it ought to be at the end of an epic struggle. Further, if he CAN be killed that easily, he HAS to be smart enough not to put himself in that position; if he wasn't brighter than that, he'd have died about 985,000 years ago.

I realize that he IS mechanical, but the series never failed to present him as having a personality, even in this premier episode. I feel that his mechanical aspect was overplayed in this book.

Perhaps my biggest objection is in an anachronism within the Star Trek universe: if the Federation had had to deal with the question of self-aware AIs as early as this, certainly the Next Generation episode &quot;The Measure of the Man&quot; would never have happened; Data would automatically have been accepted as more than a machine, without the need for a trial. Of course, this book came out at about the same time as that episode, probably a bit earlier, so one can hardly blame the authors for that fact; still, &quot;Next Gen&quot; was already a year into its run when this book was published, and clearly ALL of the questions raised by Data's existence (to say nothing of Voyager's EMH, who WASN'T part of the canon yet, but who even more poorly fits into a timeline in which this book is placed) would have long since been answered were this book to be considered canonical.

But as Shakespeare goes, in spite of being one of his best-known plays, it truly isn't one of the best.<br />Certainly, there are the bones of a fine plot here, but the play is very short and thus doesn't really give us the smooth development of plot and character that we usually see in Shakespeare. Nor, given how entirely unappealing the main character is, is it properly a tragedy when he dies; granted, one can consider it tragic that good King Duncan is killed, and Banquo as well, to say nothing of McDuff's family. But can a play in which the unequivocal \\"good guys\\" categorically win (and several of them even survive) be properly called a tragedy?<br />There are certain similarities between the plot (or at least, the theme) of this play and that of the novel \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Dostoyevsky. If you liked that book, you may enjoy this play. If you like this play, you will probably enjoy that book (it is a much more in-depth character portrait). Granted, the issue of Kingship never comes into play in Dostoyevsky's work, but the concept of the effect a murder has on the murderer is there, and actually handled rather better.<br />Of course, being Shakespeare, there is much beautiful language to be found here, and as Shakepearean plays go, the language isn't too difficult for the modern reader; there are only a few places where the footnotes are absolutely essential to an understanding of what's been said. But truly, it is hard to really like this work, and while it can be interesting, it would have been better if it weren't so rushed.	2002-11-06

Otherwise, the consistent \\"5 stars\\" wouldn't tell you much. So when I rate this book five stars, I'm saying it's one of the best of the best.<br />As a matter of fact, it isn't unusual for Shakespeare's \\"histories\\" to be more interesting to the modern reader than either his comedies or his tragedies; they fit the modern style that doesn't insist that comedies must have everything work out well in the end, or that tragedies must be deadly serious with everyone dying at the end, as was the convention in Shakespeare's time. Thus, this book has a serious plot, real drama, and blood and destruction, yet still has many extremely funny scenes. And as Shakespearean plays go, it's a fairly easy read, although in places the footnotes are still neccessary. The only caveat I will make is that one needs to remember not to consider Shakespeare's histories particularly historical; they have about as much historical accuracy as the Disney version of Pocahontas. Treat them as excellent stories based (very) loosely on history, and you'll do fine.<br />It's a real shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare was writing that his plays are no longer accessable to the masses, because that's who Shakespeare was writing for. Granted, there is enough seriousness to satisfy the intelligensia, but there is generally enough action and bawdy humor to satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they could understand it, and this book is no exception. Unfortunately, once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. I don't think I'll hold my breath waiting.	2002-11-03

(Dave explains that this is why guys are so bad at housecleaning; they have a genetic visual impairment that renders them unable to see dirt.)<br />If you love subtle, elaborate, intellectual humor...<br />you won't want to read this book.<br />But if you can find amusement in seriously irreverent humor, even if it has the subtlety of a blowout at highway speed, then you should enjoy this book.	2002-11-02

This book is something of a cross between a hard-boiled detective novel and a horror novel, with a touch of sci-fi thrown in for good measure. The setting is basically the modern world (St. Louis no less, a point in its favor; it's fun to see a book set in one's hometown for a change) except that all sorts of mythological horrors actually exist, and have become generally known: vampires, werewolves, zombies, ghouls, wererats, etc. I'm not enamored of this concept; it seems to me to lose some of the mystique of the supernatural if they're too much a mundane part of life. And really, the only character in the book that I like is the main character, Anita Blake. But her I like a LOT; she's a marvellously compelling character, and the writing is wonderful, far better than that in Anne Rice or Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, authors of the two other vampire series with which I'm familiar. I prefer the historical settings Yarbro gives us, and there are more characters in her books that I feel a connection to. But her writing is nowhere near as good as Hamilton's. And Anne Rice takes herself (or at least, her writing) way too seriously for my taste; the character of Anita has an irreverent sense of humor that I absolutely love.<br />Also, if you're a fan of \\"traditional\\" vampire stories, you'll prefer this to Yarbro's; the vampires are mostly villains, rather than the misunderstood heros of the Saint-Germain series. They also retain more of their traditional supernatural powers. On the other hand, if you like to empathize with the vampires, this book isn't for you; the main character is a vampire slayer, not a vampire.<br />The sexual content in this book is basically PG, maybe PG-13. But the violence is probably at the \\"R\\" rating, not too severe for a vampire novel, but certainly not for the squeamish.	2002-10-30

In this book, however, as in the previous two, the main character is Atta Olivia Clemens, who as a lover of Saint-Germain's became a vampire when she died, back in the Rome of the Emperor Nero (in the third book of the series, \\"Blood Games\\".)<br />This book is set in France during the reigns of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, which is the period during and slightly after the time of Cardinal Richelieu of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" fame. The \\"d'Artagnan\\" of the title is based on the historical Charles d'Artagnan on whom Dumas based his hero, not on the fictional hero himself.<br />In some ways, this book is better than the two previous books focusing on Olivia; my major complaint about them, that Olivia's vampiric powers were downplayed too severely, does not apply to this book. But I have a very major problem with EXTREMELY major plot points happening offstage, and the reader being informed of them after the fact and given an insufficient description of events to follow the action. This was badly done, and is a major part of my failure to rate this book more highly. Also, the editing did not seem as tight as in the previous entries; far too many typos and incorrect word usage (being \\"adverse\\" to something, rather than \\"averse\\", etc) managed to slip through. I hope this trend doesn't continue into the later books in the series.<br />This is an enjoyable read, better than some in the series, certainly not as good as \\"Tempting Fate\\", the fifth book in the series.	2002-10-27

In this book, however, as in the last, the main character is Atta Olivia Clemens, who as a lover of Saint-Germain's, became a vampire when she died, back in the time of Nero in Imperial Rome (in the third book of the series, \\"Blood Games\\").<br />This book is set in the late twelfth Century, during the time of the third Crusade.<br />As with \\"A Flame In Byzantium\\", the previous book featuring Olivia as the main character, I found this book somewhat disappointing, mainly because Olivia's power as a vampire is radically downplayed. Mostly, the only indication we have of her vampiric nature is her disabilities: her susceptability to light and water, her inability to eat normal food, etc. Her power is DISCUSSED, but never seen. Granted, there are more episodes in this book than in the last in which she is shown acting intrepidly, but never really in any way that could not have been accomplished by a reasonably heroic mortal woman. In the books that feature Saint Germain, we invariably see him demonstrating surprising power for his diminutive frame, or in some other way showing the reader his vampiric power (always subtly enough not to tip his hand to other characters, of course.) And certainly, Yarbro paints Olivia as a sufficiently independant-minded and resourceful woman that one cannot easily accuse her of the intention of writing female characters that are helpless damsels waiting to be rescued. So the question is: WHY do we never get to see Olivia use the \\"exceptional strength\\" that we keep hearing that she has? Just as it has been, in previous books, quite cathartic to see short, dapper Saint Germain beat the stuffing out of, say, five proto-Nazis each of whom had eight inches and eighty pounds on him, in this book there were several situations in which it would have been quite satisfying to see Olivia do something similar, and it could easily enough have been arranged. Instead, the author very carefully arranges the circumstances so that when Olivia has to fight, it is without the advantage of her powers. Just once, I'd like to see her demonstrate the ADVANTAGES of being a vampire.<br />This is a well-written book, excellent if what you want is a historical novel of the time period.

In this book, however, the main character is Atta Olivia Clemens, who as a lover of Saint-Germain's became a vampire when she died, back in the time of Nero in Imperial Rome (in the third book of the series, &quot;Blood Games&quot;).<br />This book is set in the time of the Emperor Justinian in 6th Century Byzantium; for those of you not up on the history, this can be most quickly identified as the time of the burning of the library at Alexandria, a minor plot point in this book.<br />I liked this book, but not as well as most of the previous entries in the series, for a couple of reasons:<br />1) The element of Olivia's vampiric powers is radically understated in this book; granted, Saint-Germain is subtle in the use of his vampiric powers, but he does have them, and we the reader generally get to see him make use of them several times during the course of a novel; he may show exceptional strength; not just &quot;he had a surprisingly firm grip&quot;, but actually breaking the arm of an assailant with little difficulty, or climbing nearly-sheer walls, or moving with exceptional quickness, or sustaining a wound that would be near-fatal to a mortal with minimal effect. Now (again) granted, Olivia, as a woman, must be even MORE circumspect than he about demonstrating such puissance, but surely, we could have seen SOME situation in which she had opportunity to be impressively butch, but it never happens. The &quot;vampire&quot; element is limited to her taking small sips from her lover's neck, her not eating (normal food) and being susceptible to sunlight and water, and needing her native earth in her shoes and mattresses and such. Otherwise, she might as well have been a normal woman. What's the fun in that?<br />2) Early in the book, we see Olivia struggling unsuccessfully to broach the subject of her vampiric nature with her lover Drosos; he pointedly refuses to pick up on her hints, and she can't find the way to force the issue. Later in the book, we discover that he knows about it, and she knows he knows. Presumably, at some point in between, the issue was dealt with, during a behind-the-scenes moment.

For those of you unfamiliar with the series, the Saint-Germain series is a series of \\"historical horror\\" fiction in which the title character and hero (yes, he is a proper hero, not an antihero as in so much vampire fiction) is a vampire who has \\"lived\\" for somewhere between 3500 and 4000 years. In the first five books of the series (\\"Hotel Transylvania\\", \\"The Palace\\", \\"Blood Games\\", \\"Path of the Eclipse\\", and \\"Tempting Fate\\") we have seen him in five novels in five different historical periods: pre-Revolutionary France, Renaissance Italy, Imperial Rome, 13th century China, India, and Persia, and Germany between the World Wars, respectively.<br />This book is somewhat different; it is a collection of short stories (interspersed, as always, with dated correspondence to establish the time frame) ranging chronologically from 1889-1981. Thus, if your preference is for longer stories with an overarching plot, this book may not be for you; similarly, if one of the drawing cards for the series is the earlier historical settings, this might be disappointing. Still, the stories are interesting, and provide insight into the character. Further, two of the stories, \\"Renewal\\" and \\"Cabin 33\\" are excellent, must-read stories for those fond of the series; in \\"Renewal\\", we see the initiation into vampirism of James Emmerson Tree, who we met in the fifth book of the series as the American lover of the vampire Madeline de Montalia. In that book, he was told of her nature, and warned that as her long-time lover, he would become a vampire when he died, but her refused to believe any of it, being the pragmatic modern man that he was. In this story, he is forced to come to terms with the reality of the situation. In \\"Cabin 33\\", we have the pleasure of seeing Saint Germain deal with a villain who happens to be a fellow vampire, albeit a more traditionally-minded one than himself. (Imagine the humor inherent in seeing someone attempt to impress Saint Germain with their puissance by archly informing him that they \\"died in 1896\\". This in 1980, thus making them approximately 1/40th of Saint-Germain's age, a mere puppy by comparison.)nforming him that they \\"died in 1896\\".

This book, the fifth in the series about the vampire Franz Ragozy de Saint Germain, was originally intended to be the last of the series. (It says so, in the \\"about the author\\" section in the back.) Of course, there are roughly a dozen more out now; Yarbro keeps getting new ideas for the character, beyond what she'd originally planned. This is unquestionably the best written of the first five books in the series, but be warned: do not read it unless you are in the mood for tragedy. It is powerfully written, and captures all too fully the trauma that struck all too frequently in that time and place; \\"The Sound Of Music\\" this most assuredly is NOT. (\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" was set in prerevolutionary France, \\"The Palace\\" in renaissance Italy in the time of Botticelli, \\"Blood Games\\" in imperial Rome at the time of Nero, and \\"Path of the Eclipse\\" during the Mongol invasion of China; this is set primarily in Germany during the period between the world wars.)<br />There is little of the feel, all too evident in the first three books of the series, of the cheap Gothic Romance; the characters are very real, and so are the events (in at least two cases, a little TOO real for my taste, but I can't reasonably fault the author for that; the setting and period would not have been done justice had everything turned out well.)<br />For those unfamiliar with the series, the Comte de Saint Germain is a vampire who has \\"lived\\" since approximately 1500 BC; he has many of the typical features of the stereotypical vampire; he doesn't age, is difficult to injure, and needs to drink blood to survive. But unlike the stereotype, he doesn't kill with his blood-drinking, and blood itself is not sufficient; there must be an emotional connection as well, and the less emotional connection there is, the less satisfying the blood is. He can be killed by severing the spine or destroying the brain; other wounds are painful, but ultimately superficial. He is susceptable to sunlight, but less so than many vampires; he doesn't care for it, but hardly bursts into flame on exposure. Essentially, he sunburns easily. Similarly, he cannot rest unless it is on his native soil, and cannot cross running water. All of these prohibitions, however, are alleviated by the expedient of wearing his native soil in the soles of his shoes, using it in the foundation of any home he builds, and filling his mattress with it, so he CAN, in fact, be seen in broad daylight in the Mediterranean summer on shipboard.<br />The character is an unmitigated hero, not the antihero of most vampire fiction; wealthy, urbane, kind, generous, most worthy of emulation.

That it would render \\"Love thy neighbor as thyself\\" less meaningful if he did not, literally, feed a multitude with a few loaves and fishes.

In spite of the fact that this particular plotline ended with a serious message, and was tied up rather nicely all things considered, still it is apparent that it was supposed to provide the comic relief for the story; as such, it was not unlike many similar concepts used during various episodes of the series, so at least I have to give Crispin credit for being true to the characters as established for the show. But just as was true in MANY of the similar \\"Data makes a fool of himself trying to be human\\" stories that aired, not only was this one NOT funny, it was downright PAINFUL to watch. I fail to understand how any author (who has no doubt experienced the insecurity of asking for the opinion of friends about her writing, as well as being asked for her opinion about the writing of others, and the extreme difficulty of treading the line between being dishonest or downright cruel) could POSSIBLY think that there was ANYTHING funny in this scenerio.<br />On the other hand, if it WASN'T intended to be funny, then we run into the same problem that Troi ran into in critiquing Data's work: if something that was meant to be serious is percieved as being comedy (even failed comedy) then there's something seriously wrong with it.<br />Much of this book was well worth reading; if you're a fan of the subplots in which Data strives futilely (and painfully) to mimic human creativity, you'll no doubt love this one.

I expected a book written by committee to be sincerely bad. The four authors in question are all good enough to rescue this book from that fate, but almost any book by any one of them is better than this one.<br />Frankly, I thought that the concept was weak; I've read and enjoyed other &quot;shared world&quot; books, notably the &quot;Thieves' World&quot; series and the &quot;Wild Cards&quot; series, but in this case, ALL writing in the Star Trek universe already has all the advantages of such a concept, and I think that, left to themselves, we'd probably have gotten a novel at least as good as this one from EACH of these writers in the time it took us to get this one from the four of them.<br />The one possible reason for writing a novel this way is that it is potentially more fun for the authors than writing solo. I can see no other reason for the concept. Hopefully, having gotten this out of their systems, they'll go back to doing what they do best: writing solo.	2002-09-16

Or in this case, the man writing the blurb for the back cover, which apparently was based on a VERY early rough draft/plot synopsis, which bore VERY little resemblance to the eventual story.<br />The actual story is intriguing, one of the best I've seen. There are a couple of caveats: I HATE cliffhanger endings, so that's why I docked the book one star; if you don't share my dislike of stories that end &quot;to be continued&quot; without resolving any plot points, then consider this a five-star rating. Other than that, my major caveat is that the claim in this book is that at this point in time, Uhura ranked Sulu, and was fourth in the Enterprise chain-of-command after Kirk, Spock, and Scotty. This is clearly not canonical; Uhura was not in command-track at all, and while it's possible that Sulu wasn't yet fourth in the food chain, Uhura was certainly not ahead of him.<br />But this is a minor quibble, and one I'm willing to overlook, given how good the story is. I must admit, I'll be interested to see how the author gets them out of the corner s/he's painted them into; this really is a proper cliffhanger, as it certainly seems like there's no likely way out, but we KNOW that they get out of it, as the story is set early in the first five-year mission, just after the episode &quot;The Naked Time&quot;. Or just before it, depending on how you look at it, given that at the end of that episode (and the beginning of this book) the Enterprise has just been accidentally timeslipped three days into the past.	2002-09-13

Like many of the books in the Vampire Chronicles (\\"Interview With The Vampire\\", \\"Pandora\\", The Vampire Armand\\") the majority of the plot is flashback/backhistory for the purpose of character development. And as with Louis in \\"Interview\\", the title character is well worth developing, a fascinating character (although I must say I was disappointed by her actions near the end of the book; they didn't seem to be in character as it was established in the rest of the story.) But there is very little current plot, although more than in any of the others mentioned earlier. Far, far less, say, than in \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", \\"Queen of the Damned\\", \\"Tale of the Body Thief\\" or \\"Memnoch the Devil\\". Less than 100 pages out of 370 are devoted to things that ARE happening, rather than recounting things that happened years ago (that admittedly have much bearing on what is happening now, but still...).<br />Also, the writing (or at least, the proofreading) is sloppier than I remember it being in any previous installations of this series; ignoring the \\"...the sky grew ever more lighter\\" on pages 254-255, which is the kind of error I've come to accept as inevitable (if annoying) in modern mass-market paperbacks, Rice can't seem to keep track of her own characters' names. Several times, she refers to a character who she's introduced as \\"Matthew\\" as \\"Michael\\". Perhaps she changed her mind on the name in mid-writing, and failed to ferret them all out with the edit function on her word processing program. But this sort of sloppiness is really inexcusable in a writer of Rice's stature; it suggests to me that she's getting sloppy, and coasting on her laurels.<br />This book was definitely more interesting than \\"Pandora\\" or \\"Armand\\", and didn't actively annoy me as much as \\"Tale of the Body Thief\\" (a rant for a different day) but is less interesting than any other books in the series. If you're a big fan of the series, obviously, you don't need me to tell you that you want to read it.

Not a bad book, but definitely not one of David's best; he clearly fell in love with the character of Stone, who I found obnoxious and annoying. I simply could not find it in me to understand why this was supposed to be a sympathetic character. Nor was it plausible that a character with his problems would have passed psych profiles, much less been able to read as &quot;sane&quot; to Deanna Troi. The man as portrayed was clearly pathological.<br />Other than that, the writing was, as usual for David, excellent.	2002-09-09

The parts of this novel that involve flashbacks to Janeway's past are fascinating; they are obviously the main thrust of the story. And what's even better is that, given that the book is written by &quot;the co-creator and executive producer of the TV series&quot;, we can be reasonably confident that this biographical information is actually canonical, unlike, for instance, &quot;Best Destiny&quot;, a novel that did much the same sort of thing with Kirk from the original series. Unfortunately, they are embedded in a &quot;normal&quot; Voyager story, involving the adventures of the Starship Voyager and the full complement of its crew, as they make their way home from the Delta quadrant. Both this &quot;current&quot; story, and the excuse for our seeing Janeway's past history (she's experiencing flashback dreams) were weak at best, and for most of the book, exceptionally weak. So on balance, the book is worth reading, but only for the background scenes, plus maybe the last chapter or two of the current story.<br />The book would have been improved immensely if it had simply been written as a life story of Katherine Janeway, with no actual &quot;Voyager&quot; story to detract from it.	2002-09-01

He was, if you ask this biographer. Not only were his motives always pure, honest, and honorable, but his abilities unmatched. If only his political rivals had simply crowned him King and allowed him to run things as he wished, we'd never have had the Great Depression, and if they'd failed to do so until it started, he could still have ended it sooner and less painfully if only vicious, unscrupulous opponents hadn't refused to follow his wise advice. The closest Lyons is able to come to saying anything bad about Hoover is to admit that he wasn't a good politician, a perfect example of praising with faint damns.<br />Now, granted, Hoover was unfairly tarred with the responsibility for many of the terrible things that happened &quot;on his watch&quot;, things that can in no way be attributed to any action of his, and which he couldn't possibly have prevented. Writing in 1964, Lyons, an admitted Hoover supporter and admirer, was attempting to counter years of unfair negative image, and I'll admit that it's interesting to hear the other side. But even he admits that he overdoes it; in his final subchapter, he says as much:<br />&quot;It is altogether likely that in these pages I have been betrayed by ardor into overstatement...(r)eading reams of unconscionable spite aimed at Hoover...one is driven to compensatory bias in his favor.&quot;<br />Understandable, and if all you've ever heard of Hoover is the negatives, it might be worth reading this book for a counterweight. But if you do, be aware that that is what it is: a counterweight to negative bias. It is most assuredly NOT a balanced, evenhanded historical document. Which is a shame, because it's hard enough to find biographies of Hoover that it would be nice if this one were more worthwhile. It reads like the biographies written for young people of our founding fathers, in which Washington, or Franklin, or some other such historical character, is portrayed as a larger-than-life, perfect hero, the kind of biographies that lose their appeal once one is over the age of ten or so.fe, perfect hero, the kind of biographies that lose their appeal once one is over the age of ten or so.	2002-08-31

Which is a shame, because the basic idea had potential: Star Trek meets Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". And the writing wasn't completely hopeless; as the story progressed, I did find myself caring what happened next, and moved by the fate of the characters. But there were too many flaws for a high rating; the entire subplot of Deanna Troi's visions/hallucinations was superfluous and pointless, and the concept that the planetary culture that the Enterprise was in conflict with could have provided as much of a challenge as they did required too much supension of disbelief for my taste.<br />Not the worst Star Trek book I've ever read by a long shot, but definitely on the weak end of the scale.	2002-08-25

The first book in this series, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", was a classic, one of my favorite books of all time. Each book in the series has failed to live up to the preceding book, but up until this one, they were all still excellent. This one is a pleasant read for a fan of the series; it's like a visit with family. It's good to see more of Ayla and Jondalar, but not overly exciting. And it doesn't help that there was an ELEVEN YEAR hiatus between the previous book and this one, producing the reaction, \\"We waited eleven years for THIS?\\"<br />It's tempting to say that nothing happens in this book, but that wouldn't be accurate. Not even that nothing important happens. After all, Ayla and Jondalar get married, and have a child, and Ayla is accepted by Jondalar's people, and decides to become a shaman. All of these things are important events, not only to the people involved, but to the plotline of the series. But it WOULD be very close to accurate to say that nothing EXCITING happens in this book.<br />In the first book of the series, Ayla survives an earthquake as a five-year old, survives wandering alone for days, survives being attacked by a cave lion, learns to live with a completely alien group of people, teaches herself to hunt, to survive on her own, and to swim, and is taught how to be a healer. She saves lives, challenges tradition, and faces down her enemy in a gripping scene at the end of the book.<br />In the second book in the series, she survives for years on her own, learns to make fire with flint, tames a horse and a cave lion, saves the life of her soul mate, falls in love, relearns how to speak verbally, and invents a new hunting tool (with a little help from Jondalar.) (And learns that sex can be fun.) Meanwhile, Jondalar is surviving a cross-continent journey with his brother, experiencing many narrow escapes and new things, loses his brother and almost dies.<br />The third book sees her tame a wolf, and sees the relationship between her and Jondalar tested; she meets new people for the first time, and learns to deal with difficult ones.<br />The fourth book sees the two of them survive an encounter with a madwoman with political power, and set to rights the culture that that woman had warped to her own liking, and help a neanderthal couple defend themselves from a gang of young toughs.<br />So what's the most exciting thing that happens in THIS book? The incident in which Ayla FAILS to heal someone too badly mauled to save? The healing of someone with a badly broken leg? Or the meeting of people who don't like her, and whom she's presumably eventually going to have to win over? None of these are gripping dramas, but they're the closest that this book has to offer.

Books being commissioned and published that do not fit into the planned continuity of the series. Or worse, not HAVING a planned continuity, and having a right hand (the TV producers) which neither knows nor cares what the left hand (the book publishers) are doing.<br />This is hardly the only published Star Trek book which has been made non-canonical by later developments in one or another of the series. And it isn't fair to blame Friedman for the fact that his book is defined as wrong less than 2 years after it's published. But it isn't fair to the Star Trek fan, either, to have a &quot;prehistory&quot; of the Star Trek universe that is simply incompatible with what the series &quot;Enterprise&quot; has established. I realize that, by definition, the books are considered non-canonical, and only what shows up onscreen is canonical. But it would be nice if the two were kept a bit more consistent.<br />As such, this is a perfectly okay book for casual fans of Star Trek, who enjoy the concepts, but neither know nor care enough about the series to be annoyed by inconsistencies. The true fan will consider this to be, at best, an interesting &quot;parallel universe&quot; story, and at worst an interesting science fiction story which does not, in spite of similarities, have anything to do with Star Trek.	2002-08-19

Peter David explains in his introduction that in writing this book, he was working under a handicap: the characters hadn't been very well-defined by the time he was assigned the task. Given that, he did an admirable job of anticipating the characterizations that would eventually become canonical. Still, the feel was a little bit off. Also, while David does manage to maintain his usual ability to write with humor even while writing a very serious plot, the plot is a little too dark for my taste, and the violence a little too graphic. This is definitely not one of David's better efforts, in fact it's the weakest book by him that I've yet encountered. But even his worst is fair to middling.	2002-08-19

A story does not become as well-known and a part of the culture as this book has become without tapping in to some serious veins of the social subconscious. It is a fascinating idea, with a balance that allows for many hours of debate as to the relative merits of the monster and his creator, as well as the relative merits of the options facing Dr. Frankenstein, and whether the option he ultimately chose was the most ethical one or not. Still, much of the writing style itself is rather weak; there are places where it really shows that Shelley was only nineteen when she wrote it. Particularly given that the story is essentially told in the first person from the perspective of Dr. Frankenstein, in his voice, the fact that Shelley's dialogue is stilted and awkward is a real drawback. I realize that by the standards of 19th century fiction, the dialogue is not as poorly written as it would seem in a modern book, (dialogue was in general not a strong point in 19th century fiction) but even by those standards, the dialogue here is weak. Still, the concept is too good to rate less than four stars.	2002-08-09

This fourth book of the series, in terms of the order in which they were written, was at the time it was written the second in terms of internal chronology; the first book, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\", was set in 1700s France. The second, \\"The Palace\\", was set in late 1400s Italy. The third, \\"Blood Games\\", was set in first century Rome. This one is set in 1200s Asia, ranging from China to India.<br />I was somewhat disappointed by this book; it started well and ended well, but dragged rather badly in the middle. Really, it should have been two separate books, as there were two female romantic leads, one early, one late, and my biggest complaint with the book is the abrupt death of the apparent female lead a third of the way into the book; the character deserved better treatment. Mind you, I don't object to the concept of Saint-Germain losing a lover; I understand that it's part of the character concept; an immortal vampire suffers a continuing series of losses of that sort throughout his life. But the character was good enough to deserve a climactic death at the end of a book, rather than being disposed of in mid-book, in a senseless and wasted death. And the second female lead was an interesting enough character, also, to deserve a book all her own, rather than first appearing 2/3 of the way through the book.<br />On the other hand, both of these characters were nice deviations from the \\"damsel in distress\\" pattern we'd seen previously for Saint-Germain's lovers, and that's a definite plus as far as I'm concerned (although if part of what you like about the series is the \\"hero rescues damsel in distress\\" shtick that we've seen previously, you may be disappointed in this one).<br />Then again, back on the negative \\"hand\\", the villains in this book are even more cardboard than we've seen previously in the series; there's nothing wrong with having stories with clear-cut divisions between good and evil, as Yarbro consistently does, but it helps if your villains are at least fleshed out sufficiently that the reader can fathom what it is that THEY think they're accomplishing. It was one thing to have the Mongol hordes be an implacable, mindless force (certainly, that's how they were perceived by their enemies historically) but the worshipper of the goddess Kali was simply a nutcase, with no more rationale given for her evil than that she was crazy, and no rationale at all given for WHY she was crazy. Now, I realize that there ARE people like that in the world, but it's a cheap out to use in fiction. Generally, even unabashedly evil characters should have SOME reasonable explanation for their actions; this book is the weakest of the series so far in that regard.<br />On the other hand again, I really liked the ending. (I can't tell you more without making for an inexcusable spoiler.)<br />As you can no doubt tell, I had mixed emotions about this book, so a three star rating seems about right.leshed out sufficiently that the reader can fathom what it is that THEY think they're accomplishing.

One of the biggest flaws in the Star Trek universe, for some time now, has been the obvious conflict between the &quot;history&quot; that the series posited for the period 20 years or so in advance of when it was created and what we've since seen; it seems that the Star Trek timeline is more and more clearly not our own. After all, in &quot;Space Seed&quot;, it was claimed that there were &quot;Eugenics Wars&quot; in the 1990s, when Khan and his people tried to take over the earth, and failed, only to escape in the &quot;sleeper ship&quot; that they were found in by Kirk and crew. Last I checked, that doesn't match the 1990s history that I remember.<br />Greg Cox to the recue; the obvious intention of this book is to rationalize away that inconsistency. He's trying to (and mostly, succeeding in) writing a story in which those events actually DID occur, but have remained (so far, at least) top-secret and unknown to us folks not privy to the real behind-the-scenes goings on in world politics. A marvellous concept, and if he continues to pull it off as well as he has so far, I'll be delighted.<br />So why only four stars? Two reasons, really. Neither of them major complaints, but cumulatively worth a star.<br />First of all, while I realize that when you buy a book that says &quot;volume one&quot; on the cover, you can expect that there's a reasonably good chance that it won't be a complete story in itself, that doesn't mean that it has to end on a cliffhanger. Cliffhanger endings are annoying, amatuerish, and cheesy. ESPECIALLY when you have two completely separate plotlines going on, each good enough to stand on its own, so there is no NEED to make it a continued story. Tell the two stories separately, and be done with it!<br />Secondly, the two stories alluded to above make a &quot;frame story&quot;; there are goings on with Kirk and the Enterprise that cause Kirk to decide to refresh his memory of the events of the Eugenics wars, and what we see of that history is apparently supposed to be what he sees as he brushes up on that part of history. But the events we see are almost exclusively things that WOULDN'T have made it into history books; Gary Seven's activities would certainly nver have been publicized, nor would several of the activities of Khan that we see here. It is POSSIBLE that Cox may have an explanation of this latter complaint (Star Fleet/Federation history may be more thorough than one would expect on the subject; perhaps Gary Seven allowed his notes to be opened after some specific date) (presumably, AFTER the point in their own timeline when Kirk and company originally encountered him, otherwise, they'd have been prepared to encounter him in the first place -- can you say &quot;temporal paradox&quot;?) but it will take some really fast talking to make any such explanation plausible.<br />Highly recommended.apparently supposed to be what he sees as he brushes up on that part of history.

As I've said before, Peter David is unquestionably the best author of Star Trek novels extant. This is because he is capable of telling a dramatic, moving, action-packed story WITHOUT LOSING HIS SENSE OF HUMOR. This is what separates great Trek from good Trek. It is also what is absolutely necessary to tell a good story that involves Q.<br />I've never been fond of the character of Q, because very few of the Q stories managed to successfully walk that tightrope. Most fail to see the humor in the character entirely, but if Q is written without humor, as a &quot;villain&quot;, then there's no explanation for why he doesn't simply wipe the Enterprise (and perhaps humanity) out of existence. And those stories that saw the humor inherent in the character generally lost all sense of drama.<br />Leave it to Peter David to be able to tread that very thin line, and write a dramatic, compelling story involving Q without losing a bit of the potential for humor.<br />If you're not a Star Trek fan in good standing, you'll miss a great many of the references to various episodes, but that shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of the story being told here. But if you ARE, it will be truly amazing how David manages to tie in so many existing stories that were (apparently) unrelated, remaining true to all of them, but making it all work. &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; and &quot;Squire of Gothos&quot; from the original series, &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Encounter At Farpoint&quot; from TNG, are only the most obvious examples.	2002-07-22

Mostly, if there are any flaws in the information, they are beyond my poor ability to spot (I seem to remember noticing one or two, but can't remember any specifics at this point.)<br />The book is useful, but could certainly use a bit of polishing.	2002-07-20

His &quot;New Frontier&quot; series is a delight to read, with excellent plot, characterization, humor, and competent writing.<br />That being said, (and as I said about the first book of this series) this book wasn't really one of his better efforts. Granted, his &quot;off day&quot; is better than most writers' best, but still...<br />We're two books into the series, and still, it feels like we're just setting the table. I'd really like to have seen more happening by now. And again, we end on a cliffhanger, something that I really hate. (Honest, I promise I'll buy the next book without a cliffhanger ending if the writing is good, and if it isn't, the cliffhanger isn't going to help, because I won't CARE what happens next.)<br />Also, and this is just a personal preference, but I've always HATED the character of Shelby, so I could have really been much happier if she wasn't involved, but at least she's mostly being used for contrast between the &quot;cowboy&quot; Captain Calhoun and her own straightlaced, annoying self. I hope David doesn't start working at making her TOO sympathetic a character; I really DON'T want to start liking her.<br />Definitely worth reading, but there's still plenty of room for improvement. Hopefully, things will start picking up in the next couple of books.	2002-07-18

This book is much better; one assumes that the author has matured a bit as a writer in the interim. It utilizes a plot device that is unduly common: Kirk &amp; the Enterprise must save the entire universe. But unlike most books that use such a device, this one actually manages to make it more or less plausible, and handles the concept well. Further, the characters are well-written, and the language is handled with a smooth competence unusual in mass-market paperbacks. The plot moves well, and the book accomplishes all that it sets out to.<br />Excellent read for the Star Trek fan, and probably worthwhile for the casual reader, as well.	2002-07-17

The first, &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot;, took place in mid-1700s France; the second, &quot;The Palace&quot;, in late 1400s Italy. This one takes place in the first century of the common era, in imperial Rome during the time of Nero and a bit later. There are something over a dozen books in the series all told, plus a few spinoffs of books about Olivia Clemens and Madeline, two of Saint Germain's lovers who become vampires themselves.<br />The series so far has been quite good; I continue to feel somewhat guilty for not rating the books higher than I do. But there is the continuing stylistic affectation of placing a piece of correspondence after every chapter, which I continue to find minorly distracting, and there is a scene in this book that seems to be simply out of character as it has been so far defined for the main character. We have been given to understand that many of the traditional legends of the weaknesses of vampires, such as the inability to cross running water and the inability to withstand sunlight, are conditionally true in the world of Saint Germain; that is to say, they are true, but can be overcome so long as he stands upon his &quot;native soil&quot;, so he has learned to wear special shoes that are hollow and filled with soil from the land of his birth. Yet in this story, when deprived of his special shoes and forced to fight giant crocodiles at midday during a blisteringly hot Roman summer day in the arena, (in water) while constantly commenting on how ill and unwell  this makes him feel, he's still able to function well enough to slay several crocs and survive. (It's not giving away critical plot points to reveal his survival, considering that he exists in the previous two books of the series, both of which occur historically later than this one). He doesn't, as near as I can tell, even get a sunburn. This is just so far out of line that I feel the need to dock the book a star just for this one scene; otherwise, the book is quite well written.<br />If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction, you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books.

Granted, there is enough serious philosophizing to satisfy the intelligensia, but the action and bawdy humor would surely satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they understood it. Unfortunately, while the plots are good enough to be lifted and reworked into modern movies (and they frequently are, sometimes more subtly than others) once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. So far, that hasn't happened, and I don't expect it to any time soon.<br />As Shakespearean plays go, \\"The Tempest\\" is a fairly easy read. There are a few places where the footnotes are absolutely essential, and a few others where the main thrust can be grasped without them, but a double-entendre might be missed. But by and large, the play is readable for the literate modern reader. Granted, the romance element is as shallow as it usually is in Shakespeare, and there really isn't much drama: there's never any real doubt that Prospero and Ariel have matters well in hand. Still, it's an amusing comic romp, and that's all it was ever really intended to be. Don't try to read too many levels of symbolism and allegory into this play (or any other of Shakespeare's comedies, for that matter).

Still, the plot is a classic one, the dialogue is still (in spite of its occasional impenetrability) sparkling, and it has a remarkably high amount of (admittedly dark) humor for a classic tragedy; the scenes in which Hamlet acts the manic fool in order to keep his own counsel are delightfully funny (to say nothing of the gravediggers, and the verbal sparring between them and Hamlet.)<br />One of the many \\"must read\\" Shakespearean plays.

Other reviewers have complained that this book gives too brief a treatment to Jefferson's presidential and post-presidential years, and certainly, if you're interested in a thorough study of Jefferson's presidency, this isn't the book for you. But it is, after all, called &quot;Thomas Jefferson: A Life&quot;, not &quot;Thomas Jefferson: A President&quot;. About 50 pages are devoted to the eight years of Jefferson's presidency, out of a touch less than 600 pages. Not an unreasonable percentage to devote to eight years out of a touch over eighty. Granted, his post-presidential years are skimmed over quite briefly, and could have been given a bit more attention, but it's a minor quibble.<br />The major quibble is that the writing style can get a bit ponderous at times; I occasionally found myself struggling to keep my eyes open if at all drowsy.

This is certainly a tolerable children's book, better than many. But for someone familiar with and fond of the movie (and aren't we all?) this is quite a disappointment. Generally, I find the book version to be superior to the movie, so, given how much I love the movie version of this story, it was with great anticipation that I finally got around to reading it. Unfortunately, this is one of those rare occasions in which the movie is vastly superior to the book. The book is written in a style not too different from the fairie tales of Hans Christian Anderson (definitely more his than the Brothers Grimm); that is to say, it's very straightforward, with little or nothing in the way of style to embellish the basic story. The dialogue is bland, the plot without nuance or embellishment, the characters only a little better than wooden and one-dimensional. Which is okay for a book that is intended purely as a children's story, but given the humor, nuance, and characterization found in the movie which was based on this story, I'd expected more; I'd expected it to be one of those \\"children's stories\\" that was still entertaining to an adult.

This book, written before the airing of the DS9 episode &quot;Crossover&quot;, is a sequel to the original series episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;. As such, it details what has happened in the mirror universe between Kirk's time and that of the later Trek series; unfortunately, her back-history is radically different from that in the canonical DS9 episode. So what we clearly have, is a DIFFERENT parallel universe. Different from the one in the DS9 series, and different from the one in later novels, notably William Shatner's trilogy, &quot;Spectre&quot;, &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, and &quot;Preserver&quot;, as well as the &quot;Dark Passions&quot; duology by Susan Wright, all of which follow the canonical DS9 history. If one accepts this concept, then the story works just fine. It is well-written, well-concieved, and well-executed, and is excellent in its own right. Granted, I find the concept of a parallel universe extremely dubious; every time someone does something different, it would alter the path of history a little bit, and soon it would be so different that there would be no parallel.

The episode/s that this book is based on were better than average episodes, so the story is pretty good (except for the ending, which utilizes a very trite and overused plot device which I probably can't describe further without giving away too much of the ending.) But what Diane Carey did to this reasonably good story when it was entrusted to her ought to be a criminal offense, as should entrusting a novelization of a Star Trek episode to the worst Star Trek writer currently published, bar none.<br />Ms. Carey has always had a tendancy to try too hard to reach for \\"clever and creative\\" in her use of language, and generally succeeds only in achieving \\"wrong, distracting, and silly\\". But she's much worse in this book than she has been in most of her previous efforts, which is a shame because she actually has a good feel for characterization, pacing, and (when the story's her own, which it isn't here) plot. If she could ever grow up and stop trying to be clever, she might actually be a competent writer.

For those already familiar with the series, I will only say that this second book improved slightly on a very good first book, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\". I'm not entirely sure why I liked it better; perhaps the villain was ever so slightly less cardboard (A medieval religious fanatic, rather than a diabolist) or perhaps the romantic angle was slightly less like a Gothic romance; it seemed more plausible that Saint-Germain's romantic interest was more than a bit nervous about the whole vampire concept, instead of embracing it as whole-heartedly as Madeline did in the first book. But whatever the reason, I enjoyed this book somewhat more than I did \\"Hotel Transylvania\\".<br />For those not yet familiar with the series, an introduction is in order: \\"The Palace\\" is the second of on the order of a dozen (so far) novels of Saint-Germain, who is a vampire. He is one of the first of the modern \\"good guy\\" vampires, an unequivocal hero rather than an antihero or a sympathetic villain, the more traditional roles for a vampire. At least in these first two books, there is definitely more than a taste of the \\"historical romance\\" to the books, so if you enjoy that genre, you should certainly enjoy these (unless you just don't care for vampires, and even then, I'd suggest giving them a try.) Each book is set in a different historical period, and they don't progress in any sort of historical order; the first is set in mid-1700s France; this one, technically a prequel, is set in late 1400s Italy. The history seems to this only moderately informed reader to be extremely good, but it wouldn't take much to fool my knowledge of the period, so I can't say how accurate they actually are. And the writing is quite good, even if I still don't much care for the artifice of beginning and ending of each chapter with a piece of correspondence.<br />If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction, you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books: while not without angst, Saint-Germain is remarkably well-adjusted for someone who has seen all the suffering that he has, who has been as alienated as he presumably has been for as long as he has been. There are only a passing few mild \\"sex/blood drinking\\" scenes, and less of the mysterious than is usually found in the genre. But if you like historical romance, or even historical fiction generally, and don't object to the concept of a heroic vampire protagonist, you should find this book, and probably most of this series, quite enjoyable.e vampire genre that are missing from these books: while not without angst, Saint-Germain is remarkably well-adjusted for someone who has seen all the suffering that he has, who has been as alienated as he presumably has been for as long as he has been.

This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL \\"democratic\\" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow.	2002-06-06

It is action-oriented, but has plenty going on behind the action for those who don't read Star Trek purely for action. I'm not generally a fan of Klingons, although I'm finally beginning to accept them as protagonists, so if I speak highly of this book, understand that that's an extremely high recommendation; it isn't as though it's coming from somebody who loves any book focusing on Klingons and their culture.<br />If you're a fan of Klingons, this one can't miss. If you're a Kirk fan, you'll love it. One could quibble, and suggest that the relationship between Kirk and the Klingon commander is too congenial for the time period in which the book is set, but that would be an EXTREMELY picky quibble.	2002-05-28

I could have justified giving this book two stars, or even three. It is, after all, well and cleverly written. It is seductive, easy to get caught up into the plot and hard to resist caring about the characters, even when your head tells you that you REALLY don't even marginally like any of them. Also, there are parts of Rand's \\"philosophy\\" that are undeniably true, and need to be heard in the modern world. But she's made it clear that she prefers honest hatred to indifference, so I'll do her that much courtesy.<br />The biggest problem with this book is the \\"romantic interest\\", a term which I use advisedly. The main character is supposed to be Rand's concept of the ideal man; one must therefore assume that the female lead must be the ideal woman for such a man (after all, if he's ideal, he wouldn't fall for just anybody, right?) and their relationship must also be ideal.<br />That relationship begins with him raping her. No, this is not an exaggeration, it isn't date rape, it's actual, honest-to goodness, no mistake or confusion rape. But that's okay, because it's only what she secretly wanted from him, and certainly what she had coming; she was, after all, a snotty rich woman who'd treated him with a lack of respect just because he was (so far as she knew) a common laborer.<br />Does anybody else out there see a problem with this concept? How about the fact that she spent the rest of the book trying to convince herself that she deserved him, because his treatment of her earned her worship?<br />There are other problems with the philosophy expressed in this book, as if there's actually any need for MORE reasons. But this one is sufficient in itself to make the book utterly worthless, in spite of the validity of SOME of its message. Those parts of the message can be found in other books that do not have the baggage that this one carries. I recommend \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" by Ken Kesey.	2002-05-27

This novel, the first &quot;Enterprise&quot; spinoff to be out in paperback, (second overall only to the novelization of the pilot episode, &quot;Broken Bow&quot;) was a reasonably pleasant quick read, and about two thirds of it was a perfectly acceptable if unexceptional plot. The characters were handled well, especially given that they haven't really been established all that clearly on the show itself yet, and the dialogue was handled well.<br />The biggest problem with the book was the roughly one-third of it that was devoted to the role-playing game four of the characters (five, if you count Hoshi, who was going to be involved but wound up too busy with her duties to play) played during their leisure time. I realize what the intention was here; it was to establish characters by showing us what they do for fun, and how they interact. In other words, it served the same purpose (allegedly) as the chess games between Kirk and Spock on the original series, or the holodeck stories in Next Generation. And to a limited extent, it accomplished what it was meant to accomplish; it did give us something of a look into the personality of Travis Mayweather, as well as a few more minor characters. But like the holodeck bits on Next Generation, and unlike the glimpses we got of chess games between Kirk and Spock, it was given far too major an emphasis; the purpose to this sort of thing is to give us some insight into the characters' personality WITHOUT taking up a major portion of the book. I didn't think that anything could be worse than watching characters in a television show play characters in a holodeck game, but I was wrong; reading about characters playing a role-playing game with dice was definitely worse, and it wasn't helped by the (admittedly very plausible) fact that, as novice gamers playing under a novice gamemaster, their game was poorly run and poorly played.<br />I sincerely hope that that plot device is NOT repeated in future books.	2002-05-07

There are a few caveats, however, which is why it was only given four stars, rather than five:<br />First, if your interest in vampire fiction is in traditional supernatural vampires, this will disappoint you. The vampirism is treated in a very scientific way, and those \\"infected\\" show no supernatural abilities beyond seeing in the dark. It is a very interesting science fiction explanation of vampirism, however.<br />Second, and most critically, we once again run into the overused plot device of the rogue conspiracy at the highest levels of Starfleet, and idea that would be interesting if it were rare, but has been overused so badly that it just can't be used anymore. Further, although for a good part of the book, this particular plot device was actually handled better than it generally is, toward the end of the book, it wasn't even handled well. The personality of the admiral at the center of the conspiracy was handled inconsistently and implausibly.<br />Had it not been for the use of this plot device, I'd unquestionably have given the book five stars. A much better book than \\"Demons\\", Dillard's previous Star Trek novel, which also brought some horror concepts into Star Trek, but much less successfully.	2002-05-06

For those unfamiliar with the Man-Kzin Wars series, or Kzinti in general, the Kzin are an alien race created by Larry Niven, a spacefaring race evolved from carnivorous hunting cats instead of omnivorous monkeys. They mass about 500 pounds and are about 8 feet tall, and are about as dangerous hand-to hand as a jaguar would be. Their culture is a warrior culture, with no respect or tolerance for pacifistic philosophy. The only thing that keeps them from completely subjugating humanity is their tendancy to be overconfident and unsubtle. (Subtlety, to their warrior mentality, is dishonorable, and fortunately for the humans, most Kzinti buy into the old death-before-dishonor concept.)<br />This series is a series of collections of short-to-mid length stories, mostly written by authors other than Niven, based in the world he created and about the conflicts between humans and Kzin. This book is one of the best of the lot, although the writing itself in the second story, \\"Telepath's Dance\\" by Hal Colebatch, (a story with some interesting concepts) was sloppy and error-filled. Given that this was true of none of the other stories in the collection, I must attribute it to the author, rather than to poor copyediting, although I suppose good copyediting might have prevented the errors from making it into the final product.<br />Although this is the eighth book of the series, it would be perfectly reasonable for someone who's read none of the other books in the series to start with this one, as all of the stories are set early in the hostory of the conflicts, including one that occurs long before humanity ever met Kzinti, the only such story in the entire eight-book series.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, Kzinti telepaths play at least a small part in all five stories, and a large part in four of them.<br />The stories were all interesting, and all but the second were well-written. Definitely worth reading.	2002-05-01

His &quot;New Frontier&quot; series looks like it will be a very enjoyable, very well-done series.<br />That being said, book one really wasn't one of his better efforts. (Granted, his &quot;off day&quot; is better than most writers' best, but still...) There are a couple of places where his language is a little clumsy, the first time I've ever seen that in his work, and this book is just a &quot;setting the table&quot; book, that doesn't really go anywhere, just prepares us for the following stories that presumably WILL accomplish something. Worst of all, it lets off on a cliffhanger ending, something that I despise and will almost always dock a book one star for.<br />However, the characters look fascinating, and as usual, David manages to write a fast-moving plot with no hint of the spoof to it (unlike, say, &quot;How Much For Just The Planet&quot;) that nonetheless has a marvellous sense of the tongue in cheek to it. That's what makes David the best: he can tell a dramatic plot while still maintaining a sense of humor.	2002-04-26

This is one of those books that almost anyone who's grown up in this country has heard of, but not very many have actually read. If this applies to you, given that it's available from Dover Thrift Editions for a buck and a half, there's no reason not to rectify that situation. It's essential to an understanding of the thought that formed our country.<br />That having been said, it's not as enjoyable a read as I'd hoped it would be; it's good, but I'd expected better. Some of Paine's points are spot-on undeniable; his arguments against a hereditary monarchy can't be refuted. But some of his claims are less clearly true, and like political polemicists of all ages, he gives no respect to opposing arguments, even when there is a legitimate cause for debate. Further, his political theory is naive and childish in places; he describes a hypothetical situation in which a small group is stranded on an island, with no established society or government, and claims that said group will obviously, by nature, develop a democratic government. This would be true, if one assumed that all members of the group had similar backgrounds and abilities, perhaps, but far more likely, they would find themselves led in short order by the (ideally) most competent member of the group, or (more likely) by the strongest or most persuasive.That this would be true even now is probable, even with the socialization we've all had in democratic principles. At the time he was writing, it would have been even more certain, given that people were NOT accustomed to assuming a democracy.<br />Still, one can quibble over details in his arguments, without failing to acknowledge that reading Paine is essential for any student of American history. No one can claim to understand our country's formation without having read this short book.	2002-04-25

On the one hand, I am no fan of the writing of Diane Carey; in this book, as she frequently does, she tries very hard to make creative use of the language, and generally fails miserably, succeeding only in using words incorrectly. Her idea of creative description is much like that of Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carrol; she insists that words mean whatever she intends them to mean, rather than what their actual definitions are, or even what a reasonable person would consider a plausible connotation. (She continues to insist that &quot;sniggering&quot; can be used when one means &quot;niggling&quot;, for example, the third book of hers in which I've seen this usage.)<br />On the plus side, her strength has always been in her plot ideas and her characters, and both of those trends, too, continued in this book. Her characters are fascinating, her plot classic Trek, and the philosophical debate that made for a large part of the creative tension of the book was actually handled well and evenhandedly, and did nothing to detract from the action of the book.<br />On the down side again, there is the drawback that all books in this &quot;Gateways&quot; series will have, presumably until the last installment: they will all end on a cliffhanger, rather than being self-contained stories.<br />So it's a difficult call: If you don't mind a book with no familiar Star Trek characters (that is, characters from any of the TV series), don't mind a cliffhanger ending, and can tolerate the author's misuse of the language, this book has a good plot and fascinating characters. But if any of those caveats would put you off, by all means, avoid this book.	2002-04-22

For lo, and many in the camp of the fanatical followers of the writings of Tolkien were sore wroth, for the reviewer did have the temerity to say bad things about some of those writings, indicating that the style was ponderous and pretentious, with neither humor nor spark of life to be found in any character anywhere in the book, nor in any jot of the writing beside. Yet did the reviewer compound his heresy, conceding only that there was some minor interest for the true fan in seeing the development of the ideas that went into the formulating of the world that Tolkien eventually created, and that those who, upon reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, do find that the best part of the entire experience is in reading the elvish poetry recited by sundry characters in those books, will undoubtedly be greatly enamored of the present work. Yet did he maintain that the vast majority of those who love those books enjoy them largely for the writing style in which they are told, and will therefore find little or nothing of value in the present work. Further, he did propose the blasphemy that the editor of this volume, one Christopher Tolkien, son of the master, did no favors to his father's legacy by publishing sloppy, immature first drafts of his father's writings for the obvious purpose of cashing in on the name of &quot;Tolkien&quot;, and did further wonder when the volume of shopping lists, notes to remind himself of engagements, comments on the papers of his students, and other sundry scribblings of J.R.R. Tolkien can be expected to be published. And, greatest of the heresies that the reviewer was guilty of, he did suggest that perhaps there was a REASON that these tales were never published, and perhaps it would have been better if some lost tales had never been found.	2002-04-17

Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote stories set in her world of Darkover for something like 30 or 40 years; not surprisingly, the earliest novels were very different from the later ones. For one thing, they were written by someone with a great deal less experience as a writer (and as a person), and for another thing, they were written in a time that what was expected of Science Fiction was very different from what is expected now.<br />In the '60s, most science fiction was still envisioned as juvenile fiction, pulps written for young readers. So \\"The Planet Savers\\", \\"World Wreckers\\", \\"Star Of Danger\\", and \\"Winds of Darkover\\" were interesting, but mostly unrefined novels with a very strong flavor of the pulp sci-fi novel.<br />As time went on, Ms. Bradley evolved as a writer, and what was considered publishable in the science fiction genre also evolved, so the next few novels were somewhat different. \\"Heritage of Hasteur\\", Sharra's Exile\\", and \\"The Bloody Sun\\" were much better than her earliest novels, and at least \\"Heritage\\" and \\"Sharra\\" are still two of her best. But she continued to evolve, and the stories that interested her changed, so people who love her stories from one period don't always enjoy the stories from another period. That's one of the beauties of Darkover, however; it's big enough, and complex enough, that all kinds of stories can be written about it.<br />There are some constants, however: on the down side, Ms. Bradley always has been a trifle sloppy in her copyediting. In this book, that shows up not only in the usual periodic typos that slip through, but in the scene toward the end of the book, in which a character who'd been sent home with a serious injury before the funeral train reached its destination (Hermes) gives a eulogy at the funeral.<br />On the positive side, her characters have always been her strong suit, and this book is no exception. What's more, they actually change and grow, not just within a book, but from book to book as the same characters are seen at different stages of their lives.<br />Interestingly, for most of her career, it was obvious that a big part of what fascinated Ms. Bradley about Darkover was the opportunity it provided for comparing and contrasting a highly technological Federation with an archaic, almost medieval culture. Generally, she found an interesting balance between the two, with Darkovan culture being found lacking in its treatment of women and education, and Federation culture being found wanting in terms of respect for individuality and honor. By this book, it seemed that she'd solved the question of which she found preferable in her own mind; there was no longer anything to recommend the Federation at all, so that Darkover, for all that it still had its failings, won by default.<br />The only real flaw to this book, other than the nit-picking copyediting problems mentioned previously, is that it was left openended enough that she'd obviously intended to tell us more later.But having died, it seems unlikely that she'll ever show us the end to the storyline begun here. Unfortunate, but unavoidable. When you spend almost 40 years writing 21 Darkover novels, sooner or later, you won't get to write the next one.acters are seen at different stages of their lives.<br />Interestingly, for most of her career, it was obvious that a big part of what fascinated Ms. Bradley about Darkover was the opportunity it provided for comparing and contrasting a highly technological Federation with an archaic, almost medieval culture.

It's an obvious concept if you think about it: our automatic thought when we hear the name &quot;Benedict Arnold&quot; is clearly a matter of perspective, not simple truth. The victors write the histories. Had Britain won the war, Arnold would have been, at worst, someone who saw the writing on the wall and got out while the getting was good, and at best, a prodigal son who'd seen the light and returned to the fold, renouncing his treason against king and country.<br />The first beauty of this book is that by simply existing, it forces you TO think about it; most people never do. But beyond that, it gives a meticulous history of the man, admitting his flaws (he was ambitious and more than a bit prickly about what he saw as slurs on his personal honor) but also pointing out the many positives that most Americans are completely unaware of: he was one of the greatest generals in the rebel cause, generous, courageous, honorable, and brilliant. So why did this man turn against the cause he'd fought for? Partly because he was disillusioned by the behavior towards himself and others by what he saw as a congress interested more in political connections than competence in awarding military honors, partly because he came to believe that said congress's incompetence rendered the American cause unwinnable. An error, and a serious one, but one which must be balanced against the fact that his contributions at the battle of Saratoga were largely responsible for the American victory.<br />A fascinating study into a seriously overlooked subject in American history. A must-read.	2002-03-30

It was a difficult decision whether to give this novel four stars or five, and not because it was &quot;somewhere in between&quot;. It was either very specifically four stars, or very specifically five.<br />There is a legitimate school of thought that says that it should get five stars, because it accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish (being a hilariously funny spoof of Star Trek) near-perfectly.<br />There is another school of thought which says that Star Trek is at its best when it manages to maintain a sense of humor about itself, WHILE NONETHELESS TELLING A DRAMATIC STORY. This book succeeds gloriously in maintaining a sense of humor, but fails at actually telling a dramatic story. It makes for an enjoyable read, but it a flawed Star trek novel because it misses the balance between the two.<br />As you can tell by the fact that I ultimately rated it four stars, I'm of the second school of thought. Still, it is a marvellous romp, reminiscent in style of Robert Asperin's &quot;Myth&quot; series.<br />(Of course, there's a third school of thought, which maintains that &quot;THAT'S NOT FUNNY! How dare they mock Star Trek?&quot; But just ignore that school of thought. Unless, of course, you firmly believe that Star Trek should always be taken seriously.)	2002-03-28

This book is the second of a (thus far) four book &quot;series&quot; by the same author involving related plotlines and characters. The first is &quot;Star Trek #18: My Enemy, My Ally&quot;, the third is &quot;Star Trek #95: Swordhunt&quot;, and the last is &quot;Star Trek #96, Honor Blade&quot;. This is a very well-written book, with a reasonably plausible plot, excellent characterizations, and a very interesting back-history of the Romulans told alongside the current story.<br />The only real flaw is that, since this book was written, the &quot;canonical&quot; back-history of the Romulans has been created, and it isn't this one. Worse, the back-history of the first Federation-Romulan war she writes here involves contact between the Federation and the Romulans BEFORE contact was made between the Federation and the Vulcans, and that's CLEARLY wrong. But it isn't really fair to hold this author responsible for that; she wrote her history first, it simply wasn't accepted by the canonical writers.<br />The only other thing that needs to be mentioned is that some Star Trek readers will doubtless be unhappy with the fact that the ONLY Enterprise regular that we see in this book is McCoy. Some will doubtless consider this a failing; I found it kind of refreshing. Not that I don't enjoy the other characters, but there's no reason why ALL Star Trek stories have to include Kirk and Spock. They've had their share of books in which they get the lion's share of the action, and McCoy appears little or not at all. No reason not to feature him for a change.	2002-03-27

The idea that philosophy is useful and underutilized in our culture is certainly true enough. The concept that some people who philosophy might be able to help may need someone experienced in philosophy to help them get started is a defensible enough idea. And the author makes occasional disclaimers mouthing the appropriate words, admitting that psychiatry and psychoanalysis are sometimes the appropriate tool, and that he's only trying to add another tool to the mix.<br />But it's clear from the lion's share of his comments that he doesn't REALLY believe this. He constantly derides both psychiatry and psychoanalysis in ways that demonstrate his true opinion of them, and it's clear that he really thinks that they're next to worthless. The very title of his book is a good indicator. And if someone needs Prozac, all the philosophy in the world isn't going to help him a bit.<br />Now, I suppose it's true that there are people taking antidepressants whose problems are not truly biological, but I rather suspect that the percentage of people taking antidepressants for whom this is true is SIGNIFICANTLY lower than Dr. Marinoff thinks or would have us believe; if he didn't think it was a common situation, he wouldn't have chosen the title he chose. And suggesting to people who are on antidepressants that they very likely don't need them and would do just fine if they'd only examine their life choices more carefully is not only a very cavalier attitude but downright dangerous, to say nothing of cruel.<br />His discussions of how philosophy can be applied to \\"real life\\" are interesting, and worthwhile reading. But the attitude that permeates the book is one of self-serving arrogance, a dismissal of any tool for dealing with problems other than his preferred tool. For this reason, I do not recommend this book.	2002-03-16

The only thing that saved it from a one-star rating is that the subplot of McCoy losing his memory (as near as I can tell, the REAL main plot) is moderately intriguing in concept, and handled surprisingly well other than the fact that the cause of the amnesia is trite beyond words (the old bonk on the head trick) and the cure for it so heavily foreshadowed that by the time we finally get to it, it's seriously anticlimactic. This is not the worst Star Trek novel I've read; it's better (by far) than \\"Triangle\\" or \\"Spock Must Die\\", and a bit better than \\"Killing Time\\" or \\"Black Fire\\".

The only thing that has kept them from enslaving all of humanity is that their code of honor frowns upon sufficient caution; their genral idea of strategy is \\"first you scream and then you leap.\\"<br />This installment comprises three stories, two short and one nearly novel-length by itself. On balance, they are well-written, but the characterizations seemed somewhat flat by comparison to previous stories in the series. It's difficult to say why exactly; the characters were not by any stretch of the imagination stereotypical, but I simply found it difficult to really care what happened to them.<br />The first story details the events just after first contact, when the first human ship to encounter Kzin was attempting to persuade a dubious government back home of the reality of the threat. The writing was good, but the main character lacked anything to make him a sympathetic character, and the plot turned on a rather dubious bit of retroactive deus-ex-machina.<br />The second story detailed the events that led to humanity acquiring a faster-than light drive technology, giving them the technological edge over the Kzin for the first time. These events had been referred to in previous installments, but the full story had never been told. Again, the writing was good, but while the main characters were certainly more sympathetic than the main character in the first story, they never really connected, and events still seemed rather like a deus-ex-machina, out of the control of the characters and dependent on aliens vastly more advanced, and vaguely reminiscent of beings from the Cthulu mythos.<br />The third story was in some ways the best, except that it was too short to live up to its potential. Just a hint, but it may be that we actually met the Kzin Patriarch himself in this one! If so, he demonstrated that he deserves his position.story was in some ways the best, except that it was too short to live up to its potential.

For those of you new to this series, the Kzinti are a race, created by Larry Niven, which he has given other authors permission to write stories about in this series.

The only drawback is that while in neither story can it be said that the heros &quot;fail&quot;, the price for their success in each story is depressingly high.<br />The first story is a continuation of the first story in volume IV of the series; those who read and enjoyed that story will not want to miss this one.	2002-02-21

Like volume IV, (and unlike I-III) this book contains only two stories, rather than three. Unlike volume IV, the stories are a bit more even in length, 202 and 129 pages respectively. The first story, by Jerry Pournelle and S.M. Stirling, is a continuation of their story in volume III of the series, and is quite good, more interesting than I've found any of their previous stories set in the Wunderland system. The second story, by Thomas T. Thomas, is a little bit of a comedown from the quality of the first story, but only a little bit; it's much better than the second story in volume IV of the series.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with the series, I wouldn't really advise starting with this book, although it wouldn't be as disastrous a mistake as starting with book five of SOME series. All you REALLY need to know going in is that Kzinti are a sentient, spacefaring race evolved from carnivorous hunting cats, seven feet tall and 500 pounds of mighty warrior who consider it marginally dishonorable to plan an attack against so trivial an opponent as an omnivorous monkey, and whose general &quot;strategy&quot; amounts to &quot;first you scream and then you leap&quot;. For this reason, and this reason alone, humanity always wins in the long run. The short run, however, can get quite unpleasant for the unwary monkeyboys.<br />The entire series is excellent, and highly recommended.	2002-02-14

This book is one of a relatively small number of stories that could all be considered prototypes of the &quot;mad scientist&quot; subgenre of the science fiction genre. (Some of the others are &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, by Mary Shelley, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under The Sea&quot;, by Jules Verne, and &quot;Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde&quot;, by Robert Louis Stevenson.) As such, there are many elements of the story that to a modern reader may seem trite and overused; what is necessary for the reader to understand is that these concepts were NOT trite and overused at the time; this is one of the writers who CREATED these concepts, which are so powerful that they've been copied by later writers until they seem downright hackneyed. If a modern writer had written this story, I'd rate it two or three stars for a fairly competent style, by no higher because it adds nothing new to the genre. But as it is, it's one of the originals, and is worth reading if for no other purpose than to be able to see the references back to it in later novels, such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, by Michael Crichton.<br />If you're bored with the &quot;mad scientist&quot; subgenre, you probably needn't read this book. But if you're at all curious to see one of the books that originated the concept, this is an excellent early example of the idea. And if you are a fan of the genre, this book is definitely a must-read.	2002-02-08

There are a few quibbles that I have with this book, most notably that it's difficult to place it on the Star Trek timeline. The intro by the author says that it is a story that arose out of the same brainstorming sessions that produced the movie \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\", which would suggest a similar time-frame. But that concept clearly doesn't work, as the events in the second and particularly the third Star Trek movies have obviously not happened (notably, the death and return of Spock and the destruction of the Enterprise). Thus, given those facts and a few hints toward the end of the book, it seems likely that it takes place between movie #1 (Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\") and movie #2 (Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan\\"). It would have helped if that had been made a little clearer a little earlier, but truly, this is a minor quibble.<br />The problem is, the book itself isn't really good enough to cause one to be willing to overlook minor quibbles. It isn't terrible; the writing is fairly good, the characters recognizable as themselves, the dialogue plausible, the minor characters from the Enterprise and the missing science team interesting enough. But the characters that the Enterprise crew must interact with range from vanilla personalities with no real spark to stock villains with no real spark. And the plot itself, while not without promise, never fulfills that promise. There was never really any sense of drama, never any sense of compelling interest. It was, quite honestly, mediocre.<br />If you're a Trek fan with a real need for a fix, there's no reason not to read this one; it's a perfectly acceptable read. But if you aren't desperate for a Trek story, there's no particularly driving reason TO read it, either.	2002-02-05

The main plot of this book is Star Trek at its best, giving a very close look at a basic truth: the reason for most aggression is fear. Unfortunately, the subplot involving Dr. Crandall, the civilian observer and general pest, was not up to the standards of the rest of the book; it was neither original nor believable, and was, in fact, pretty well pointless. The concept that the &quot;outsider&quot; from off the Enterprise, whether an Admiral from Starfleet or a civilian scientist, proves to be difficult and troublesome is done so often in Original Series episodes and books that it is trite beyond words, and the concept that someone as utterly worthless as this clown was portrayed throughout the book could have such a sudden change of heart and selflessly risk his life to save the day is completely out of the realm of possibility. If you wanted him to get to that point eventually, he needed to either have been portrayed with SOME redeeming value earlier, or else have been given more time to digest his transforming experience before acting on it. As it was, people just don't work that way. Not even in a gloriously optimistic place like the Star Trek universe. This cost the book a star, but it was still an excellent book, very thought-provoking, and maintaining much of the feel of an Original Series episode.	2002-01-31

Rather than writing a four-book series, each a full-length novel set in one of the Star Trek series, the author compresses this series into two books; the first tells a half-length story of the &quot;Original Series&quot; crew and a half-length story of the &quot;Next Generation&quot; crew. The second will have a half-length story of DS9 and a half-length Voyager story. This leaves each story feeling more than a bit rushed.<br />Other than that, the writing is fairly good, although it started weakly. There were a half-dozen typos and copyediting mistakes in the first 70 pages, (to say nothing of the anachronism of Kirk calling Scotty on his commbadge, a technological innovation that didn't exist for about another 80 years or so, roughly equivalent to an author of a historical novel set in the time of the War of 1812 having James Madison call James Monroe on the telephone) but I didn't notice any after that. The characters were competently handled, the plots were reasonably good as far as they went. They simply didn't have time to go far enough; that was the only serious problem with the book.	2002-01-28

But for the most part, these are enjoyable, reasonably well-written stories. It seemed to me that they got better as the book went along; one of the earlier stories, \\"A Dance For Darkover\\", by Diana Perry and Vera Nazarian, was the one true clunker in the lot, one of the worst stories to show up in any of these \\"Friends of Darkover\\" anthologies. I can't imagine what Ms. Bradley was thinking when she included it. The characters were two dimensional and behaved in ways that simply made no sense; their actions seemed noticeably forced in order to get the plot where the authors wanted it, rather than flowing naturally from their established personalities. But given that Ms. Bradley DID include it, I must conclude that she saw something in it she liked; there's no accounting for taste.<br />Some of the other early stories were also a tad weak, but only a tad. And just about everything in the last half of the book was excellent; on balance, I recommend this book highly. We even get a story about Magda Lorne, (one of my favorite canonical Darkovan characters) even if it is a fairly short one that breaks little new ground.	2002-01-22

People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, is written in a style that is accessible to children, or told in a narrative voice that is speaking as to children to be a &quot;children's book&quot; and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book falls into that category, as do the rest of the books in the Narnia series, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, by J.R.R. Tolkein, and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; by Lewis Carroll, among many others.<br />Furthermore, not only is this book one of the most enjoyable reading experiences available, it is also one of the most thought-provoking. All of the Narnia books are thinly-veiled allegories for Christian philosophy; the lessons that this book has to teach -- that not every action that is done in the name of God is done by his will, that it is the responsibility of every thinking adult to judge for themselves whether the person invoking the name of God is doing God's will, and that it is critical not to accept the judgement of others if what is being demanded in the name of God seems to be evil -- are lessons that everyone, young and old, needs to be reminded of on a regular basis.	2002-01-15

In each of the first three books of this series, the book was made up of two or three stories of relatively equal length. This book varies somewhat from that format; there are two stories, the first a small novel in and of itself, taking up about 75% of the book (240 pages out of 310). The remaining 70 pages are a story more similar to the others we've seen in the series, perhaps a bit shorter.<br />Both of the stories in this book are excellent, particularly the longer first story (&quot;Survivor&quot;, by Donald Kingsbury). I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone not familiar with the basic concept of Kzinti, a race of spacefaring carnivorous cats, constantly at war with us omnivorous monkeys and constantly losing in the long run because we monkeys are capable of THINKING about the long run, whereas Kzinti consider it shameful to be so cautious as to excercise forethought and planning. (Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it conveys the spirit of the situation.) Still, it isn't necessary to have read all of the previous three collections to appreciate this one; granted, the first story refers back to some events in a story in volume three, but if you didn't know that, you would probably simply assume that the events glossed over were events of tangential importance to this story, and you'd be correct.<br />This is my favorite of the series so far, even if the ending to the second story was somewhat less than satisfying.	2002-01-14

This book is a sequel to the novel &quot;Dreadnought&quot;; it is somewhat better than that novel, in that the plot is a bit more original, if still an offshoot of the same old worn-out concept. Like Dreadnought, it is rather untraditional as a Star Trek novel, in that the main character is a young officer just out of Starfleet academy, and we only see Kirk, Spock, etc, through her eyes. It is an interesting and worthwhile variation, almost making up for the unoriginality of the basic storylines; Piper is transparently a female equivalent of the young Kirk, with just as much talent and potential as Kirk had as a youth, and just as much inexperience. So in a way, watching her adventures has the advantage of giving us some insight into the early development of the Kirk character, without the disadvantage that &quot;flashback&quot; stories have of being restricted to events that fit into what we know of Kirk's history, and without the guarantee that he will come through successfully (after all, we KNOW Kirk got through those early trials, but there's no guarantee that the next young hotshot officer will).<br />There's something of the feel of juvenile fiction to these stories, with the young main character saving the day repeatedly, but to her credit, Ms. Carey doesn't limit the usual main characters to the sidelines; they take their full place in the plot, and are as amazingly competent as they should be. There's simply the addition of another main character, taking her turn at saving the day. Also to Ms. Carey's credit, she resists the temptation to include a romantic entaglement between Kirk and her heroine, a concept which would clearly be out of place, but which many authors would fail to resist (there's a talented, attractive female character; quick, have Kirk seduce her, or at least try.)<br />(Oh, and Ms. Carey still hasn't learned the difference between a &quot;niggling&quot; doubt and a &quot;sniggering&quot; one, the difference being that there IS such a thing as a niggling doubt, but if there's such a thing as a &quot;sniggering&quot; one, I've never heard of it.)<br />There's no lack of action in this story, nor any lack of fascinating character insight. It does seem that the attempt to make Piper a parallel for Kirk goes a bit overboard, though, in that her best friend and most trusted colleague is a Vulcan, and her next best friend and most trusted colleague has a southern drawl.

There isn't really much action in this book; it's mostly hinted at rather than actually described. This is understandable, as the book is intended to be more of a look at the philosophy of the Federation and Starfleet, rather than an action-adventure story. I found the characterizations intriguing, particularly that of the characters original to this book; mostly (with the exception of Worf and to a lesser extent, Picard) the established characters are background filler. But I found the basic concept of the Magna Romans (from Original series &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;) having advanced far enough in 80 years to have joined the Federation and been entrusted with a Starship of their own more than a bit dubious; I doubt that either the Federation or Starfleet would be that foolish. Further, I found it disappointing that the people who were too pacifistic to defend themselves (but not too pacifistic to ask for help so that somebody ELSE could defend them) were never actually forced to face the consequences of their actions; further, those who were unwilling to allow them the luxury of that hypocrisy were portrayed as villains. Granted, changing their culture without permission was villainous, but it would not have been out of line for Picard (or Sejanus) to refuse to help those who would not attempt to help themselves.<br />Clearly, the authors intend to bring Sejanus back in some future story. For all I know, they may have already done so; if they have, I've not read it yet.	2001-12-21

This is a tolerably well-written book; contrary to at least one of the other reviewers here, I feel that the author did a fine job of portraying the established characters, and the story fit well as a continuation of the original series episode, &quot;That Which Survives&quot;. Also, the new race, the Petraw, seem plausible and moderately interesting, kind of a cross between the Ferrengi and Harry Mudd. (Although I must say, I found the motivations for the &quot;deviant&quot; member of the alien crew a bit opaque, and since the actions of that character have a very major effect on the plot, that's a rather large caveat.) Also, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, this story was somewhat lacking in action; not as much as has been suggested elsewhere, but enough that if you read Star Trek for the fast action and gripping adventure, you're likely to be disappointed.<br />But the real flaw in this book (and the reason I gave it 3 rather than 4 stars) is that it has no satisfactory ending; it is simply &quot;Book 1&quot; of a series, and cannot stand on its own. The &quot;Section 31&quot; series demonstrated that that is not a neccessary flaw in a series; &quot;Cloak&quot;, at least, (the only one of that series that I've yet read) is a complete story in and of itself, in spite of being part of a series. That is the way a series SHOULD be put together; it is dishonest to write a story that has no ending, simply to attempt to bully the reader into buying the next book in the series. If the writing is good, the reader will do so without that gimmick, and if it isn't, the gimmick won't help.<br />If you like Star Trek, and are willing to put up with having to follow the story line into the next book (and the five after that one, probably) there's no reason not to get this book.

Better than mediocre, but not quite as good as four stars, this book is worth reading, if for no other reason than to give one a feel for the origins of the science-fiction genre. Granted, Wells is not the originator or the genre; that title probably belongs to Jules Verne, but Wells is one of the earliest contributors to the development of science fiction. &quot;The War Of The Worlds&quot;, &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; are all among the earliest treatments of seminal concepts that later become standards of the genre, and are all reasonably interesting treatments of basic ideas, treatments which are later surpassed as subsequent writers build upon the basic idea and try novel variations upon them.<br />As a story in its own right, this book is interesting, but has a few flaws: the explanation offered for why the main character chose NOT to use theatrical makeup to &quot;pass&quot; when he needed to seem normal was unconvincing (it would take too long to remove if he needed to suddenly be invisible; not nearly a sufficiently compelling consideration to offset the obvious advantages of being able to pass in normal society). Further, since he mentions that his earliest test of his procedure turned a piece of cloth invisible, it seems silly that he didn't make himself invisible clothes to avoid the rather obvious disadvantage of needing to be naked in order to be properly invisible, during an English winter (which is when he made his experiment.) Nor does it make any sense that he would become visible once dead; if his flesh was invisible, it should have remained so.<br />Still, in spite of all these quibbles, it is a very interesting book, and well worth the reading.	2001-12-16

Anyone who wishes to be considered at all educated in the history of the United States MUST read this book. The period of this history is absolutely critical to an understanding of the country both before and after that time, as well, obviously, as during that time. And without reading the account of this great American of his experiences, one can not, truly, understand that time period.<br />Granted, there will be those who will argue, &quot;But why should we need to read an anti-slavery tract; there's no one alive now who would argue in favor of slavery, or deny that it was a great evil. To read a book whose primary purpose was to convince people of what is now considered obvious is pointless.&quot; But the same argument could be used to apply to reading a biography of George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson. Most of the issues that were important to them are currently decided, and decided in their favor. Yet it is still considered neccessary for an educated American to have at least a passing idea of the history of their lives.<br />The same is true of Frederick Douglass. The man risked his life for freedom, just as surely as did Patrick Henry, or any of the founding fathers, and his history is just as much a part of this country as theirs is; further, it is worth seeing just how literate a man born in slavery, not only self-taught, but self-taught on the sly, against every effort of his oppressors to stifle his education, can be. His facility for language is frankly better than 90% of modern Americans of any color, in spite of virtually universal education. He was a great man, and deserves to be recognized as such.	2001-12-14

Let's be up-front about one thing: for the first 50 pages or so, I expected to hate this book; I read it only because I have a compulsive desire to read every Star Trek book out there. I've never been overly fond of the character of Will Riker, I'm even less fond of the character of Deanna Troi, I hate stories about love at first sight between intrinsically incompatible people, and telepathic &quot;soul mates&quot;, and I'm very dubious about time-travel stories, especially stories in which time travel is used to interfere with the time stream to make things better.<br />This book contains all those things.<br />In spite of myself, I liked it; partly, that is because Peter David does an excellent job of handling the details of characterization and has a facility for the language that makes a story move well. But partly it is also because, much to my amazement, he actually manages to make many of the weaknesses in concept work: the relationship may be a spiritual, &quot;love-at-first-sight&quot; thing, but that doesn't help it to work out such that they are able to magically &quot;live happily ever after&quot;; their relationship still needs to be worked at, and goes through ups and downs and many stages, in spite of the &quot;spiritual connection&quot;; their conflicts do not end as soon as they both acknowledge the attraction. The time-travel angle is handled much better than I thought possible, being a correction of an interference, rather than a new interference. And in spite of my innate disinterest in (verging on hostility towards) the main characters, I found myself drawn into their challenges and trials. As always, Mr. David handles the story with a deft and surprisingly lighthearted touch; he is capable of injecting a touch of humor into the most intensely dramatic situations, without giving the impression of &quot;playing for laughs&quot;.<br />I've read Star Trek novels that I enjoyed more, but not many of them. And given that this book started with two and a half strikes against it in basic concept, that it managed to climb up past &quot;okay&quot; to &quot;extremely good&quot; is nothing short of astounding. If you actually LIKE the characters of Will Riker or Deanna Troi, or enjoy stories about love at first sight or time travel, you'll undoubtedly find this book spectacular.<br />Read anything by Peter David; the man could make a workable plot and an enjoyable read out of a recipe for tapioca pudding.d a half strikes against it in basic concept, that it managed to climb up past &quot;okay&quot; to &quot;extremely good&quot; is nothing short of astounding.

If you are one of the vast number of people who are fascinated by vampire fiction, and do not have a particular prejudice against female lead characters, you will almost certainly find this an excellent read. There are a wide range of different concepts here, from the relatively traditional vampire in Barbara Hambly's &quot;Madeline&quot; and M. John Harrison's &quot;Empty&quot;, to the very offbeat and high-tech &quot;Song of the Night People&quot; by Larry Niven. Along the way, we meet tormented souls struggling against their nature (&quot;In the Blood&quot;, by Michael Kurland), kind and loving immortals little different from humans save for the fact that they don't age (&quot;Tumbling Down The Nighttime&quot;, by Dean Wesley Smith), a light-hearted spoof (&quot;Survival Skills&quot;, by Deborah Wheeler), and even a vampiric ship (&quot;La Dame&quot;, by Tanith Lee). All of the stories are extremely well-written, and the collection as a whole is well-edited (I found only one copyediting mistake in the entire book, almost unheard-of these days).<br />Highly recommended for anyone with a liking (or even a lack of antipathy) for the subject matter. Some of the best vampire fiction I've read.	2001-12-10

For one thing, the characterization of Jean Valjean seems somewhat erratic at the beginning of the book; apparently, Hugo believes that being converted from beastliness to benevolence increases a person's IQ by about 30 points. (Valjean goes from being a common laborer, unexceptional and unimpressive, who 19 years in the galleys have turned into a beast, to being, after his conversion to the &quot;light side of the force&quot;, an inventor, a competent magistrate, and an expert herbalist.) But this is a fairly minor quibble, as it is one of the few flaws in characterization, among dozens of characters, and happens early enough in the book that we have well over seven hundred pages of consistent characterization of Valjean after the sudden change.<br />Otherwise, we have a book which, if taken in the context of the accepted writing conventions of its time, is virtually flawless. Still, a modern reader is likely to find the pacing rather slow at times; what it actually is, is &quot;symphonic&quot;. It starts slowly, and very very gradually builds to a crescendo, only to begin a new movement, again very slowly, and build very gradually to a crescendo. This happens over and over in the course of the thousand pages of the book (give or take a couple of hundred, depending on the edition that you read.) It can be very annoying at times; for instance, we're literally fifty pages into the book before we even MEET our main character (the first fifty pages being a character portrait of a man who has a very major influence on the life of said main character, but who never appears again after the first hundred pages) and then again, a bit later, after we've just finished a very exciting part of the story, and seem poised to continue in a similarly exciting vein, we take a literally fifty page digression into the history of the battle of Waterloo, which happened eight years or so previous to what was happening in the story, and while a tiny bit of this digression later becomes extremely important to the plot, truly forty-five of those fifty pages were completely irrelevant, and even the five or so that were germaine did not become so until MUCH later. Then, with &quot;only&quot; 200 pages left to go, a character escapes from a tight situation by fleeing into the sewers, so we must have a twelve page digression on the history, philosophy, and geography of the Parisian sewer system. This pattern is repeated constantly throughout the book, and it can be very frustrating for a reader who comes from an era in which an author is expected to stay at least marginally on-topic, but it is necessary to understand that such was considered a perfectly reasonable writing style at the time. In any case, the story is good enough to make it worth putting up with the digressions; my only other complaint is that the love interest in the story is again very typically 19th century, (two people, incidentally both young and good-looking, who don't know each other in the slightest, make eye contact across a quadrangle and are suddenly, magically, in love. But it's a spiritual love, of course, nothing of physical attraction in it at all, and the love actually survives the test of time...a concept that still survives today, mostly in bad romance novels, but it was absolutely standard in Hugo's time) but one can hardly blame the man for being a product of his times.<br />Highly recommended, with the caveat that you must understand that it will not be an easy read.

My favorite of his continues to be &quot;Rescuing The Bible From Fundamentalism&quot;, but this one is certainly worth the read.<br />Spong's basic message is, essentially, that it is a mistake to try to force literal belief in the events of the bible; doing so is almost impossible for a modern, educated person, and the effort distracts us from the actual message of the book and of Christianity in general. The message of Christianity is love and joy and goodness; all else is window-dressing. This is a message that is difficult for most Christians to accept, and many who DO accept it come to a point at which they no longer define themselves as Christian, because the vast majority of those who call themselves Christian would not accept the commonality of their religious outlook. But this is the religion that Jesus taught, and Spong strives mightily to help people remember that the key to Christianity is to follow the teachings of Jesus, and that one cannot do that by blindly following what others have claimed were the teachings of Jesus. One must study the history of the writing of the Bible, in order to learn the truth of how certain passages came to be included, in order to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. If one doesn't do so, if one uncritically accepts what traditional teaching claims for the bible, one loses the power that originally led to the Christian movement, and is left with silly children's stories.<br />Not a book for those who wish to cling to a security blanket of a religion. But an excellent book for a mature reader who wishes to understand the real meaning of Christianity more fully.	2001-11-29

This is far from the worst Star Trek novel I've ever read, but truly it isn't very good. Those who've read other novels by J.M. Dillard are likely to be seriously disappointed in this effort. The characters are handled competently enough, and there's plenty of action for those who read Star Trek purely for thrills. But the basic plot is rather weak, and were it not for the blatant intercession of a very active author-deity, the good guys would have lost this one.<br />I'm told that back in the days of the movie western serials, Hopalong Cassidy was once trapped in a box canyon, no way out, and hopelessly outnumbered by the approaching bad guys. Then the writers realized that they had written themselves into a corner, so when we &quot;tuned in next week&quot;, the story began with &quot;After Hoppy got out of the box canyon...&quot; This story reminded me of that anecdote, notably in the segue from chapter six to chapter seven.<br />Sloppy.	2001-11-16

The book is well-crafted, its characters -- both previously established characters and newly created ones -- well-developed and for the most part plausible, the exception being the &quot;villain&quot; of the piece, whose motivations are too cardboard and trite to be plausible. The dialogue works, and the plot, while it starts somewhat slowly, becomes compelling as the story moves along. Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat unsatisfactory; the story is, essentially, a detective murder mystery in Star Trek's clothing, and I do not feel that the answer to &quot;whodunnit&quot; had been adequately foreshadowed in the earlier storyline. In retrospect, there WAS some attempt at foreshadowing, but it simply didn't ring true when the actual would-be murderer was revealed.<br />Definitely a good read, but just as definitely flawed.	2001-10-19

The &quot;Sword And Sorceress&quot; series is a series of collections of short stories set in the &quot;Sword and Sorcery&quot; genre, except that in this series, all the protagonists are female. This is because, as Marion Zimmer Bradley has always explained in her introductions, historically in the &quot;Sword and Sorcery&quot; genre, the only female characters were &quot;Bad conduct prizes&quot; for the heros. This series as a whole is very good, although some volumes were stronger than others; I'm very fond of volumes 17, 16, and 15, as well as several of the earlier ones. This volume doesn't quite live up to the high standards of its three most recent predecessors, but it is probably as good as any volume in the series earlier than that.<br />There are only two stories in this volume that are continuations of the adventures of characters met in previous anthologies: &quot;A Passage Of Power&quot;, a story of Diana Paxson's Bera, the Norse wisewoman, and &quot;In The Sacred Places Of The Earth&quot;, about Dorothy Heydt's Cynthia, the Witch Of Syracuse. I will say that there were fewer typos and general copyediting mistakes in this book than there have been in some of the earlier ones; whether this was due to Elisabeth Waters paying more attention to such minutinae than Ms. Bradley did or not I can only guess. (Note to Rosemary Edghill, author of &quot;Little Rogue Riding Hood&quot;, however: the singular of &quot;staves&quot; is not &quot;stave&quot;, it is &quot;staff&quot;.) My primary complaint about this book is that it seems to be awefully heavy on the &quot;Sorcery&quot;, and awefully light on the &quot;Sword&quot;; I think that the aforementioned &quot;Little Rogue Riding Hood&quot; is the only true &quot;swordswoman&quot; story, with perhaps &quot;Arms and the Woman&quot; coming close. Almost all the rest center around mages of one stripe or another.<br />My second (minor) quibble is that &quot;Raven Wings On The Snow&quot;, by Pauline Alama, while a well-written story, is really just a retelling of a fairy tale, something that Ms. Bradley had always maintained was not allowed, and while I know that she always said that any of her rules could be broken if the story was good enough, I didn't think that this one was; it was good, but not THAT exceptional.<br />I am told, (by someone who should know, one of the authors) that there are plans for two more &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; collections.

This story is well-written, and the characters are handled well. The part of the story dealing with section 31 is handled EXTREMELY well, contrary to the complaints of many of the reviewers here; of COURSE the conflict between Kirk &amp; co. and Section 31 is very shadowy; it's a shadow organization, and any time it gets into direct conflict, it has failed in its mission. And I get the impression it doesn't fail often. That's the beauty of Section 31 as a &quot;villain&quot; for a story; it's SUBTLE, and not easily confronted, much less defeated.<br />Another thing that the story manages well is to place itself squarely in a specific time frame, namely between the original series episodes, &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot; and &quot;For The World Is Hollow, And I Have Touched The Sky&quot;. This lends a real feeling of authenticity to the story; unfortunately, it also leads to the biggest flaw: if James Kirk was aware of the existence of Section 31 from that point on, and was working covertly to fight them (as is suggested in the epilogue) there should have been some hint of this later in the series. The fact that there wasn't indicates that he was not. Therefore, the very feeling of authenticity that the author works so hard to accomplish defeats itself. It would have been better if Kirk had simply been left uneasily aware that something was wrong, but unable to specify what it was. Then the story would have fit into the continuity perfectly, and it would have been a perfect Section 31 adventure: their immediate plot is foiled, but they remain hidden for future plots.<br />The book is an enjoyable read, but doesn't QUITE handle the subject matter in an ideal manner.	2001-10-10

This novel is an adaptation of an episode in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; television show. It is well-written, and any flaws in it are not truly the fault of the author, Michael Jan Friedman, but rather of Ron Moore, the writer of the teleplay for the episode it was based on.<br />My primary objection, perhaps surprisingly, is not the method of justifying (or even the very fact of) the existence of the character of Montgomery Scott nearly a hundred years after the original Star Trek series; I found myself willing and able to suspend disbelief for that concept. No, what I found troubling and implausible was the characterization of Mr. Scott, and his inability to recognize what he knew, and what he didn't, and to avoid being a danger to everyone when let loose in an engine room.<br />The man was no fool, and perfectly aware that technology had changed while he'd been &quot;away&quot;. And he'd plenty of experience examining unfamiliar, superior technology. He'd not have made the stupid mistakes he was portrayed as making. Nor would he have failed to understand that a chief engineer can't be interrupted while on duty. The entire concept, essential to the story, was an insult to the character. Other than that flaw in characterization, the story was good, and it was a pleasure to see Scotty back in action. I just wish that the creator of the story had had more respect for the character.	2001-10-09

People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, that is written in a style accessible to children, or told in a narrative voice that is speaking as to children to be a &quot;children's story&quot;, and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book, indeed this whole series, falls into that category, just as do &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, by J.R.R. Tolkein, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, by James Barrie, and &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot;, by Lewis Carrol, among others.<br />Like all the Narnia books, this one is an exciting adventure in another world, with 8-12 year old children as the main characters. Also like all the Narnia books, it isn't hard to find the Christian allegory and symbolism a very short way beneath the surface of the story. Some non-Christians find this distracting and off-putting; mostly, it doesn't bother me. Certainly, Christians should find the books marvellous. But I will say that there was one minor flaw in this book, which again was not unique in the Narnia books to this one, but seemed more extreme in this case: Lewis revealed that he was, in fact, a rather serious sexist by modern standards, although I daresay that by the standards of his day, he was probably better than most. I say this not because the villain is a woman and a witch (if women CAN'T be taken seriously as villains, that would certainly be sexist) nor even because the female villain is (A) beautiful and (B) powerful, but because it is taken as obvious that there is something wrong with Prince Rilian, since clearly there must be something wrong with any man who is willing to be ruled by his lady. This was a distraction, but given when this book was written, I suppose it's just one of those things that we need to wince at, shrug, and be certain when reading the story to our kids, they don't absorb the attitude as correct.<br />I have now read all the books in the series save &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, and would rate this one above only &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, but it's no insult to be ranked below all of the others.ct.<br />I have now read all the books in the series save &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, and would rate this one above only &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, but it's no insult to be ranked below all of the others.	2001-10-03

This is a book that absolutely must be taken with a grain of salt the size of the Hope Diamond, but it should not be discounted entirely. Ms. Davis makes many bold assertions in this book. Some of them are perfectly reasonable, like her claim that many pre-Christian, pre-Judaic cultures were goddess-worshipping cultures, and archaeological evidence demonstrates that these cultures frequently had a very high level of civilization, thus demonstrating that patriarchal culture has no monopoly on civilization, or that women have been treated rather shabbily (to put it mildly) by the Christo-Judean society of the last 3000 years; many are plausible, such as the assertion that some (many? most?) such cultures were matriarchies just as chauvinistic as later culture was in reverse.<br />Others are more dubious, such as the assertion that the Biblical story of Cain and Abel is an attempt by a newly-fledged masculinist society to tell of the conflict between the old matriarchal civilization, which was agricultural (Cain, the elder brother, being the raiser of fruits and vegetables) and the newer, nomadic, meat-eating culture (Abel, the younger brother, being the shepherd), with Cain being cast in the role of the villain. Sounds plausible enough, until you start to wonder why a new culture would claim to have been symbolically &quot;killed&quot; by the old one.<br />Then there are the highly dubious claims (in the old matrilineal societies, violence, even to animals, was unheard of) and the outright speculative (legends of the lost city of Atlantis are true, it was the site of the original prehistoric civilization that all other later civilizations, from Sumer down to Ur, Greece, and Egypt all devolved) and worst, the internally contradictory (on back-to-back pages, she makes the interestingly matched claims that A)women in some South-Pacific Island cultures, still relatively untouched by the masculinist modern society, still practice the age-old ritual of surgically breaking the hymens of their young girls before they reach puberty, thus avoiding an unpleasant first sexual experience, and B) that hymens are a recent evolutionary development, having only evolved since patriarchal culture began selecting for them -- itself an assertion in the &quot;highly dubious&quot; category, but absolutely incompatible with the previous one. Then there is her continuing difficulty in deciding whether to claim that matriarchal societies were peaceful and nonviolent, or that women leaders could, too, be great warrior-queens, fully the equal of any male warrior.<br />Then there are the downright offensive bald-faced assertions, such as the statement casually made that all men hate all women.<br />The problem is, these assertions are all made with identical (read absolute) confidence, spoken as unquestionable truth. Thus it is difficult to tell where the author's evaluation of evidence is accurate, where it is pure speculation, and where it is simply wrong. The temptation, after reading a couple of her more outreageous statements, is to simply assume that everything she says is wrong, and that does a disservice to her legitimate arguments. I will say that the book improved markedly with the beginning of Part III, &quot;Pre-Christian Women in the Celto-Ionian World&quot;. Her denunciations of the treatment of women in Christian culture from the time of Constantine rang true, and were very persuasive. Also, it helps to remember that this book was written in 1971, when women's treatment in our own society was only beginning to improve beyond the appalling stage.<br />I strongly recommend avoiding this book for anyone who is uncertain of their ability to sift through the dubious and the silly without being unfairly influenced against the reasonable; surely, there must be more reasonable, well-written books that discuss her more plausible concepts. Unless, of course, you're a good old-fashioned chauvinist looking for cheap ammo with which to discredit any feminist argument by virtue of guilt by association. I must admit, in that case, this book is a must-read.ist argument by virtue of guilt by association. I must admit, in that case, this book is a must-read.	2001-10-01

Excellent finish to an excellent 3-volume biography; the first volume took us from Jackson's birth through his tenure as governor of Florida; the second took us from there through the end of his first term as president and his successful bid for re-election. This volume takes us from the beginning of his second term to his death.<br />As with both previous volumes, the marvellous thing about this book is that Remini provides the reader with sufficient information that it is possible, with nothing more than the information he provides, to disagree with his evaluation of his subject. Clearly, on balance he is much more taken with Andrew Jackson than I am, although there are a few instances in which I actually think that he is too harsh in his judgement. But the marvellous thing is, he gives me sufficient information to make that judgement, an invaluable characteristic in a biographer.<br />Anyone interested in reading a detailed, in-depth biography of the first truly populist president (whether one considers that  a good or a bad thing to say about the man says a lot about one's personality) and the president who appointed Roger Taney, the chief justice responsible for the Dred Scott Decision, to his post as Justice of the Supreme Court, needs to read all three volumes of this set.	2001-09-30

In this, it is not unlike \\"The Lion, The Witch And the Wardrobe\\" and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", only more so. I don't begrudge Lewis the opportunity to inject his own religious symbolism and philosophy into his works; in \\"The Horse And His Boy\\" and \\"Prince Caspian\\" he does so without noticeably detracting from the story. Even in the \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", while I felt he wasn't as subtle as he might have been, I didn't really feel that it hurt the story any. But in this book, (at least in the last third of it; prior to that, I had no objections) he was just a bit too ham-handed in his preaching, to the detriment of what would otherwise have been a fine story. Of course, if you ARE Christian, and believe that the symbolism is one of the things that make these stories classics, then you may well find this one of the best of the lot.	2001-09-17

This was a fascinating character study of opposing sides in a political conflict; fascinating because it was very realistic. There were no simple &quot;good guys vs. bad guys&quot; conflicts here; the leader of the planetary government, while clearly not doing everything he could possibly have done to help his world at a crisis point, clearly believed that what he was doing was for the best, and his charisma (necessary in a leader of his type of government) was well-enough portrayed that the reader could feel it, and couldn't help but like him in spite of knowing better. Meanwhile, his opposition was also well-meaning and determined, convinced of the rightness of her cause, if somewhat less charismatic than he was. Both of them were plausible, at least somewhat likeable, wishing the best for their world...and absolutely incapable of working together or reaching compromise in order to save it, even with the Federation's best efforts at mediation. Sad, but all too plausible.<br />On the downside, one character who DID grow during the course of the story (Ambassador Undrun) did so rather IMPLAUSIBLY.

I was fully expecting to give this book a five star rating; it was one of the most enjoyable reads of all the Next Generation books I've yet read. Unfortunately, the ending was rather weak, and somewhat out of sync with the rest of the story; a story as lighthearted as this one shouldn't have had such a downer of an ending. But the ending wasn't terrible; it just didn't live up to the rest of the story, and cost it one star. It's still an excellent story, even with a less-than stellar ending.<br />In general, this story was somewhat reminiscent in style of some of the best of the Original Series episodes, like &quot;Trouble With Tribbles&quot;, &quot;A Piece Of The Action&quot;, and &quot;Shore Leave&quot;, in which a significant amount of humor is added to the mix, without sacrificing any of the action or drama of the storyline. The plot moves well, is not implausible, and the characterizations are handled with a deft touch. A very enjoyable book.	2001-09-09

Peter David is, perhaps, the best author of Star Trek books that I've run across, at least the best with more than one such book to his credit. The other book of his that I've read is \\"Strike Zone\\", which is a marvellously funny book much in the tradition of \\"Trouble With Tribbles\\", with drama and danger present in the plot, but still not taking itself too overly seriously.<br />This book is very different; it is a very serious and gripping story, action-packed and not at all lighthearted, but also very well done.<br />It's a pleasant enough surprise to discover an author who can write well in one or the other of these styles; it's a revelation to discover one who can do both. Personally, I prefer a somewhat lighter touch, and so prefer \\"Strike Zone\\" to this book, but this book is unquestionably a keeper.	2001-09-04

I don't know that it is exhaustive; I'm sure that there is information one might want that isn't to be found here, although I can't think of any examples off the top of my head. And I can't vouch for its veracity; I haven't the competence in the subject matter. Certainly, it is a marvellous reference for someone like me, who has little other knowledge of the subject, and wants a place to begin in gaining such knowledge.<br />The style of the entries varies considerably, as one might expect of a book that is a collection of entries by various authors; some of them seem very straightforward and mainstream in their approach, others are clearly written by activists seeking to balance centuries of European-oriented history with their own opposite cultural perspective. All are at least reasonably well-written, however, and quite enlightening.	2001-09-04

This is a novelization of a popular &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode, in which Picard and the Enterprise crew interact with Spock. All told, it isn't a bad job of novelization, but it's a little rough around the edges; the author mentions in her introduction that it took her a month to write it; that seems like an awfully short time to throw together a project of this size, and it shows. Still, the plot is interesting, the characters handled reasonably well, and other than a few points where there was obviously an insufficiency of proofreading and copy editing, the writing isn't bad. If you're a fan who enjoys almost any Star Trek book, this one is certainly good enough for you. If, on the other hand, you only bother with the best of the large selection of Star Trek books, this one won't make the grade.	2001-09-02

On the plus side, this book continued to demonstrate that Shatner has a fine grasp of the characters and the general universe, although even this aspect of his writing was not as good here as in his previous books. And where there was action or drama, the story moved well and managed, in spite of my general disappointment, to capture my attention and interest.<br />But on the down side, the basic plot was rather over-ambitious, and Shatner failed to successfully carry off his attempt at writing an epic saga; there were too many unanswered questions, too many loose ends left untied, too much general confusion. It seemed to me (admittedly, it's been over a year since I read the previous installation in the series, so I MIGHT be mistaken, but I don't think so; my memory of it seems pretty clear) that the continuity between books left something to be desired, and was more than a little choppy. At least in the beginning of this book, Shatner fell back too often on the dodge of making Kirk even more competent than he is, too much of a larger-than-life character, to the detriment of his humanity (he was guilty of this in the earlier books, too, but not as badly). The basic plot-concept was more than a little reminiscent of &quot;Star Trek #5, The Prometheus Design&quot;, by Sondra Marshak and Myrna Culbreath, and if this book wasn't as bad as that one (which it wasn't) it isn't because the basic concept was any better; it was just a bit better executed. The quality of the writing was better, the characterizations were better. But the basic idea (nearly-omnipotent alien beings are manipulating galactic history, and Kirk &amp; co are NOT powerless to do something about it) was still bad.<br />To be fair, I should probably give this book two and a half stars; it really is better than a two-star book, but I can't bring myself to give it three. Three, after all, is what I gave its predecessor, &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, and for all that this book gives us an ending (the lack of which was that book's biggest flaw) it isn't nearly as good a book as that one was.which was that book's biggest flaw) it isn't nearly as good a book as that one was.	2001-08-31

This is a somewhat unusual &quot;Dilbert&quot; book, in that it is not merely a collection of &quot;Dilbert&quot; cartoons, but is rather a humorous ramble by Scott Adams, accompanied by &quot;Dilbert&quot; cartoons strategically placed to illustrate whatever point he's making at that particular moment. As such, it was quite interesting and amusing. The only weak spot was the last chapter, in which Adams, apparently at least semi-seriously, proposes some ideas that are so fluffy and new-agey that I was beginning to wonder if he was channelling for Shirley MacLaine; in the post-script, he claims that he was not really claiming that these things WERE true, but only that they COULD be, as a thought experiment; that's a lot less unreasonable, and he does maintain his sense of humor, even while being apparently serious about weirdness, but it was kind of unsettling. My advice is, assume that he's kidding in the last chapter. It'll be more enjoyable, and it'll keep your head from exploding.	2001-08-26

On the plus side, this novel had an interesting main character, a young command trainee fresh out of Starfleet Academy, and we only see Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew through her eyes. This was an interesting and novel approach for a Star Trek novel.<br />Unfortunately, the main plot was NOT a novel and interesting one; it was that old, beaten-to-death standby of a Starfleet admiral gone rogue. What is it with Starfleet; does it have a requirement that ANYBODY promoted to admiral MUST be a psychotic sociopath? Is it against policy to promote sane, rational people beyond the rank of captain? You'd think so, given how often this plot shows up in one form or another.<br />Further, Ms. Carey continues her tendency to have the occasional rather questionable word choice; the example that comes to mind here is the use of the word &quot;sniggering&quot; when she clearly means &quot;niggling&quot;.<br />Not completely worthless, nor even close to being the worst Star Trek novel out there; still, it's even farther from the best.	2001-08-22

This is neither an especially bad Star Trek novel, nor an especially good one. The characters were handled, for the most part, with a deft touch, and the main plot was interesting enough, if not spectacular. But unfortunately, the author set up a situation that would have been too easily solved if the Enterprise were working properly, so he felt the need to fall back on the trite old standby &quot;the Enterprise is malfunctioning, but needs to complete a difficult and dangerous mission anyway&quot; routine, a badly overused plot device. Further, his eventual explanation of what caused the malfunction was so comletely implausible as to challenge the abilities of even the most forgiving fans of the unlikely to suspend disbelief. Further, he flubs rather badly in one of his attempts to reference original television episodes as history for the story; at one point, Kirk is reminiscing about the events in the episode &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot;, and &quot;remembers&quot; that only some of Scotty's best transporter work saved the crew of the shuttle. Only problem is, Scotty was one of those on the shuttle being beamed to safety. A trivial point, I know, but if you're going to refer back to the show in the first place, you should be careful to do it ACCURATELY.	2001-08-19

I never did forgive the writers of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; for their treatment of Tasha Yar, easily the most interesting character on the show. First they radically underutilized her, then wrote her out of the show entirely. Okay, they wrote her out because the actress wanted out, but perhaps if the character hadn't been so underutilized, Denise Crosby wouldn't have wanted out. And in any case, if they were going to write her out, they could have done so without killing her, and if they absolutely HAD to kill her off, they could have done so in a way that wasn't so completely trivial and worthless.<br />This book gives us a wonderful look into the character of Tasha Yar, as well as a bit of insight into Data and the interrelationship of the two. It is a marvellous precursor to &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, another Next Generation Novel by Jean Lorrah. It is easily the best &quot;Next Generation&quot; novel I've read to date. The ending seemed a bit rushed, as Ms. Lorrah takes us through the story of the end of Tasha's life, without being willing to go into great detail, assuming that we've seen the episode that tells that story. But that is my only complaint, and it is a minor one, because she DOES tell enough of the story to fill in someone who isn't familiar with it. It simply felt a bit rushed, as I say.	2001-08-15

If you're looking to study the history of feminism, it's essential. Further, for someone who simply wishes to get a feel for just how far we've come in the last fifty years, it can be very informative to read this book, and see just what constituted &quot;radical&quot; feminist thought around 1950.<br />But if what you're interested in is cutting-edge, interesting, thought-provoking feminist theory, I'm afraid that this book no longer has what it takes. It was all of these things when it was written, and most of them as recently as the 1970s, but for a modern reader, most of de Beauvoir's concepts and arguments fall into one of three categories:<br />The first is the &quot;Well, DUH!&quot; category, in which she makes a large production out of an argument that has long since become generally accepted; only the most neanderthal sexist would still argue against the basic right of women to be treated on an equal basis with men in employment, or to be treated as, legally, an equal partner with their spouse in a marriage, for two of the most obvious examples. People may argue still about what exactly constitutes equal treatment, but almost no one would dispute the basic concept.<br />The second category, and even more unfortunate, is the category of arguments which have long since been discarded as themselves sexist; for all of her attempts to be radical, she was still a product of her time, and rather a lot of ideas got past her internal screen. The most obvious example of this category is her blind acceptance of the claim, then popular among most gynecologists (which of course, at the time, meant &quot;most male gynecologists&quot;, since there were very few of any other kind) that almost all menstrual or pre-menstrual difficulties experienced by their patients had no physical cause, but were in fact caused by a psychological problem with accepting their femininity. De Beauvoir, of course, puts a more tolerant spin on this outdated claim, suggesting that it is only REASONABLE that women would have difficulties accepting the demands put upon them by society's reaction to their gender, but that doesn't change the fact that she accepts the basic premise itself, a premise that has long since been recognised (at least by feminists) as patent hooey. There are a great many physical causes of menstrual difficulties, and if there are occasional instances of neurotic triggers, that doesn't make the statement &quot;I can't find a physical reason for your problem, therefore there isn't one,&quot; an acceptable diagnosis.<br />The third category of argument in this book, at least for the reader unschooled in existentialist psychobabble and/or marxist dialectic, is the &quot;WHAT did she just say?&quot; argument. In spite of claims to the contrary in the introduction, this book is rather heavy going for the reader not familiar with the catch-phrases and pet terms of those disciplines. Terms like &quot;immanence&quot;, &quot;transcendance&quot;, and such are liberally sprinkled throughout the text, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the usage. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it does make the book rather inaccessible to the average reader.<br />I do NOT recommend this book to the general public; for committed historians, particularly historians of the feminist movement, there is much to be learned from it. But for the general reader, it has long since lost the relevance that made it worth the effort to parse the 814 pages of impenetrable language.his outdated claim, suggesting that it is only REASONABLE that women would have difficulties accepting the demands put upon them by society's reaction to their gender, but that doesn't change the fact that she accepts the basic premise itself, a premise that has long since been recognised (at least by feminists) as patent hooey.

Others, notably the current publisher, have renumbered the books in something resembling an internal chronological order. So far, I've read books 1-3 by the latter ordering, which is to say, books 1, 5, and 6 by the order in which they were originally published, and my considered opinion on the subject is that it really makes very little difference in WHAT order you read them. Unlike many &quot;series&quot; stories, the Narnia books are really each self-contained stories, with no need to read any of the others in order to know what's going on. At least, that's been true so far. Surely, there are more important things to argue about than the numbering of the books in a series in which each volume can stand alone.<br />This is a delightful story, with a touch of &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; and a touch of &quot;The Prince And The Pauper&quot; in its basic concept. If you have kids, read it to them. But even if you don't, don't miss out on one of the most enjoyable stories available.	2001-07-27

Volume three runs from the beginning of his second term to his death.<br />The marvellous thing about this book, as with the first volume in the set, is that Remini provides the reader with sufficient information that it is possible, with nothing but the information he provides, for the reader to disagree with his apparent opinion of his subject. There are times when I feel that he gives Jackson too much credit, and others when it seems to me that he is too harsh in his judgement, but the important thing is, he gives me enough information to MAKE those judgements.<br />Excellent for anyone interested in a very in-depth and well-balanced look at a very complex and interesting figure in American history.	2001-07-18

This is one of those stories that tempts a reviewer to succumb to grade inflation; it is so much better than other books that I've rated five stars, that I'm tempted to give it a higher than maximum rating.<br />Granted, there are people out there who claim that this book is too cloyingly sweet for words; it's very stylish to be cynical. So call me a sucker for a happy ending if you must, but this is unquestionably the best thing that Dickens ever wrote; not only does it have his usual marvellous characterizations, but the plot moves better than most of those in his longer works, and, being a very short piece, it doesn't have the tendency to ramble that some of his longer works fall prey to.<br />But beyond that, the story is an absolute classic, one that eveyone should have the pleasure of reading on a regular basis. What I find particularly pleasing about it is the frequently-overlooked fact that when Scrooge becomes pleasant and generous not only is it the right thing to do, and not only does it make the lives of those around him infinitely more pleasant, but it actually makes Scrooge himself much happier; it isn't WORK to be pleasant, it's FUN!<br />The movie versions generally do a fairly good job of portraying the story, but nothing can compare to the original written story itself; even better, it's available from the &quot;Dover Thrift Editions&quot; for only a dollar!<br />If you cherish your cynicism, you may want to avoid this story; but if you enjoy a good bit of delightfully playful writing that winds up with a classically upbeat ending, DO NOT miss this book.	2001-07-09

First there was &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, our introduction to the character of Slippery Jim DiGriz, aka the Stainless Steel Rat, galactic con man, thief, and all-around troublemaker. This was followed by four sequels: &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves The World&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You&quot;, and &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat For President&quot;. Then, apparently growing bored with the direction his stories had taken, Harrison wrote a prequel, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat is Born&quot;, followed by a sequel to the prequel, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Gets Drafted&quot;, and a sequel to the sequel to the prequel, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Sings The Blues&quot;. Then he returned to the original sequence with a sequel to &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat For President&quot;, with &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Goes To Hell&quot;. This book follows that one.<br />In the initial book of the series, we are told that Jim has had a long and successful career being one jump ahead of the law, but we see that career coming to an end as he is recruited by the galactic Special Forces as an agent, on the theory that it takes a thief to catch a thief. He is &quot;recruited&quot; by being caught and faced with the choice of joining or going to prison.<br />That pattern is repeated throughout the series; he's supposed to be incredibly talented, clever, and intelligent, but he is invariably outmanuevered whenever it's necessary for plot development. This book continues that pattern; he is outmanuevered consistently throughout the book. Just once I'd like to see him actually demonstrate his claimed competence. But beyond that objection, this story was very poorly written, or at least very poorly proofread. There's a typo (generally involving a missing word or a wrong word being used) about every 30 pages, and as some other reviewers have mentioned, the author even gets his characters confused late in the book; admittedly, they're twins, and I understand if another character can't tell them apart. But there's no excuse for an author making such a sloppy mistake, and not catching it himself or making sure his book is proofread well enough to catch it. (One of the twins approaches DiGriz, and he calls out &quot;Bolivar!&quot;, but the twin says, &quot;No, James. Bolivar is...&quot; otherwise occupied. But then on the next page, the present twin is continually referred to as &quot;Bolivar&quot;.)<br />Like the others in the series, this book is fun brain candy.

Furthermore, it isn't nearly as overly wordy as Tess, or for that matter most 19th Century fiction. Its style is much more concise and direct than most of its contemporaries, although still a bit stilted by modern standards.<br />But what's more, this book is worthwhile from another standpoint entirely: it is a scathing condemnation of traditional marriage(&quot;And so, standing before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every other time of their lives until death took them, they would assuredly believe, feel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and desired during the few preceding weeks. What was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore.&quot;) and traditional religion, and of ruining one's life by living it to please society and its strictures; and while society has changed much since the days this book was written in (and about), there are those who would argue that those changes were not for the better; that liberalizing attitudes toward divorce, and toward living together without benefit of marriage, have been a seriously bad thing. This book is an excellent look at how it was not always such a good thing for people to be forced into marriages that were clearly not compatible, and forced to stay in them. And while, as I say, times have changed a great deal, there are still far too many people who marry just as precipitously as Jude did Arabella, or Sue did Phillotson, and with no better reasons. It says here that it is a distinct improvement in our society that when people make such a mistake, it can be rectified without totally destroying their lives forever after.<br />Granted, if you're looking for a worthwhile or positive female character, this is not the book to read; of the two main female characters, one is conniving, mercenary, rude and vulgar, (reminding me a great deal of Moll Flanders, from the DeFoe title of the same name, but without her redeeming charm) while the other is neurotic, selfish, whiny, and inconsistent. If you're looking for a worthwhile female character, &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; is a much better choice. Or better yet, the aforementioned &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. But in general, this book is much better written than &quot;Tess&quot;. For one thing, although it is just as much of a tragic romance, if not more so, the characters do not ALWAYS make the wrong choices.

If you're looking for a worthwhile female character, &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; is a much better choice. Or better yet, the aforementioned &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. But in general, this book is much better written than &quot;Tess&quot;. For one thing, although it is just as much of a tragic romance, if not more so, the characters do not ALWAYS make the wrong choices.

Rose Arvigo and Don Elijio Panti are carrying on a very valuable tradition of herbal healing, and while I don't accept all that the old man has to say about his cures (the concept that some illnesses are caused by evil spirits and black magic strikes me as downright silly, and a return to medieval attitudes towards disease, for one thing) nonetheless, it is apparent that his cures frequently work, regardless of whether his understanding of their cause is correct. I'm glad that there are people willing to live and work in the rainforest to learn these herbal cures and preserve them, because I know I wouldn't be. I'm a city boy at heart; as far as I'm concerned, the entire purpose of thousands of years of developing civilization is to learn how to keep &quot;the great outdoors&quot; OUTDOORS. Still, I appreciate the value of herbal medicine.<br />The book is well-written and interesting, and I wish all concerned with the attempts to preserve the rainforest and its herbs the best of luck and much success.	2001-06-15

This volume, as did each of the previous two, contains three mid-length stories set in Larry Niven's science fiction alternate-future in which the human race finds itself frequently at war with the Kzin, a race evolved from carnivorous hunting cats instead of from omnivorous monkeys. As in the first volume, the first story is by Niven himself, and is followed by two by other writers writing in his established universe. Each of the stories in this book can be considered a continuation of a story from a previous volume; Niven's follows up his introductory story of the first encounter between humans and Kzinti; the second is a collaboration by Jerry Pournelle and S. M. Stirling, which follows from the story they wrote in an earlier volume, and the third continues from Poul Anderson's previous effort. The only complaint I have is that there was no continuation of the storyline by Dean Ing, which was always my favorite, but I suppose that when there are only three stories per volume, there is not enough room for every author to appear in every book. (In Pournell and Stirling's story, there is even a hint of an answer to a previous question of mine: how DID a race such as the Kzin develop advanced technology in the first place?)	2001-06-07

No, in this case, this book is truly what it says it is: James Bishop Peabody edits a collection of original source material, puts it all in chronological order according to the events it is discussing, rather than the order in which it was written, and provides connecting and explaining paragraphs of his own. What we are left with is truly a biography rather than an autobiography; Peabody really should get the credit as author, rather than editor. Still, probably 2/3 to 3/4 of the book is actually written &quot;in his own words&quot;: excerpts from his incomplete autobiography, his correspondence, and his diary entries detailing his life in very thorough and exhaustive detail.<br />The book is a bit dry, and because it is in Adams' own words, its style is somewhat archaic, so it may not be for the general reader. But for the amateur historian who would like a close look at the source material, it's marvellous.	2001-06-03

If you can't bear to hear someone say bad things about an alleged classic of American literature, do not read this review.<br />This is, without a doubt, the single most overrated book in the English language. Granted, this doesn't mean that it is completely valueless, but considering its exalted reputation, it's amazingly close.<br />On the plus side, the basic plot is certainly a classic plot; &quot;normal fellow sails with compulsive maniac of a sea captain in hunt for killer denizen of the deep, and is the sole survivor of the experience&quot; is, after all, essentially the plot to &quot;Jaws&quot;, as well, so clearly, this novel has had major, long-lasting literary effect. And Melville starts well; the first 3-4 chapters are a delightful bit of lighthearted scene-setting and character development as we meet Ishmael and his new buddy, the harpooner Queequeg. And the penultimate three chapters, &quot;The Chase, days 1, 2, and 3&quot;, are exciting enough. And I won't deny that there are some interesting literary devices applied between these bookends; periodically, Melville interrupts his attempt at writing a treatise on whale hunting in the ninteenth century to slip in a bit of character development or plot foreshadowing. But only occasionally; most of this book is only of value if you're interested in knowing all there is to know about the technical aspects of the whaling industry in the ninteenth century; then it's absolutely invaluable. Meanwhile, Melville's style is horribly obtuse, over-wordy, and convoluted, to say nothing of pretentious. As an example, in the chapter, &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot;, Melville spends 7 1/2 pages, including a 469 word sentence that takes up just ONE of those pages, saying nothing more complex than that, although white is frequently considered a GOOD color, in the case of Moby Dick, it is a BAD one, because instead of being reminiscent of purity, it is reminiscent of spectrality. Seven and a half PAGES, to say what I, a mere reviewer, can say in 31 words. The whole book is like that; he never uses one word where ten will serve.<br />Mind you, I'm not some high school student forced to read this book for a class, unable to appreciate classic literature. I'm a very well-read 42 year old, who read the book on my own initiative because I felt that I wanted to make my own decision about it. I believe in speaking my mind; if I was any more complimentary about this book than I have been, I would be being intellectually dishonest.<br />Astonishingly, there are those who consider this &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;; if you like pretentious writing and writing that can't keep to its topic but rather keeps wandering off at tangents, I suppose it is. I suppose it IS rather amazing that he was able to keep his syntax unscrambled in the above-mentioned 469 word sentence, but that hardly qualifies it for the title of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;. For my money, that title should go to &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, but there are certainly any number of good candidates for the spot. This book is NOT one of them., a mere reviewer, can say in 31 words.

I thought I saw where this book was going long before the ending, and was severely unsatisfied with what I thought I saw coming. Dillard managed to put a surprise twist on the events of the story at the end that cleared up MOST of my objections, and was actually plausible as an explanation. What I'm left with as an objection is that I still can't accept that Kirk and McCoy were so dumb as not to suspect the newest addition to the crew when there was sabotage and espionage taking place; surely, that would have been the obvious response, even if said new crewmember WAS a very attractive and apparently pleasant person. Nor can I accept the concept that a medical doctor could become lovers with someone whose body temperature was significantly higher than normal without noticing that something ODD was involved. Or that scanners didn't detect anything odd when searching the ship for a missing Romulan, and there was a disguised Romulan aboard. Granted, the visual disguise was perfect, and her blood pressure was artificially normalized, but her body temperature was not, and I have real trouble believing that that wouldn't have showed up in a scan.<br />All in all, the book is well written, stylistically, but the characters, while mostly behaving believably, in a few very key areas are simply mishandled, and there are too many holes left in the plot for a high rating. But the story is too enjoyable for a low rating, either, so a middling three stars seems the only solution. Far from the best Star trek novel I've read, but certainly at LEAST as far from the worst.	2001-06-01

This novel is wonderfully written, so much so that it was able to hook me into its plotline, in spite of the fact that I've never been a fan either of Data or his quest for humanity. I've always considered that character concept too much of a &quot;been there, done that&quot; concept to really move me. (Gee, there's this artificial person who desperately wants to be human, and tragically never can, little realizing that his humanity is proven daily by his actions; where have I seen that before? &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, maybe? &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;? Marvel comics &quot;Avengers&quot; comic, with the Vision? This concept has been beaten to death long before Data was created, and done well enough that there really wasn't much to add to the concept.) Still, the concept proved just too ambitious; given that the story is set early in the run of the series, there were obvious problems with making such a major change in a character who had clearly not experienced this change  in later episodes; the book is set in the series' second season, immediately after the episode &quot;The Measure Of A Man&quot;. This left the author fairly well hamstrung and unable to come up with a satisfactory ending to the story; there are only a very few ways to deal with such a situation, and the way she found is not really surprising, just terribly trite and quite a let-down after the superb job she did with the early part of the story.<br />Definitely worth reading, but ultimately unsatisfying.	2001-05-29

Although this story seemed, to the best of my memory, to conform very faithfully to the television episode that it was based on, still it seemed to do a better job of establishing characters than that episode did. Perhaps this is simply a function of the fact that I already know the characters now, as I read the book, whereas I didn't yet know them when I first saw the episode on television. But I don't think so; I believe that once again, this book demonstrates that a book can do a better job of character development than the screen can; the screen can give us visual impact that even the best written description can't, but a book will win when it comes to character development every time.<br />Although I WILL admit that, had I not seen John Delancy's portrayal of Q, I might not have truly appreciated just how obnoxious he was merely from the book; his superciliousness seemed a bit understated.	2001-05-21

People often make the mistake of assuming that any book that is about children, that is written in a style accessible to children, and/or that is told in the style of someone telling children a story, is a &quot;children's story&quot;, and therefore of little interest to adults. But just as in the case of &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, just to name a few, this is a serious error in the case of the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, of which this book is chronologically the first, although it was not the first written.<br />Don't mistake me; children will love this book. And it's a very good book for them to read or even to have read to them before they're old enough to read. It is a religious allegory, with a strong Christian flavor, but even if you aren't Christian, the ethics and morals it teaches are exactly the sort of things that children need to learn, and it teaches them in a very age-appropriate way. But as with all the other books I listed above, a child's understanding and appreciation for this book can only be partial; there are levels to it that an adult can enjoy that a child can't.<br />Unless, of course, that adult has allowed his or her sense of wonder to atrophy; then they will only see the light-hearted style, and fail to see any of the beauty of the book, much like Uncle Andrew hearing nothing but the roaring and growling of a lion when Aslan speaks.	2001-05-17

If you are a fan of the Romance genre, particularly if you are a fan of the historical Romance genre, and most especially if you are a fan of the tragic, historical Romance genre, you'll doubtless enjoy this book. What's more, if you like lush, flowery descriptions of pastoral settings, you'll doubtless love this book.<br />Since I'm not overly fond of any of these things, it's main interest for me was as a period piece, a reminder of just WHY we don't want to go back to the &quot;good old days&quot; of Victorian sexuality. (Not that I really need much reminding.) It is certainly true, however, that given the limitations put on it by the time period of its writing, its genre, and the author's prediliction for flowery language, it was a far more interesting read than I expected; its characters were surprisingly sympathetic, and its plot more interesting than a cursory summary would make it seem.<br />When an author has a definite idea of what course of action he deems the correct one, there are two ways for him to make his point: either he can have a character that resonates with the reader take that action, and show the positive outcome, or he can have his characters take the opposite action, and show what disasters follow. Hardy invariably takes the latter course in this book. Bank on it; if his characters are faced with a choice, they'll make the WRONG choice. And as a result of their choices, tragedy follows. This is generally considered to be &quot;having realistic characters&quot;; I've never entirely understood why. (Is it REALLY more realistic to be dumb as a box of rocks, rather than having at least as much sense as the average five year old?) Still, the technique is a perfectly acceptable literary device, and Hardy uses it well; the fact that I have a preference for the opposite technique is rather beside the point.<br />This is certainly a more interesting and accessible read than many of its contemporaries, and many readers will be far more impressed with it than I was.it than I was.	2001-05-15

This is a collection of short stories set in the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; that is the backdrop for the &quot;Mage&quot; role playing game. Many of the stories are quite interesting and well-written; a few more are either one or the other. A few were just not up to professional standards. In general, this is a fairly interesting read, but I do wish that they had better quality control: the number of typos and other proofreading errors was higher than should be found in a professionally edited book.<br />The first story, &quot;The Crystal Messiah&quot;, by Philip Nutman, started well, but the ending looked as if the author had missed his deadline, and had to rush 25+ pages of story into a one-page summary.<br />Next, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, by Edo van Belkom, was interesting and well-written (being one of the few stories in the volume in which I DIDN'T find a typo, grammatical error, or malaprop) but I thought that the basic idea was a rather trivial conflict, even if it was potentially deadly.<br />&quot;Introit&quot;, by Jackie Cassada, was perhaps the best of the lot except for the stories by Kevin Andrew Murphy and James A. Moore; again, there were no glaring errors, but more importantly, the characters were well-developed, the plot moved well and seemed reasonable, and the ending was satisfying.<br />&quot;When The Moon&quot;, by James S. Dorr, was not bad; it had its share of typos, and I can't really say that it resonated with me, but it was a fair story, fairly told.<br />&quot;That Which Is Given&quot;, by Don Bassingthwaite, again had its share of errors, but other than that was a very interesting story, very well told.<br />&quot;Waiting For Yesterday&quot;, by Brett Brooks, was a well-told story, and fairly interesting, but I found the ending less than satisfying.<br />&quot;Candledark&quot;, by Thomas S. Roche, was a moderately interesting story, more sloppily proofed than most, with interesting characters, and a somewhat implausible ending.<br />&quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot;, by James Lowder, had no obvious errors in the text, and was a marvellous story with interesting characters and a very satisfying ending.<br />&quot;A Block Of Time&quot;, by Jane M. Lindskold, had a bit more than its share of errors, but was otherwise an interesting and enjoyable read.<br />&quot;The Judas Tree&quot;, by Richard Lee Byers, was an interesting story too, but had WAY too many errors to be considered professional (I count 11 in a twenty page story). Professionals proofread their own work, Richard.<br />&quot;End Run&quot;, by Nigel D. Findley, was not the most interesting of stories, but it was told in an interesting first-person style, and was error-free other than misspelling &quot;tinnitus&quot; as &quot;titinus&quot;.<br />&quot;Pushing The Right Buttons&quot;, by Doug Murray, was another sloppily unprofessional story (eight typos in fourteen pages); other than that, it was an only passable story anyway.<br />&quot;Dreamspeaker&quot;, by Bill Crider, had only one typo that I noticed (&quot;through&quot; used when &quot;throw&quot; was meant), but while the story was interesting in general, there was to my mind a flaw in the basic storyline.<br />&quot;Devil's Bargain&quot;, by Thomas Kane, was a fairly interesting story with only somewhat more than its share of typos.<br />&quot;Silver Nutmeg, Golden Pear&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Grim Reminders&quot;, both by Kevin Andrew Murphy and James A. Moore (the first story primarily by the former, the second primarily by the latter),were unquestionably the best of the lot. The characters were delightful, the plot fascinating, and the writing good. Murphy managed to get through a 38 page story with only one noticeable glitch, and Moore 26 pages with three. But these stories were good enough that I'd have been willing to overlook far more typos. I hope to see more writing by these two.<br />Finally, &quot;The Seven Sages Of The Bamboo Grove&quot;, by John H. Steele, was unquestionably the weakest story in the collection. There was only one typo, but the story itself was disjointed, a confusing attempt at being artistic, and neither the plot (such as I was able to follow it) nor the characters were even marginally interesting.tionably the weakest story in the collection.

The author gives a tremendous amount of information on the life of Butch Cassidy, as well as on his sources for that information, and does an admirable job of admitting that we really don't know how that life ended; he gives a detailed account of the standard version of Butch &amp; Sundance's deaths (shot in Bolivia) as well as detailed accounts of the various alleged sightings of Butch after that, and the pros and cons of those alleged sightings. He admits that he just isn't sure what the truth is, and leaves it at that. But if you expect a biography of as exciting a person as Butch Cassidy to be itself exciting, this book will be a disappointment; it is not told in a narrative style, but in the style of a researcher, and very little of the character of Butch comes through.

This book is a very thought-provoking, interesting book, and also quite an enjoyable read, telling some unpleasant truths with a liberal touch of subtle and rather offbeat humor. Still, I can't imagine why it enjoys the spectacular reputation that it has; it is good, but it isn't THAT good. It's a fairly typical anti-scientific distopia, warning of all the horrors that will surely accompany modern society's move toward comfort, ease, and lack of personal responsibility, and away from all those marvellous old-fashioned virtues of suffering, sacrifice, self-flagellation, and martyrdom. Granted, some of its points are very true, but a great many of them are overstated past the point of caricature, and others are very debatable. (Does anyone REALLY think that the culture that created John (&quot;the savage&quot;) and all of his foolish self-abasement is REALLY any better than the majority society in the book? Does anyone REALLY think that by quoting Shakespeare without truly understanding what he's quoting, he's any better than the &quot;normal&quot; folks quoting hypnopaedic brainwashing without understanding what they're quoting? The author seemed to; I don't.) Still, as I said, this makes for a very interesting and thought-provoking book, even if the thoughts it provoked in me are very different from those the author intended to provoke. And it IS a very well-crafted book.	2001-05-03

This book did a spectacualar job of any biography's first mission: to provide enough information both on the pros and cons of the subject to allow the reader to form opinions of his own, even ones that disagree with those of the author. Remini does a fine job of detailing the accomplishments of Jackson, but he also admits willingly that Jackson was far from perfect, and generally makes no attempt to sugar-coat the flaws in his subject. But what's even more impressive, is that even in the case of events that HE is willing to cut Jackson some slack in passing judgement on, he gives sufficiently clear and unbiased reporting to enable me in several cases to decide that I am NOT. Further, in at least one case, his apparent opinion of the merits of Jackson's actions is harsher than mine is.<br />This volume covers Jackson's life from birth through his governorship of Florida; if the next two volumes are as good as this, I do not anticipate needing any other biographies of Andrew Jackson. I cannot rate this book any more highly for someone who would like to learn about one of our most controversial presidents, without having his flaws glossed over, but without ignoring his legitimate accomplishments, either.	2001-05-02

But it is a poorly conceived story, handling the concepts of time-travel and alternate time-lines as badly as I've ever seen them handled; the characterizations are mostly poor and one-dimensional, the dialogue is stilted and awkward, and (sorry if I'm being overly picky here) authors who don't know the difference between \\"illegible\\" and \\"inarticulate\\" (as in, \\"an illegible cry tightened his throat\\",) (pg 66) shouldn't be published, and editors who don't know enough to fix that mistake shouldn't be in the business either.	2001-04-21

It started poorly, not the least because the basic concept --a crossover between Star Trek and the amazingly silly show, &quot;Here Come The Brides&quot; -- was ridiculous beyond words. Additionally, Ms. Hambly was rather clumsy in setting the stage; in order to get the characters where they needed to be, she had them behave rather badly out of character. But once the characters WERE positioned where she wanted them, she showed a very deft hand in handling their characters, and wrote a very enjoyable, moving story with good handling of the characters, and if the time travel concept made no sense, that's no different from most other time travel stories, and this one was actually handled somewhat better than most.

If you're looking for hard-core pornography, this book isn't for you. On the other hand, if you're a relative novice, I suppose that there may be some helpful information here, and if what you're looking for is excellent erotica (or for those less inclined toward euphemisms, soft-core porn) the book is excellent. The photos are extremely erotic, although they never show genitalia; the models, although apparently actually engaged in sex, are always positioned strategically so that, while we see breasts, buttocks, backs, even nipples, we never see even a hint of pubic hair, much less vaginas or penises. (We do see artists renderings of them in a couple of insets, but not actual photos.)	2001-03-27

This book, while remaining true to the movie in most major plot points, varying only in minor detail, nonetheless manages to be a great deal more plausible and internally consistent, both with itself and with the established Star trek universe as a whole. The characterization is better, the plot flows more smoothly and makes more sense, and several details that were completely implausible in the movie are at least arguable here, if not completely acceptable. The book is quite enjoyable on a simple action-story level, and on deeper levels it is at least as good as most Star Trek stories, better than some if also not as good as others.<br />Definitely recommended for any &quot;Trek&quot; fans who would like to see the movie version turned into a viable story, and if you actually liked the movie, there's nothing here not to like.	2001-03-23

This is a contest, named after Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, whose 1830 novel, &quot;Paul Clifford&quot;, opened with the instant cliche, &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot;. The object of the contest is to write the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels, generally by using impossibly complex and tangled syntax combined with vermillion-purple prose, guaranteeing that no noun is without more than its share of excessively flamboyant adjectives, no verb without more than its share of ridiculously flamboyant adverbs, and if possible including an incomprehensible or mixed (or incomprehensibly mixed) metaphor.<br />If you enjoy the language enough to appreciate attempts to pillory those who abuse it, and have a sense of humor such that you find satire to be an appropriate form of pillorying, you will enjoy this book (and any of the others in the series, &quot;It Was A Dark And Stormy Night&quot;, &quot;Son Of It Was A Dark And Stormy Night&quot;, &quot;It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: The Final Conflict&quot;, and &quot;Bride Of Dark And Stormy&quot;). I found this one to be on a par with &quot;Final Conflict&quot;, which is to say, better than the original, but not quite as good as &quot;Son Of...&quot;. (I've yet to track down a copy of &quot;Bride Of...&quot;, so I can't compare this one to that one.)	2001-03-19

This is the second volume of a two-volume biography; the first is &quot;Lone Star Rising&quot;, which covers Johnson's life up until his run for the vice-presidency with JFK; this volume covers his years as vice president, president, and his short retirement.<br />Dallek does a very good job of showing both the positives and the negatives of a man who he demonstrates clearly deserves the title of the book. Johnson is unquestionably a giant of American history; his domestic accomplishments, most notably pushing the Civil Rights Act through congress (something that few other men could have accomplished in the same position, given that Johnson had more influence with southern politicians who were inclined to oppose the act than most liberal democrats at the time) are certainly undeniable. Yet his flaws were spectacular too, notably his handling of the Vietnam war; it isn't just that he escalated the war from a minor, we-had-a-few-advisors-over-there situation to a situation in which thousands of Americans were dying; it isn't just that he refused to pull out when it became apparent that we weren't going to win the war anytime soon, and that Americans by and large didn't support the cost in lives of staying the course. It's that he lied repeatedly about our prospects there in order to build support for something that he knew perfectly well people wouldn't support if they knew the truth, and that he became downright paranoid on the subject, considering anyone who disagreed with him on it to be a &quot;commie dupe&quot; and a &quot;traitor&quot;. It's that he subtly undercut the presidential campaign of Hubert Humphrey, his own vice-president and the man most likely to continue his domestic policies, in favor of Richard Nixon, because Nixon's stance on Vietnam seemed more in keeping with his own.<br />Dallek does an excellent job of detailing all of this, and having read this book, I am both more aware of the good Johnson did, and more aware of the reasons why, prior to reading this book, I did not credit his presidency for that good; all I knew prior to reading this book was the negative side of the story, and not even all of that.eading this book, I did not credit his presidency for that good; all I knew prior to reading this book was the negative side of the story, and not even all of that.	2001-03-18

(The others being &quot;It Was A Dark And Stormy Night&quot;, &quot;Dark And Stormy Rides Again&quot;, &quot;It Was A Dark And Stormy Night: The Final Conflict&quot;, and, I think, &quot;Bride Of Dark And Stormy&quot;, if I'm not mistaken.) The Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest is a contest , named for Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, whose &quot;Paul Clifford&quot; (1830) opens with the immortal line &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot;, which is run by Scott Rice and sponsored by San Jose State University, in which contestants vie to write the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels. Generally, the trick is to make the sentences as complex syntactically as it is possible to imagine, while violating as many rules of creative consistency as possible, and to be certain that no noun is without more than its share of purple-prose adjectives.<br />This is not for everyone, but if this sounds like fun to you, it probably is. This is the third of the collections that I've read; I thought that &quot;The Final Conflict&quot; was better than the original; this is even better than that one.	2001-03-16

Certainly exceptional at the time it was written; it is not one of the<br />earliest written Darkover novels, but it was written much closer to<br />the beginning than to the end of MZB's career, and it is at least as<br />good as, and perhaps better than, many of the books that were written<br />after she'd developed a great deal more experience and seasoning as a<br />writer. It is one of the best &quot;coming of age&quot; stories I've<br />ever seen, partly due to the fact that it involves the coming of age<br />of not one or two, but three main characters, and partly due to the<br />fact that it is perhaps the single most tasteful, insightful,<br />believeable, and moving story of the coming of age of a young man<br />coming to terms with his own homosexuality that I've ever seen. If this<br />concept truly bothers you, then perhaps this book isn't for you, but<br />if you're even willing to attempt open-mindedness on the subject, give<br />it a try.<br />In the chronology of the Darkover series, this book falls<br />just before &quot;Sharra's Exile&quot; and &quot;Winds of<br />Darkover&quot;, and just after &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;. It is the<br />story of the Sharra rebellion (often referred to in the books that<br />fall later in the series) and is the story of the coming of age of<br />Regis Hasteur, Lew Alton, and Danilo Syrtis, all characters seen in<br />other books as older adults.<br />If you're looking to start reading the<br />series, this is as good a book to start with as any. If you've read<br />any other book in the series and liked it, this book is a must.	2001-03-11

The characters are marvelously portrayed, to the point that established characters are shown to have abilities and talents previously unsuspected, but absolutely plausible and in-character for them (if you feel Chekov's generally gotten the short end of the stick, you'll love seeing him pull a few rabbits out of his hat in this one), and there are several new characters introduced that I would definitely like to see more of. The plot moves well, and is truly compelling; generally, I'm reading about a dozen books at a time; I'll read a chapter of one, then a chapter of another, in no particular order. After about the midway point of this book, I simply couldn't put it down; that almost never happens with me. And while Uhura IS the primary focus of the story, in that it is HER idea that leads to the solution of the problem, and her talents ARE vital to the mission, it is still plausible in that she does not take over the role that Kirk and Spock usually play (and still do) as the leaders of the crew. Some might find that disappointing (one reviewer here did, at least) but it seems to me that it is far more plausible and pleasing to see Uhura (and Chekov, for that matter) play major roles, far more so than usual, while still remaining junior officers. Kirk and Spock are handled with a sure hand, and play their usual roles WITHOUT putting the junior characters in their shadows as they so often do.<br />This is the first Star Trek book I've ever given a rating of 5 stars. That should say something.	2001-03-02

But for many of the presidents, it is almost impossible to find<br />a full, comprehensive biography, and for those interested in those<br />presidents, this work is invaluable.

Riker, particularly, seems completely out of character, very self-conscious and uncertain, very unhappy to be a first officer, thinking of Data (at least at the start of the book) as simply an ambulatory tool with no personhood, and being even more pacifistic and unwilling to cause harm to another entity, even in self-defense, than Picard.<br />This book would probably rate four stars if it stood alone, as a science fiction story with characters that were entirely its own; but the poor handling of established characters brings it down to three.	2001-02-25

I agree with the reviewer who said that the mystery was too easy to solve, and I am NOT the connoisseur of mysteries that he or she admits to being. Part of the problem is the title; by including the word &quot;murder&quot; in the title, we know from the beginning that the death/s are murders, which the characters don't, and are looking to solve the mystery of &quot;whodunit&quot; before the characters know that there is a murder to solve. Had it been titled &quot;The Vulcan Academy Affair&quot;, or &quot;Trouble At The Vulcan Academy&quot;, or some such similar title, we might have missed the clues that told us who the murderer was. As it is, I was certain of the murderer and the motive before the characters had even begun to suspect that the deaths were not caused by accidental mechanical failure.<br />That being said, I did think that the book was well-written; the characters were well-developed and consistent with previously established character concepts. The plot moved well, and it was very readable.	2001-02-18

The editorial review claims that this is the fourth collection; I believe that this is in error.

To be honest, this one isn't QUITE as funny as &quot;Dark and Stormy; the Final Conflict&quot;, which is the only other collection that I've read yet, but it is still well worth reading if you have the particular warped sense of humor to enjoy parodies of overblown purple prose.	2001-02-15

One would expect a novel written in the 19th century about the subject of adultery, penitence, conscience, and puritanism to resonate far less with the modern reader than this one does. Granted, the language is somewhat stilted to a modern ear, but not nearly as much so as most of its contemporaries, and while the characters are made to suffer for their &quot;sin&quot;, it is clear that Hawthorne feels that the punishment far exceeds what is just. The novel is more a condemnation of the sort of society that the Puritans were, rather than a condemnation of Hester Prynne. And while her paramour is not a very sympathetic character, it isn't because of his part in the &quot;sin&quot;, but rather because he's coward and hypocrite enough to allow her to bear the full brunt of the punishment, while keeping his own good name and reputation intact, up until the moment of his impending death.<br />All in all, a surprisingly good read, and a very worthwhile book to discuss; there are many concepts involved which are capable of being seen in more than one light.	2001-02-12

Fortunately, I and almost everyone I know has just such a sick sense of humor.<br />The basic concept is marvellous: The Darwin Awards are imaginary awards, given to those who improve the human gene pool by eliminating themselves from it in spectacularly stupid ways, thus demonstrating that this was, ultimately, for the best. Generally, this means engaging in terminal stupidity, but occasional &quot;winners&quot; &quot;only&quot; injure themselves in ways that render them permanently infertile.<br />The book also includes &quot;(dis)honorable mentions&quot;, who do NOT eliminate themselves from the gene pool, but whose stories are good enough, and whose stupidity is spectacular enough, that the only reason they don't qualify for an award is failure to meet that requirement.<br />Not all of the stories in the book are true; they are all labelled, at least hypothetically accurately, as to whether they are &quot;confirmed&quot;, &quot;unconfirmed&quot;, &quot;personal accounts&quot;, or &quot;Urban Legends&quot;. I felt that too many stories were included that were unconfirmed; the whole point to these stories is that they're true. Anybody can make up a story about spectacularly unbelieveable stupidity; what's the fun in that? What makes these stories interesting is the awe one feels at their truth. I can understand including the best of the unconfirmed stories, listed as such, if the author suspects that they're probably true. But the Urban Legends should be eliminated; they detract from the whole.<br />Further, some of the stories get overly cutesy in the telling; those that merely factually report the events, without attempting to embellish the natural humor inherent in the story work best.<br />In summation: IF you find the basic concept funny, you will probably enjoy this book, even if it isn't as well-done as I'd expected. If, on the other hand, you are offended at the concept of laughing at the demise of a fellow human, no matter how well-deserved that demise might be, (or if you're a creationist) then you certainly won't be amused by this book.emise of a fellow human, no matter how well-deserved that demise might be, (or if you're a creationist) then you certainly won't be amused by this book.	2001-02-06

Granted, this book is a novelization of a movie, and a very faithful one at that, so much of the credit goes to the makers of the movie rather than to Brooks, but he does succeed in taking a marvelous story and telling it wonderfully, fully capturing the spirit of the story with his tone, as well as the events in it.<br />And a wonderful story it is, too. A superb sequel to the original Peter Pan story, answering the question &quot;What would Peter be like if he ever DID grow up?&quot; in a very plausible, indisputable way. Further, it is a perfect primer on how NOT to be a father, and what effects it can have on the children of someone who's falling down on the job, as well as showing a good example of how to do it right for comparison. Additionally, it is, like the original Peter Pan, an excellent story of the magic of childhood, but this one discusses how an adult can (and indeed MUST, if they want to avoid becoming unbearable) hold on to some of that magic, even while growing up and becoming responsible. And that sometimes, even people who HAVE lost that magic still don't learn how to be particularly responsible.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is truly wonderful; do yourself a favor, and track down a copy. It will be worth the effort. Then settle in for a good evening's read. You won't regret it.	2001-02-05

If you are familiar with the movie that this book was based on, I will say that this is one of the most faithful novelizations of a movie that I've ever seen; almost every scene from the movie is included, and most of the dialogue is faithfully kept as well. Ms. McIntyre satisfies her creative urge by filling in gaps in the storyline, adding internal dialogue and insight into the characters' thoughts as well as transitional scenes that further explain and clarify the storyline.<br />If you are not familiar with the movie, there are a few quibbles you might have with the story, but for my money, the quibbles are all things that originated in the movie, and that Ms. McIntyre is not responsible for: the running gag of Kirk attempting to &quot;fit in&quot; to 20th century society by cursing, which he does clumsily, and Spock's even more clumsy attempts to follow Kirk's lead. I'm not certain whether this was supposed to be purely a humorous bit, or whether it was supposed to be a comment on how silly vulgarity makes one look, and how foolish it is to try to fit in in that way. If it was intended for humor value, its humor wore thin very quickly, and if it was intended for the latter purpose, I'm not sure that it was effective. But in any case, that, as I say, is not Ms. McIntyre's fault; it was part of the movie that she was working from. Similarly, any part of the plot that referred back to the previous movie, and Spock's tenuous grip on his memories as a result of being recently &quot;reborn&quot;, do not sit well with me (see my review of &quot;The Search For Spock&quot; for my objections to that movie/book) but again, this is not the author's fault. I also do not believe that a bit of ambient radiation causes malfunctions in phasers, as happens in one scene, but the same disclaimer of responsibility applies.<br />On its own merits, and outside of the consideration of how well it remains faithful either to the movie it was based on, or the Star Trek universe in general, or the previously established characters, this book is still quite good, and better able to stand on its own as a Science Fiction Action-Adventure novel than most Star Trek books, and it also does a better job of faithfully portraying the known characters than many. And as I said, it does a marvellous job of faithfully depicting the story from the movie while building on it plausibly and believably.

It isn't bad, but it's not nearly up to Ivins' standards for humor, and there really isn't much information here; I expected to come away both significantly more entertained than I was, and significantly more informed than I was. But other than the news that &quot;as a conservative, I support property rights&quot; Bush made a lot of money using eminent domain to seize private property in order to build a brand-new, government financed stadium for his baseball team (not that this surprises me, but it WAS information I didn't previously have) there just wasn't much there. Perhaps I'd have been more impressed if I'd bought and read the book earlier, before the campaign really heated up, rather than waiting for the softcover edition, but by now, most of what's here (at least, most of what isn't intuitively obvious) has already been covered elsewhere.<br />Let's see if I can summarize: George W. Bush is a wealthy son of privilege, who opposes campaign finance reform because he is adept at raising tons of money from other wealthy, financially conservative businessmen. (Well, gee, I'd never have guessed if Ivins hadn't told me.) He needs support from the Christian fundamentalists to get elected, so he plays the part of a Christian conservative, and appeases them as much as he needs to to keep their support, which is quite a bit, but he doesn't seem truly enthusiatic. (I kind of figured that, too, although I'm glad to have the idea that he isn't really enthusiastic confirmed.) He supports the death penalty, to the point that he won't pardon or even commute the sentence of even the most sympathetic residents of death row, even an attractive, born-again woman whose commutation of sentence is supported by Pat Robertson. (I'd heard that, and frankly give him points for sticking to his guns on that case; if you support the death penalty, you shouldn't waffle just because the criminal seems like a likeable person, and in any case, this wasn't news.) He is truly appallingly bad about protecting the environment, preferring to protect the corporate bottom line. (Again, no new news here.)<br />About the closest we come to news is the impression that he really isn't as dumb as he seems, and that he really does care about education (although what he believes will help is of questionable value.)<br />Again, this isn't a bad book, but I expect better of Molly Ivins.out protecting the environment, preferring to protect the corporate bottom line.

If you're already familiar with Dave Barry, all I need to say is that this book is unquestionably one of his best, along with &quot;Dave Barry Talks Back&quot;, &quot;Dave Barry Turns 40&quot;, and &quot;Dave Barry's Only Travel Guide You'll Ever Need&quot;. If you aren't familiar with his work, all I can say is that he's one of the funniest writers I've ever encountered, and as long as you don't object to irreverence (read 'intentionally immature for effect') you will probably love his writing, too.<br />Ironically, this book contains my all-time favorite Dave Barry column, which happens also to be one of two of his columns I've ever read that are not humorous, but are decidedly serious. This column is &quot;Uneasy Rider&quot;, the column about his twelve-year-old son having a semiserious bicycle accident; it is an immensely powerful description of what it feels like to be a parent in that situation. The book also contains the two or three columns that were the genesis of his later book, &quot;Dave Barry's Book Of Bad Songs&quot;. If you have read that book, you'll have seen these columns, but if you haven't, you're in for a treat. (He runs a reader survey, and does two columns on the results, asking &quot;what is the worst rock/pop song ever written?&quot;)<br />Marvellous book; I can't recommend it any higher.	2001-01-25

Unfortunately, there is also much that is bad to be said about it; on balance, I think the bad slightly exceeds the good.<br />On the plus side, there is a fascinating basic plotline, and some excellent characters. The writing is effective, and draws the reader into the plot; by the end of the book, I actually found myself caring about the characters and what happened to them, in spite of not really liking the book. And if you like complex, involved, convoluted plots, this book is certainly one that you will not want to miss.<br />On the down side, while there is certainly 400+ pages of excellent plot in this novel, it takes the author 875 pages to tell it. (This refers to the unabridged Wordsworth Classics edition, in paperback.) The writing reminds me of a quote I once heard describing Dickens (and which could easily be applied to many 19th century authors): he was paid by the word, and it shows. Further, Dumas uses an odd convention for conversations: he does not change paragraph whenever he changes speakers. I don't know whether this was a standard convention for his time and place, or whether it is strictly his own. This is a minor quibble, but it is distracting, at least at first.<br />Then, there are some truly immense amounts of suspension of disbelief that one must manage if one is to take the book seriously; primary among them is the fact of Dantes' immense competence, especially in the social skills and understanding of people, during his long, drawn-out revenge. Here, after all, is a man, who when he was a 19 year old was so naive that when he was imprisoned, he couldn't even fathom who would have wished him ill or why. He spent 14 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, the rest of it with only his one fellow prisoner as company. Granted, he had a native intelligence and charisma, and his fellow prisoner was well-educated, and spent much time teaching him languages, math, science, and history during their years together. And of course, once he escapes, he becomes fabulously wealthy. But native intelligence, a fine classical education, and a ton of money do NOT equate to a knowledge of people; he could not have picked that up in prison, because it is not the kind of thing that one can learn by studying the abstract; it can only be learned through practice, and he had none of that. Yet as soon as he leaves prison, he immediately is portrayed as a masterful schemer and manipulator. Granted, there is a ten-year gap during which we do not see his adventures, but even so, it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would be able to learn all that he learned in that time. Not to mention that it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would have been able to protect his person and his wealth while learning the people skills necessary.<br />Then we have specific instances of his manipulation being more complete than anyone could reasonably expect to do, no matter how much they know, or how much money they have, at least without better explanations from the author (which we do not get). For instance, at the very beginning of his insinuation of himself into Parisian society, he buys the superior horses of one of his unwitting enemies, and then gives them back to the man's wife as a present, to sow marital dischord. When he does this, he knows that she intends letting a friend of hers (also the wife of one of his enemies) have a ride in the carriage behind the splendid beasts the next day. So he positions himself and his servant at precisely the right place to intercept the carriage the next day when the horses run amok and threaten to overset the carriage, and save the lady, thus insinuating himself into her good graces. It is made very clear that he knows that the horses will run wild by the questions and orders he gives his servant, but it is never explained HOW he knew that. Had he provided the driver for the carriage? It was never stated. Had he bribed the existing driver? Again, it was never stated, and it seems unlikely that such a bribe could be safely made, and kept completely secret. Had he insinuated an irritant into the horses' equippage? That would have assured them running wild, but not at the exact place and time that they did so, with no chance of overturning the carriage before ever they got to that point. All in all, an incident like that one needs to be explained in order to be at all plausible, and it wasn't. And there were others, too, less obvious, but still implausible.<br />And a last negative, which causes me to drop my rating from three stars to two: Dantes is supposed to be a sympathetic character, terrible to his enemies, benificent to his friends, but all I can say is, preserve me from the pain of such benificence. Toward the end of the book, he saves his best friend's lover's life, by simulating her death. Yet he allows his friend to think that she is dead FOR A WHOLE MONTH in order to &quot;test his mettle&quot; to discern if he &quot;merits happiness&quot;. And in fact, years before, in his other act of benificence, to that friend's father, he saves him from financial ruin, but only does so at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute, allowing the man to come within a hairsbreadth of committing suicide in despair. If this were done in order to demonstrate that his ordeals have cost him all compassion, it would be one thing, but as I say, he is portrayed as being a marvellously benificent friend; the friends he has treated in this way not only forgive him, but don't seem to be aware that there is anything to forgive; they act as if his treatment of them has been marvellous.<br />No, I cannot say that I enjoyed this book. I cannot rate it highly. I cannot, even, concede that it is (on balance) well done. But there certainly are things to like about it, and any book that can produce the interesting philosopical arguments that this one is capable of can't be all bad.ver stated, and it seems unlikely that such a bribe could be safely made, and kept completely secret.

But it hasn't really aged well; what Crane attempts is to tell a war story that is the antithesis of the traditional, enthusiastic panegyric of heroic warriors. In 1895, this was novel and ground-breaking, and the writing style was not unlike many at that time period.<br />But for the modern reader, there are many better examples of anti-war stories, that tell the story of the horrors of war, and the basic humanity of the participants, who are neither heroes nor cowards entirely, but always a little bit of both. And to the modern ear, the style of this book is overly flowery and elaborate, except when the author tries to capture the dialogue in the vernacular, and fails by badly overdoing it. Dialect is a tricky thing; if you render it verbatim, it sounds exaggerated. Just a touch of patois in dialogue goes a long way.<br />Historically, this is an important novel, a major landmark in the history of American Literature, and a good source of insight into the thought process of the country at the time it was written. But it is not a book to read for its own sake, not for the modern reader.	2001-01-13

This is an okay book, neither as good as it's fans claim, nor as bad as its detractors say.<br />2.)It is, however, a lousy sequel to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;; for one thing, it does not follow the obvious plotline Crichton set out at the end of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (the dinosaurs escaping to the jungle) for the planned sequel. For another, contrary to what Crichton claims at the beginning of this book, which claim is defended by his obsequious fans among the reviewers, Ian Malcolm was quite thoroughly dead at the end of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, sufficiently much so that it rated a comment which I quote: &quot;They (the Costa Rican government) did not even permit the burial of Hammond or Ian Malcolm.&quot; If the story had been told in the first person, and this comment had come from the mouth of a fallible character, Crichton's claim in &quot;Lost World&quot; that rumors of Malcolm's death had been erroneous would have been plausible. But the story was told in the third person, omniscient narrator style; that quote came from the mouth of the author, and can not, therefore, be set aside so easily. Yet here in &quot;The Lost World&quot;, that is exactly what Crichton tries to do: he claims that rumors of Malcolm's death were greatly exaggerated.<br />3.) Why does he do this? It's pretty obvious, actually, and I'm astounded that none of the other 400+ reviewers here seem to have figured it out. It has nothing to do with needing to bring him back to make the book match the movie sequel; nothing else in the book matched the movie, so what makes anyone think that Crichton or the producers would care if that detail was different? No, it has to do with the fact that if Malcolm isn't available, Crichton doesn't have anyone handy to spout chaos theory, and he neither wants to leave out his pet psuedoscience, nor create a brand-new chaotician character to act as his mouthpiece. Understandable, but not really forgivable; if he needed to keep Malcolm alive for the sequel, he shouldn't have killed him off in the first place. Very careless.<br />4.) One of the weakest points in the plot is the fact that I find it extremely implausible that Malcolm would even CONSIDER going anywhere near the island once the suggestion was made that there might, again, be dinosaurs on it. After what he'd been through in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and given what we know of his character, it seems highly out of character for him to so readily join the expedition. There should at least have been serious soul-searching, or a more pressing reason for him to go. As it was, he seemed almost eager: 'Oh, the dinosaurs may not all be dead after all? Well, in that case count me in!' Just not at all in character, but then again, see comment #3; Crichton needed him to be there, so he was there. Never mind what the character would really do.<br />5.) There is almost NOTHING in common between the novel, &quot;Lost World&quot;, and the movie, &quot;The Lost World&quot;. There are two characters in common, plus one character in the movie who is sort of a pastiche of two of the characters in the book (Thorne and Eddie are sort of combined into one), and I think there was one scene that was similar; I don't remember the movie well enough to be certain. But seriously, that's IT. I've never seen a movie have less in common with the book it's named after (I won't even say 'based on', 'cause it really WASN'T!).<br />All in all, a tolerably good action-adventure novel, but don't expect it to follow logically from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, or to bear any resemblance to the movie version.equel, he shouldn't have killed him off in the first place.

The regular characters are handled well, we get a better than usual look at the character of Uhura, as well as a fascinating look at the character of Kor, the Klingon commander from &quot;Errand Of Mercy&quot;. And while the character of Kor was a bit more sympathetic than I care for (he didn't strike me as nearly such a reasonable fellow in &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot;), perhaps he had, in fact, matured a bit with age, as he himself suggests. Further, we meet an interesting if unpleasant new character, Guy Maslin, a famous musician every bit as mature and pleasant as, say, Mick Jagger in his heyday, or Frank Sinatra, or for that matter, Wolfgang Mozart.<br />On the downside, the ending leaves something to be desired; I find it dubious that beings as powerful and accomplished as the Taygetians were demonstrated to be could possibly have been unaware of what, in the end, the Enterprise crew had to teach them, and the love affair between Uhura and Maslin ends predictably, and unsatisfactorily.<br />A mid-range Star Trek book: much better than many, not nearly as good as others.	2000-12-24

Before I read this book, I knew nothing about Byzantium. So I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information, and realized after I started that I had made a mistake; I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was the third volume of a three-volume set. Doubtless, it would have been less overwhelming to start at the beginning, especially for someone like me, with no previous knowledge of the subject. Still, I learned a great deal from this book; not only was it informative, but it wasn't nearly as dry and impenatrable as I'd been afraid it might be. In fact, the style is downright readable; Norwich actually has a rather pleasant, if dry, sense of humor.<br />I definitely plan on getting the first two volumes of this series, and continuing my education on the history of Byzantium.	2000-12-09

Then there's &quot;About Barbers&quot;, which starts as a commentary on what we now call Murphy's Law, and then moves on to complain of barbers who are intent on cutting the customer's hair the way THEY want it, and to blazes with what the customer wants -- a complaint that seems still relevant even today. Then follows another story with a point unaffected by the passage of time: &quot;A Literary Nightmare&quot;, a complaint about advertising jingles that cannot be driven out of the brain with an icepick. Then we have &quot;The Stolen White Elephant&quot;, in which Twain directs his satire at the deductive powers of would-be Sherlock Holmeses, and a self-deprecatory tale of his own foolishness during the Civil War (&quot;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot;). Next up is my personal favorite, &quot;Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences&quot;, in which he gives elaborate reasons, in great detail, why he disagrees with the common wisdom that James Fenimore Cooper is a great writer (or, for that matter, can write at all.) (Perhaps I should find &quot;Pathfinder&quot; and &quot;Deerslayer&quot; on the book list here, and transcribe his comments.) And he closes with &quot;How To Tell A Story&quot;, in which he gives advice that seems to me to be good advice for would-be stand-up comics.<br />The humor in some of these stories is a bit unsubtle, but certainly if you are fond of Twain, and haven't all of these stories in some other collection, it's worth the price of admission for even the least of them.ome other collection, it's worth the price of admission for even the least of them.	2000-12-06

And worse yet, it would have been possible to use the elegant solution as a part of the deus ex machina, if he really HAD to have that tie-in, and it would have made perfect sense.<br />I can't explain here what that &quot;elegant solution&quot; is without giving away the book's ending, an unpardonable crime when reviewing a mystery, but if you're curious (and have read the book) feel free to e-mail me and I'll let you know what I think.	2000-11-30

There are two possibilities: either the author really sees what she claims to see, or she doesn't.<br />If she really sees what she sees, there are two possibilities: either it's really there, or she's delusional.<br />If she doesn't realy see what she claims to see, there are two possibilities: either she's a lying charlatan preying upon the gullibility of suckers to sell books and increase her personal sense of self-importance, or she feels that it is a good idea if more people are encouraged to believe in the pleasant fantasy of the fairies, and perhaps that more people will give consideration to the state of the environment if it is personalized, rather than being simply an abstract concept.<br />Which of these four possibilities is the true one? I can't say. I have never seen fairies, at least not since I was three years old (my memory does not go beyond that), nor do I know anyone who does. But that, of course, does not prove that they AREN'T there, any more than Ms. van Gelder claiming to see them proves that they ARE. And while she doesn't come across as a lying charlatan, that simply proves that if she IS one, she's a persuasive one.<br />I would LIKE to believe in fairies, and I'd like to believe that if they aren't really there, her motives for writing this book are concern for the environment, rather than for personal aggrandizement. But I simply have nothing to base an opinion upon; contrary to what other reviews of the book have said, there is nothing in the text to convince me one way or the other.<br />I will say, however, that I wouldn't recommend reading the foreward by Caitlin Matthews; it is much less readable than the book itself, and comes across as intolerably new-agey and soft headed. And if you already DO believe in fairies, this book should provide a wealth of information about them.	2000-11-27

It's a real shame that Vonda McIntyre's excellent writing had to be hamstrung by being forced into the general plot of the third Star Trek movie; the very concept behind this book -- bringing back the character of Spock after he'd quite efficiently and irrevocably been written out of the series in the previous movie -- was just plain stupid, and there was no possible way to do it well. Granted, writing him out in the first place was a mistake, but it was one that there was virtually no way to repair. Certainly, this was not the way.<br />Which, as I say, is a real shame; other than the fact that the basic concept is ridiculous and impossible, the book is excellent. (But aside from THAT, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?) The characters are well-handled, the rebellion of the Enterprise command crew and their theft of the Enterprise is delightfully done, the idea that they would all, without hesitation, scrap their careers for loyalty to a fallen comrade is commendable; everything about the book is wonderful...EXCEPT for the basic underlying concept.	2000-11-20

As near as I can tell, this is the first book in the Star Trek series to treat Klingons sympathetically. It is intereresting, and has a viable plot and worthwhile characters, and does something I've always thought more Star Trek books should do: focus on new characters, rather than the Enterprise crew (who make only cameo appearances in this book.)<br />So why is it only three stars? Well, its portrayal of Klingons and Klingon culture, while interesting, do not seem to fit particularly well with other depictions of Klingons as we've seen them, either as fearsome enemies (as in most of the original series) or as honorable warriors (as in much of Next Generation and later portrayals.) They almost seemed more Romulan than Klingon to me.<br />Further, I admit that I'm just enough of an original-series purist that I really don't care much to see Klingons as the good guys; my alien race of choice is Vulcans, and there's a limit to how much enthusiasm I can work up for Klingons. An emotional bias, I admit, but nonetheless a real one.<br />And, just for an added reason to lower the evaluation, we have once again the overused plot-device of the Starfleet Admiral gone rogue, attempting to create a war or at least undercut peace negotiations. What happens to Starfleet folks when they get a promotoion to Commodore or Admiral? Do they automatically get programmed to be nut-case war-hawks? Don't sane, stable captains ever get promoted to Admiral?<br />All in all, the book was good, and I admit I enjoyed reading it. But it's definitely not without major flaws in concept.	2000-10-25

I don't normally care all that much for coming-of-age stories, nor for overly realistic books set in the backwater south (ie, Faulkner, Steinbeck). But this is a very character-driven novel, and while there is only one interesting character in it (the heroine, Molly Bolt), she is more than interesting enough to grab and hold the imagination. Sort of a cross between Holden Caulfield and Randle Patrick McMurphy, only as a lesbian.<br />Yes, some of the scenes in the second half of the book, after she moves to New York City for college, are somewhat cartoonish and caricatured; still, it was impossible to give any book that gives us Molly Bolt less than five stars.

I am quite fond of Msrion Zimmer Bradley's world of Darkover, and have read almost all of the books set in it, even including the &quot;Friends of Darkover&quot; fan fiction anthologies edited by Ms. Bradley. It is, however, noticeable that the quality of the writing improved markedly as the series progressed (in real time; the stories were not written chronologically, so many of the earlier-written stories were set later in the history of Darkover). Ms. Bradley learned a great deal about the craft of writing as she matured, and as she wrote. This book is not one of her earliest books, but it isn't one of her latest, either, and so, not surprisingly, the quality of the writing is middling by her standards, which is fairly good by general standards.<br />One thing that bothered me about the story (which was, in general, a fairly gripping mystery story) was that the love interest, which was central to the plot, was a typical Harlequin-style love interest -- two people, who have absolutely NO reason for falling in love: nothing in common, have barely spoken a civil word to one another, and have very strong taboos AGAINST falling in love, suddenly fall madly in love. Why? Just because. After all, love is irrational, and needs no justification.<br />Frankly, that is hooey, no matter how popular the notion is, and I find it jarring when as intelligent a woman as Ms. Bradley was falls back on it. I'll chalk it up to immaturity; she generally treats the subject somewhat better in later books, although I have the definite impression that by the time she wrote this book, she OUGHT to have been old enough to know better.	2000-10-12

Bear does a reasonably good job of portraying the known characters, and develops a few new ones that are also interesting. His plot has some similarities to the episode &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;, and also some similarities to various books and episodes, notably &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, that involve the Enterprise saving the universe (or at least all life as we know it therein) from an almost-all-powerful energy creature. But for all of that, the plot is handled well enough that it was only occasionally noticable that the basic plot was somewhat hackneyed. Also, interestingly, it was not actually a member of the Enterprise crew who really saves the day.<br />This book does not, really, break any new ground, but the plot moves well and the writing is competent.	2000-10-06

For those who have been reading the &quot;Friends of Darkover&quot; collections of fan fiction that MZB has edited, most of these stories will be familiar; only a couple of them are new. These are the stories, written by MZB herself, that have appeared in the various collections, collected here in one place for those purists who refuse to read the Darkover fan fiction but want to read everything that herself has had to say. They include &quot;To Keep The Oath&quot;, the story of how Camilla came to be a renunciate; &quot;The Keeper's Price&quot;, written in collaboration with Lisa Waters about the failed keeper Hillary Castamir, &quot;Everything But Freedom&quot;, about the Lady Rohana, and several tales of Dyan Ardais.<br />The writing is excellent, as any regular reader of Marion Zimmer Bradley could have guessed, and the stories give us interesting glimpses into the interstices between the full-length Darkover novels.<br />If you've collected all of the Friends of Darkover Collections, you may not feel that it's worth the price of a whole book just for two new stories (although the new ones -- &quot;Hillary's Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Hillary's Wedding&quot; -- are both quite good) but if you have not been willing to buy collections of fan fiction for the one or two actual MZB stories per book, this is the book for you.	2000-09-20

A comprehensive bio, from birth to  death, I can't imagine how it could be improved, unless one were to change  the title. (I concede that TR was a romantic, and I concede that my  definition of &quot;romantic&quot; might be different from that of the  author, but I cannot concieve of a definition of &quot;romantic&quot; that  would allow Roosevelt to be declared &quot;the last&quot;.) But other than  that very minor quibble, I find nothing to object to; the story is told in  detail, the writing is very fluid and pleasurable to read, and the author,  while obviously very impressed by the subject of his book, nonetheless  remains fair: when Roosevelt is in the wrong, the author doesn't hesitate  to admit it, as when he (Roosevelt) frequently falls prey to his tendancy  to demonize his opposition at every turn, or when he berates an opponent  for cowardice for making a compromise that, had Roosevelt himself made it,  would have been defined (by Roosevelt) as  &quot;statesmanlike&quot;.<br />Defnitely the definitive biography of Teddy  Roosevelt.	2000-09-15

Diane Duane handles the characterizations of the known characters well, introduces interesting new characters that are intriguing, including throw-away references to minor random crewpeople that will probably never be referred to again simply for the sake of adding fullness to the background and aliens that are truly alien, not simply humans with makeup. The story captures the feel of the original series far better than most novels, and could easily be seen as a potential episode in the series.<br />On the negative side, I've always found stories that involve non-linear time and attempts to imply that cause needn't predate effect a little too \\"zen\\" for my taste. As, in fact, was most of the philosophy hinted at in this book.	2000-09-09

There are some excellent stories in this anthology, notably &quot;An  Object Lesson&quot; by Mercedes Lackey, in which she once again brings back  the character Tayksa the ex-assassin, a character she has written several  stories about in previous anthologies. (This was an excellent story, even  if it WAS merely a set-up for an abysmally clever pun.) But there were also  some stories that I didn't think much of, particularly &quot;The Gift From  Ardais&quot;, by Barbara Denz, which started out well, was well-written,  and ended in a needlessly depressing way, serving no point that I could  discern. Less bad, but still not much to my liking, was &quot;To Serve  Kihar&quot;, by Judith Sampson, which seemed to me to have an implausibly  upbeat ending, not justified by the story to that point. Now, I'd rather  see unjustified optimism than unjustified cynicism, but it still isn't  really a good story if I don't feel the ending is justified by the story  leading up to it.	2000-08-30

It was vaguely reminiscent  of the episode (the title of which escapes me) in which the Enterprise crew  are &quot;infected&quot; with spores that render them blissfully happy,  totally pacifistic, and utterly useless. The main difference is that in  this novel, the part of the spores is played by a sentient alien with a  hypnotically persuasive voice and marvellous diplomatic skills who they  rescue from a disabled ship.<br />A perfectly workmanlike, but unspectacular  story.	2000-08-30

But there is one of them that I must point out is decidedly NOT a  canonical Darkover story; Ms. Bradley has always said that she doesn't  necessarily consider stories in these anthologies to be canonical, but  &quot;Cradle of Lies&quot;, by Deborah Wheeler, is several orders of  magnitude less canonical than most; in it, Ashara Alton is the chosen  successor of Varzil the Good, and still a young and unproven keeper when he  dies. This is distinctly NOT what we saw in Bradley's own novel,  &quot;Shadow Matrix&quot;, and although the story was well-written and  interesting, I found the inconsistency distracting.<br />The rest of the  stories are all interesting, of varying quality, but ranging from so-so to  excellent; none of them were bad. Also, in her introduction to &quot;Poetic  License&quot; by Mercedes Lackey, Bradley indicates that Lackey is her  chosen heir to the Darkover series, a relevant and interesting fact now  that Bradley is dead. I wonder if this also applies to the &quot;Sword and  Sorceress&quot; series? I suppose we'll find out eventually.	2000-08-30

This story is fascinating, as are most of Bagley's books, and is told in a  somewhat more artistic style than most. The art is not simply gratuitous,  however; Bagley did not simply decide to try something new for no reason.  The story is actually two stories, one of the events leading up to an  avalanche (the &quot;Snow Tiger&quot; of the title) and the other of the  inquest that takes place afterward. It was necessary to tell the story of  the events leading up to the avalanche as flashbacks, otherwise the inquest  could not have been told in an interesting fashion. As always, Bagley's  characters live and breathe, each speaking with his own unique voice, and  his plot as always is never lacking for action. If you can find a copy of  this book, or almost any of Bagley's works, I highly recommend it/them.	2000-08-30

This book is definitely funny, if not as funny as &quot;Dave Barry Is Not Making This Up&quot;, &quot;Dave Barry Talks Back&quot;, or &quot;Dave  Barry's Only Travel Guide You'll Ever Need&quot;.<br />This book takes a  bizzarro look at American history. To quote Dave in the introduction,<br />  &quot;...(a) major part of the problem is the system used to teach  history in our schools, a system known technically, among professional  educators, as the Boring Method. You were probably taught via this method,  which features textbooks that drone on eternally as follows:<br />  EARLY EXPLORATIONS<br />The region was first explored by the Spanish  explorer Juan Ponce de Rigeur (1534-1579), who in 1541 was commissioned by  King Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; IV of England (1512-1583) under the terms of  the Treaty of Weems (1544) as authorized by Pope Bilious XIV (1511-1598) to  end the Nine Years, Three Months, and the Better Part of a Week War (May 4,  1534-August 8, 1543, at about 1:30 PM), under which France (1243-present)  would cede an area &quot;north of the 17th parallel, west of the 163rd  longitude, and convenient to shopping&quot; to England in exchange for  those lands originally conquered by Denmark during the Reign of Large  Unattractive Feathered Hats (1387-1396) and subsequently granted to Italy  under the Treaty of...<br />and so on.&quot;<br />You think THIS is funny?

This is an excellent, well-written story with good characterizations, both  in terms of creating new characters (notably Spock's son, the title  character) and in faithfully portraying the established characters and the  interrelations between them. I could easily envision this story as being  canonical, as being made into an episode of the original Star Trek series  if only it had been written fifteen years earlier.<br />In it, the author  begins in what may be the ideal way to begin a Star Trek novel: she starts  with an episode from the series, and builds a &quot;what if&quot; sequal to  it; in this case, she builds on the episode, &quot;All Our  Yesterdays&quot;, in which Spock and McCoy are trapped (temporarily) 5000  years in the past, during the ice age of a planet that is (in the present)  about to be destroyed when its sun novas. During that episode, Spock (for  reasons never adequately explained, but apparently having something to do  with the unplanned nature of their time-travel) reverts to the barbaric,  emotional, pre-logical state of Vulcans in that time period. (Why McCoy  didn't revert to the superstitious, unscientific state of humans at that  point in time is never explained, either.)<br />In any case, this book assumes  what is only hinted at in that episode: that Spock and the woman Zarabeth  who was (sort of) native to that time became lovers, physically as well as  emotionally, and that unknown to Spock, she was pregnant with his child  when he and McCoy returned to the present. When Spock learns of this  through archaeological evidence, he uses The Guardian of Forever (from the  episode &quot;City On The Edge Of Forever&quot;) to return to the past and  rescue the boy, and the rest of the story builds on that concept. The plot  is handled extremely well, although I did find the ending rather  unsatisfactory. (Though I must admit, it, too, would have fit very well  into an original series story; it seems to follow the series guideline,  &quot;Never make a change to the cast or status quo of the characters; any  change of that sort must be eliminated by the end of the story.&quot;)Never make a change to the cast or status quo of the characters; any  change of that sort must be eliminated by the end of the story.&quot;)	2000-08-14

Not, properly, a sequel to the first book, there is  no indication at any point in it that the Alice (clearly the same  individual, slightly older) from this book ever had the adventures in the  first one; there is no reference to her previous adventures, even when she  once again meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Obviously, the two books are  intended as parallel adventures, not subsequent ones.<br />The most memorable  bits from this book are doubtlessly the poem, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, as  well as chapter six, &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. But all of the book is  marvellous, and not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a magical romp  through silliness and playful use of the English language.<br />(This review  refers to the unabridged &quot;Dover Thrift Edition&quot;.)	2000-08-11

This book is a collection of stories written by &quot;The Friends of  Darkover&quot;, which is to say, mostly fans of Marion Zimmer Bradley's  Darkover series, set on the world of Darkover, and edited by Ms. Bradley  herself. It's one of several such collections, and like most of them, it's  hit-and-miss. Some of the stories weren't all that impressive; in fact, I  didn't care ofr any of the first three. But some of them were interesting,  if none of them actually come to mind as being memorable for positive  reasons.<br />There was one story written by Ms. Bradley herself, &quot;Man of  Impulse&quot;, which further developed a character mentioned elsewhere in  the canonical Darkover books, and apparently popular with readers: Dyan  Ardais. So if you are determined to read everything ever written by  Bradley, you need to read this story, even if you don't care for the fan  fiction.<br />And there was a story, quite a good story in fact, which Ms.  Bradley put in this book in spite of the fact that it was not written for  Darkover; it was intended for her &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; series,  but for reasons unclear to this reader, she felt it fit better here. The  story is &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot;, by Patricia B. Cirone, and it seemed  to me that it would have fit much better in its target anthology, rather  than this one. But it was a good story in any case, so I'm glad it was  published SOMEWHERE, regardless.	2000-08-10

The overall value of this book is much less than the sum of its  parts.<br />It is a frame story, in which we get a story told by Captains Kirk  and Sulu in the first person, at a tavern called &quot;The Captain's  Table&quot;.<br />The story/stories told by Kirk and Sulu is/are marvellous;  fast-paced, complex, with excellent characterizations and insightful looks  into all of our favorite original series characters. Those internal  stories, I would rate five stars without hesitation.<br />The concept of The  Captain's Table, a semi-mystical, alternate-dimensional tavern where all  captains of all races and times are welcome, and only captains are welcome,  and can enjoy the society of their peers without problems of communication  or enmity, is an interesting enough concept; &quot;Callahan's Crosstime  Saloon&quot; meets the galactic federation. If the idea were standing  alone, I would rate it four stars.<br />But the idea does not stand alone; it  chooses to be wedded to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, to make it more  marketable. And unfortunately, it simply doesn't work in the Star Trek  universe. As even my eight-year-old can see, when told about the idea, and  that captains from the long past sailing ship days are there along with  starship captains, &quot;Doesn't that violate the prime  directive?&quot;<br />I would love to see the &quot;Captain's Table&quot;  concept continued, but with NEW characters and a NEW background universe.  Leave Star Trek out of it; some concepts just don't mix.

When it's bad, it isn't awful, so on the whole, I suppose it isn't too bad. But it definitely has some weak  points.<br />The &quot;Star Trek Log...&quot; series is a series of  adaptations of the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. This is the last  of the series. The episode this book recounts is &quot;Slaver Weapon&quot;,  a story written by Larry Niven. One of the plus sides to this story is  that, being written by Niven, we get a kzinti crossover. It's interesting  to see the kzinti interact with the crew of the Enterprise. (For those not  in the know, the kzinti are an alien race from Niven's writing, who  resemble large bipedal cats and who are a warrior culture not unlike the  klingons; the only thing that has kept them from taking over the known  galaxy and enslaving humanity is that, being self-styled mighty warriors,  they ALWAYS attack before they're ready. Suitable caution would be cowardly  and dishonorable.)<br />Another interesting subplot in this book occurs when  Kirk, Spock, Sulu, and Uhura have their personalities switched due to a  transporter accident. Kirk finds himself in Sulu's body, Sulu in Spock's,  Spock in Uhura's, Uhura in Kirk's. This happens, of course, immediately  prior to a major diplomatic session, so the victims can't simply hide out  in their quarters until the problem is ironed out. This was a clever plot  complication, and it was handled well.<br />The bad news is, we have a  reappearance of Captain Kumara, the Klingon who, according to the episode  adapted in &quot;Log Seven&quot;, knew Kirk well from their days in a  failed &quot;Interspecies  Academy&quot;, an attempt at detente between the  Klingons and the Federation when the two captains were both younger, junior  officers. As I said in my review of &quot;Log Seven&quot;, this  &quot;Interspecies Academy&quot; never happened; something that major would  have HAD to have been mentioned in the original series episodes involving  Klingons, and it wasn't. Therefore, it is impossible, as is Kumara and his  almost-friendly rivalry with Kirk.<br />Not a bad book, certainly. It's  well-written, and handles the known characters well.

There is also a  certain similarity between its plot and that of &quot;Dr.  Strangelove&quot;, although this is not a comedy. This story is set in the  time immediately after the original series Star Trek episode,  &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;; the computer has not yet been  reprogrammed, and is still overly affectionate toward Kirk.<br />If you enjoy  Star Trek: the original series, you should definitely read this book; it is  one of the better books in the Star Trek series. Even if you aren't a big  fan, but are only lukewarm toward Star Trek, you should give this book a  try.	2000-07-28

This is the ninth of the &quot;Star Trek Log...&quot; series, a collection of adaptations of the animated Star Trek Series. The first six of the series were collections of three episodes to a book; the last three have  been one extended episode per book. This is perhaps the best episode so  far, &quot;BEM&quot;, an episode in which the enterprise crew deal with a  very alien intelligent life form, far more alien than special effects would  have allowed on the original series. The aliens are &quot;communal  beings&quot;, collections of life forms which join symbiotically to create  higher life forms, but which can still dissociate when neccessary into  their component parts, so that a head, a torso, and a trunk can each be  moving separately and performing separate functions. On the planet Pandro,  all higher life forms have this capability.<br />It was an interesting  concept, one that was handled well, and in general the story did a fine job  of maintaining established characters. Further, the primary representative  of the alien species is given a plausible, interesting personality, and the  plot flows well. There was an interesting (but implausible) sidebar in that  for a part of the story, Lt. Uhura is left in charge of the Enterprise;  this would have been a nice touch, except that Sulu was neither  incapacitated nor absent, and as ranking officer, should have taken the  Captain's chair before she did; still, it was nice to see her given a bit  more of an active role for a change.<br />All in all, a fine episode, even in  spite of the fact that the author (not Foster, presumably, but David  Gerrold, who wrote the script for the episode) couldn't resist the bad pun  of naming the main alien character Ari bn Bem; for those of you not in the  know, &quot;BEM&quot; is a term given to aliens in bad science fiction; it  stands for &quot;Bug Eyed Monster&quot;.	2000-07-25

This book gives a much more realistic, believable look into the<br />mindset of a pedophile than I expected it to; that's the good news,<br />along with the fact that its reputation for salaciousness is vastly<br />overrated. By modern standards, the descriptions of the sex act are<br />minimal and downright reserved.<br />HOWEVER, the writing style, so<br />lauded by so many reviewers, is not &quot;sensual&quot;,<br />&quot;gorgeous&quot;, and &quot;passionate&quot;.  It is simply<br />overdone. Have you ever heard of Edward George Bulwer-Lytton?  He is<br />the Victorian author whose novel began &quot;It was a dark and stormy<br />night...&quot;, a beginning that has become a byword for bad, overdone<br />writing, to the point that Scott Rice of San Jose State University<br />holds an annual contest to see who can intentionally write the most<br />Bulwer-Lyttonesque opening sentence, the opening to the worst of all<br />possible novels. Many of the passages in this book remind me of<br />entries in that contest; let's try a few examples at random:<br /> As she<br />strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the fender, her<br />young weight, her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom, shifted<br />in my tense, tortured, surreptitiously laboring lap; and all of a<br />sudden a mysterious change came over my senses.<br />Or how about:<br /> The<br />child therapist in me (a fake, as most of them are -- but no matter)<br />regurgitated neo-Freudian hash and conjured up a dreaming and<br />exaggerating Dolly in the &quot;latency&quot; period of<br />girlhood. Finally, the sensualist in me (a great and insane monster)<br />had no objection to some depravity in his prey.  But somewhere behind<br />the raging bliss, bewildered shadows conferred -- and not to have<br />heeded them, this is what I regret! Human beings, attend! I should<br />have understood that Lolita had ALREADY proved to be something quite<br />different from innocent Annabel, and that the nymphean evil breathing<br />through every pore of the fey child that I had prepared for my secret<br />delectation, would make the secrecy impossible, and the delectation<br />lethal.<br />As I say, these are simply passages taken almost at random:<br />open to a random page, and look for a suitably overblown descripion<br />nestled in a suitably complex sentence.

This book was a pleasant surprise; the concept sounded forced, and not really all that funny, so it was not at the top of my priorities list of Dave Barry books to read. But it is truly one of his best, up there with  \\"Dave Barry Talks Back\\", \\"Dave Barry's Only Travel Guide  You'll Ever Need\\", and \\"Dave Barry Is Not Making This Up\\".  Much of it is screamingly funny, although he actually does have a  semi-serious chapter/column on visiting Hiroshima (how much can even Dave  Barry find to laugh about at Hiroshima? Not much, and surprisingly, he  doesn't try) but the interesting thing, for all that he would deny any  intention of being serious, is that there are serious insights to be found  in this book on the differences between America and Japan if one looks past  the chuckles.<br /><br />This book is a must for any Dave Barry fan, and is highly  recommended if you AREN'T already familiar with his other work. Of course,  if you ARE familiar with his work, and didn't care for it, his style of  humor hasn't changed any.	2000-07-22

The &quot;Sword And Sorceress&quot; series is a series of collections of short stories set in the &quot;Sword And Sorcery&quot; genre, except that in this series, all the protagonists are female. The is because, as Marion  Zimmer Bradley has always explained in her introductions, historically in  the &quot;Sword And Sorcery&quot; genre, the only female characters were  &quot;Bad conduct prizes&quot; for the heros.<br />The series as a whole is  very good, although some volumes were stronger than others. I would rate  this one as the best of the series, and with MZB's death, it may be the  last. Not a certainty; it is possible, I suppose, that the publishers may  choose to continue the series with a new editor, possibly MZB's assistant  of the last few years. But I suppose we'll just have to wait and  see.<br />There are only three stories in this collection that are  continuations of the adventures of characters met in previous anthologies:  &quot;An Exchange Of Favors&quot;, by Dorothy Heydt (the adventures of  Cynthia, The Witch of Syracuse); &quot;Shadow Soul&quot;, by Laura J.  Underwood (Ginny, celtic wisewoman); and &quot;Lady Of Flame&quot;, by  Diana Paxson (Bera, Norse Voelva). But there are many fine one-shot stories  here, and no bad ones. If this is the end of the line for the series, it is  going out in fine style. Hopefully, there will be more to come.	2000-07-03

This novel had a hint of an interesting idea behind it; unfortunately it handled that idea so badly that it almost overshadowed how badly the characterizations of Kirk and Spock were handled.<br />To give just a hint of  what I'm referring to, the &quot;Triangle&quot; referred to in the title  refers to two things; one of them is a plot point in which two competing  &quot;totalities&quot; (i.e. telepathic multiperson unities) are competing  against each other, as well as against the &quot;individualists&quot; like  Kirk and the rest of the members of Starfleet. I could have tolerated this  plot point if it had been handled better, although I must say that I find  the whole &quot;oneness-totality&quot; concept rather new-agey. But the  other referent to the title is the romantic triangle in which Kirk and  Spock fall in love with the same woman. (Yes, Spock falls in love.) This  should give some idea of just how badly the established characterizations  were abused in this book. Further, not only do the authors show a distinct  lack of understanding of the characters they are writing about, they also  show a distinct lack of understanding about the subject that they are  writing about: love. For both Kirk and Spock, and for the woman at the  center of the triangle, it is love at first sight. They meet, speak a few  words together, and immediately fall in love. As anyone over the age of 15  knows (or ought to), love just doesn't work that way. Kirk might  temporarily delude himself into believing that such a thing was love and  not lust; Spock certainly wouldn't. In any case, neither would have a true  emotional tie with the woman at that point.<br />The whole thing has the feel  of a Junior High School Creative Writing class project; young female Trek  fans create an extremely talented and dynamic alter-ego in their story, and  both Kirk and Spock fall madly in love with her at first sight. And  frankly, the writing style itself is only slightly better than that. As a  Junior High School project, I'd give it a B+; as a professionally published  novel, it is the next thing to utterly worthless.Junior High School project, I'd give it a B+; as a professionally published  novel, it is the next thing to utterly worthless.	2000-06-29

The first book of the trilogy of which this book is the second, &quot;The Toybox&quot;, did a very good job of being a self-contained story, rather than obviously the first third of a trilogy. So I had hopes that this book  would not suffer from &quot;middle-book-itis&quot;, as so many second books  (or movies) do. Even Tolkein failed in this regard; none of the books of  his trilogy can stand alone. In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie trilogy  (not counting the most recent prequel) the second movie, &quot;The Empire  Strikes Back&quot; suffers from this fault. And this book, too, cannot  stand on its own.<br />Still, while it refers back to the events of the first  book quite a bit, and doesn't really have a satisfying ending of its own,  it does do a better job of at least ending at a reasonably plausible  break-point than many middle books of trilogies do, and the writing is  still enjoyable (if not quite as much so as in the first book) and the  characters are as compelling as ever. Obviously, if you've read the first  book and enjoyed it, you should continue with this one. But be forewarned;  you won't find an ending here; one could plausibly have read just the first  book, stopped there, and not felt cheated. One cannot do that with this  book; it will be necessary to continue to the third book of the series.	2000-06-23

How do you rate a book that is a classic, and understandably so, but which for a modern reader is not necessarily an easy or even an enjoyable read?<br />The plot is interesting enough, and well done from a technical  standpoint. But the setting doesn't resonate with the modern reader, and to  a lesser extent, neither do the characters. Of course, some of this is not  merely anachronisms; you can find similar hopeless-love-triangle plots in  almost any modern romance. This is a &quot;classic&quot; in that it was one  of the first of the genre. Still, the concept of a villain who is redeemed  by the love of a good woman is a dubious concept at best. Too many people  have internalized this concept as real, and (if female) keep expecting  their love to redeem the badly-behaved male in their lives, and (if male)  use it to blame their own bad behavior on the woman in their lives who just  isn't doing a good enough job of loving them to &quot;redeem&quot;  them.<br />Interesting, but only recommended for those familar (and  comfortable) with 19th-century literary styles, or those inclined to become  so. Most modern readers would find the style of this book tedious.	2000-06-23

The James Blish \\"Star Trek\\" series is a twelve book series of adaptations of the stories from the original \\"Star Trek\\" television series. Frankly, Blish didn't do a very good job of it, and most  of the series is pretty weak, even for a longtime fan of the series. But  this volume is better than most; it has some of the better episodes, and  also the writing itself seems a bit better; perhaps by this volume, Blish  was finally getting a handle on the characters.<br /><br />The first of six episodes  adapted in this book is \\"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\\", which  is far and away the weakest story of the lot (Kirk and Nurse Chapel beam  down to a planet to meet her fiance, previously missing for five years and  presumed dead, to find that his memories live on in an android which only  THINKS it has emotions).<br /><br />Next is \\"The Squire Of Gothos\\", one of  the all-time classic stories from the series, in which the Enterprise crew  encounter Squire Trelane, the prototype for the character \\"Q\\"  from the \\"Next Generation\\" series.<br /><br />Then comes \\"Wink Of An  Eye\\", a story which requires more than the usual amount of suspension  of disbelief, in that the crew is threatened by a race which moves at many  times the human rate, so fast that they cannot even be seen by the naked  eye, and sound like the buzzing of insects. If you can swallow enough  disbelief to accept the basic premise, and the inconsistencies and  illogicalities required to make that basic plot point work, it's actually a  pretty good story. But I've never been able to manage that trick. I mean,  the opposition moves so quickly they can't be seen, but yet the Enterprise  people accomplish a great deal before they've finished what they're doing;  it's almost as if they only move at that speed when somebody's looking, and  only at normal speed otherwise. Further, they beamed aboard by  \\"piggybacking\\" when the landing party returned to the ship,  invisibly joining in the beamup. Yet, for one thing, Scotty (or whoever was  at the controls) should by rights have noticed that there was more mass  being beamed aboard than expected, for another, no matter how fast they  were CAPABLE of moving, they would have needed to stand still for the  duration of the beamup process, which would have left them visible, and  they would have needed to be standing so close to the crew they were  beaming up with that they should have been felt, even if they couldn't be  seen.<br /><br />Fourth is \\"Bread And Circuses\\", in which the Enterprise  encounters a parallel earth, in which Rome never fell, and so the planet  has developed to the point equivalent in technology to that of the mid  twentieth century on Earth, but with a culture and political situation of  what Rome would have become.<br /><br />Fifth is \\"Day Of The Dove\\", in  which the Enterprise crew and the survivors of a Klingon ship must resist  their natural antipathy for one another, in spite of the prodding of an  energy being who feeds on the violent emotions.<br /><br />And last is \\"Plato's  Stepchildren\\", in which they encounter a planet inhabited by three  dozen highly powerful telepathic telekinetics, all with as much concern for  the feelings of \\"lesser mortals\\" as one might expect.<br /><br />If you  enjoy \\"Star Trek\\", even if you aren't a serious collector of  \\"Star Trek\\" books, this one is worth reading.

This is the third book of a trilogy; the first two, &quot;Blood War&quot; and &quot;Unholy Allies&quot;, are interesting stories (or, more accurately, story fragments) with good, fast-moving action plots and  compelling characters. Unfortunately, they both suffered from a lack of an  ending, or even a reasonable stop at a plausible break-point. Call me  old-fashioned, but I believe that a book, even if it is part of a series,  should have a beginning and an end. This series really should have been  written as one very large book. As it is, I will give the series as a whole  four stars, but no individual book in the series can be rated higher than  three stars; how can a book be rated higher than that, when it isn't a full  story in its own right? This one at least has an ending, but it has no  proper beginning; I suspect that someone reading it without reading the  previous books would be quite lost.<br />Further, I felt that the  finally-revealed secret of Dire McCann's relationship to Lameth was  unsatisfying, and that the characters were more than a trifle overpowered.  Nonetheless, I do recommend the series, but only as a whole. If you aren't  willing to read all three books, don't bother with any of them. None of  them stand on their own.	2000-06-15

This novel is the first in a growing and very successful series about the vampire le Comte de St. Germain, known also as Prinz Ragoczy of Transylvania, among other lesser aliases. So if you've encountered any of the other books in the series, you doubtless know yourself whether you want to read this one or not: if you've enjoyed the others, you no doubt want to read the original; if you haven't, you probably don't.<br />But for those of you who are not familiar with the series, I can honestly say that I highly recommend this book, it may not seem it, based on the three star rating I've given it, but I truly do enjoy it. It is well-written, well-researched, (it's set in mid-18th century France) has a compelling plot and exquisite characters.<br />So why do I only rate it three stars?  Three reasons, really; one is that in spite of my visceral liking for the book, my head insists on pointing out that the style is rather too close to a Gothic romance for my taste (if you enjoy both Gothic romance and horror, ignore this quibble; you'll definitely like this book) the second is that I find a stylistic affectation of the author's annoying: every &quot;section&quot; of the book begins with an excerpt from some sort of correspondence between the characters, and every chapter ends the same way.  Now, I have nothing against using correspondence between characters as needed to further the plot, but to do it so formulaically seems to me, as I say, an affectation. It seems forced. The third reason is that I find the ending, if not unsatisfying, a bit baffling. I can't say more without revealing more of the plot than would be fair, but suffice it to say that I felt that a very major point in the &quot;Epilogue&quot; went unexplained and unjustified.<br />Other than that, however, I find little to object to. This is for the most part a very well-written book, and certainly an enjoyable one.	2000-06-14

The first book of the &quot;Masquerade of the Red Death&quot; trilogy, &quot;Blood War&quot;, was a well-written, fast paced, interesting novel with one flaw: It had no ending. This is a common flaw in trilogies or  multi-book series; even if the main plot will carry from one book to the  next, ideally, some major subplot should be begun and ended in each book,  or at the very least there should be an ending of each individual book at a  reasonable &quot;break point.&quot;<br />This book did not suffer from this as  badly as I expected it to; it did not feel like it had no beginning, in  spite of the fact that it was a continuation of &quot;Blood War&quot;. And  while it had no true ending, the cutoff point was more reasonable than that  in the first book.<br />Still, I cannot rate this book, on its own, higher  than a three, because it is not a complete story on its own. The series as  a whole may wind up with a higher rating than that, but as an individual  book, this is simply a story fragment.<br />It's a well-written and  interesting story fragment, but a story fragment nonetheless.	2000-06-12

The &quot;Star Trek Log...&quot; series is a series of adaptations of episodes from the animated Star Trek series; through volume six, each book had contained three separate, if related, episodes, each with its own title  and occupying roughly a third of the book. In volume seven, this pattern  changed slightly; it was possible to see three distinct sections to the  story, but only one episode title was given, and it was treated as one  continuous story. That pattern was continued in volume eight, but the story  was good enough that I find I don't object as strenuously. For what it's  worth, the episode title given is &quot;The Eye Of The Beholder&quot;, and  the book is unquestionably the best of the series so far. I have only one  quibble with it, which is that in the second third of the book, the  Enterprise crew meet a race of beings whose biology is based on silicon,  rather than carbon, and are shocked that such a thing is possible. As any  connoisseur of the original Star Trek television show can tell you, they  met such a creature in the episode &quot;Devil In The Dark&quot;, and were  surprised to find such a creature possible. If that episode predated the  events in this story, they should not have been so surprised at the concept  here; conversely, if the events here supposedly predate those in that  episode, they should have been less surprised then. In either case, we have  a case of a failure of internal consistency.<br />This is a small quibble,  however, as is the fact that in the original series, whenever they  attempted to leave the confines of our galaxy, they met with a powerful  forcefield (&quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, &quot;Is There In  Truth No Beauty&quot;), yet in this story, they are able to do so easily,  without incident. Perhaps the forcefield does not extend all the way around  the galaxy, but is a comparatively &quot;local&quot; phenomenon. In any  case, the existence of such a field is implausible enough that I'm more  inclined to pick nits with the original series stories than I am with the  story in this book.<br />In the first part of this story, Kirk, Spock, and  McCoy are captured by aliens with the appearance of elephant-sized slugs  (more or less) who are sufficiently more intelligent than humans that it  takes a good bit of persuasion to convince them that humans (or even  vulcans) are sentient enough not to be kept as zoo specimens. Later, the  aforementioned silicon-based life forms are encountered, followed by a life  form ranging upward from continent-sized that roams the wilds of the space  between galaxies.<br />The story is fast-moving, well thought out (unlike many  of the stories in this series) and maintains the characterizations of the  known characters well. It is interesting and spurs some worthwhile  philosophical thoughts (the concept of Kirk &amp; co being seen as merely  interesting zoo specimens, for instance) and is generally well worth  reading.clined to pick nits with the original series stories than I am with the  story in this book.<br />In the first part of this story, Kirk, Spock, and  McCoy are captured by aliens with the appearance of elephant-sized slugs  (more or less) who are sufficiently more intelligent than humans that it  takes a good bit of persuasion to convince them that humans (or even  vulcans) are sentient enough not to be kept as zoo specimens.

Admittedly, the  traits in question are never negative ones; still, any suggestion that  there are personality traits inborn and shared by an entire race ought to  be an idea of the past, even if it isn't.<br />In spite of all that, this is a  very impressive work on many levels: purely as a story, it is a fine,  compelling story peopled with many compelling characters, and if some of  those characters are too one-dimensional to be true, either purely good or  purely evil, that is understandable in a novel that intends to be a tale of  good and evil, and at any rate, not all or even most of the characters can  be said to be so. Most are surprisingly well-balanced for a novel of that  time period, particularly one with the sole purpose of teaching a moral  lesson.<br />Further, the novel is important as a historical piece; it is  extremely worthwhile for everyone who is in any way affected by the  &quot;race issue&quot; (which is to say, just about everyone) to be  reminded of just WHY we still have a race issue in this country, 150 years  later. Granted, no white person alive today has ever owned a slave (as a  friend of mine comments, &quot;You've obviously mistaken me for someone  much older&quot;,) but it is useful to be reminded of just how much hatred  was sown for white, mainstream society by the institution of slavery, and  just how understandable it is that those who are still, generations later,  at a disadvantage from the criminal treatment of their ancestors would be  resentful and bitter. At the same time, while it would do little to lessen  that bitterness for blacks to read this book and be reminded of just how  brutal that institution was, it might be a worthwhile reminder for those  who exaggerate the current level of racism as to just how much HAS changed  in those 150 years. Society may be far from just, but it would be a mistake  and an insult to those who suffered slavery to suggest that &quot;nothing  has really changed&quot;, an idea which the more vehement occasionally  suggest.<br />All in all, this is a very important historical novel of a time  that we as a country should never be allowed to forget, and the fact that  it manages to do so while still being a remarkably readable book is merely  icing on the cake.older&quot;,) but it is useful to be reminded of just how much hatred  was sown for white, mainstream society by the institution of slavery, and  just how understandable it is that those who are still, generations later,  at a disadvantage from the criminal treatment of their ancestors would be  resentful and bitter.

First there was &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, our introduction to Slippery Jim diGriz, aka the Stainless Steel Rat, the galaxy's greatest thief and con man, in which our hero, after a long and successful career is  apprehended by the galactic special corps and &quot;persuaded&quot; to join  them, on the theory that it takes a thief to catch a thief. Then there  followed four sequels; in order, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat's  Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves The World&quot;,  &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You!&quot;, and &quot;The Stainless  Steel Rat For President&quot;. Then, apparently growing bored with the  direction that his series was taking, Harrison wrote the prequel, &quot;A  Stainless Steel Rat Is Born&quot;, followed by a sequal to the prequel,  &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Gets Drafted&quot;, and a sequel to that,  &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Sings The Blues&quot;. This book is a return  to the original sequence, following &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat For  President&quot;.<br />All of these books are fun reads, light and  action-filled, without overmuch concern for plot plausibility or  consistency. This one is no exception. Still, it did seem to me that the  writing style had matured a bit; this is one of the better books in the  series from that standpoint. Still, the plot itself seemed rather weak, and  the ending rather unsatisfying. All in all, it isn't bad, but don't expect  too much. Read it for entertainment, not when you want a book that makes  much sense.	2000-06-07

If you like detective fiction, spy fiction, or simply action thrillers, Desmond Bagley is an author you should definitely discover. His plots are as plausible as that in &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;, but he  manages to keep them moving at a much brisker pace, with a great deal more  action. His characters are very believable, and although he doesn't go out  of his way to write obvious dialect, one can still hear the subtle  differences in language between an American, a British man, a white South  African, a Sikh, and an educated black Kenyan. A South African himself,  Bagley seems very knowledgable of Africa, but he also seems comfortable  when his plots take the action to Britain, or even to the United States. He  is the author of about a dozen books; all are at least good, and this is  one of his better efforts.	2000-06-02

In &quot;Rescuing the Bible From Fundamentalism&quot;, John Shelby Spong, biblical scholar and Episcopal bishop of Newark explains that the texts of the bible are filled with truth, but a deeper, symbolic truth rather than a  surface literalism. In &quot;Born Of A Woman&quot;, he reinforces this by  saying, in essence, &quot;Yes, this applies even to the stories of  Christmas and the virgin birth.&quot; In this book, he parallels that one  by saying, &quot;Yes, this applies even to the Easter story and the  resurrection, the cornerstone and linchpin of Christianity.&quot;<br />As in  those other books, it is refreshing to hear a practicing, active Christian  admit what has been obvious to me for all of my adult life, namely that no  thinking adult could easily wrap his/her head around the concept of  biblical literalism. But for some reason, something seemed to be missing in  this book; in &quot;Rescuing the Bible..&quot; and &quot;Born of a  Woman&quot;, I didn't feel like I was reading biblical scholarship; that's  meant as a compliment. The style was almost conversational, and it was easy  to read Spong's explanations. This book seems to me a great deal more dry  and scholarly than either of those. It still presents interesting ideas,  but it was more of an effort to focus on the writing. I frequently found my  mind wandering, which didn't happen in either of the aforementioned  books.<br />Worth reading, but somewhat slow going.	2000-05-30

If you had told me that I would give four stars to a novel about Spock battling the effects of pon farr, I would not have believed you. I would have said, &quot;I've seen that plot done dozens of times, and they've all  been badly done wish-fulfillment by female Trek fans.&quot; But this story  actually works; it manages to retain the essence of the character even  while showing him struggling with emotions of unaccustomed strength.  Further, it does a fine job of tying in to the Next Generation episode  &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot;, showing the battle of the Enterprise C  against the Romulan attackers of the Klingon civilian outpost Narendra III.<br />All in all, the plot is tight and plausible, the characterizations  consistent both internally and with what we've seen in other Star Trek  venues, both page and screen, and the story is one well worth telling. The  writing is competent, although it would help if the publisher did a bit  better job of proofreading/copyediting. Well worth reading for anyone  familiar with the series; I can't speak for those who aren't.	2000-05-24

The &quot;Star Trek Log...&quot; series is a series of adaptations of the animated Star Trek TV series; this one doesn't come close to living up to the majority of the first six volumes. For one thing, there seems to be  only one story, whereas the previous six volumes each contained three  stories; perhaps this was a multi-episode story originally; there are more  or less three parts to it, but no clear break between them, and only one  title listed (&quot;The Counter-Clock Incident&quot;).  But the story is  not particularly good; an alternate-universe story even more implausible  than most is the first part of it, followed by a running conflict with a  Klingon ship captained by someone Kirk allegedly knew well because as  cadets they'd been involved in a cultural exchange program (which just  never happened, or we'd have heard about it the first time Kirk ran afoul  of Klingons in the series), followed by an encounter with a world just as  implausible as the alternate universe, all tied together with the deus ex  machina of a race of super-powered, Q-style beings who were responsible for  both the implausible alternate-universe and the impossible planet, neither  of which really existed.<br />What may be worse, in several places Foster  seems to lose track of who is speaking when writing Spock's dialogue.  &quot;Anyhow&quot; is a word that should never cross Spock's lips; neither  should the phrase &quot;the transporter went crazy&quot;. (The transporter,  being an inanimate object with no sentience, can malfunction, but cannot  &quot;go crazy&quot;, and it would be highly illogical to refer to a  malfunction as doing so...)<br />All in all, unless you're absolutely  determined to read all the Star Trek adaptations, I wouldn't recommend this  one. It has some minor amusement value, but there are certainly better Star  Trek books available.	2000-05-17

This book is at least as good as P.J.'s previous best, &quot;Parliament of Whores&quot;, a book that I didn't think could be topped. It is spectacularly funny, cogent and persuasive, and actually more than a little  informative. It may be that you couldn't actually teach an economics course  from it, but there are doubtless worse books to use that are being used for  just that purpose; if you used this book to teach a beginning survey course  in econ, you'd at least keep more of your students awake and paying  attention than you would with most economics texts, and they'd certainly  learn some basic principals from it.<br />But of course, that isn't its  purpose; its purpose is a) to make P.J. a bunch of money, (at which it's no  doubt succeeding admirably), b) to be screamingly funny (at which it also  succeeds), and c) to argue for the benefits of a free-market economy,  (which it does very persuasively.)<br />A must-read.	2000-05-17

This is a collection of science fiction shorts from Harry Harrison, the creator of The Stainless Steel Rat and Bill The Galactic Hero; 13 of what he considers to be his best. (The rear cover blurb claims 14, but either  they can't count, or I can't.)<br />These are the kind of science fiction  short stories that got me interested in the genre, over twenty years ago  when I was a kid. Some of them have aged better than others; I find myself  shaking my head at some of the stock plots and characters. And some of the  ideas that are addressed seem a bit dated, 25 years later. But all of them  DO address ideas, ideas that were fascinating to a 14 year old 25 years  ago, and would probably be fascinating to one today. Some of them, of  course, are fascinating to a 41 year old today.<br />If you're a fan of  old-fashioned science fiction, you'll love this book. If you're not, but  are curious about what kind of stories cause those who are to be so, this  book is for you. And if you're an inquisitive youngster who HASN'T read a  lot of science fiction, this book is perfect for you. But if you've read a  lot of classic science fiction, and have gotten a bit jaded, you may find  this book a bit too reminiscent of an old copy of Analog magazine.	2000-05-08

But, of course, being a dramatization, it was not bound by little things like facts; it took the basic story, and made it as interesting and  dramatic as possible.<br />This caused me to develop an interest in the  subject, and a curiosity as to what the actual truth of the story was, and  this book served admirably to answer that question.<br />If you're interested  in an entertaining story that has drama, characterization, and closure, see  the movie.

There are really two stories here, artfully interwoven: the story of young Pok's coming of age, an interesting look into Klingon culture, as told by Gowron while he is taking part in Klingon-Federation negotiations on Deep Space Nine, and the story of those negotiations themselves, and the  attempts to sabotage them and assassinate Gowron.<br />The stories are  interesting, the characters artfully handled, and the writing good (with  the exception of a couple of what I'm willing to assume, given the quality  of the rest of the writing, to be typographical and copy-editing errors  rather than flaws on the part of the writing itself).<br />This book is not  identified on its cover with a specific generation of Star Trek; this  usually indicates that it is set in the original series. Don't be fooled;  it is something of a hybrid between Next Generation and DS9, which is why  it is not identified as either. There is nothing of the original series in  it.	2000-05-03

First there was &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, our introduction to Slippery Jim DiGriz, aka the Stainless Steel Rat, a high-tech, futuristic conman and thief, who is caught after a long and successful career by the  galactic special corps, and recruited to join them because it takes a thief  to catch a thief. Then followed four more books in chronological order,  &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Steel  Rat Saves The World&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You&quot;,  and &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat For President&quot;. Then, apparently  growing bored with the direction his stories were taking, Harrison  retreated to the beginning and wrote the prequel, &quot;A Stainless Steel  Rat Is Born&quot;. This book is the sequel to that one, and is in turn  followed by &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Sings The Blues&quot;.<br />There  are dangers to writing prequels that were unplanned at the time the  original story was written; this book mostly avoids them. It is necessary  to make it plausible that the character/s have had these experiences prior  to the later stories, and that their characters have developed from these  experiences into the character/s they are at the beginning of the original.  It is easy to see how the Jim DiGriz from this book became the Jim DiGriz  at the beginning of the original. It is also necessary, and much more  difficult, to make a story that is interesting, but yet have it remain  plausible that the events in it are not referred back to in the  chronologically later, but earlier written, stories. Surprisingly, that too  is managed well in this book.<br />What that leaves us with is a book which  succeeds well at what it sets out to do: to be a fun romp, action-packed,  plot-driven, not to be taken any more seriously than it takes itself, which  is not very, but enjoyable brain-candy. The dialogue is a bit stilted, the  characters are somewhat two-dimensional, the &quot;philosophy&quot;  propounded by the members of the alien culture is downright silly, and  Harrison never lets a little thing like consistent characterization get in  the way of keeping the plot lively; DiGriz is supposed to be brilliant, but  he makes enough stupid mistakes to keep himself in one exciting crisis  after another.  This isn't anything like great art, but it IS fun, and  sometimes that's all you want. For those times, this is a perfectly  enjoyable light read.ed by the members of the alien culture is downright silly, and  Harrison never lets a little thing like consistent characterization get in  the way of keeping the plot lively; DiGriz is supposed to be brilliant, but  he makes enough stupid mistakes to keep himself in one exciting crisis  after another.

There is a great deal positive to be said about this book; unfortunately, there is also a great deal to be said that is negative, as well.<br />Shatner is a fine writer, technically, and his plot moves well, has plenty of  action and drama, switches scenes well and keeps multiple plotlines in  balance. Of course, he has a fine grasp of the characters (is this a  shock?) particularly the original series characters, and he does a fine job  of portraying those characters. And the scope of his plot is certainly  impressive enough.<br />But as to the negative: I realize that this is  intended as one book of a continuing series, that the plotline continues  from one book to the next. But I object to buying a book that has no  ending, to getting merely one installment of &quot;The Perils Of  Kirk&quot;, which ends at a cliffhanger with &quot;continued next  book&quot; implied, if not actually printed, at the end. I thought this  book's predecessor, &quot;Spectre&quot;, was bad in that regard, but this  book's ending is even less satisfying than &quot;Spectre&quot;'s was. At  least &quot;Spectre&quot; ended on a cliffhanger, which while I disapprove,  is at least a traditional &quot;ending&quot; for a continued action story.  This book didn't even have that; it felt as though somebody just took a  knife and chopped off an ending about three chapters early. When writing a  series, it really is preferable that each book has a main plot of its own  that is resolved at the end, even if the major plot-arc of the series  continues. The end of this book resolved nothing.<br />Further, I have a major  problem with the entire concept of the major sub-plot to this book. In the  original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode that this series works off  of, the Enterprise crew accidentally cross over to a &quot;mirror&quot;  universe which is eerily similar to their own, except that each individual  there, as well as the equivalent of Star Fleet itself, is nasty, vicious,  and brutal. One of the key themes to that episode, stated at the end by Mr.  Spock, when explaining why it was not difficult for him, in command in  Kirk's absence, to recognise the mirror Kirk, Scotty, McCoy, and Uhura as  duplicates when the party from our side of the mirror had been able to  &quot;pass&quot; on the other side, was that &quot;it was far easier for  you, as civilized people, to act like barbarians, than it was for them, as  barbarians, to act like civilized people.&quot; Or words to that  effect.<br />Yet in this series, duplicates from the mirror universe have been  successfully infiltrating Starfleet; not only are these people raised as  barbarians, but people raised as a subjugated race, slaves who are elevated  to a position of minor power if it is seen that they have a  &quot;useful&quot; duplicate in our universe, who are bullied and bribed  into working for their oppressors by passing in this universe, and  (presumably) given training in how to behave like their duplicates. But  does anybody really believe that not just one or two, but MANY people in  that situation, would have the acting ability to successfully pull off that  switch? AND not immediately turn double-agent the moment they had a chance  over here? And that anybody with the acting ability to pull off the switch  wouldn't be clever enough to MAKE that chance at some point? The whole  concept is preposterous. People who've had such radically different life  experiences, no matter HOW similar their DNA, can NOT simply step into each  other's lives, and have nobody notice.<br />All in all, a fun read, but  seriously flawed.ne of the key themes to that episode, stated at the end by Mr.  Spock, when explaining why it was not difficult for him, in command in  Kirk's absence, to recognise the mirror Kirk, Scotty, McCoy, and Uhura as  duplicates when the party from our side of the mirror had been able to  &quot;pass&quot; on the other side, was that &quot;it was far easier for  you, as civilized people, to act like barbarians, than it was for them, as  barbarians, to act like civilized people.&quot; Or words to that  effect.<br />Yet in this series, duplicates from the mirror universe have been  successfully infiltrating Starfleet; not only are these people raised as  barbarians, but people raised as a subjugated race, slaves who are elevated  to a position of minor power if it is seen that they have a  &quot;useful&quot; duplicate in our universe, who are bullied and bribed  into working for their oppressors by passing in this universe, and  (presumably) given training in how to behave like their duplicates.

This is not P.J.'s best work, but it's far from his worst.

So  if you're politically to the left of Spiro Agnew, and easily offended, this  book is not for you.

Then he followed that with &quot;A Stainless Steel Rat  Gets Drafted&quot;, a story following immediately on the heels of the  prequel. This story follows that one chronologically.<br />There are dangers  to writing prequels, and this book fails to avoid them entirely. In a  prequel, it is necessary to make it plausible that a character's  experiences could lead to him being the person he is at the beginning of  the book the prequel precedes; this is reasonably well accomplished in this  book, if not perfectly well. But it is also necessary, in a prequel, that  the story be interesting without having anything happen so major and  potentially relevent to events in later stories that it seems impossible  that the character never referred back to those experiences in  chronologically later, but previously written, stories. Here, this book  fails miserably; given that DiGriz has experiences in chronologically later  books with both time travel and visitors from his time's far future, both  of which also come into play in this book, it seems incredible that we've  never &quot;heard&quot; him mention the experiences in this book  before.<br />But perhaps this is all too stringent a set of complaints to make  about a book that, like the rest of the series, is never intended to be  taken seriously; like a James Bond story, or an action movie, the  &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; stories are all meant as merely fun romps,  plot-driven and action-intensive, without worrying about whether those  plots will stand close scrutiny for internal consistency.<br />So let's review  it on its own terms: yes, it's a fun romp, with plenty of action. As usual  in these books, the dialogue is rather stilted and artificial, the  characters are two-dimensional, and if it enhances the potential for action  and drama in the plot, Harrison doesn't let a little thing like consistency  of character stand in his way. (DiGriz is supposed to be brilliant, but  makes enough stupid mistakes to keep himself in constant danger, so that  the pace of the action can stay high.)<br />This book, like the rest of the  books in the series, is fun brain candy, but don't expect careful plotting  or a serious story, and don't examine things too carefully for plausibility  or internal consistency; it won't stand up to even passing examination.ike the rest of the series, is never intended to be  taken seriously; like a James Bond story, or an action movie, the  &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; stories are all meant as merely fun romps,  plot-driven and action-intensive, without worrying about whether those  plots will stand close scrutiny for internal consistency.<br />So let's review  it on its own terms: yes, it's a fun romp, with plenty of action.

The world is ostensibly a world colonized by humans 14000 years prior to the setting of the story, a world immense by earth standards but metal-poor enough that the gravity and atmosphere are basically earth-normal. (A concept which I find dubious at best.)<br />Still, if I don't care for the world on which he sets his story, the characters are interesting and vibrant, and Silverberg even manages to discuss a worthwhile philosophical question or two. And being a juggler myself, it was delightful to have a troupe of jugglers as the primary background characters, and the plot device of an overthrown king with amnesia becoming an apprentice juggler was a novel touch.	2000-04-22

Contrary to what the cover  and the ad blurbs would have you believe, it is not the least erotic, the  plot is poorly constructed, and the style vacillates between failed  attempts at levity and overweaning pretentiousness.<br />Other than that, it  was fine.	2000-04-22

The Kzinti are a sentient race of spacefarers of similar intelligence<br />to man, with a similarly evolved technology, who are evolved from<br />carnivorous hunting cats, rather than omnivorous monkeys. As such,<br />they are a warrior culture, valuing strength and expertise at<br />violence, rather than intellect.  (So just HOW did they evolve that<br />spacefaring technology? Good question, and one that isn't<br />answered.)<br /> This book is the first in a series of collections of<br />stories about the interactions of humanity and the kzinti in a world<br />created by Larry Niven, but in which he allows other writers to<br />create. The first story in this book is by Niven himself, the original<br />story of the first contact between humanity and kzinti. At the<br />beginning of this story, humanity has only recently developed space<br />travel, and has for centuries been so peaceful that most cannot even<br />imagine participating in violence. In spite of this, they survive<br />their first encounter with the warrior kzinti, and learn from the<br />encounter that they cannot remain fanatically pacifist if they wish to<br />survive in the universe.<br /> There are two problems with this story:<br />one being that I find it highly dubious that such totally domesticated<br />people would be able to switch the mental gears required to defend<br />themselves successfully quickly enough, and the other that, frankly, I<br />find the kzin more &quot;human&quot; than the humans at the outset.<br /><br />The next two stories are by Poul Anderson and Dean Ing, respectively,<br />and they are, frankly, better than the introductory story by<br />Niven. Still, while this is an enjoyable read, it's not a particularly<br />impressive one.	2000-04-20

Marion Zimmer Bradley always explains, in her  introductions, that she began the series because in traditional &quot;sword  and sorcery&quot;, female characters wer relegated to the role of &quot;bad  conduct prizes&quot; for the (male) protagonists.<br />It's a fine series, and  this is one of the better books in the series. Number 15 is still my  favorite, but this one is in the top three, possibly second-best. There's a  nice mix of continuing adventures of characters we've seen in earlier  volumes and totally new stories. I didn't care at all for &quot;A Sister's  Blood&quot;, by Patricia B. Cirone, but that was essentially because I  didn't care for the conclusion it reached. I will, however, concede that it  was well-written, and could be the catalyst for an interesting discussion  or two with someone who disagreed with me. &quot;Moonlight On The  Water&quot;, by Carol E. Leever, was excellent, as were &quot;The Wishing  Stones&quot;, by Lisa S. Silverthorne, and &quot;A Fool's Game&quot;, by  Selina Rosen. &quot;The Anvil Of Her Pride&quot;, by Lawrence Schimel, was  a bit predictable, but good nonetheless, and &quot;The Day They Ran Out Of  Princesses&quot;, by Gail Sosinsky Wickman, was just plain fun.	2000-04-15

This biography does a very good job of following the life of Abraham Lincoln from birth to death, although I would have liked a few more complete quotes from his more noteworthy speeches. (Donald tends to give excerpts only.) But he gives a very even-handed evaluation, neither hiding from Lincoln's flaws and attempting to lionize him beyond his desserts, nor downplaying his undeniable importance. Clearly, by modern standards, Lincoln was a racist; this is hardly surprising, given his background and upbringing. But just as clearly, he overcame that background and upbringing to a tremendous extent, and was clearly very close to an abolitionist; to the extent that he resisted abolishing slavery, and did so only under the press of political neccessity, it was not because he didn't consider it a great evil, but because he was concerned about the practical ramifications of such a drastic step. Donald makes all of this quite clear, and gives a very balanced treatment of this issue, among others.<br />A fine book, well worth the read.	2000-04-13

The Sword And Sorceress series is a series of collections of short stories, of traditional &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; style, but with women as main protagonists. Marion Zimmer Bradley always explains in her  introductions that she began the series because in traditional sword and  sorcery, what female characters are to be found are invariably &quot;bad  conduct prizes&quot; for the (male) main characters.<br />It's a fine series,  and this volume may just be the best; there was not a bad story in the lot,  although I wasn't really taken with &quot;Shimmering Scythe&quot;, by Vera  Nazarian, and had serious doubts about the ending of &quot;A Matter Of  Names&quot;, by Cynthia Ward. But I WAS very taken by &quot;Oaths&quot;, by  Lynn Morgan Rosser, perhaps the best of a very good lot, and there were  also a number of stories that continued the exploits of characters found in  previous volumes, all of which were a pleasure, a renewal of old  friendships: &quot;The Sick Rose&quot;, by Dorothy Heydt, continues the  adventures of Cynthia, the witch of Syracuse; &quot;Skin Deep&quot; by  Heather Rose Jones, continues the stories of Laaki, Asholi, and Eysla the  skin-changers; &quot;Spring Snow&quot;, by Diana Paxson, the adventures of  Bera, apprentice Norse wisewoman; and &quot;The Dragon's Horde&quot;, by  Elisabeth Waters and Raul S. Reyes, the adventures of Princess Rowena and  the dragon. If you've enjoyed any of the other collections in this series,  you are more than very likely to enjoy this one; if you're not familiar  with the series, this is as good an introduction as any.	2000-04-11

Granted, it's aworld with which I am already familiar but it didn't seem to me that areader unfamiliar with the world would be hard-pressed to understand what was happening; Cassada seems to me to do an excellent job of providing background information to the uninitiated without boring those readers familiar with the White Wolf universe. The book did not read like a chronicle of a gaming campaign; the characters were fresh and compelling, and the plot flowed well. Neither did it seem to end unfulfillingly, as beginnings of trilogies frequently do; while we have seen a plotline that is left incomplete as a lead-in to the next book, enough loose ends are tied up that it does not feel as though we have simply read the first third of a story; we've read a full story, and there are others to follow. If there is a criticism, it is that there are a few too many sidhe (noble) characters, compared to the other kith. But this is truly nit-picking; this is a marvellous tale.	2000-04-05

It is a bit dry stylistically, which  is all that keeps it from five stars, but it contains an amazing wealth of  information that balances out the general viewpoint of American history as  it is taught in public schools. It should be considered an invaluable asset  in any attempt to present a balanced perspective on our country's history.  Ignoring the criminally dishonorable way in which those of European descent  have treated the Natives will NOT make it go away, nor even lessen the  karmic debt. Only by learning about and acknowledging the truth can we even  BEGIN to decide what steps need to be taken now and in the future.	2000-03-29

Have you ever wondered about how Van Helsing could have (safely) given Lucy Westenra four blood transfusions in four days from four different people, without bothering to check for blood types or RH factors? Have you  ever wondered how the count could be killed by two knives, one slashing his  throat, the other stabbing his heart, when all vampire lore in and out of  the novel suggests that normal weapons are useless against him? Have you  ever wondered, if you yourself are not religious, why religious artifacts  would have powerful effects against him? Then you MUST read this book. Not  only is this a fabulous retelling of the story from Dracula's viewpoint,  but this version explains and clarifies these and many other weak points in  the original tale and is, frankly, a much more enjoyable read for a modern  reader.	2000-03-27

The Star Trek Log... series is an adaptation of the episodes from the old animated Star Trek series; the episodes in Log Six are \\"Albatross\\", in which Kirk and the Enterprise crew must find evidence to acquit Dr. McCoy  of having accidentally caused a major plague nineteen years before;  \\"The Practical Joker\\", in which the Enterprise's computer  develops a deviant personality; and \\"How Sharper Than A Serpent's  Tooth\\", in which the Enterprise meets the entity who was worshipped as  Kukulkan by the ancient Aztecs. Foster does a fine job of portraying the  characters and developing the plots, and the episodes are reasonably  interesting although the last one strikes me as derivative of the episode  from the original series, \\"Who Mourns For Adonais\\", in which Kirk  and company meet Apollo.	2000-03-26
