Valente, Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams (Prime, 2005)<br /><br />Sometimes I feel as if I should have a \\"five-and-a-half star\\" ranking. I've given a lot of books five stars in the past couple of years-- more five-star reviews than I'd given out in the decade before, almost. (Blame my getting a library card again, and thus not being limited to my own books.) But there are some books that transcend even the five-star rating, that are not only outstanding works of art, but that are so beautifully written that they deserve a place on the short shelf of sacred literature. The benchmark, for me, of this trait has long been Wendy Walker's The Secret Service, the book I consider the most beautifully written and constructed book I've ever read. Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams is the first book I've come across since reading The Secret Service that rises to the same level.<br /><br />Throw away your conceptions of what a novel is before cracking the cover on this one. All the stuff you got taught in English class, chuck it out the window. Yume No Hon is character study in its purest form. The problem is, you've got an autobiography from the most unreliable of narrators (cf. Lauren Slater's Excellent Lying, to which this bears a passing resemblance more than once, were our main character epileptic and living in America); every time you think you've got an answer as to Ayako's real nature, you're likely to turn around and find yourself with many more questions. It's the mimetics of creative nonfiction, but turned around and attached to fiction; is Ayako dying and delirious, or possessed by powerful spirits? Is she ghost, hermit, memory, God? Ultimately, the answers to the questions don't matter (though the very end of the book does offer the reader a chance to resolve them); the journey, rather than the destination, is the point here.<br /><br />And what a journey it is. Valente's language is lush, rich, precise, every word slotted into place with painstaking care. While reading this, I found myself with a constant sense of overwhelming rightness in word choice (\\"rightness\\" here as opposed to \\"suitability;\\" a Dennis Lehane or George R. R. Martin novel contains suitable language, but the sentences could be phrased in many ways and still get the point across; the right language is that place where you think that there really is no better way to phrase something). The book is rich with striking, original metaphors and turns of phrase that will have the lover of beautiful language scrambling for a notebook to copy it all down. Buy two, actually; you may end up filling one completely before you're done.<br /><br />While the one negative effect of all this is to highlight the book's few typos (and, comparatively, there are very few; if memory serves, I found five, and two of them were arguable), this is one of those exceptionally rare pieces of work where stumbling upon a typo became something forgivable.<br /><br />Yume No Hon belongs with Walker's The Secret Service, McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Koja's Strange Angels, and a handful of other novels on the short shelf of sacred literature-- the first stuff you save when your apartment catches fire. It is a small jewel, to be read, pondered, re-read, and (for novelists) aspired to. Find a copy. Read it. *****ng care.

Robin Hobb, Shaman's Crossing (Harper, 2005)<br /><br />How do you follow up one of the strongest fantasy series of the last decade (which has been chock full of strong fantasy series)? If you're Robin Hobb, you turn around, walk the other way, and completely start over in a whole new world. (One does, however, wonder if the land east over the Barrier Mountains will turn out to be the Six Duchies.)<br /><br />Shaman's Crossing is the first of a trilogy featuring Nevare Burvelle, son of a soldier recently elevated to noble status. The first hundred-ish pages of the book take us through parts of Nevare's childhood, as he prepares to go to the Royal Academy at Old Thares to learn the ways of the cavalla (think \\"cavalry\\" here) to follow in the footsteps of his father. The rest of the book deals with Nevare's first year at the Academy-- the friendships and rivalries formed amongst the cadets, how the social life of the academy mirrors the mounting tension between old and new nobles in Old Thares, and laying groundwork for what's probably going to come in books two and three.<br /><br />Robin Hobb's books tend to start slowly, and Shaman's Crossing is no exception. As usual, however, the pace picks up as the book goes on. It doesn't pick up all too much, though, and a number of critics have come down on the book for being too slow. It does rather seem as if Hobb spends a lot more time in this book on setup, rather than allowing setup to flow naturally through the story (as happened in Assassin's Apprentice or Ship of Magic). That said, there's also a good deal more to set up; while many of the aspects of the life and culture of Gernia are the same sorts of things that were present in the life and culture of the Six Duchies, Hobb is obviously going to go into a lot more detail on them here. Fitz was always something of a loner, and only cared about political intrigue as it directly affected him. Nevare is a whole different sort of animal, who's forced to care about the intricacies of such things not only because he's in the thick of them, but because he's been born and bred to the task. There's a lot less action to be found in Shaman's Crossing than in any of Hobb's Six Duchies books, so be warned.<br /><br />This has the potential to be another fantastic series from the pen of Robin Hobb; I eagerly await the second book to see where things are going to go. ****he intricacies of such things not only because he's in the thick of them, but because he's been born and bred to the task.

Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Drafts 1-38: Toll (Wesleyan, 2001)<br /><br />I've (ironically) put down a number of drafts of this review, and haven't come up with anything remotely satisfying. There's really not much I have to say about the book; it's overlong (though from what I have been able to gather it's only the first two sections of a larger, as yet unfinished, work), close to unintelligible in places, full of parallel text branching off the main piece with no stage direction as to how a reader is supposed to read said parallel text, and drops out of what poetic mode it has in places and becomes didactic (\\"Deixis\\" is the most blatant example of this). All of this leads to a simple \\"didn't like it much.\\" Nothing else to be said, I guess. **	2005-10-11

Jim Edgar, Bad Cat (Workman, 2004)<br /><br />By now, I don't think there's anyone who has an Internet connection who hasn't heard of mycathatesyou. But there are still some remote places on the planet where there are no Internet connections, much less broadband (for example, Missouri). For those poor, unfortunate souls, Jim Edgar, the supreme guru of mycathatesyou, has distilled two hundred forty-four of the site's most wanted, given them captions, and turned them into this small, hilarious book.<br /><br />Pictures of cats who look like they want to kill you are relatively commonplace, and have been ever since someone decided that trying to photograph a cat was a good idea. Edgar, however, has a knack of putting captions with the pictures that induce laughter. (As in, out-loud, make-people-on-the-street-look-at-you-funny laughter.) The captions are what turn this from a work of unbearable cuteness into the greatness it is. Love cats, hate cats, cower in fear from them because they bring on asthma attacks, you will love this. ****	2005-10-11

Bronwyn Carlton, The Books of Faerie (DC Comics, 1998)<br /><br />Having made it roughly halfway through the Sandman series, I figured it was high time to start checking out the spinoffs, The Books of Magic and The Books of Faerie. Turned out to be a good idea, on both counts.<br /><br />The Books of Faerie, at least this volume, comprises two tales-- that of how Titania came to be Queen of Faerie, and another regarding a quest to go find Tim Hunter and bring him to Faerie originally published as Arcana Annual #1. While those who haven't yet picked up the Sandman or Books of Magic series are urged to read at least a way into those first, The Books of Faerie are quite a treat for those who have wandered off into the thick layers of mythology and symbolism Neil Gaiman imbued both series with.<br /><br />As with the whole extended series of graphic novels of which this is but a part, The Books of Faerie is a treat well worth savoring. *** ½	2005-10-11

Nail Gaiman, The Books of Magic (DC Comics, 1993)<br /><br />Comic books, like television sitcoms, have spinoffs when they get popular. All in the Family spun off The Jeffersons. Cheers spun off Frasier. The Sandman spun off The Books of Magic (which in turn spun off The Books of Faerie, though that could also be seen as a Sandman spinoff... it gets complicated, you know?). And yet The Books of Magic takes a whole different direction, in its first book, than one would expect from a Sandman spinoff; Gaiman mines the world of horror comics (Roger Zelazny, in his introduction, seems to have an almost horrified fascination for the depth of Gaiman's knowledge about obscure comic characters) and comes up with a foursome, called \\"The Trenchcoat Brigade\\" by member John Constantine, who are to find a young British boy named Tim Hunter, who has the capacity to become our age's finest wizard, and present to him the choice of whether he wants to become a wizard at all or not. (Presaging, one might add, a certain movie regarding red pills and blue pills that a whole lot of people seem to be fond of.)<br /><br />I am not as knowledgeable about obscure comic book characters as Neil Gaiman, and so I only know one of the Trenchcoat Brigade, Constantine. (I do vaguely remember references to Doctor Occult in my preteen reading, but those days are lost in a lot of fog.) Gaiman retains the spirit of Constantine, but as with the many authors who have been a part of the Hellblazer series over the years, puts his own stamp on the character; he's recognizably Constantine, but not Garth Ennis' or Brian Azzarello's Constantine, he's Neil Gaiman's. Which is a little odd at first, but one gets used to it relatively quickly. (I assume the same can be said of the series' other borrowed characters, but don't quote me.) The interesting thing is how Gaiman's imagination of Constantine fits so well within this world; there's always a bit of jarring when a new team takes over a comic, but Gaiman's absorption of Constantine is flawless, as if he's always been a Gaiman character.<br /><br />Very odd, and very interesting, and definitely worth continuing with. ****absorption of Constantine is flawless, as if he's always been a Gaiman character. <br /> <br />Very odd, and very interesting, and definitely worth continuing with. ****	2005-10-11

Vive Griffith, Weeks in This Country (Kent State, 2000)<br /><br />The trouble with chapbooks, at times, is that there's simply not enough in them for one to get a feel for the author. On the good side, as long as you're enjoying the work, it leaves you wanting more; on the downside, it doesn't really give you much to say in a review.<br /><br />Weeks in This Country suffers this malady. I was engaged by Griffith's loose, easy diction, which remains poetic while still sounding like someone talking to you while on a flight from Fresno to Schenectady. It's good, solid work that left me wanting more. But there's not terribly much I can say about it, because there are only twenty-six pages here to read. Those twenty-six pages are worth looking for, though. *** ½	2005-10-11

Stephen Green-Armytage, Extraordinary Chickens (Abrams, 2000)<br /><br />I still have no idea what to say about this book. I'm sure most people didn't see it the way I did, but I really couldn't help myself. Chickens are low-level disturbance generators to me, far below the level of clowns, but more disturbing than, say, mimes (who are simply annoying rather than the stuff of nightmares). For some reason, I was rather expecting your basic book of photos of chickens doing really dumb things. This is not that book.<br /><br />Green-Armytage obviously has an affinity for these fowl. (Which makes me wonder about him.) These are portraits of various show chickens, along with notes on the various breeds and that sort of thing. I ended up looking at it rather like I look at dog shows. Half the time, I'm wondering who it was that thought breed X was actually attractive, when it actually is the kind of thing that invokes nightmares in small children. The other half of the time, I was amazed that you can find this sort of thing in nature.<br /><br />The photos themselves are impeccable. Green-Armytage knows his way around a camera, to be sure. And if you're a fan of chickens in their more interesting forms, you will probably quite enjoy this. If, on the other hand, you think chickens are the harbingers of the end of the universe, you will most likely want to avoid this. ***	2005-10-11

Ho Che Anderson, Scream Queen (Fantagraphics, 2005)<br /><br />Ho Che Anderson takes the Brute method of drawing (if you don't know Brute's work, look at some KMFDM album covers) to whole new areas of weirdness. It's a kind of German expressionism mixed with pulp-fiction-book-cover thing they've got going on. Not too easy on the eyes, but then the subject matter usually demands some pain.<br /><br />Kind of hard to explain the plot of this one without getting into spoilers from the very beginning. There's this woman, you see, hitch-hiking...<br /><br />Very odd stuff. Requires some thought at the end to see what Anderson's on about (not with the plot, which resolves nicely, but the reason for the existence of the thing in the first place), and you're likely to draw only the most ambiguous of conclusions. Feels like a short story that's begging to become a novel; will we see a full-length Scream Queen from Anderson in the future? One can only hope. ***	2005-10-11

Neil Gaiman, Sandman: A Game of You (DC Comics, 1993)<br /><br />This fifth book in Gaiman's Sandman series takes us off on a side journey to a decidedly odd apartment house in New York City whose fate is inextricably tied to that of an outer island in the Dreaming. Lovely, innocent Barbie (who, of course, has an ex-boyfriend named Ken, because it's cute, and in Gaiman's world, \\"cute\\" is an inevitable precursor to destruction; it's almost on the same level as hubris in classical literature) and her best friend Wanda live in an apartment building with a pair of well-meaning lesbians, a youngish art history student who wears outrageously oversized glasses, and a reclusive type up on the top floor named George. All of them are in some way connected to the Dreaming, and the events of past books in the series, but how is only revealed to the reader in stages, so explaining it all would be quite spoilerific.<br /><br />A worthy addition to the series, though the two previous books were (slightly) better overall. ****	2005-10-11

Thomas Ott, Greetings from Hellville (Fantagraphics, 2002)<br /><br />Greetings from Hellville is likely to take you places you may not want to go; be warned. Ott's short, silent, rather nasty stories (four of which are contained in this slim volume) depict the sleazy side of life in what could well be any modern metropolitan area. While it would probably be a stretch to call Greetings from Hellville a horror comic, Ott's subjects are undeniably horrific, and Ott fails to leave even the smallest shred of hope that things are going to get better for the millions of nameless citizens of his city. (In fact, in one story, \\"G. O. D.,\\" the events center on hope being crushed.)<br /><br />Greetings from Hellville is an ugly, depressing ride.

Jack El-Hai, The Lobotomist (Wiley, 2005)<br /><br />Every once in a while, a book comes along on a subject so important, and so deserving of elucidation to a public that in the popular mind has misrepresented it, that the book almost cries out to be read. Its very subject matter promises that it will, in fact, be a brilliant piece of work. Then you actually read, or attempt to read, the thing, and... well, it's not.<br /><br />While Caldwell's Hitler's Pope is still the reigning king in the arena of \\"important, but unbearably boring\\" books, The Lobotomist has certainly proved itself to be at least the court jester. Finally, the world gets a biography of Walter Freeman, who worked tirelessly to popularize the lobotomy (and, we note, didn't get a tenth as far in years as Joey Ramone did in less than two minutes), which if it is in any way objective is going to go a long way towards fighting the demonic image the lobotomy has in today's society. And to be fair, Jack El-Hai's book aims to do just that, and to some extent succeeds. The problem is that by the time you get to hearing about Freeman's work in the field, you no longer have any facility for caring left in your brain.<br /><br />The Lobotomist is written as if it were to be read, in its audio form, by whatever teacher you had in school with the most monotonous, uninspiring voice. El-Hai writes about events that changed the face of society, and them men behind those events, as if he's cataloguing the also-rans at a county poultry show. I understand a bit of journalistic detachment (which is, in itself, a literary trope; Michael Bilton, for example, uses it to great effect in the final chapters of Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper), but it hardly seems human to look at events such as these, report them, and let not even the merest shred of awe or wonder come out in your writing about the subject, does it?<br /><br />I eagerly await another biography of Walter Freeman, because El-Hai missed, by a wide margin, his stated goal in this one.

Leslea Newman, Jailbait (Delacorte, 2005)<br /><br />It is quite probable that, no matter what happens with Leslea Newman's career, she will forever have her name linked with Heather Has Two Mommies, her 1990 juvenile picture book that inspired a firestorm of controversy (that still rages today). She could win the Nobel Prize for Literature next week, and people would probably still refer to her as \\"the person who wrote Heather Has Two Mommies.\\" Whether Jailbait was an attempt to break the mold by writing another book with an undeniably controversial theme or not, I've no idea, but I must admit the thought crossed my mind more than once.<br /><br />I find it exceptionally interesting that a previous Amazon reviewer (August 16, 2005) criticizes the novel for not \\"[disproving] the myth that young girls always understand the consequences sexual involvement with an older man can bring.\\" I'm not terribly sure where that reviewer is getting her information; in America, the myth (and the law to back it up) is that no \\"child\\" of either sex understands the consequences of sexual involvement with an older member of either sex. And while to say exactly how Newman tackles that question would be the spoiler of spoilers for the book (for that question and how it is addressed, predictably, is the climax of the novel), I have to say that from where I'm standing, the previous reviewer seems to have read exactly the opposite of the book I did.<br /><br />It's impossible to judge the book without looking at the deeper ethical concepts raised, unfortunately, but I think I managed to base my review more on the book's construction than the questions it addresses. It is aimed at the 10-12 grade crowd, and the language fits. The characters are well, and surprisingly, drawn; for a book set in 1971, the token trapped-in-the-sixties stoner is surprisingly understated, and one has to give at least grudging respect to the idea that Newman had to have been tempted to turn said token stoner into a stereotype. Instead, he turns out as human as the rest of the cast. The boyfriend, who is of course at the core of the book, is handled quite well; Newman uses the book's first-person-singular to keep us from knowing any more about him than her protagonist does, which proves on more than one occasion to simultaneously frustrate the reader and lend an air of veracity. (One imagines an author with lesser skills sending her protagonist off to play amateur detective, a move Newman wisely avoids.) Our hero's parents slip a little now and again towards stereotype, but that's to be expected in literature aimed at the teen set, and Newman never takes it too far.<br /><br />An interesting book, both well-written and worth thinking about for its subject matter; I just wish Newman had strayed as far from conventional morality in the latter as she did from conventional genre writing in the former. *** ½, he turns out as human as the rest of the cast.

Pinckney Benedict, The Wrecking Yard (Doubleday, 1992)<br /><br />Pinckney Benedict writes testosterone-fueled stories that seem, given the publication date of this book, almost to be a rebuttal to the Robert Blys and Sam Keens of the world. I'm certainly glad someone was doing it.<br /><br />The ten stories here (actually, nine stories and one radio play) have an eighties-fiction feel about them; they are simple slices of life that don't seem to be about much of anything. However, sometime in the late eighties, writers began to take the eighties-fiction tenets and play with them, creating stories with the same mediocre presentation and writing really, really good stuff within the frame. Barry Hannah and Ethan Canin are obvious examples; Pinckney Benedict can be put on the same shelf. Where Hannah pokes his nose into the life of the American south, Benedict reins his vision in a little tighter, sticking with rural West Virginia, and the myriad strangenesses to be found there. For example, \\"Horton's Ape\\" deals with two travelers who find themselves at a roadside bar that has a small zoo out back; \\"Washman\\" deals with a mountain man who exacts a horrible revenge on a man who tries to kill his mule, and Washman's own punishment for his acts.<br /><br />It's possible that the best story in the collection is \\"Rescuing Moon,\\" about a man who goes to save a friend of his from life in a surreal nursing home. However, every reader will likely find a favorite in here, and it could be any of the ten pieces presented. All are written with the confidence of a guy who writes fine short stories, and knows it. Benedict is one of America's lesser-known literary lights, and that's a shame; his books are a lot of fun, in the same way Barry Hannah's are (and with, especially in this case in \\"Washman,\\" the same genial mean-spiritedness that is likely to disturb more than a few readers).

Tim Waggoner, Like Death (Leisure, 2005)<br /><br />Somewhere roundabout page seventy or so, Like Death gets good-- real good. Like, Tom Piccirilli or Caitlin R. Kiernan good. While it unfortunately doesn't hold on for the rest of its length, the fact that it gets there at all shows great promise.<br /><br />Like Death is the story of Scott Raymond, who, we learn in the first chapter, cowered under a kitchen table at the age of seven, watching the murder of his family. Fast-forward a good number of years, and Scott is now a true-crime writer who has, over the past couple of years, come slightly unhinged. Previously a loving husband and father, he has become sullen and threatening toward his wife, who moved out and took their son with her. She moved, in one of the coincidences that only happen in novels, to the same town where Amanda Tanner, the subject of the book Scott's working on, disappeared a year before. Thus, Scott can move to the same town and stalk his wife and child while simultaneously working on the book. The problem being not only that his wife doesn't want to see him, but as soon as he touches ground in Ash Creek, he becomes like Rene, the cafe owner in 'Allo 'Allo!: it seems like every woman who sees him wants to bunk down with him.<br /><br />All of which, I must say, makes Scott sound like far less sympathetic a character than he actually is. He's your basic nice guy who happens to be deeply confused by both the events going on around him and the war within him that he doesn't understand, much less know how to fight. As such, Like Death could easily be read as allegory on a number of levels (just about every subplot can be tied to \\"the war within,\\" as it were) for someone who wanted to go a little deeper than just getting a ripping yarn. But for the rest of you, the ripping-yarn factor here is relatively high, and Waggoner's prose approaches the heights that say \\"this guy's getting signed by the majors\\" on a sporadic, but not infrequent, basis.

Lauren Slater, Lying (Random House, 2000)<br /><br />I picked up Lauren Slater's first book, Welcome to My Country, on a whim in 1997, and instantly fell in love with Slater's impeccable prose. That she related case studies without descending into the smarmy self-help realm of, say, Oliver Sacks helped immensely. Welcome to My Country was on my best-I-read list that year.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2005, and I start wondering what Slater's been up to since releasing it. I check her out at Amazon, and am thrilled to find she's released two books since. Lying is the first of them I picked up, and it's great to see she's still at the top of her game.<br /><br />Billed as \\"a metaphorical memoir,\\" we are given an autobiography of Lauren Slater, an epileptic who's had a rather extreme surgical procedure performed to counter her epilepsy. It controls the physical aspects-- the seizures-- but hasn't controlled any of the mental. This, of course, is the stuff popular memoirs are made of; the dysfunctional childhood sells.<br /><br />What Slater brings to the table that sets her apart from the others is that, while there is always the understanding that the memoir is colored by the perceptions of its author, Slater recognizes this as much as any reader, and has decided to play with it-- to the point where the reader (and the person who wrote the cover copy, as well) realize that by the time we reach the first of Slater's revelations that she's written a fantasy as an actual event, we can no longer even be sure she has epilepsy. This opens up whole worlds of discussion in the larger genre of memoir, and that in itself makes Lying a singularly important work in its field; if taken as a greater meditation on memoir, the reader should come away with this book with a new way of looking at the form.<br /><br />All that aside, though, the best reason to read Lauren Slater's books is simply that she's a fine, fine writer. Lying also has a very, very good chance of landing on this year's best-I-read list, despite the quality of my reading having skyrocketed in recent years. **** ½n this year's best-I-read list, despite the quality of my reading having skyrocketed in recent years. **** 	2005-10-07

Cherlyn Michaels, Counting Raindrops Through a Stained-Glass Window (Archland, 2004)<br /><br />A quick websearch and about five minutes of research turned up the fact that Michaels herself created Archland Press. Therefore, this is self-publishing, not vanity publishing, and thus that particular flavor of tar can't come out with the feathers. The problem is, all the shortcomings of vanity publishing show up with self-published works, and so they end up usually being only a step above vanity work.<br /><br />Counting Raindrops Through a Stained Glass Window has a relatively good idea for a romance novel: heroine (who is, of course, smart, sexy, and self-assured) has the perfect relationship. She's seen so many marriages go down the drain that she's unwilling to make the final commitment. Boyfriend (who is, of course, an Adonis who can cook) wants to propose. Heroine keeps finding ways to halt the conversation, while her friends are telling her to go for it. Resolve, of course, must crack. It's a romance, everyone's gotta end up happy (and preferably married); the fun of romance novels is the journey taken to get there. And thus, in romance novels, as in any genre fiction, it's doubly important that the journey at least be well-written enough to keep the interest of the reader.<br /><br />And here's the problem with self-publishing and it's ugly cousin vanity publishing: in this case, it's not. It doesn't even come close. Every time Michaels gets herself into a rhythm, she drops in something that seems as if it were cut out of a marketing brochure, rather than pulled from a romance writer's quiver. Her tone changes in the space of a sentence from romantic to didactic, then back again. It's awkward, and even the most entry-level editor at a major press (or even a small-but-on-the-rise press; BET's publishing arm seems as if it would've been a natural fit) would have immediately flagged huge sections of this manuscript, mandating the tone be changed to fit with the rest of the material. Unfortunately, without the advice of an editor, the book stayed in what reads like rough draft form, and showcases the differences between an author's first draft and a publishable piece of work. Other awkward errors can be found as well, such as using an abbreviation and then spelling out what the abbrevation means the second time, rather than the first, it's used:<br /><br />\\"While I was the only one in the lobby at the Cleveland Growth Association's COSE office, the phone was lit up like Times Square....The coffee table held a spread of information provided by the Consortium of Small Emterprises (COSE).\\" For the record, there's roughly half a page covered by that ellipsis.<br /><br />Coincidentally, as I write this, the book has been picked up and reprinted by Hyperion. It might be worth comparing the two editions to see if there were changes to some of the text to make it a better read. I'm reviewing from the first printing, however, and I have to say to avoid this one like the plague. (zero)he rest of the material.

Brite, The Seed of Lost Souls (Subterranean, 1999)<br /><br />First off, there is more to this slight (forty-six pages) chapbook than simply the seed of Lost Souls; it also contains a book review she did of an anthology put out a few years back and an interview with a fanzine. So it wouldn't be fair just to review it on the basis of the short novella. But I'll probably lean too far in that direction, anyway. Be warned.<br /><br />I've never been much of a Steve-and-Ghost fan; I became a Poppy Z. fan after reading Exquisite Corpse, and took an immediate liking to the new novels that some wags have been calling \\"food porn.\\" I've never been sure what it was about Lost Souls (and the S&G story in Wormwood) that didn't grab me. I have to say, after reading this, that I still have no idea-- but I do know I was far fonder of this than either of the other pieces.<br /><br />Brite says in the introduction that \\"the writing is that of a twenty-year-old, sometimes breathless with possibility but more often just breathless.\\" And to be fair, it's certainly an unfinished piece; the characters never really gel, but are very good sketches; the two storylines come together in what can generously be called the most superficial of ways; there is a good deal of promising imagery, but too little of it is fleshed out for the deeper-looking reader to get involved in anything resembling textual analysis. But the prose itself just says \\"wow.\\" Even in such a disjointed, embryonic piece, it's obvious to the reader-- this reader, anyway-- that the person who wrote these lines was going to grow up and be a very, very good writer. Of course, that's rather easy to say in hindsight, but when work oozes potential like this and you're given a chance to read it, you have to feel like you were one of the people on the novel-in-progress-prize board a few years ago who encountered Elizabeth Kostova's half-finished manuscript for The Historian.<br /><br />A number of the reviews on Amazon for this chapbook (which are, interestingly, all of either the five- or one-star variety) seem to have missed the point of the latter two sections entirely. \\"This book makes it seem like she despises the 'gothic' fan base...\\" (Feb. 6, 2004) can only be referring to the interview at the end, which seemed to me to express quite the opposite sentiment, though Brite's parting shot is obviously drawn from rather painful personal experience, and someone who doesn't read that into it (maybe you have to have been one of the outcasts yourself to get it) could see it as condescending. More amusing is a comment from from May of 1999 that seems like it's going to get interesting, then tails off \\"it's not like Lost Souls was a masterpiece or anything.\\" I'm guessing this guy (I'm inferring from the lack of grammar and the tone the review was written by a male; sue me for sexism, then) skipped the intro altogether. Whether or not a book is a \\"masterpiece\\" doesn't really have any bearing on the fanaticism of its readership; Brite says in the intro that Lost Souls \\"has spawned music, artwork, roleplaying games, devotion, contempt, and a church-sponsored book burning....\\" Anyone who has taken the book and done anything with it, it can be safely assumed, is going to love this.<br /><br />I can attest that some of us who weren't overly fond of Lost Souls were just as happy to read it, thanks. *** ½n for this chapbook (which are, interestingly, all of either the five- or one-star variety) seem to have missed the point of the latter two sections entirely. \\"This book makes it seem like she despises the 'gothic' fan base...\\" (Feb. 6, 2004) can only be referring to the interview at the end, which seemed to me to express quite the opposite sentiment, though Brite's parting shot is obviously drawn from rather painful personal experience, and someone who doesn't read that into it (maybe you have to have been one of the outcasts yourself to get it) could see it as condescending.

Vollmann, Whores for Gloria (Pantheon, 1991)<br /><br />Published just as Vollmann was beginning to make a name for himself as a critical darling, Whores for Gloria propelled him into the world of underground literature with a fervor rarely seen. What separates the now-towering Vollmann from his flash-in-the-pan contemporaries is that Vollmann's shock-value work actually has some real meat to it.<br /><br />Whores for Gloria is the story of Jimmy, a drunkard who lives in San Francisco's Tenderloin district and pines for Gloria. We have no idea who Gloria really is, and we often get the idea that Jimmy doesn't, either. In an effort to rebuild his memories of Gloria in his mind, Jimmy begins paying the area's hookers to tell him stories of their childhoods, which Jimmy then maps onto himself and Gloria, attempting to make her (or his vision of her) achieve flesh-and-blood status.<br /><br />As the title is likely to convey, Whores for Gloria is not a suitable-for-all-audiences kind of book. However, one isn't going to get the prurient-interest-for-the-sake-of-prurient-interest writing one finds in such authors as Dennis Cooper or Matthew Stokoe; what Vollmann has penned here is a surprisingly subtle mystery novel disguised as a slice-of-life drama so embraced by the other authors mentioned above. The best comparison I can make to this book is to the better novels of Joyce Carol Oates; it seems to me that those who enjoy Oates' take on the disintegration of the psyche will also get a kick out of Vollmann. This one deserves the hype. *** ½	2005-09-29

The characters, and the situations in which she places them, are interesting enough to hold the readers' interest, but the language is often awkward; language is, of course, the most important part of poetry. It's hard to imagine anyone writing the lines \\"Water breaks/and oh! Rapture\\" and still be surprised when someone pegs the poem for a piece out of the nineteenth century. At other times, the language is more subdued, but prosaic:<br /><br />\\"I sort rubber rings<br /><br />stack extra lids<br /><br />arrange my memories<br /><br />of you neatly<br /><br />in vacuum packed jars...\\"<br /><br />(\\"Cold Storage\\")<br /><br />There's a good deal of promise here, but this reads more like a first draft turned into a writing workshop than a finished, and published, manuscript. **	2005-09-29

Chris Baty, No Plot? No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days (Chronicle, 2004)<br /><br />I figured I'd get this read now, and save the inevitable library queue sure to form in the last two weeks of October. November, of course, is National Novel Writing Month, and Chris Baty is the man behind it all. No Plot? No Problem! Is Baty's manual to getting yourself through the month of November (or whichever month you choose, if you're crazy enough to try this on your own) and be able to look back and see fifty thousand words in your week.<br /><br />Now, some people do that sort of thing naturally; Clive Barker has mentioned that his usual goal is five thousand words a day. But then, most of us embroiled in NaNoWriMo haven't even published a short story, much less enough eight-hundred-plus-page novels to tip over a good-sized bookshelf, so Baty assumed that five grand a day was not, in fact, natural, and gave us a little self-help guide on ways to kick one's muse awake and into gear for thirty miserable but rewarding days.<br /><br />No Plot? No Problem! is amusing, and holds the reader's interest. It's relatively short (Baty wanted to give the reader an example of a fifty-thousand-word completed work) and an easy read. Baty has a bit of a caffeine obsession, but that can be forgiven. Worth reading if you're going to try and jump off this particular cliff this year. ***	2005-09-29

Kiernan, Murder of Angels (Roc, 2004)<br /><br />It'll take you a good three hundred of this novel's three hundred thirty-five pages to figure out the title, and even then, you'll probably still be questioning whether you've got any idea. But don't let that worry you.<br /><br />The story revolves around rock star Daria Parker and her partner, Niki Ky. Daria and Niki saw something in a basement in Birmingham ten years before, and whatever it was caused them to flee westward to San Francisco. Daria has sublimated it all with the help of a strong alcohol dependency and an artistic outlet; Niki, on the other hand, has slid downwards into schizophrenia, barely checked by the handfuls of psychoactive prescription drugs that form her dependency. Watching over the two of them are, respectively, Alex, the guitarist and Daria's band, and Marvin, Niki's caretaker. Their lives are stable, if not solid, until the ghosts of that night in Birmingham start coming to call-- literally.<br /><br />Kiernan is, simply, a fantastic writer. It doesn't matter what her medium is at any given time (though I have to admit not having read any of her published papers on paleontology), a reader can trust her to bring out the ammunition, lock and load, and open fire with simultaneous total obliteration and deadly accuracy. I'm relatively convinced, having now worked my way through a little over half of Kiernan's back catalogue, that the woman has never put a word on the published page that isn't worth reading. Murder of Angels is no exception. She has a Clive Barker-like ability to take the underbelly (in the quotidian, not the \\"gritty, sleazy\\" sense) of the life we all know and put up with and juxtapose it with the supremely weird without having us think :wait a minute, the last sentence was about real life, and this sentence is about the supremely weird.\\" And when in this case one example of \\"supremely weird\\" is the Dog's Bridge pictured on the cover of the trade paperback edition, you should be getting the idea you're in for a fun, albeit somewhat disturbing, ride.<br /><br />As always, Kiernan delivers. Like the best work of Barker, Koja, Shepard, etc., Kiernan's book transcends genre and flirts with that elusive beast \\"literature.\\" It doesn't matter whether your preferred tipple is Stephen King or Haruki Murakami (though you're in a better starting place if you enjoy both); Murder of Angels will have its way with you, and you'll thank it. ****tion, you should be getting the idea you're in for a fun, albeit somewhat disturbing, ride. <br /> <br />As always, Kiernan delivers.

Meg Rosoff, How I Live Now (Wendy Lamb, 2004)<br /><br />How I Live Now won the ALA (sponsored by Booklist)'s Michael L. Printz Award for Literary Excellence for 2004. After having read it, my basic response ended up being \\"it was pretty good, but it wasn't all that and a bag of chips.\\" (Kathe Koja's The Blue Mirror, like the rest of her young adult novels, was of course ignored.)<br /><br />How I Live Now is the story of Daisy, a fifteen-year-old girl sent to England to live with her cousins under the threat of war. One can never really be sure why, because it doesn't seem like the U.S. Is in danger of getting involved in the conflict at any time, while Britain seems to be right on the edge. When the cousins' mother, Aunt Penn, is trapped in Oslo after an explosion at the train station, Daisy and her cousins live on their own for a time, until war finally does come to the island; at that point, soldiers requisition their house, and the cousins are separated and sent off to different work farms. In the interim, of course, Daisy has found love with her dashing cousin Edmond, who is of course packed off somewhere else. The bulk of the novel details Daisy and her younger cousin Piper trying to find the three older siblings.<br /><br />The book kept giving me flashbacks to the somewhat superior Ian McEwan novel The Cement Garden in its constant ignoring of general societal taboos. The plot is different, of course, but the general look-and-feel is the same, and so I spent most of my time reading this comparing the two novels; How I Live Now mostly comes up short. Still, for what it is, it's a quick, readable novel with a number of fleshed-out characters (though only Daisy feels truly three-dimensional). It's enjoyable, but is it really a prizewinner on both sides of the Atlantic (it also won the Guardian Childrens' Fiction award)? ** 1/2	2005-09-29

Jeff Smith, Bone (Cartoon Books, 2004)<br /><br />This edition of Bone was an amazing undertaking, easily the largest in scope in graphic novels (and it's not all that far from one of the biggest in print publishing): a single volume of the entire series. It weighs in at an impressive 1,341 pages-- larger than even the hardback first editions of Stephen King (1,200 pages for The Stand), Norman Mailer (1,310 pages for the infamous Harlot's Ghost), and George R. R. Martin (a seemingly paltry 992 pages for A Storm of Swords reported by Amazon, though I could swear my copy was in the 1,100-page vicinity) that currently are the living definition of the doorstop. Heck, I have computer reference books that are smaller. In fact, the biggest computer book on the shelf, The Windows 2000 Graphics API Black Book, only weighs in at 1,188 pages. So you have to ask yourself why Jeff Smith decided to collect his already cult-favorite multi-volume graphic novel and publish it in what is, if not the thickest trade paperback in recent memory, in the top ten? That, unfortunately, is a question I am not able to answer without access to Mr. Smith's brain. I can, however, tell you one thing: you need to read Bone.<br /><br />The story starts out simple enough: Phony Bone has been thrown out of Boneville for reasons that do not become clear until much later in the series. His cousins Fone Bone and Smiley Bone went with him in order to help him escape. They get lost in the desert and, in a swarm of locusts, Fone Bone gets separated from his cousins. The biggest thing on everyone's mind is how to get back to Boneville. The problem is, stuff keeps getting in the way-- talking bugs, dragons, Fone Bone falling in love with a human girl, you know, all the usual stuff. Smith takes his simple plot and weaves it around something much larger and infinitely more complex, but does so with such panache that before you've gotten twenty pages, you will be completely sucked into the story. This, it should be noted, is a story for which you will forego food and sleep, so don't start it if you don't have a weekend handy and/or don't care about your job.<br /><br />What truly separates Bone and its fellow Greatest Comics in History (Preacher and Watchmen immediately spring to mind) is that these aren't just your basic superheroes-with-flaws that have become so common. (It's nice for someone to have noted, a few decades back, that superheroes should, in fact, be human, however.) In each of these cases, the main characters are fully-developed three-dimensional characters, and so are at least some of the minor characters; you truly get to know the villains and their mentalities; the story segues into flashback or narrative without the slightest jarring of your suspension of disbelief, then slips back into the present the same way; etc., etc. In short, the best graphic novels do the same thing as do the best novels-- they entertain without assuming the reader is a buffoon or a know-nothing idiot, but couch those aspects of them that invite things like textual analysis and literary criticism inside themselves in such a way that buffoons and know-nothing idiots are still liable to find them enjoyable.<br /><br />I cannot recommend Bone highly enough. Don't let the sheer size of the volume scare you off. (It can still be found in its component pieces, for the reader willing to spend a bit more cash for the sake of portability.) This is, truly, the sort of thing comics were originally conceived for. A success in every regard. *****hould be noted, is a story for which you will forego food and sleep, so don't start it if you don't have a weekend handy and/or don't care about your job. <br /> <br />What truly separates Bone and its fellow Greatest Comics in History (Preacher and Watchmen immediately spring to mind) is that these aren't just your basic superheroes-with-flaws that have become so common.

Howard Hayden, The Solar Fraud: Why Solar Energy Won't Run the World (Vales Lake Publishing, 2001)<br /><br />I must have a built-in moron detector in my head, because it never once occurred to me that the majority would take the statements of those Hayden calls \\"solar sirens\\" in the ways in which Hayden simply assumes the sheep take them. However, Hayden, in presenting his case, lays down the foundations in such a way that I understand what he's on about (in no small part because he lays down some numbers about the uses of electricity and power in our society that I found exceptionally surprising), and I am horrified. Maybe I just never listened to the solar sirens closely enough, because when I see their words quoted in this book, my first thought is, \\"what are these people smoking, and where can I get some?\\"<br /><br />I always thought of the solar sirens as saying \\"we can use a lot more solar energy to run our homes, and maybe a few limited commercial applications.\\" Which is, to be fair, roughly where Hayden draws the line on what might be practical (though he does note with evident amusement that all solar homes have backup connections to the local power company for those times when the batteries die). But no. I read the quotes again. These people really believe we could run the whole country with solar energy? Do they have no concept of how much power a steel mill uses, compared to the average American house? (Neither did I, but I knew the number could be approximated with the phrase \\"a whole hell of a lot more.\\")<br /><br />Hayden's book, which reminds me a great deal of Bjorn Lomborg's more popular (and more controversial) The Skeptical Environmentalist, systematically takes the arguments of the various solar sirens we've heard singing for the past few decades and demolishes them. Where Hayden's book differs from Lomborg's is that with Lomborg, you always got the feeling he was using the environmentalists' tactics against them, and so the truth was somewhere in the middle. Hayden never fails to show his work. The math is laid out on the page for us all to see. He does all the necessary conversions (from, say, BTU to joules, the standard measurement), presents all the data in standard format, and then lets us judge for ourselves. There are a few times where he can't resist slipping in a \\"yeah, that'll work\\" or something along those lines, but really, it should be obvious to anyone reading this that the solar sirens are full of it.<br /><br />That said, I found the book to be incredibly optimistic, because what Hayden didn't say was that the idea of solar power wasn't economically feasible at all. In fact, in going through the arguments, he gave the bare outlines of how one would go about doing things in one's home to start using more solar energy. Which, if the proces of things like solar collectors were ever to come down, could save the average homeowner a few bucks a month. Nowhere does Hayden dispute this sort of thing; it's just the ideas of solar power running steel mills or \\"solar cars\\" that he goes after-- the unrealistic expectations folks have been trying to drill into our heads for the past few decades.<br /><br />Very good stuff. Especially if you live in a state passing one of the more hare-brained initiatives to get 20% (or something) of its power from sun, wind, and wave, you'll probably want to read this so you can judge how quickly you should be looking for a job in another state. *** ½ewhere in the middle.

Nowhere does Hayden dispute this sort of thing; it's just the ideas of solar power running steel mills or \\"solar cars\\" that he goes after-- the unrealistic expectations folks have been trying to drill into our heads for the past few decades. <br /> <br />Very good stuff. Especially if you live in a state passing one of the more hare-brained initiatives to get 20% (or something) of its power from sun, wind, and wave, you'll probably want to read this so you can judge how quickly you should be looking for a job in another state. *** 	2005-09-29

Colin Watson, Snobbery with Violence: Crime Stories and Their Audience (Eyre and Spotswood, 1971)<br /><br />I was expecting a survey with this book (rather like Moorcock's lovely Wizardry and Wild Romance), but got something altogether different: a critical assessment. Watson, a writer a notable crime fiction himself, looks over the state of things in relative detail from the turn of the century up to the emergence of James Bond (whose creator he calls \\"hopelessly derivative,\\" then goes on to show examples from many other authors he covered earlier in the book). While there's a bit of a bibliographic feel to the narrative-- fans of crime fiction will certainly see a new name or two to hunt down in one's library's stacks-- Watson is more concerned with the morals and values to be found in both the fiction and the authors writing it, and what those morals and values said about the changing of British society in the twentieth century. It's interesting stuff to be sure, but something of a vertical-market piece. Those who think they'll find it interesting most certainly will. *** ½	2005-09-29

What probably will surprise the reader is that Siana's letters to Ogre (aka Kevin Ogilvie, lead vocalist of the now-reformed Skinny Puppy, as well as a number of other projects over the years) are not nearly as focused on the \\"cutting\\" aspect of Siana's personality as the subtitle would lead one to believe; in fact, the actual cutting itself is mentioned few enough times that you won't have to take your boots off to count. (Which is good. All those eyelets can get frustrating.)<br /><br />Instead, what one gets is a uniformly depressing look at late-eighties life in the heartland. Siana rushes to add, in an afterword, that life was not always nearly as depressing as it seemed (and her relationship with her mother, especially, was not as bad as she made it sound back in the day). Keeping that in mind (not that the average reader could), this becomes a piece of anti-nostalgia; it's material that colors the view in the opposite way at the same time the events are occurring. (One wonders if any nostalgia, in fact, informs Siana's present-day commentary.)<br /><br />Those of us who were around and relatively the same age at the time are likely to get a kick out of this simply because we remember all this stuff. There are some glosses-- especially of the infamous \\"Cincinnati incident\\"-- but that can be put down to the fact that participants in the events as they were occurring have a less clear view of them than people would afterwards (e.g., Brent Banbury's interview with the Kevins for Brave New Waves in 1991, where they gave the whole story). This is a trip back to a time when we were all bored, and is likely to spark some interesting memories based solely on glancing references (I'd completely forgotten, for example, a college infatuation with Clan of Xymox until Siana mentions them). The rest... I can't be sure. ***ege infatuation with Clan of Xymox until Siana mentions them). The rest... I can't be sure. ***	2005-09-29

Jay Hovdey, Inside Horse Racing (Ballantine, 1987)<br /><br />There was a brief period when the major presses would actually publish books about horse racing. (That period seems to be returning, thanks to Seabiscuit and the reprinted Ruffian: Burning from the Start being such good sellers.) It's probably the case that books like Inside Horse Racing were what caused the bigwigs in the industry to relegate most publishing of books about the only decent sport on the planet to vertical-market publishers like Bonus.<br /><br />Not that Inside Horse Racing is a bad book by any means, but no matter how you look at it, it's a vertical-market book. Hovdey seems as if he's doing a general-interest \\"intro to horse racing\\" kind of thing, with four long chapters (on the horses themselves, handicapping, and the roles of jockeys and trainers) that do give an overview of his subject; however, it seems to me that the target audience for Hovdey's book is those who have at least casually followed the sport long enough to be familiar with, if not the trainers and jockeys, at least the horses. Each of the chapters save the handicapping chapter, which is far too general for the average beginning horse racing reader to find useful (much like Mark Cramer's works, which are marketed specifically to experienced horseplayers), talks about ways of ranking its subjects in terms that even the experienced player may find vague.<br /><br />While it's an interesting academic exercise, and will find a welcome home in the libraries of collectors of racing books, this isn't one I'd recommend picking up until well after you've fleshed out the bones of your racing library. ** ½	2005-09-29

Periel Aschenbrand, The Only Bush I Trust Is My Own (Tarcher, 2005)<br /><br />With all the good advance press this book got and the initial rave reviews, I'm not sure what I was expecting. Actually, I am; I was expecting this book to be funny.<br /><br />Tarcher's back-cover copy describes Aschenbrand's debut (which sits somewhere between memoir and attempted standup) as \\"raunchy and hilarious,\\" when in fact it's neither. There's a very, very big difference between \\"raunchy\\" and \\"obscenity for obscenity's sake.\\" I've never been one to use the old saw about using profanity when you have nothing better to say, but it really does seem to apply here. It's not in the least offensive or shocking (or even amusing, as \\"raunchy\\" would tend to imply)m it's just there, taking up space, as if Aschenbrand had a word quota and couldn't find another way to fill it up. As for the humor part, I'm going to guess that some of this is wildly funny if you've been up all night drinking cheap tequila and telling dead baby jokes, but in the cold light of sobriety, I kept waiting for a single chuckle.

And it has nothing whatsoever to do with Skidmore, so I will leave the reference at that.<br /><br />Our story: a small town in the middle of nowhere suddenly finds itself cut off completely from the rest of society-- a society that may, in fact, no longer even be in existence. The book chronicles the first year of their lives after the rest of the world vanishes.<br /><br />I half-expected either a weird science-fiction kind of thing or horrid environmentalist message-poetry pap. I got neither, which is a very good thing. Case was interested solely in exploring the relationships between the characters and how they would react to suddenly having to fend for themselves. That's the good part.<br /><br />The bad parts come in both the composition of the thing and in Case trying to cram far too much into one short book. The former is a matter mostly of mechanics; every once in a while lines rhyme, which in a book-length unrhymed poem stands out like a sore thumb, and she has a distressing tendency to repeat words in a way that grates on the nerve endings like nobody's business. The latter has to do with characterization; the amount of writing she's got here simply isn't enough to give her characters depth, and so we find ourselves not really caring as much about the people involved in the situation as we do about the situation itself. Case even throws in a few \\"kill me\\" characters who never get mentioned except during a flu epidemic. Not only is their only purpose to expire like coeds in a slasher flick, but they don't even show up in the pages prior to their expiration.<br /><br />It's interesting, for what it is, but it's certainly not going to supplant the book-length poems we know and love in the canon.

Lance Humble and Clark Cooper, The World's Greatest Blackjack Book (revised edition) (Broadway Books, 1980)<br /><br />The problem with the classic in the genre, Edward Thorp's Beat the Dealer, is that it's simply too complex for English majors like me to figure out. If you don't have a head for numbers, trying to put Thorp's work into practice is liable to send you to the nuthatch for long stretches of time. Humble and Cooper, after a good deal of expository prose (most of which is long, long out of date-- much of it, they surmise at various times, was probably out of date by the time the book rolled off the press), introduce first a basic non-counting system, then build on that to introduce the Hi-Opt (High Optimization) counting system. As it's a gradual process, it's already easier for boneheads like me to make sense out of. It does get complicated towards the end, of course, but as you're learning it in steps, things certainly seem a good deal easier. Besides, the big fad these days is Texas Hold 'Em, so you might actually be able to find a seat at the blackjack tables for once (or, better yet, at a no-dealer game administered by machine, where you can range your bets without a pit boss getting after you). The expository prose may be outdated, but the system is a \\"now more than ever\\" kind of thing. *** ½	2005-09-29

Dale Bailey, The Fallen (Signet, 2002)<br /><br />I've now read all three of Bailey's full-length fiction releases (two of them novels, one a book of short stories), and I have to say that this one, the first of them, is the weakest. Putting a positive spin on it, boy got real good real fast-- House of Bones is a whipcrack of a novel, and if you want to get hooked on Bailey, that'll do it.<br /><br />Not to say The Fallen is a bad book by any means, it just seems as if the ground's been trod a tad often. Which is interesting, given that House of Bones takes one of the oldest plots in the world, the haunted house novel, and makes it fresh and exciting. (It likely also doesn't help that the cover of The Fallen pretty much gives away the big reveal at the end.)<br /><br />The devil in the details, though, has been Bailey's from the start. His name choices are wonderful, almost Dickensian in their combined whimsy and appropriateness, and he's great at stringing the reader along. Perhaps it's better to think of The Fallen not as your typical horror novel, but as a tragedy; \\"predictable\\" doesn't enter into it that way, because you've already got the plot laid out for you and have since you first read Sophocles. Bailey puts some twists on it, though, and gives it a modern feel.<br /><br />A good debut, but save it till last if you're working your way through Bailey's fiction writing. *** ½	2005-09-29

Serge Bramly and Bettina Rheims, INRI (Monacelli, 1998)<br /><br />It has long been a truism that some of the world's most spiritual works are those most held up to persecution, ridicule, and other types of snubbing by those who believe themselves to be the moral guardians of the earth's souls. Take, for example, Scorsese's adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' wonderful book The Last Temptation of Christ. Once you got past Harvey Keitel's Brooklyn accent popping up in Jerusalem, it was a fantastic movie. It may also be the most protested movie ever made (mostly by those, naturally, who would never consider soiling their souls by actually seeing it).<br /><br />I've no idea whether anyone's challenged INRI yet, but if not, it's probably because of the book's limited American release (and prohibitive price tag). After all, what good old-fashioned upstanding guardian of the moral cloth could possibly allow all us unwashed heathen to look at pictures that pair a retelling of the story of Jesus Christ with-- gasp, cough, choke-- nudity? Perish the thought!<br /><br />Let's face it, folks. The accounts we have of Jesus' life have him going among prostitutes to spread the word. One doesn't usually hang out with hookers without seeing a few things. And, of course, Jesus was born before the days of baby formula, so it stands to reason that Mary nursed him. (In fact, one of the book's quotes speaks of Mary's \\"miraculous milk.\\") Nursing blouses weren't exactly in the height of fashion back in the day, either. And when it comes right down to it, are we all that certain that the world simply didn't have our hangups with various parts of the human body? One imagines a latter-day Matthew describing some right-wing zealot protestors, upon seeing (or, I should add as I am writing this during Banned Books Week, even hearing one described in some books) a breast now and again as \\"falling to the ground, possessed by a host of devils.\\" Perhaps the second coming really is a good idea.<br /><br />But I digress. INRI is, at its heart, a profoundly spiritual document. The story of Jesus, as presented to us in the gospels (the book seems to slightly favor Luke, but draws from all four), is presented in somewhat more modern language, but is still a faithful retelling, though it tends to touch mostly on highlights. The pictures are an interpretation of that story, just as any pictures that we are aware of today of Jesus, Mary, the apostles, etc. are. They didn't have Polaroids back in the day, neither.<br /><br />Every once in a while I pick something up assuming I'm going to be amused, or at best outraged. The ubiquity of the stories of organized religion has caused me to forget that, at one time, they were profoundly moving, and spoke to people on a level most of us have long forgotten. In those rare times, I forget to mock the basic impossibilities of whatever faith happens to be in question (for I am an equal-opportunity cynic when it comes to Western religion) and think that perhaps, for a moment, I have caught a glimpse of understanding of what a given religion's first adherents must have felt. INRI is one of the few books to have ever given me that feeling. It is, simply, beautiful. **** ½<br /> <br />But I digress. INRI is, at its heart, a profoundly spiritual document.

Other than that, you really don't need to know anything other than that the book was written by John Hollander; if you're familiar with the man's work, you know what to expect already-- wordplay, a touch of erotic scurrilousness, diction that feels just the slightest bit archaic, but in such a way that you can still imagine someone (someone erudite, anyway) actually talking like this.

Steven Crist, Betting on Myself: Adventures of a Horseplayer and Publisher (DRF Press, 2004)<br /><br />Crist's surprisingly readable \\"my life thus far\\" autobiography is probably stuck with a built-in limit to the numbers of readers who are going to be intrigued by it. This is a mistake not by Crist, but by those readers who don't think they're going to like a \\"horse book.\\"<br /><br />Crist traces the path he took from his years at Harvard, when he first discovered greyhound racing, to his present position as the owner of the Daily Racing Form. In between there's a lot of other fun stuff to interest both the horseplayer and the general reading audience: a stint with the New York Times, various discussions of economics (as it pertains to horse racing, granted, but money is money), the political scene in Albany, and all the other good stuff a dirt-dishing autobiography is supposed to have. (Kitty Kelley readers, however, will be depressed to note that Crist has been married to the same woman since Methuselah was a pup, and if there's any steppin' out involved, it never gets mentioned. Which may explain why Crist, and not Kelley, wrote this book.) It's also exceptionally readable for non-fiction, and a lot of fun in the bargain. A lot of fun. ****	2005-09-29

Until, that is, you find yourself faced with someone suffering from Clear Rice Sickness. Then, of course, you will find this book invaluable.<br /><br />It helps somewhat that this time round, the esteemed Dr. Lambshead, now at the spry old age of 103 (as of this edition), has combed the planet for some of the finest talents in the medical profession. Such luminaries as K. J. Bishop, Jeffrey Thomas, Neil Gaiman, and many others have contributed their expensive medical knowledge to this volume. He even goes outside the bounds of the medical profession every once in a while, for example in the cast of the Right Rev. Michael Moorcock; one would think that perhaps a man of the cloth wouldn't have much to contribute to a medical volume, but you'd be surprised.<br /><br />If there is a problem with the newest version of the guide, it is to be found in the environment itself. There are so many eccentric diseases around these days (very few, surprisingly, are discredited; doesn't everyone know by now that Twentieth-Century Chronoshock is nothing more than a bad hangover?) that it sometimes seems that the enterprising young physician with an open mind will be paging through the blasted thing for years, if not decades, trying to figure out what's wrong with his patient. During which time, naturally, the patient might expire. Imagine, if you will, the good doctor's chagrin upon running into the patient's house with the proper tincture and finding the patient had been buried six months previous.<br /><br />Still, an invaluable asset that belongs on the shelf of any good physician. If yours does not keep a copy of the Guide handy, you'd best go find yourself one who does, or risk the most severe of consequences. ***	2005-09-29

Miller has the noir script down pat, and he plays it to the hilt every time.<br /><br />This one's rather short, as Sin City novels go (a slight 126 pages), and brings back the much-beloved team of Dwight and Miho. As expected, there's a lot of shooting, a lot of tough guys being sexist (and then being shown the error of their ways in the next panel), and a lot of Dwight, perhaps the series' most cerebral character, mulling over the various things he's doing while doing them. Not that any of his internal conversations ever stop him from pulling a trigger on a bad guy or anything.<br /><br />Looks as if this one's going to be in the second Sin City film (slated for release in July of 2006), as Devon Aoki and Clive Owen are both signed on for the sequel (and Clive Owen couldn't really play Dwight in the first half of A Dame to Kill For, could he now?).

Meimu, Birthday (Dark Horse, 2004)<br /><br />Birthday, known in its film incarnation as Ring 0, is exactly what the film title would lead one to expect: a prequel to Ring. It's told in three interconnected short stories,that focus on Sadako (if you have somehow not yet found yourself involved some way in the Ring trilogy, read the first novel, or watch the first film; you'll get up to speed pretty quickly. Note: Ring Two is an \\"offshoot,\\" not the actual sequel [that's Spiral, the film version of which was called Rasen and has not been remade in America as of this writing], and so you may get thrown off track if you think of it as canon).<br /><br />I can't really call Birthday bad, per se, but am more than willing to entertain the idea that I'm not doing so because I have a fondness for Koji Suzuki's wonderful novels and Hideo Nakata's film versions. What Birthday is is more disjointed. It's hard, despite the presence of Sadako, to figure out exactly how it all fits in some pieces of the story (not to mention how we get from point A to point B; where does the title [and last frame] of \\"Lemon Heart\\" come from, anyway?). There are enough events from Ring here (told, of course, from different points of view) for us to get an anchor, but the boat itself is being battered by constantly-shifting winds.<br /><br />Still, it's not a bad little book. The impressionist feel of the delivery, while sure to alienate those who like their stories straightforward, does give the whole thing a creepy sensation, and the stuff that comes at you from out of the blue (like that whole \\"lemon heart\\" thing) can be unsettling, as long as it doesn't completely jar you out of the story.<br /><br />For Ring fanatics only, but will be a valuable addition to the completist's collection. ***	2005-09-29

Neil Gaiman, Sandman: A Season of Mists (DC Comics, 1992)<br /><br />There are many of my acquaintance, and many I've read (including Steve Erickson, who wrote the intro to the third Sandman volume), who believe that A Season of Mists is the crowning achievement in the Sandman series. I am not one of them; I think Dream Country is a tad better. A tad, mind you; A Season of Mists is a lovely thing as well, and like all of Gaiman's graphic-novel output, deserves to be read.<br /><br />This fourth book is where Gaiman really breaks Sandman away from its horror-comic roots and turns it into the kind of twisted-fantasy thing it is ultimately remembered as. A pretty odd statement for a book that deals with Morpheus going to hell to fight Lucifer for a soul he condemned ten thousand years before, but there you go. Here, for the first time, we meet most of the Endless (one is still elusive), we see a (temporary? We don't yet know) change of heart for Lucifer, learn more about some of the other pantheon's in Gaiman's universe (and are introduced to others), and get some interesting clues about the land of Dream itself.<br /><br />If you've followed the Sandman series this far, you will definitely enjoy this one. If you haven't, either start at the beginning or star with Dream Country, the third book in the series, but not related to the overall storyline (and thus it can stand alone). ****	2005-09-15

Tom Piccirilli, A Lower Deep (Leisure, 2001)<br /><br />Tom Piccirilli may be one of the most overlooked writers of the last decade. His books, which have appeared in almost every genre there is in which to write, have the rare distinction of being character-driven novels that have the pacing and readability of plot-driven novels, as well as being intricately detailed without the introductions of those details getting in the way of Piccirilli telling a good story. While writing short stories seems to have made up the bulk of the first decade of Piccirilli's published career-- from 1990 through 1999, he published only four novels, according to fantasticfiction's bibliography-- he has more than made up for it since, having already published twice that many since the dawn of the new century. I haven't yet read any of his previous-to-2000 output, but the new stuff is good-- really, really good.<br /><br />A Lower Deep, published in 2001, was the book that set Piccirilli on the path to where he is today; it was the transition between \\"guy only hardcore horror lovers have ever heard of\\" (Greg Gifune is a current example) and \\"guy with enough of a following and enough talent to get signed by a mid-tier press\\" (Charlee Jacob is a current example). (It was not too long a time before Piccirilli hit stage three, \\"released by a major publisher;\\" his inarguably brilliant A Choir of Ill Children began his still-standing relationship with Bantam. He is long overdue to reach the terminal stage, \\"household name.\\") I've read the novel that came just before this, and while that one's good, there's a long, long way between \\"good\\" and A Lower Deep.<br /><br />The focuses of A Lower Deep is a character we know only as Necromancer (he does have another name, but we are never told it) and his demon familiar Self. Necromancer was part of a coven of witches headed by Jebediah DeLancre, dabbler in the occult and descendant of a family known for having sired some of the most vicious witch-burners in Medieval Europe. Ten years before our story opens, Jebediah and Necromancer were the only two survivors of something horrible (while Piccirilli does give us some details later on, we never see the full picture) which destroyed their coven. Necromancer, who lost the woman he loved in the disaster, has been wandering aimlessly for the ensuing decade. Now, however, a chance encounter with a beautiful woman in a dive bar sets him back on the path to Jebediah, who with growing age and insanity has come up with a plan which requires Necromancer's help, but one so much more dangerous than the last disaster that even the immortal Self is wary.<br /><br />The plot, however, is secondary. It could have been left out altogether, and this would still be excellent writing.

Ten years before our story opens, Jebediah and Necromancer were the only two survivors of something horrible (while Piccirilli does give us some details later on, we never see the full picture) which destroyed their coven. Necromancer, who lost the woman he loved in the disaster, has been wandering aimlessly for the ensuing decade. Now, however, a chance encounter with a beautiful woman in a dive bar sets him back on the path to Jebediah, who with growing age and insanity has come up with a plan which requires Necromancer's help, but one so much more dangerous than the last disaster that even the immortal Self is wary. <br /> <br />The plot, however, is secondary.

Julie Kaewert, Unsolicited (Crimeline, 2000)<br /><br />Julie Kaewert's Booklovers mysteries took a while to make it to this side of the pond, but I am one of a growing number who are glad they finally made it, even if they did take so long. Unsolicited, the first of them, spends (as do most first-in-a-series books) a bit much time introducing us to characters and their complex relationships, but that rarely gets in the way of a cracking mystery.<br /><br />While it's inaccurate to call this a cozy (the narrator is threatened with death a bit often for that), \\"hardboiled\\" is about the last word one would use to describe Alex Plumtree, the book's hero. He's thin, bespectacled, quite bookish (which shouldn't be surprising, given that he runs Plumtree Press), and an amateur at the whole roughing-people-up thing, to be sure. However, he finds himself forced into it when, at a press party, he narrowly dodges a huge roll of printing paper that comes crashing down from a ceiling, narrowly missing him and killing a friend of his who happens to be a noted book critic. Alex has himself a murder to solve, but things, of course, get far more complex when Alex begins to suspect that the critic's murder has to do with the next book coming from Plumtree Press, the sequel to a runaway bestselling novel by an author so anonymous even Alex has no idea who he is. Add to this his longtime and continually frustrating relationship with an American investment banker, and you've got the makings for a fun mystery.<br /><br />It does its job quite well (though in the end we find ourselves with the Least Likely Suspect rule hanging over our heads, proving once again that the journey is often more fun than the destination). There's some prose, especially towards the beginning, that probably could have done with a bit of stripping and sanding; the book's pace gets bogged down a few too many times in the particulars. Once it gets going, however, and finds its pace, there's quite a neat little mystery here. Fans of other authors who spend their time mooning over books will find this right up their alley. *** ½tle mystery here.

Vaughan, Y: The Last Man: Safeword (DC Comics, 2004)<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Y: The Last Man has been good so far-- straightforward action-adventure with an unlikely hero. Sounds like a Hollywood action flick, doesn't it? Well, yeah. Turn your brain off and have a good time. Safeword, however, blasts Y out of the good and into the stratospheric.<br /><br />One thing I'm noticing about the graphic novels I'm encountering that are truly excellent-- Preacher, Sandman, Bone, Watchmen, etc.-- is that the story goes off in directions you'd never expect, and yet it all manages to tie in without seeming overly artificial. (Well, okay, you suspended disbelief from the first few panels, but it all makes internal sense anyway.) At the beginning of this episode, the unlikely hero, Yorick, is delivered into the hands of one of 355's old workmates for safekeeping while 355 and Dr. Mann head off into Denver to get some antibiotics for Ampersand, who's developed an infection. All seems to be going well, until... well, basically, saying anything about this episode is a spoiler. Trust me, though, it's worth it.<br /><br />It almost seems as if, somewhere between books three and four, Vaughan grew up. Don't get me wrong, inane jokes still abound, but where the other books have overall had an action-movie tone of juvenile humor about one man on earth with three billion women, Safeword develops a tone from the get-go far more intimate than its predecessors. You care about the characters more by the time you've finished the first chapter than you have before, and that makes all the difference.<br /><br />If Vaughan continues at this clip, this will rival Watchmen and Preacher as one of the best out there. ****	2005-09-15

Matthew Zapruder, American Linden (Tupelo, 2002)<br /><br />One of the drawbacks of having rooms full of books waiting for you to read them (and it's even worse if you have a library card and wide-ranging tastes) is that once in a while you hear good things about a book right after it comes out, put it on the list of \\"hmm, I should read that some day,\\" and then promptly forget about it for three years. This is exactly what happened to me with Figments guitarist Matthew Zapruder's American Linden, and I'm kicking myself for not having just gone out and found a copy as soon as I heard good press about it.<br /><br />Zapruder's work is the kind of stuff you read simply for the pleasure of hearing the words flow by in your head.<br /><br />\\"Where I inspect myself<br /><br />for a black and white cat<br /><br />who hides my sluggishness from inspectors.<br /><br />His name is Joselito.\\"<br /><br />(\\"Park Slope\\")<br /><br />There is a great deal of depth and definition to Zapruder's word choices; so many of these poems work so well that it's extremely difficult to find fault with a single word. (One wonders how much of this was workshopped or criticized by outside sources; one suspects the answer is \\"none of it.\\") It's work that says its piece and gets out, though you'll likely be left pondering what, exactly, that piece might be.<br /><br />In an age where it seems anyone with a connection to other media are pumping out books of poetry to no end (viz. recent howlingly bad collections by Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Carter, Jewel, Ally Sheedy, etc. etc. ad nauseam), it's nice to find someone who can work this well in both genres.

Kate DiCamillo, Because of Winn-Dixie (Candlewick, 2000)<br /><br />My sister-in-law (who is ten) picked this up at Borders one day last week, and while she, my wife, and my daughter were off shopping, I picked it up. I had it finished by the time sister-in-law left that evening; it's a very quick read.<br /><br />Like most people, I guess, I assumed that the book (and the rather successful, if released to mixed reviews, movie based upon it) was about the grocery store chain, and wondered to what depths corporate America wouldn't sink. What a pleasant surprise to find out Winn-Dixie is actually a dog (named after the grocery store chain, so I'm still wondering about corporations and depths, but at least they were half-subtle about it if there's a marketing conspiracy to be had here). The story concerns Opal, a new girl in town, who adopts a stray dog after he gets inside a Winn-Dixie supermarket where she's doing some shopping. The dog, being a naturally affectionate sort, helps her get socialized in her new situation.<br /><br />It's a simple story, aimed at the 9-12 crowd, and wonderfully written. DiCamillo conveys the characters' emotions without beating us over the head with them, and so crafts a far more powerful tale than most in this genre. Highly recommended. **** ½	2005-09-12

If you haven't yet come to the world of graphic novels, this is a great place to start; even the toughest critics of graphic novels, I should think, would be hard-pressed to deny the emotional power of this little tale (and it certainly puts to bed the idea that all comics are for kids). **** ½	2005-09-12

Michael Paine, Steel Ghosts (Berkley, 2005)<br /><br />Michael Paine is quite the enigma. He wrote three novels in the late eighties and early nineties (only one of which, Owl Light, I've been able to track down; a fine book it is, too), then dropped out of sight for almost fifteen years. Earlier this year, Paine showed up on bookshelves again with Steel Ghosts. And let me tell you, folks, it's been well worth the wait.<br /><br />Steel Ghosts centers around Steadbridge, Pennsylvania, a dead steel town that just hasn't realized its demise. Its factory, Number Five, shut down ten years before, and there was a mass exodus of populace. The town now has a skeleton crew keeping it alive, and their main form of entertainment is drinking away their relief checks. Tom Kruvener, who grew up in Steadbridge, mentions offhand in a meeting at Overbrook, the firm he works for, that Number Five would probably make a great tax write-off if they bought it, demolished it, and put up a movie studio there. Despite having sworn to never set foot in Steadbridge again, he finds himself heading back to scout locations for a Z-grade horror flick (titled, amusingly, The Colors of Hell-- the name of one of Paine's older novels) at the behest of his superiors.<br /><br />Steel Ghosts is your classic haunted-house tale, but it's far more than that, as well. Tom and his old friends Ruth and Bill spend a lot of time mulling over the old saw \\"you can't go home again,\\" and Paine adds another layer to the discussion by not only having the town, but Tom's old friends, change remarkably in his absence as well. It's almost as if he's penned a coming-of-age tale where the actual coming-of-age took place offscreen, and the characters are musing on how and why it all happened. There's also a subtext about the death of the Pennsylvania steel industry.<br /><br />All this, of course, plays second fiddle (as it well should) to the simple ghost story that overlies it all, and it is at the simple ghost story that Paine excels. Steel Ghosts is the kind of horror novel that you'll go back to years later because you still remember a random piece of scenery and feel the sudden need to re-read the book. I have little doubt that the second (and third, and fourth) time I read this, it'll be just as good. Welcome back, Mr. Paine, we have missed you. **** ½story that Paine excels.

Neil Gaiman, Sandman: Dream Country (DC Comics, 1991)<br /><br />Steve Erickson, in his prologue to this third installment in the Sandman series, says he really revs things up in book four. I'd have to disagree; having read both (in fact, I finished the fourth book in the series the night before writing this review), it seems to me that Dream Country is, by a hair, the better of the two books.<br /><br />Dream Country takes us away from the main storyline of the Sandman tales a bit and gives us four stories that tangentially touch on Morpheus himself (plus a script for the first of them, which is a great behind-the-scenes look at how one of these things gets made). \\"Calliope\\" starts things off on a rather ugly note, the story of a one-hit novelist who's desperate for another book. Through an acquaintance, he comes into possession of the muse Calliope. \\"A Dream of a Thousand Cats\\" is the second, and the name pretty much tells you all you need to know. \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" which won the World Fantasy Award (giving, according to Harlan Ellison in the introduction to volume 4, a number of fantasy and sci-fi writers something approaching apoplexy), tells the story of how the Kingdom of Faerie is invited to a performance of a new William Shakespeare play; \\"Facades,\\" in which the Dream king doesn't even make an appearance, is about what happens to superheroes once they retire.<br /><br />What Gaiman has created here is more than just a graphic novel (actually, collection of graphic short stories). These contain some of Gaiman's finest work in any genre; it's easily the equivalent of American Gods or Coraline. If you're a Gaiman fan and have not yet been exposed to the Sandman books, even if you don't plan to read the rest of the series, read this. **** ½	2005-09-12

Unfortunately, what brought about a renaissance in interest in Laymon was not the current horror boom so much as Laymon's untimely demise in 2001. (Not like one of his victims-- erm, characters-- did, though, which I'm sure he'd have preferred.) Leisure have been releasing manuscripts he completed before his death, as well as re-releasing some of his older titles, and he's quickly gaining the hardcore-fan readership in his native country he's long enjoyed in others. There is no doubt in my mind that In the Dark will do nothing but continue the growth of that readership.<br /><br />Librarian Jane Kerry is closing up for the night when she finds an envelope on her chair. In it is a fifty-dollar bill and a cryptic note. She figures out the (relatively easy, as it's supposed to be) clue and goes to find what she hopes will be a second envelope. On the way there, she runs into Brace, a university professor who's stayed past closing unintentionally; together, they discover the second envelope and another cryptic note. Jane soon finds herself torn between Brace, who obviously cares about her, and following the whims of the man she knows only as MOG, the Master of Games.<br /><br />In the Dark is quite unlike many of the Laymon novels I've read in that it's not a straight horror tale. His older novels are very much in the proto-splatterpunk tradition, deliciously gory romps through horrific landscapes produced by one of the truly twisted imaginations to inhabit our planet. In the Dark, however, is 90% straight thriller (the other 10% can't be mentioned here, as it would be the biggest of spoilers), and Laymon delivers the goods with an exceptionally rapid punch. While the novel tops half a thousand pages, Laymon starts off at breakneck speed and only gets faster, while his writing style, which is never anything less than utterly compelling, keeps the pages turning at a record pace. While there's not quite as much constant action as the benchmark for record-pace-setting books (Douglas A. Winter's Run), you won't notice a lull; Laymon keeps you moving right along even through the times when Jane's being introspective.<br /><br />The book's only real letdown is its climax. It's a thriller, so you rather expect what's coming, but the final revelation seems like something of a cop-out when Laymon has spent so much time building up the rather obvious suspects for MOG's big reveal. Still, unlike many books where the anticipation leads to a dud payoff, here the journey is so much fun that the final few pages of \\"oh, please\\" don't seem nearly as silly as they otherwise would.<br /><br />A truly fun novel. It's not going to go down in history as one of Laymon's best, but it certainly gets the job done. ****e novel tops half a thousand pages, Laymon starts off at breakneck speed and only gets faster, while his writing style, which is never anything less than utterly compelling, keeps the pages turning at a record pace.

Jhonen Vasquez, JTHM: Director's Cut (Slave Labor Graphics, 1997)<br /><br />Does anyone remember little Johnny any more? Vasquez gained much acclaim (and respect) for being the brain behind the cartoon Invader Zim in the late nineties, but before Zim, there were Johnny, Squee, and the rest of the cast of this thoroughly twisted comic.<br /><br />Covering the first seven issues of the comic book and a good deal of unreleased material, JTHM: Director's Cut both is and is not, in ways, an actual graphic novel. There is a full story arc to be found here, but the way we get from point A to point B is extremely disjointed. Which actually fits in quite well with the art, which is also exceptionally disjointed, and Johnny's speeches, which are... you get the idea. And thus the book's major flaw-- Johnny and his compatriots on his journey through life are not your typical comic book inhabitants. In many ways, that's a wonderful thing. (Who would read Archie and Veronica, Natural Born Killers?) But Johnny has a tendency to spend large numbers of panels at once going off on long diversions that, given the font of the lettering, tend to be hard to read. Conundrum: there's really nothing one can change, because Vasquez' visual concepts are so well married to the material that I have to think a change to a more readable (or larger) font wouldn't have given the work the same ambiance the work presently has.<br /><br />Still, speechifying aside (and let me rush to add that it's not annoying political speechifying, it's Johnny turning his examination inward), this is great stuff. Extremely inappropriate for anyone under the age of 18, so buy as many copies as you can and give them to all your nieces, nephews, neighbors, and all the rest of the little tots who can greatly benefit. *** ½	2005-09-12

The worst thing I can say about it is that it will still lead you to the poorhouse, give you a hearty handshake, and send you off packing inside.<br /><br />Great Betting Systems seems to be a collection of Dash's newspaper articles. If so, this might be seen as a book whose content was aimed mostly at the crowd who were going to the track more as an alternative to, say, dinner and a movie, and thus expected to drop about the same amount of money. If that's the case, Dash's systems (which also include roulette and dice systems, which I've not yet run through the simulator; the popular wisdom that there's no winning craps system, however, is likely to apply given the quality of the horse racing systems here) can be seen as a handbook for a harmless pastime for those looking to spend roughly $30 while watching a pack of majestic animals flying around an oval track. And those people are wonderful. We love them. They deserve a book. Anyone who were to take one of these systems as a serious handicapping tool, though, most probably lost a bundle.

Thankfully, though, my mother is both a mystery fan and rather well-traveled, so I sometimes pick up a name here and there to check out. The most recent of these was Kate Ellis. I managed to track down an import copy of The Plague Maiden and got to reading.<br /><br />As far as mysteries go, it's good stuff. Ellis' books (all of them, according to her website) combine a contemporary murder mystery with an historical event which also includes a murder mystery. Nice, that. After all, mystery novel detectives are usually working on two cases at once, anyway (and yet somehow can never figure out how they go together until the last fifty pages; figure that out for me, will you?). Why not set one four hundred years ago?<br /><br />In this eighth installment, Detective Wesley Peterson has himself a nasty case of threatening; the manager of the local Huntings supermarket has received a threat. When it pans out, things start getting ugly. At the same time, Wesley's mate Neil is on an archaeological dig at a plague pit where a new Huntings is slated to go up, and finds a couple of skeletons who look rather like they didn't die of anything carried by fleas.<br /><br />Ellis is quite good at integrating the history lessons into the storyline, something all too many authors fail miserably at, which makes The Plague Maiden a much easier read than one might expect, given that the author is going to be forced to do some explication for those of us not up on South Devon during the Black Plague. (How much of what's here is true, of course, I've no idea for that very reason; even if it's fabricated, the point is that it's well-meshed with the story.) The book is quite readable, and there are enough unexpected twists and turns to keep most mystery fans guessing.

James Morrow, This Is the Way the World Ends (Henry Holt, 1986)<br /><br />There's a pretty good premise here. Nostradamus is visited by a lad whose mother is being seen in the doctors' office downstairs just as Nostro is working on a new invention to help him spread the word a bit more. To explain what they boy's seeing, he tells the boy the story of the end of the world. The end of the world involves a whole lot of nuclear missiles, a race called the unadmitted, and a gravestone carver from New England.<br /><br />I think Morrow was going for comedy here; there are certainly a few amusing passages. The problem is that the comedy so often gets subsumed under Morrow's anti-nuclear message, which is delivered with all the subtlety of a Mack truck hitting a kid on a bicycle at full speed, that any humor value is pretty quickly lost. The book comes out sounding, not surprisingly, like a whole lot of other anti-nuclear-war material (I kept thinking of it as a failed attempt at a cross between Slaughterhouse-Five and Dr. Strangelove, and lamenting that Morrow hadn't chosen more worthy anti-nuclear fare to base his screed on; imagine a combination of, say, On the Beach and Threads!) that's overbearing and has little value outside delivering its message.<br /><br />Still, there are times when it's readable, and it does contain a thread of amusement, so it doesn't fall to the bottom of the ratings basement. **	2005-09-08

Natsuki Takaya, Fruits Basket vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 2000)<br /><br />Ah, the wonders of Engrish grammar. How can you not be intrigued by something called Fruits Basket? Especially when you think about the number of translators and proofreaders it probably came through to get to the publication stage. And yet, the plural of \\"fruit\\" still, somehow, retained an incorrect s.<br /><br />Okay, so the story begins with Tohru. Tohru is an orphan. She's been living in a tent ni the woods while saving up money. She's discovered by the owner of the property on which her tent sits, and after a whole bunch of panels, invited to live with him and his two brothers (one of whom is a classmate of Tohru's) at their place as general housekeeper/cook/what-have-you. All well and good, except for that pesky family curse: when any of the brothers (or other family members) is embraced by a member of the opposite sex who's not a part of the family, they turn into creatures from the Chinese zodiac. (Speculation about generations of inbreeding ensues.)<br /><br />Putting aside the general Deliverance-ness of where the story could go, the biggest problem this first installment in the long-running series has is that it starts off confusing. Part of the problem is that the three brothers are almost indistinguishable from one another, but more perplexing is the setup of the storyline. This, however, goes away by (roughly) the beginning of what was originally issue 3, so there's still more than enough time once you've figured everything out to get involved with the story.<br /><br />It's cute, and interesting enough that I've got vol. 2 on hold from the library, but beware of some confusing moments at the beginning. ***	2005-09-08

Michael Slade, Death's Door (Cemetery Dance, 2003)<br /><br />Since Headhunter, the team pseudonymously known as Michael Slade have been cranking out thrillers that sit about as far out on the bleeding edge as thrillers get (you can find a bit more gore in the horror genre if you know where to look, but not by much). Death's Door continues the tradition. In this one, Special X (Special External Operations, a branch of the Mounties well-known to readers of Slade's novels) get sucked into investigating the discoveries of horribly mutilated bodies turning up on Canada's western shore. If you've read any of the series' recent novels, you've probably got a good idea of what's coming.<br /><br />Slade writes fast-moving novels that work like quick punches to the gut; the thriller reader with a taste for the perverse will find much between the covers to satisfy. ***	2005-09-08

Elizabeth Kostova, The Historian (Little, Brown, 2005)<br /><br />here have been a spate of articles recently bemoaning the publishing industry's lack of a Great American Novel this year. I don't know what the writers are thinking, as The Historian pretty much fits the definition. This is a novel that won awards before it was even completed. Kostova's advance was a sum staggering even in this day and age. It firmly qualifies for doorstop status, weighing in at a hefty 656 pages, and Kostova's author photo is definitely of the \\"let's play up the author's sexiness\\" angle that's becoming more common these days. Really, what more could they ask for?<br /><br />But when all's said and done, what's going to be remembered in the next decade, perhaps the next century, is none of these things; people will wonder about the content of the book. Is it a good read? I'll answer that with something of a qualified yes.<br /><br />It seems somewhat ironic to me that The DaVinci Code turned years of good marketing practice on its head. Usually, something gets big (e.g., goth/industrial in the wake of Nine Inch Nails' smash success), all the majors jump on it, and what we end up with is a morass of material that shares surface characteristics, but isn't nearly as accomplished. (E.g., everything Nine Inch Nails released after 1996, plus a slew of Trent wannabes with no more writing skills than, say, Jessica Simpson.) Then Dan Brown got big, the majors did their thing, and what did we end up with? A whole lot of books that, for the most part, are far better than The DaVinci Code could ever possibly be. The Historian qualifies, for the most part, but there are a few structural flaws you should probably be aware of.<br /><br />The story itself is quite nicely done; in three time periods, interlinked by the main characters, Kostova traces three generations of historians searching for the truth behind the Dracula myth. Ah, I hear fans of seventies fiction saying, a generational saga! And you're right. Unfortunately, you're not completely right; this is Kane and Abel with added supernatural suspense. Which, of course, can be done well, which is why Barbara Michaels has legions of fans around the globe. And for the most part, it's done well here; Kostova's writing style is engaging enough that, if you don't look closely, you may not see the structural defects at all. Inveterate readers of suspense thrillers, though, will start noticing disturbing patterns about halfway through the book, and by the last hundred pages, you know exactly what you're going to get-- the elves open the door, discover the huge piles of treasure, and we cut away to a deodorant commercial. It's the oldest suspense-building trick in the book, and it stopped working well about the time deodorant commercials were invented. (And if you think you see a stock B-movie ending coming, congratulations, you just caught the gold ring.)<br /><br />Still, despite all that, Kostova writes with a solid sense of pace, and her writing is quite simply fun to read; she's obviously far more erudite than Dan Brown (though perhaps a step below someone like Palliser or Pears), and the writing is simply better than one would expect from what is, stripped to its bones, yet another vampire novel. It's a clever, and bold, attempt to do what very few authors have done: take a simple horror story and elevate it to the realm of literature. With a few changes, it would have succeeded marvelously. But Kostova gets an A for effort. *** ½! And you're right. Unfortunately, you're not completely right; this is Kane and Abel with added supernatural suspense.

Katherine Eban, Dangerous Doses: How Counterfeiters Are Contaminating America's Drug Supply (Harcourt, 2005)<br /><br />Have you ever taken a medication and felt no effect, or far less effect than you expected to have? Put it off to building up a tolerance? Yeah, me too. After reading this, however, I have to wonder.<br /><br />The four-hundred-odd pages of Dangerous Doses fly by rather quickly for a piece of nonfiction; Eban takes you inside the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the South Florida interdepartmental task force aimed at bringing down those who would tamper with America's drug supply for personal gain. What I (and, I'm sure, many other readers) didn't expect, though, is just how much work the Horsemen had (and still have, in many cases, as of this writing) ahead of them. It would seem that counterfeit prescription medication is not a few isolated cases here and there we hear on the news, but a very, very big business that has reached its tendrils into most every state in the Union and affects untold billions of dollars' worth of merchandise. (The book's biggest shock, for me, came when one of the drugs mentioned is one I actually take.)<br /><br />This is scary stuff. It's not just highly recommended because piece of nonfiction this readable are rare birds indeed, but because this is something you need to know about, especially if you or your family members take prescription drugs. Get it. Read it. ****	2005-09-08

Caroline Kettlewell, Skin Game (St. Martin's Press, 1999)<br /><br />In the few years since its release, Skin Game has taken on an almost iconic air. I'm not sure whether it was the first memoir focusing on cutting that appeared or not, but that seems to be the most likely explanation. One other possible explanation, the book's finest moments, are when Kettlewell is profiling herself during her cutting days; anyone who's ever been a cutter (or wanted to be one) is likely to recognize a few, or more, facets o his or her own personality in Kettlewell's own soul-searching.<br /><br />The bad part, however, is that the rest of the book has some problems. The biggest of these is its pace. Kettlewell has the idea of the hook down-- we open with her in a bathroom stall sawing away at her wrist with the dull saw blade from a Swiss army knife-- but then things start dragging, and for much of the rest of the book (which runs barely a hundred eighty pages, but often seems two or three times that), the pace remains pedestrian at best.<br /><br />There are certainly things to be gained from reading Skin Game, but don't go in expecting one of the breezy, easy-to-read memoirs that have become so popular in the past few years. ***	2005-09-08

Neil Gaiman, Sandman: The Doll's House (DC Comics, 1995)<br /><br />The second book in the ten-book Sandman series is a dramatic improvement over the first, as promised by Gaiman's afterword to Preludes and Nocturnes. Where that one contained flashes of the brilliance Gaiman would later unveil in American Gods, this one pretty much goes whole hog in the brilliance department.<br /><br />Where the first book was standard plot (right out of Malory, really) in relatively standard setting, The Doll's House is fairly standard plot (Sandman must neutralize a threat to the kingdom in the form of a human girl who functions as a dream vortex), the setting is anything but standard; we meet more of the Endless, a number of murderers who make the first book's John Dee look like a walk in the park, escaped dream-creatures, a cereal convention in the middle of nowhere, and much, much more.<br /><br />The Sandman books are revered by thousands, if not millions; I'm starting to see why.

MaryJanice Davidson, Undead and Unappreciated (Berkeley, 2005)<br /><br />Somehow, reviewing Undead and Unappreciated just after The Historian was simply fated to be. You can't make this stuff up.<br /><br />If you've already read the first two, you don't need much of a synopsis. (If you haven't read them first.) Most things haven't changed-- Eric still wants Betsy, Betsy is still annoyed with Eric, Jess is still rich as Croesus, Mark is still gay, and Antonia is still a royal pain. Except that Antonia lets slip that Betsy has a half-sister. Who, Eric surmises, is the woman whom the Book of the Dead says is fated to rule the Earth, and happens to be the devil's daughter. (Like the idea that Antonia is Satan would surprise anyone who's read the first two books.)  That's enough story arc for at least the next three or four books in the series, right?<br /><br />These books pretty much define \\"empty calories.\\" They take roughly an afternoon apiece to read, have no redeeming social value (think about it: how would you feel if caught with one in public?), and will never, ever be featured by Oprah's book club. So why read them? Mostly because they're funny, even to those of us who wouldn't know a Manolo Blahnik from a blasting cap. And while Davidson has the stock romance formula down, there are a few places in this third installment in the series that she seems as if she's knocking on the walls, trying to figure out which of the weak spots she's going to tear through. That should be something to see.<br /><br />They're dumb, but they're great fun. ***	2005-09-08

Brad Smith, All Hat (Henry Holt, 2003)<br /><br />I've always rather thought of Henry Holt as a textbook publisher, but somewhere along the line they started publishing fiction. Every once in a while they pop up with a truly notable book, such as Bruce Olds' Raising Holy Hell or Kathe Koja's Kink. Well, now you can add Brad Smith's All Hat to the list.<br /><br />All Hat is a story about progress, when it comes right down to it. On the surface, it's about Ray Dokes, a Canadian cowboy who gets out of jail after doing two years of a five-year bit for assault (justified, of course, because Dokes is the story's protagonist). He gets out, of course, just as things are about to change in the three-miles-west-of-nothing where he and his acquaintances reside. Sonny Stanton, the guy Dokes assaulted, has been buying up all the area's farms, save that of Homer Parr, an old man with Alzheimer's whose daughter, Dokes' former girlfriend, won't sell. Stanton also has a horse good enough to go to the Breeders' Cup Classic, handled by a sour old trainer, a flashy good-for-nothing roustabout, and a quiet, industrious boy whom everyone thinks is a tad slow. There's also Dokes' sister, who sits and paints the same landscape over and over; Pete, Dokes' friend, boarder, and sometime employer, who wants nothing more than to go back to Texas; Chrissie, the loudmouthed but pretty jock who rides Pete's remaining thoroughbred in training; and a cast of minor characters just as full of vinegar. All of this, of course, has to change in any novel that's really about progress (well, with the quizzical exception of a few characters who seem incapable of changing; there's an interesting trend in who changes and who doesn't, but I don't want to spoil your fun).<br /><br />This is a fun little novel that got mostly overlooked when it originally came out. (It was recommended to me through the fraternity of racing fans, and god bless 'em, they were right.) Should be easily found in paperback these days; give it a look.

Karen Rose, Nothing to Fear (Warner, 2005)<br /><br />I can't remember what it was, a few months ago, that had me champing at the bit to read this book as soon as it came out. Must have been a really good press release. In any case, it spun around the back corners of my mind until it finally came out, and a copy showed up for me at the library not long after. I'd completely forgotten it was a romance. No, excuse me, a novel of romantic suspense.<br /><br />I'm not terribly sure what defines \\"romantic suspense\\" any more, but I'm guessing it's changed a whole lot from the days when Barbara Michaels laid Prince of Darkness on us all those years ago (and Dean Koontz was still writing gothics under a pen name). Nothing to Fear reads far more like a suspense thriller than it does a romance novel, unless you're in the middle of a sex scene. And even then, the writing has a far more distinct odor of an overly explicit Raymond Chandler than it does of dear, departed Dame Barbara. In fact, were I the acquisitions director at my library, I'd have dispensed with the idea of shelving this in romance altogether and found space for it wherever one keeps one's Rex Miller books.<br /><br />The premise here is the kind of thing I've always halfway wondered if we'd get a Lifetime Original Move about-- woman kidnaps deaf child from rich parents and, thanks to some duplicity, manages to hide in the best place one could under the circumstances-- a shelter for battered women. The very political incorrectness of the idea is shocking. I love it. Enter romantic hero, a ruggedly handsome security consultant who's pressed into service as an amateur PI because he served with the kid's dad's late brother in Afghanistan. There's a lot more to it than that, but you know enough to know that tensions are strained. You've got your basic plethora of cops, lawyers, accomplices, distraught parents, and dead bodies. Yep, if it walks like a mystery, eats like a mystery, and showers like a mystery...<br /><br />Even better, there's a decided lack of the kind of formulaic writing one finds in romance novels. It's been replaced with some of the formulaic writing one finds in genre mysteries, but you can't have everything. About the only vestige of the romance novel, aside from the sex scenes (which, I should note in passing, are certainly adequate enough to pass muster), is the frustrating inability of the hero and heroine to even think about communicating a couple of small points that would have made the book roughly half its size. One of these days, someone will write a love story about two people capable of talking to one another. It will be the best, and thinnest, romance ever written. Until then, you could do a lot worse then reading Karen Rose. *** ½<br /> <br />Even better, there's a decided lack of the kind of formulaic writing one finds in romance novels.

I still have no idea what's really going on behind the scenes in this book. All I know is that it is a profoundly powerful experience, and not to be missed.<br /><br />The story centers on Leo, an artist who (he tells his landlady, and others, early on in the book) found himself at an impasse in life and needed a change. Well, he certainly gets on here. His building is full of odd lots: a reclusive writer on the floor below him (one of whose novels provides the title for McKean's book), a philosophy-spouting jazz musician on the floor above, and a landlady who loves talking to pigeons. There are some other minor characters floating about, but those are the bunch you'll get to know best. There's also a cat who wanders around the building at will.<br /><br />How you decide to read this is pretty much up to you (as long as you read it. You will go read it immediately, won't you?). You can read it for the story itself, which is unfortunately a bit disjointed, and if you don't read a little deeper you'll find yourself holding some loose threads at the end that beg for a closer reading. You'll likely find yourself more satisfied with it if you read a few layers down, tracing the patterns of the lives of the characters and figuring out who's who and what everyone's representing. (McKean should be giving you just enough in the book's final chapter to get most of it figured out without exhaustive analysis.) There is also, and I didn't go this far, the opportunity to completely submerge yourself in the book's symbolism, figuring out the archetypes for every character in the book (mull on this: given the revelations about the cat in the end, what is one to make of the landlady and her endless talking to pigeons?). One could spend a great deal of time thinking about Cages, and it demands a great deal of thought.<br /><br />The only problem with this novel (and, graphic or no, this is one of the finest examples of the novel I have read this year in any form) is that it seems as if the surface layer suffered a bit in the final analysis. Things aren't quite as neatly wrapped as the should be to make this a perfect piece on every level (as they are in, say, Wendy Walker's The Secret Service or Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian). Still, that's an extremely minor point in the general scheme of things. I cannot recommend Cages highly enough. This will easily be finding a lot on my 25-Best list this year. **** ½his is one of the finest examples of the novel I have read this year in any form) is that it seems as if the surface layer suffered a bit in the final analysis.

Nina Laden, Roberto the Insect Architect (Chronicle, 2000)<br /><br />There's something to be said for reading childrens' picture books every now and again. Childrens' authors can't get away with as much as adult authors can; for one thing, they generally have less room in which to get away with it (unless they are J. K. Rowling or Clive Barker, the vanguards of the burgeoning \\"childrens' doorstop\\" movement); for another, kids have an innate crap detector adults seem to get rid of as they get older. Reading chidlrens' books is a good way of grounding yourself, if you've gotten stuck in a rut of overly wordy stuff.<br /><br />Roberto the Insect Architect is a fun one. (And note that a number of Amazon reviews of it have been posted by adults who own the book for themselves rather than their kids.) It's your basic \\"be yourself\\" kind of book, and reminds me in many ways of Randall Jarrell's brilliant The Bat-Poet. It's shorter, of course, being for a younger audience, and the points that are made are closer to the surface, but Laden still keeps things in hand by letting the story tell the story and giving visual cues that will make the reader of the intended age work (for example, Roberto's dream and its realization, which bookend the narrative in pictures instead of words).

Stephensen, 1930)<br /><br />I'm still trying to find the history on this; whether a lecture was actually planned and then later disallowed, written and then rejected as an appropriate lecture, or simply privately published and called \\"the banned lecture\\" in order to stir up interest. The last option would, I'm sure, have amused the old fraud to no end.<br /><br />This small (and now exceptionally rare) pamphlet does sound like a lecture, if one that has a tendency to wander quite a bit. Gilles de Rais is discussed, to be sure, but Crowley admits roughly halfway through that he has no knowledge of his subject; is comments are aimed at debunking the impossibly large number of children de Rais is said to have murdered (eight hundred in Crowley's account; others, e.g. Bataille's excellent The Trial of Gilles de Rais, mention that contemporary reports mentioned numbers in the four figures). Crowley's argument does contain some seeds of logic, though the de Rais hobbyist will note a few places where a firmer grasp on his subject might have steered Crowley in a different direction (e.g., for the most part, de Rais didn't abduct his victims; they came to the castle looking for apprenticeships).<br /><br />The most interesting thing about the pamphlet is wondering, if the first option in the first paragraph of this review is actually the accurate one, why on earth this lecture was actually banned. Crowley makes some remarks about Jews that could probably be taken in a disparaging light if taken out of context, but (a) one would assume that anyone reading this to approve it would be reading the comments in context and (b) anti-Semitism wasn't exactly taboo in 1930 England. There is a more vicious, but slightly more subtle, attack on the Roman Catholic church that may have incensed some folks. I can't imagine that the lecture's core idea, that de Rais didn't actually kill eight hundred children, would be considered a reason for the lecture to be banned.

That it is a compendium of journal entries should tell you a good deal of what you need to know to figure out if you're going to like this book or not; there's a good deal of repetition. It's the nature of the beast. If that's not your bag, you'll want to pass here.<br /><br />That said, Get in the Van is interesting for all manner of reasons, especially for those of us who actually grew up listening to Black Flag. If you're in a more fringe area of the music industry, a lot of this will probably sound familiar to you, if on a larger scale (most underground musicians probably don't embark on extensive tours outside their home country, though as Henry points out, people are pretty much the same everywhere). If you don't, you'll get a lot of insight into what it is to be a \\"rock star\\"-- people ripping you off, mishaps on the road, jerks everywhere you look. It ain't easy being at the top (and Black Flag may have ruled the roost where hardcore punk was concerned, but in the greater scheme of things, to call the members of Black Flag rock stars-- putting them on the same level of success as bands who sold out arenas-- the very idea is something of a joke, as Rollins sourly points out a number of times).<br /><br />The best thing about the book, though, is watching Henry's psyche and contrasting it with what we see on the page. Henry Rollins was a mass of contradictions during the turbulent Black Flag years. He often complains here that he feels detached from those around him, including the other members of the band, and that he feels less and less human. The truly sad bit is how human it all is.<br /><br />Those not yet familiar with Rollins' writings would likely be better off starting with one of his other books (I've always been very partial to Bang!, myself) or, even better, one of the spoken word cassettes from 2.13.61. But once you've found yourself a convert to Rollins' particular brand of dark, heavy humor, Get in the Van is a fine chronicle. *** ½from 2.13.61.

Kathi Appelt, Poems from Homeroom: A Writer's Place to Start (Henry Holt, 2002)<br /><br />I'm still not quite sure how I feel about this book. I love the second section of it, where Appelt goes into the ideas behind the poems and provides exercises for young readers to get to writing (even if she does make the usual mistake of calling 5-7-5 an established form, rather than a guideline, in English haiku). As for the poems themselves, the jury's still kind of out. Attention is paid to the crafting of them, which in itself makes them rise to above average in today's world of published poetry; if there is a problem, it's that the narrative structure of much of the poetry tends to get away from the image, and so some of it sounds like prose broken up into lines rather than poetry. Appelt is very good at using form, though, and when she does this collection shines.<br /><br />Overall, there's more good than bad here. Worth checking out. ***	2005-08-23

Max Allan Collins, The Road to Perdition (Paradox, 1998)<br /><br />This is, of course, best-known as the basis of Sam Mendes' second feature film. And, to be honest, I think I'd probably have liked the book better had I not seen the film. There were some details David Self's screenplay filled in that made the ending of the book a little less deus ex machina, but I'm not sure I'd have even noticed had I not seen the film.<br /><br />You already know the plot: the son of a hitman steals along with his father one night and sees the kind of work his father does. This leads to a war when dad's boss tries to have him and his family killed, and dad's primary goal is to try and get son to safety. However, while they're on the run, dad is forced by circumstance to realize that son is actually kind of good at doing some of the ancillary things that need done when one is involved in a life of crime (for example, being a getaway driver).<br /><br />The graphic novel's main failing seems to be encountered in that plot; it seems to me as if the father, for all his telling the kid that he doesn't want him in this way of life, would have at least recognized, if not entertained, the idea of a \\"like father, like son\\" life, especially given the amount of time they're out on the road. But no; the father is a bit too much the bad-guy-with-the-heart-of-gold, leaving the heavy pontificating to the son. Despite that, however, there's a lot to be liked here. The characters are well-done, for the most part (Connor Looney, especially, is more three-dimensional in the film than the book), and as always, Collins' inclusion of historical figures make a good anchor for the reader.<br /><br />Likable, but read it before you see the movie. *** ½	2005-08-23

Charles Bukowski, Betting on the Muse: Poems and Stories (Black Sparrow, 1996)<br /><br />The general rule of thumb is that Bukowki's posthumously-published works are of lesser quality than those published during his lifetime. So far, I have come across two exceptions to this rule. One is The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship, a wonderful book of journal-like observations and such. The second, in parts anyway, is Betting on the Muse: Poems and Stories.<br /><br />Much of the poetry in the book seems as if it was written in the fifties and sixties, during the peak years of Buk's quality output (though there are some of the later \\"I couldn't care less what it's about\\" poems scattered throughout). Much of it may well have been. Some, however, bears timestamps in the work that show them as having been written early in the nineties; makes me wonder what Buk might have come up with had he lived a few more years.<br /><br />The final selection of poems (I divided the book up in my head while reading into sections, each bounded with short stories) is a series of meditations on death. Not Buk's normal death writing, which always had some fierce spark of hope in it, but writing that made it clear he knew he was facing his own demise. With the exception of the amazing \\"Last Call,\\" which is roughly halfway through the book, this final selection is perhaps Buk's best work since Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame back in 1973. The process of \\"observe and write with as little translation is possible\\" is abandoned, and the work shows that either Buk revised these poems, or turned them over in his head a lot more before putting them down on paper. It shows.<br /><br />The short stories (and one short nonfiction sketch about publishing his first chapbook in 1960 that is far more optimistic) are a pretty fair reminder that despite Buk being known mostly for his poetry, he was always a strong writer of short stories-- arguably, his short stories are stronger than his poetry. Reading them is like reading Spillane, if Spillane had spent most of his life drunk in a flophouse and didn't care about the mystery aspect of what he wrote. These are quick, easily slices of life, biting with satire and rife with well-drawn characters.<br /><br />This is good stuff, and the first of Buk's books I've read in quite a while I would unhesitatingly recommend to those few people who have not yet encountered the writing of Charles Bukowski. ****are stronger than his poetry.

Robin Hobb, Fool's Fate (Bantam, 2004)<br /><br />I have been immersed in the Six Duchies and its southern cousin Bingtown for two years and six thousand, three hundred thirty-three pages. I turned the last page on Fool's Fate at about 10:15 this morning and felt a small but undeniable sense of loss. Robin Hobb has said in interviews that she's finished with this particular world, and it's somewhat hard knowing we won't be going back for new adventures. (That said, \\"next generation\\" series of novels do tend to not live up to their predecessors, except in the rarest of cases.)<br /><br />With all that weight, both physical and metaphorical, settling on the shoulders of the six hundred-odd pages to be found here, Fool's Fate not only had a lot to live up to where its predecessors were concerned, but was also tasked with finishing the series in a manner worthy of it. With so many recent fantasy series sliding far downhill into their dotage (I'm sure I don't need to mention any names, take any series that's gone more than seven or eight books in the past few years), I think I may have actually gone into Fool's Fate with slightly lowered expectations. What I ended up reading was not only up to par with the rest of the books, but was, in fact, the best book in the series. Not only does Hobb manage to tie up loose ends most readers won't even realize were loose ends, but she does so with a surprising, and quite pleasing, lack of drama; one particular twist-tie spanned all of two sentences-- and was one of the book's most jaw-dropping revelations. (Those who've gone through the series will probably recognize what I'm talking about without my having to drop hints. I don't want to, as even the barest hint will spoil the incredible surprise.) Meditating on the deeper meanings to be found in those two sentences will give the astute reader a good deal to think about regarding how meticulously the payoff of Fool's Fate was planned, and how long she's been aiming at some of these targets. She hits every last one of them with precision.<br /><br />I have not read a fantasy novel this accomplished, and with such a perfect ending, since Pullman's The Amber Spyglass five years ago. (I should note that \\"ending\\" is something of a misnomer, as it spans about a hundred fifty pages.) If you have not yet read Robin Hobb's fantastic trilogy of trilogies about the Six Duchies and Bingtown, you owe it to yourself. It's a six-thousand-plus page investment, but not only is every page worth it, the payoff approaches perfection. *****ese targets.

Daniel Hoffman, Darkening Water (Louisiana State University Press, 2002)<br /><br />Daniel Hoffman has quietly become one of the giants of American verse over the past few decades. I hadn't picked up one of his books since Middens of the Tribe, which I read at least ten years ago (and it had been sitting on my shelf for quite a while before that). I'm quite happy to have rediscovered him.<br /><br />Hoffman creates startlingly real characters for poetry, which usually doesn't work with characters at all, or gives them secondary significance to image and language. Hoffman does so not by elevating the characters over those two important pieces of the poetic puzzle, but making them of equal weight. He does so without a shred of overbearing message, which is what makes these poems so different than your average fare. As well, Hoffman is an accomplished writer in rhyme and traditional forms; Darkening Water often feels like reading a manuscript produced during the waning years of popular traditional verse, but with a completely modern sensibility. The only comparison I can even begin to see is to John Hollander, but Hoffman seems to have his feet farther on the ground than does Hollander.<br /><br />Fine stuff, demanding careful reading and much thought. Well worth it. *** ½	2005-08-12

This was evident all the way back with the publication of her first book, A Handful of Bees. As with most books of poetry, A Handful of Bees is a collection of meditations on various subjects. These are loosely grouped into three separate categories, and Orlowsky leads off with a section of poems about family, where she shows her strongest work (and presages the brilliance to come in her more recent offerings). Pick this up and read its first twenty pages; if you're not captivated by what you see... I had an ending for that sentence, but can't remember it. I can't imagine anyone not being struck by the stark, depressing beauty of the opening salvo Orlowsky fired in what has become an excellent career. This is definitely something you want to get your hands on. ****	2005-08-12

Bill Blunden, Cube Farm (Apress, 2004)<br /><br />Perhaps the most amusing thing about this amusing book is that Blunden, describing the mindless stupidity of corporate culture, obviously wrote it for, at best, those with a casual understanding of computers. And yet it was published by a press who specialize in computer books. Go figure.<br /><br />The eighties were filled with novels of young, hip twentysomethings with nothing to do except destroy themselves. Cube Farm is the nineties nonfiction version-- guy in grad school basically falls into job because he has nothing better to do. The funny thing is, once he actually has a job, the characters get a lot weirder than anything you'll find in a Bret Easton Ellis novel.<br /><br />The result is your basic \\"corporations suck\\" expose, but Blunden makes it work by keeping his tone conversational (he's the guy telling the story next to you at the bar after you've both had one too many), and being possessed of a humor blacker than pitch that either comes out in the sardonic tone of the writing or little jokes that are sure to appeal to the geek contingent.<br /><br />I liked this book.

(Those unfortunate enough to have watched the recent Sci-Fi Channel abomination will be rather surprised at a few key liberties the adapters took with the text.) I'm usually a huge fan of LeGuin's young adult work (Very Far Away from Anywhere Else was on my twenty-five-best list when I read it in 1997), but her tone here is a bit on the didactic side, a far cry from the natural prose she normally uses. Not that it'll keep me away from the other three in the series, as the characters are well-drawn and LeGuin laid her hooks for the next books quite neatly in a row in this one, but if you're new to the wonderful world of LeGuin, I'd suggest starting with one of the adult books before trying these out. *** ½	2005-08-12

Neil Gaiman, Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes (Vertigo, 1995)<br /><br />Before Neil Gaiman made himself into a household name with the twin publications of American Gods and Good Omens, there was already a sizable culture of Gaiman fanatics thanks to the Sandman series of graphic novels. Preludes and Nocturnes is the first of them. Not only Gaiman, but his publisher as well, caution the reader in forewords (and Gaiman reiterates in an afterword) that Preludes and Nocturnes is not indicative of the quality of the series as a whole, and judging by the fanaticism of the Gaiman army, I'm going to hazard a guess as to the truth of that statement.<br /><br />Preludes and Nocturnes is a basic quest storyline; the sandman has been trapped for sixty years, and the items that gave him power have been scattered throughout the multiverse. He's got to get them back. Hooray. We've seen it all a thousand times before. What shows that there's the potential for this to be great stuff is what Gaiman does with some of his minor characters. John Constantine makes a quick stop in, which is always welcome, but the series' true brilliance manifests itself in the character of John Dee (one wonders whether he's supposed to actually be the well-known magician of that name, or just a reference to same). Dee is as well-fleshed a character as any in American Gods, which is quite saying something, and the lengths to which he'll go to abuse the power he has stolen from the sandman's artifact are truly chilling. The \\"24 Hours\\" chapter here will stay with you long after you've finished reading this and gone on to the other (hopefully better) books in the series.<br /><br />Not, by all accounts, an auspicious beginning, but I'll keep going and see if the legions of crazed fans are right about how good this gets. ***	2005-08-10

Jeffrey Thomas, Letters from Hades (Bedlam Press, 2003)<br /><br />Despite the ambiguous way in which Thomas ends his narrative, it's entirely possible that the astute reader will turn the last page with one main question in his mind. Thomas' narrator muses, a few times, about the possibility of getting his manuscript back out of Hell and into the \\"real world.\\" But no mechanisms for doing so are ever detailed. So how is the reader reading this manuscript?<br /><br />This is a good thing. Thomas has done a fine job of suspension of disbelief in this exceptionally odd mix of Dante's Commedia and the first few acts of Romeo and Juliet (with intriguing dashes of A Clockwork Orange and The Dogs of War thrown in for good measure). The plot is simple: a man has committed suicide and gone to Hell where, after some basic schooling, he's left to fend for himself. He journeys around, sees things, gets involved in stuff, gets a job... a slice-of-life story, except that everyone in it is dead.<br /><br />It's an amusing enough idea, and carried off with style, but what really sets Letters from Hades apart from so many other novels to be found out there in the wide world is that Thomas' narrator actually has a brain. He doesn't react to things like the typical horror-novel (anti-)hero. There's no quaking, screaming, falling down while running away from something nasty, or conveniently forgetting important facts when they're necessary. It's a travesty that such a sensible, pragmatic hero is such a rarity in the world of fiction, but at least when you run across such a character, you appreciate him all the more.<br /><br />A fine piece of work, well worth your time. ****	2005-08-10

It's Rear Window without Jimmy Stewart (and the wheelchair). For a modern graphic novel, it's incredibly short (48 pp., almost the length of your basic comic book), but that better serves to deliver the incredible sense of despair that comes crushing down on our hero. Despite its brevity, the ending packs a serious punch. Good stuff; I'll definitely be checking out more of Jason's work in the future. *** ½	2005-08-10

Georg Trakl, Poems and Prose (Libris, 2001)<br /><br />Why is it that Georg Trakl has faded into obscurity? You'd think, given his background, he'd be considered quite the now author, despite his not having made it to the end of World War I; a brief bio that contains both incest and suicide seems as if it would certainly appeal to today's fanatical tell-all memoir crowd. Those folks who are so happy reading Running with Scissors and the spate of \\"boy, did I love alcohol growing up (but I'm smarter than that these days!)\\" books currently on the market should be getting quite the kick out of resurrecting the boy's corpse. And yet, despite the fact that this book's been out for four years, I was the first one to take it out of the library; you know how, every once in a while when you buy a hot-of-the-presses book, the pages aren't fully separated because the printing press was cutting pages too fast? Yeah. I was separating pages for most of the second half of the book.<br /><br />A shame, this, because Trakl was a contemporary of the earliest surrealists, but while they've gone on to be astoundingly influential, Trakl's particular brand of seemingly-naive fantasy, constantly shadowed with death and his guilt over/obsession with his relationship with his sister, has influenced far too few. One could probably make a case for him having been in influence on the early imagists, but they never managed to infuse their work with as much emotion (let alone obsession) as can be found in Trakl. This is great stuff, well worth reading. Those who find this a bit on the large side for a single-author collection (it should be noted that it's a bilingual edition, except for the last eight pages of prose) could certainly start with, say, Autumn Sonata, but you'll eventually get round to reading this once you've figured out how good his work is.

Vaughan, Y: The Last Man: Unmanned (DC Comics, 2003)<br /><br />The blurbs on the back of this book will make you think that Brian Vaughan's series Y: The Last Man is basically the be-all and end-all of graphic novels and a science fiction classic waiting to happen. Whether or not that's true I can't yet tell you, and while it doesn't suffer when held up against such titles as Watchmen or Preacher, I wouldn't say it surpasses them by a country mile, either. It's inventive and has excellent characterization, but really, what above-average title in the graphic novel field can you not say that about these days?<br /><br />The story thus far: something, no one yet knows what, has wiped out every man on earth with one (two, actually-- he has a pet monkey who is also male) exception. The women have factionalized quickly (think Lord of the Flies with more sides), and the ones with which our hero is tenuously aligned want to set about finding ways to have our hero repopulate the planet. Our hero, on the other hand, just wants to get to Australia to find his girlfriend (or is she his fiancee?), who was trekking in the outback when the bad stuff went down.<br /><br />The characters are rich and well-drawn (no pun intended) and the situation is, in some odd way, real enough to allow for suspension of disbelief to be stretched a bit farther than one would normally expect from such a grimly realist tale. There's definitely a lot to like about this first installment of Y: The Last Man, but don't let yourself get overexcited by the hype. *** ½	2005-08-10

Gillian Conoley, Lovers in the Used World (Carnegie Mellon, 2001)<br /><br />Gillian Conoley does not strike me as a happy camper. Her poems snap off the page at you, their language seemingly ready to beat you if you so much as look at it the wrong way. This could, of course, be a reaction to my recently reading so much of the pristine, academic type stuff that's seemingly in more vogue than usual these days (comparisons of Conoley to Jorie Graham, as have been posited by some others, strike me as especially odd, as Graham typifies that particular school), but, well, these poems snap.<br /><br />Conoley doesn't really sound like a language poet much (though she does fall into that rut a time or two in this collection), but she's certainly not above borrowing their syntax to suit her needs; odd spacings and such abound here. It's possible that it all has a reason, but as someone who's never been able to figure out the complex linguistic trickery that language poets are seemingly offering with their ways of sticking stuff on the page, I can personally attest that this stuff would read just as good if Conoley had put it on the page in nothing but heroic couplets; it's the words, and how they sound when you put them together, that's important, and these words sound very good when put together.<br /><br />Worthwhile.

Closer is a couple of steps on the right side of unreadable, but they're small steps.<br /><br />The main problem with Closer is its relentless monotony. Adults are never to be trusted; even those who sympathize with the kids who make up the bulk of Cooper's narratives will eventually turn on them in the end. The kids all live in a haze of drugs, alcohol, and sex, usually needing liberal applications of all three just to make it through the day. And no one in Cooper's stories isn't gay (or at least 90-10 bisexual). All of which can be done, of course, in ways that will make it interesting, compelling reading. Cooper seems particularly unconcerned with doing so, as if he'd adopted Henry James' (in \\"The Dead\\") technique of writing about boring people in as boring a way as possible.<br /><br />About the best thing I can say about this book is \\"don't use it as a barometer of Cooper's talent.\\" *	2005-08-10

Pat Walsh, 78 Reasons Why Your Book May Never Be Published & 14 Reasons It Just Might (Penguin, 2005)<br /><br />There are a certain number of people on the planet who have the seemingly innate ability to cut through mountains of crap and get to the point. There are a certain number of people on the planet who also don't give a flying damn whether they're going to hurt your feelings or not. It is a rare, rare thing for these two traits-- one normally seen as positive and one negative-- to come together in a single human being. If it were, we'd have a lot more secretaries on the planet and a lot fewer CEOs.<br /><br />Pat Walsh is one of the few, and 78 Reasons... is all the proof any human being should need of this. Walsh, an editor for MacAdam/Cage, started from the basic thesis that well over 90% of the manuscripts that land on his desk every year range from being not quite good enough to being complete messes, and set out to tell the world how to at least whip them into enough shape that he might have something to work with when writing your rejection letter.<br /><br />The problem with this book is the same problem that plagues most any \\"how to write\\" book worth its salt: its likely audience will be swift to give a new scent to the definition of \\"preaching to the choir.\\" I'm going to guess that most people who read this book and take it seriously will be those who are already doing (or not doing, as in the case of rainbow stationery and envelopes full of glitter... my god, to people really do that sort of thing?) at least half the things Walsh writes about. Those who actually embody all seventy-eight points of horror in one living, breathing, writing abomination are most likely already so convinced of their literary genius that they feel they don't need to read a book like this, because they know it all. Ah, the wonders of Murphy's Law.<br /><br />This book should sit beside Natalie Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones on your bookshelf; Goldberg for what do do while still working on your manuscript, Walsh for what to do once you've actually got a manuscript in hand. ****do do while still working on your manuscript, Walsh for what to do once you've actually got a manuscript in hand. ****	2005-08-10

Will Eisner, The Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Norton, 2005)<br /><br />Will Eisner completed work on The Plot shortly before his death, which could likely be seen as the natural answer to a few of the questions one is likely to be left with upon finishing this rather slim volume.<br /><br />For example: why is it so short? Eisner states in his foreword that while the extant body of literature on the Protocols is geared toward an audience far more interested in history than in the exposure of urban legends, he was aiming to create something that would be more accessible to the rest of us. And, in all honesty, that's exactly what he did; that said, it seemed to me as if he stripped off far too much of the surrounding events to really give any sort of cultural insight into the genesis of the Protocols. We all know the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule, and it seems as if Eisner spends at least fifty of the books hundred twenty-seven pages telling instead of showing. As a number of recent graphic novels have adequately shown (David B.'s Epileptic is the first to come to mind), it's quite possible to show all the cultural stuff that might well give the reader more anchors. But then again, it's possible Eisner had planned to add more here, but died before he could.<br /><br />A second, and somewhat more vexing question: at the heart of the last third of the book, which is ultimately filled with despair, Eisner poses the question as to why, when the genesis of the Protocols has been shown to be a complete fabrication time and again, do people still believe in them? I, in turn, find it exceptionally hard to believe that Eisner is wholly unaware of the many, many other facets of society in which belief in the face of evidence to the contrary exists (take your pick on any topic from \\"Nostradamus predicted the Twin Towers attacks\\" to \\"evolution is only a theory\\" to \\"professional wrestling isn't staged\\"), and how strongly the stupid will hold to their beliefs no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary. How much duplicity can we ascribe to Eisner for leaving this for the reader to ponder as some sort of great unanswered question when we see examples of it in our everyday existence? (One suggests a quick reading of Norman Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering for a possible stab at an answer, however unconscious the motivation may have been in Eisner.)<br /><br />All that aside, it is my fervent hope that The Plot, as flawed as it is, will convince a legion of readers to either read further into discovering the evidence that the Protocols are a complete fiction. More likely, however, is the idea that perhaps some of them will simply swallow Eisner's line, hook and sinker attached. The end result may be the same, but will it be a triumph of peoples' ability to think for themselves, or just another case of the sheep blindly believing what they're told? ***heir beliefs no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary.

Diann Hunt, Hearts Under Construction (Steeple Hill, 2005)<br /><br />What, really, does one say about a romance novel that hasn't already been said? I could focus on the generic plot, the endless repetition of the theme and the various kinks in it, the cardboard-cutout characters, etc., etc., etc., as has been done since the dawn of Dame Barbara. It's all here, as it has been in most every romance novel I've read in the past twenty years or more. But that sort of predictability is exactly what the readers of this sort of stuff seem to want. (And does no one else find this a tad strange?)<br /><br />While the book's Christian slant suffers from the same flaws as the rest of it (mentioned above), the overall effect here is that what would otherwise come off as unbearably preachy here comes off as nothing more than being true to one's genre. Go figure, finally, a use for genre clich&eacute;. The expected upside to this being a Christian romance is that things never get all that hot and heavy; rather like the charming chick flick Return to Me a few years ago, Hearts Under Construction makes it seem like that first kiss is actually what all the fuss is about. And as anyone familiar with the history of modesty knows, there was a time when that was actually true.<br /><br />It's genre romance, of course, and thus you can bring all your prejudices to the table, but when al''s said and done, it's certainly not bad genre romance. Just prepare to get frustrated at how stupid people can be, when simply talking to one another would have cleared things up in an hundred fewer pages. ** ½	2005-08-03

Francesca Lia Block, Witch Baby (Harper, 1991)<br /><br />The adventures of Weetzie Bat and Co. continue in this second book in the cycle, though Weetzie takes a background to Witch Baby here. Witch Baby is almost the darker side of Weetzie's coin, and gets into a number of the same messes (the names and dates change, but the situations sound somewhat similar). Block's Acker-esque fasination with ways to twist language continues apace.<br /><br />The book's major failing, as compared to its predecessor, is that Block lets her prejudices bubble much closer to the surface here, and the books smacks far more of politics than did Weetzie Bat. Political polemic and novels do not mix (though, to be fair, it's easier to do in fiction than poetry; a handful of poets can do it successfully, while perhaps a dozen novelists have managed it over the years). While Block seemed to have the trick down in Weetzie Bat, here it comes off as pedestrian at best. (To be fair, though, unlike most political screed masquerading as fiction, it never gets in the way of the story or interferes with the pace.)<br /><br />I hope the politics calm down in the series' later books, and that this was just a dip in quality easily remedied. Guess I'll find out as I keep going. ** ½	2005-08-03

Sam Harris, The End of Faith (Norton, 2004)<br /><br />Before you read this review, please go order a copy of The End of Faith. For that matter, order multiple copies to give out as Christmas presents (both because you want everyone you know to read this book, and to revel in the irony).<br /><br />Thank you. Now that you have done so, on to the review.<br /><br />I find it amusingly ironic that the word I kept coming up with to describe Sam Harris, while mulling over what to say in this review, was \\"prophet.\\" Harris would probably slap me upside the head himself for making such a claim, especially in light of his thesis here: that the problems the world currently suffers vis-a-vis terrorism (and has suffered throughout history in many forms) is not because of \\"extremism\\" or \\"fundamentalism\\"-- the problems the world currently suffers spring, fully formed, from religion itself. He then goes on to spend about two hundred pages telling us exactly why he believes this. I can't imagine that the majority of readers who have brains won't be reading this and thinking either \\"I've been saying this for years\\" or \\"I wish I'd thought of this.\\"<br /><br />Documented in exhaustive (and sometimes excruciating) detail, and using sometimes assailable but always compelling logic, Harris outlines the problems with religion throughout history, and more importantly (perhaps) why religion is even more of a problem today than it is usually. He loses a step in the final chapter, in which he proposes a spiritual alternative to religion, but I'm guessing few people will have as much of a problem with the idea as I did; Harris is not far off when he talks about the comfort of religion for the common man, and it does stand to reason that they'll need something of perceived worth to replace it.<br /><br />Perhaps even more amusingly ironic is that two of the three blurbs on the back of the book come from prominent religious figures. One wonders if they actually read it, as the book's whole premise is to tell them much of what they've based their lives on is completely illegitimate.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough; it should be on your short shelf of sacred texts with Peele's The Diseasing of America and Howard's The Death of Common Sense.

Renau, Racing Around Kentucky (self-published, 1995)<br /><br />Now, as anyone who's been reading my reviews for the past ten or so years knows, I'll read anything that relates even tangentially to any aspect of the Thoroughbred Racing industry as it is practiced in any country in the world. And my lack of giving out bad reviews to books on racing is due in no way to my affinity for the subject, but rather because I just hadn't stumbled across any bad ones. (And the tooth fairy is real. I look back over some old reviews and wonder what on earth I was thinking giving... ah, my memory is playing tricks on me; The American Handicapper did only receive a single star. So I do give bad reviews to horse racing books!) That, unfortunately, has changed mightily in the past year, as I've discovered the wonders of Interlibrary Loan, and I've found some stunningly bad books on all aspects of the racing world. The newest on the list is Lynn S. Renau's Racing Around Kentucky, which, while purporting to be many, many things, is mainly a history of racing as it relates to Kentucky. (This should not surprise the astute title reader.)<br /><br />To be fair, Racing Around Kentucky is not nearly as awful as The American Handicapper or William Bauman's \\"classic\\" tome Smart Handicapping Made Easy. This is not a book designed to put you in the poorhouse within a month after you buy it. However, it does have a number of major shortcomings. I would guess that the majority of readers of this book will find the biggest complaint to be that the book tries to do too much in limited space; a quick run-down of everything Renau lists on the back of the book should tell you that a single book, especially one weighing in at only 214 pages, will not be able to cover all of Renau's topics with anything approaching comprehensiveness; in fact, many of the sections barely reach the level of a survey of the material. If you put aside the rest and concentrate on the history, though, my main complaint comes through-- the book's style, which ranges from the dry to the unreadable (one particular chapter in the book, that on Sallie Ward, is so badly organized that one will find oneself asking the question of whether Ms. Ward died before she was born, or how many Ms. Wards actually coexisted contemporaneously. This leads to mental images perhaps best left unearthed). As if the style weren't bad enough, the book is honeycombed with typos; if you found a particularly obsessive proofreading termite and sent him in to eat away all the typos in this book, you'd find yourself with a rather ratty volume when he was finished.<br /><br />Especially at the prices for which this book goes today, it is only recommended for the most compulsive completist collectors of books on the Thoroughbred industry. The rest of you should be avoiding it as much as possible. * ½plaint comes through-- the book's style, which ranges from the dry to the unreadable (one particular chapter in the book, that on Sallie Ward, is so badly organized that one will find oneself asking the question of whether Ms. Ward died before she was born, or how many Ms. Wards actually coexisted contemporaneously.

Finkelstein, The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering (Verso, 2000)<br /><br />Do you know one of those people who lives in the world where they can saw that Elie Wiesel's Night should still be marketed as nonfiction because even though he \\"stretched some of the facts,\\" the book still deals with the \\"greater truth of the Holocaust\\"? While I know your strongest desire is probably to smack this person, a more productive (and less alienating) alternative is to give that person your copy of The Holocaust Industry-- because you do own one, don't you? After that person has read it, have the Wiesel discussion again and see if the tune sounds a few more sour notes than before.<br /><br />The Holocaust Industry, in three long chapters, takes an unflinching look at the way a number of influential Jews (and one enterprising Gentile, who has to be admired for his, dare I say it, chutzpah) have taken the events of World War II Germany and turned them into what is, basically, a media juggernaut capable of steamrolling over anything in its path. (After all, the myth that the Holocaust was unique to the Jews is capable of being debunked by anyone who reads a history book, and has as much validity as the ravings of Holocaust deniers, yet it persists, unquestionable, in our minds despite our knowledge of its untruth. What kind of power does that require?) Being Jewish himself, Finkelstein takes a novel approach to his offense at their antics; he sees the machinations of the Holocaust Industry as demeaning the actual Holocaust survivors. (And rightly so.) It should be noted in passing that any Gentile who'd attempted to write this book would have been crucified, in the press at least, for being anti-Semitic. Not that Finkelstein has completely gotten away with it, but he's gotten off with a much cleaner record than, say, I would have. This is a good thing, as Finkelstein's got a lot more to say. (He's got a new book coming out in a few months, as I write this.)<br /><br />This is good stuff, well worth reading. Not just as a condemnation of Elie Wiesel and his cronies, though that alone is more than enough reason for every thinking human being to pick this up and devour it at his earliest opportunity, but also as an interesting case study of how someone can take exaggerated (and, in some cases, patently untrue) claims and, with the assistance of the media, make \\"truths\\" of them. (The discerning reader will want to look at how the anti-smoking lobby has done the same thing over the past decade with just as much offense and disgust.)

Ottens, Coping with Satanism (Rosen, 1994)<br /><br />I originally picked this up assuming I was going to get the extremist-Christian view on supposed Satanic cult activity, but such is not the case. Rosen seems to be a publishing house focusing on the grade 5-12 set, and if there are any extremist Christians the bunch, they held their tongues long enough that the company managed to publish a J. K. Rowling biography recently. This pretty much fits with what I found in the book itself.<br /><br />Ottens take a surprisingly balanced approach to the idea of Satanism, at least while he's describing the signs that your child may, in fact, be worshipping some guy with a big red tail and a cloven hoof. He almost completely discounts the \\"Satanic panic\\" that was on the wane by 1994, addressing most of the key players and giving the reader more than enough solid reasons for doing the same. He's also pretty much got his facts right (though one wonders why, during a brief discussion of splinter groups from the Church of Satan, he neglected to say anything about the Temple of Set, who are the only real CoS splinter group worth mentioning, and by far the best known; have at it, conspiracy theorists). Things break down towards the end when he attempts to make a case for \\"Satanism as mental health problem; one thinks that a truly good argument for this tactic could easily be turned on older established religions, and Ottens was likely aware of that fact, and thus didn't want to give the budding grave desecrators any ammo they might be able to use in heated discussions with parents about the religion said parents follow. Pity, as that might have led to some really interesting exchanges over the dinner table.<br /><br />As with any book of this type, it's a double-edged sword. It has equal use to both the teen involved in a \\"Satanic cult\\"who wants to get out and the teen interested in finding out more about the religion. (Such would, of course, however be advised to go straight to the source and read Dr. LaVey's cheesy, but fun, The Satanic Bible.) Take the mental-health-issues bits with grains of salt, or apply them equally to the more established religions, and what emerges is what some of us have known was there all along: a quick, sketchy overview of an actual religion.<br /><br />One wonders, idly, why Focus on the Family or some other similar band of numbskulls hasn't raised a stink about this book yet.

William Mayne, A Game of Dark (Dutton, 1971)<br /><br />A Game of Dark is a book whose first chapter is somewhat likely to send readers packing. It did me, at least for a couple of weeks, but I eventually picked it up again, and am relatively glad I did.<br /><br />The book revolves around Donald Jackson, British schoolboy with a relatively miserable life. When he's fantasizing, Donald enters a sword-and-sorcery medieval world where he becomes Jackson, who soon after his arrival in a strange land finds himself a page to Bonebreak, the new Lord of the place, whose job is to go off and kill a large white worm that keeps eating the villagers. The two stories continue on in parallel throughout the book, though the climax is far from the earth-shattering revelation the book jacket would have you believe.<br /><br />The transition periods between reality and fantasy are both the book's main strength and its weakness. While the technique is very well-known (almost to the point of being considered clich&eacute;), it's not actually all that often used, and is usually a pleasure when one stumbles upon it-- Mayne slips his character from reality to fantasy between sentences, or at times in the middle of a sentence. Unfortunately, this is quite jarring in the first chapter; there's a much better delineation a little farther on in the book that would have served much better as the beginning transition. Still, for all that, once you've caught on to what Mayne's doing, it's relatively easy to follow.<br /><br />The characters are for the most part decently drawn, though only Donald ever truly achieves three-dimensional status. Still, this is a far cry from most of the stock sci-fi/fantasy stuff we read as kids during that era; at least there's one character you could bring home to mum whom she couldn't use as a sewing pattern.<br /><br />Probably worth checking out if you stumble across it, but not really one to go out of your way for.	2005-07-26

Charles Simic, My Noiseless Entourage (Harcourt, 2005)<br /><br />Simic continues to astound readers with thin, gorgeous books of poetry every few years. It's been a while, though (this is his first book of completely new work since 1999's Jackstraws), and one has to wonder-- why the six-year gap? Is The man losing a step? Not at all, cholly. My Noiseless Entourage, from its opening words, transports the reader to that same weird and wonderful place that all of Simic's books do. (And, with him having recently garnered a quick mention in a Lemony Snicket book, perhaps his star will be rising to where it rightfully belongs in the near future.)<br /><br />I had originally started off thinking I was going to quote specific passages from the book in testament to how great it is, but I ended up with so many I just opened the book and random and came across:<br /><br />\\"America, I shouted at the radio,<br /><br />Even at 2AM you are a loony bin!<br /><br />No, I take it back!<br /><br />You are a stone angel in the cemetery<br /><br />Listening to blind geese in the sky<br /><br />Your eyes blinded by snow.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Talk Radio\\")<br /><br />As always, there's not a word out of place, no fat to be trimmed from these wonderful, dadaesque ramblings. It's, perhaps, not quite as powerful as Simic's finest moments (The World Doesn't End or Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk, for example), but you're talking about the difference between a 20 megaton bomb and a 19 megaton bomb; you're still going to come out of the experience having been blown away.	2005-07-26

Ted McLelland, Horseplayers: Life at the Track (Chicago Review Press, 2005)<br /><br />Ted McLelland devotes a whole chapter of this book to a friend of mine. Cool.<br /><br />The obsessive reader of books on horseplaying (which is a very small group of people; in fact, it may well only contain me) needs to take a break from handicapping tomes and huge books of mathematical formulae every once in a while and read something about the equine and human sides of the sport. The former is less sparsely populated with truly great material, though Jane Schwartz' Ruffian: Burning from the Start, which is finally back in print on a steady basis, certainly fits the bill. The human side has been covered somewhat better, from the academic (John Rosencrance's thoroughly engrossing and entertaining The Degenerates of Lake Tahoe) to the poetic (Bill Barich's masterpiece Laughing in the Hills). Horseplayers: Life at the Track is a fine addition to the literature of the human side of horse racing.<br /><br />McLelland's book, actually, reads kind of like Rosencrance's, but with a plot and human names (or, in many cases, nicknames) plastered on the characters. You will meet the down-and-out, the desperate, the obsessed, the obsessive, the compulsive, the bum, the mathematician, and others. In fact, you'll meet pretty much every type of social outcast there is. (There's even a religious fanatic, though certainly the most likable one I've come across in print recently.) The one thing you'll lack is a truly well-rounded normal person, but then, the track doesn't seem to attract too many of them. Assuming they even exist. (We all have our faults, yes?) Even if you're not a big reader of nonfiction, if you like your books full of quirky characters, believe me, you're going to get a kick out of this book. And you may even pick up some tips on how to operate at your local track. (Here's a starter: stooping is not a good idea.)	2005-07-26

Which begs the question: what happens if before intrudes on Dwight's new life?<br /><br />Such is the premise of A Dame to Kill For, the second Sin City graphic novel (and the only one of the first few not to be featured in the Robert Rodriguez movie. Don't worry, berks, there's a sequel on the way). As you expect if you've read ten random panels of Frank Miller's work before, what happens is that things go very awry very quickly, and, of course, they get violent.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting thing about the novels (reflected nicely in the movie) is how far in advance Miller was obviously setting things up for later episodes in the series. Single panels from other books appear from other perspectives in different books, giving the reader a stronger sense of time than he'd otherwise have (the rest of the clues are a bit more subtle, such as Marv showing up towards the end of this book with the bandages on his face that he gets early in the first book). Miller's world is full and richly detailed, his characters dark and complex, and his art bordering on the expressionist while retaining the minimal quality of good noir. Lovely, as usual.	2005-07-26

Robin Hobb, Golden Fool (Bantam, 2003)<br /><br />Robin Hobb's first three trilogies weaved a wonderful spell, set in a world full of strife, political malice, and the kinds of wonders little found in our quotidian existence. Now I grant you, most fantasy novels do this, but Hobb has a particularly deft touch with such things; now that I've finished the eighth book in the series (for, though published as three separate trilogies, these books are actually one massive nine-volume series spanning close to four thousand pages), I'm starting to anticipate a greater sorrow than usual at leaving such a wonderful, richly-detailed world.<br /><br />Fitz, the Fool, and Price Dutiful have returned from their task (as set before them in Fool's Errand), and now everyone's got to balance Dutiful's betrothal to a Narcheska of the Outislands, about which Dutiful himself isn't all that thrilled, with all the day-to-day basics of running a castle. Of course, a number of monkeywrenches are thrown into the works at the worst possible junctures, as well, all of which are left for the reader to uncover while picking through the complex, tangled threads of the tale. (One wonders how Hobb wraps all this up in just six and a half hundred pages.)<br /><br />The major point of criticism to be had with the book (as with its predecessor, and the series' first trilogy) is that Fitz, and many of those around him, would probably not get into nearly as much mischief if everyone would learn to talk to one another instead of trying to keep secrets or deciding that things just aren't important enough to say. Still, as artificial a plot point as that often is (and as much as the fabric wears thin enough in places that it becomes obvious), this is still a cracking good read, as are all the rest in the series, and quite highly recommended here at Goat Central.	2005-07-26

Garth Ennis, Preacher: Alamo (DC Comics, 2001)<br /><br />How do you end one of the finest comics miniseries (easily the finest since Watchmen) in history? If you're Garth Ennis, you take your Texan to the place most notable for the end of Texans-- and then you blow things up.<br /><br />The tale of Jesse, Tulip, and Cassidy comes to a resounding end (though, as is to be expected, with interesting room for sequels) in Alamo. Ennis ties together all the series' loose ends in neat little bows; one wonders how far back he was planning some of the scenes to be found in various bits here. The climax and aftermath fit perfectly with both the underlying theme of the series and the fans' (perceived, anyway) love of the series' bloodlust; simply put, Ennis couldn't have found a better way to end this puppy. Tremendous.	2005-07-26

Peter Parnell, And Tango Makes Three (Simon and Schuster Young Readers, 2005)<br /><br />This kids' book is the kind of thing we need far more of in this world; the (true, mind you) story of two penguins who met and fell in love. Not so abnormal, one is likely to think, except that these two penguins both happened to be male, and they're in the Central Park Zoo. (One has nightmares of the right-wingers challenging the book blaming Harvey Fierstein for the penguins being gay.) Because they seemed somewhat morose that the other penguin couples were having kids, their handler gave them an egg from a couple who were likely to not take care of it, and boom, \\"Tango Has Two Daddies\\" was born. Yep, it's true-- such things do happen in other species of animal, thus hamstringing the \\"unnatural\\" argument espoused by the brainless sheep. (One wonders when there will be a kids' book about gay sheep. One is long overdue. The sheep's names could be Fred and Phelps.)<br /><br />Deserves to be on the bookshelves of the kids of any right-thinking parent.	2005-07-26

(Freeman Mutuels Management, 1982)<br /><br />It's a self-published book about the pari-mutuel industry. Nine hundred ninety-nine of every thousand of you reading this can now skip to the next review. It would be pretty hard to find a book that better fits the definition of \\"vertical market.\\"<br /><br />Still, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend combing used bookstores, hitting library used book sales, keeping your browser set to bookfinder, whatever, if it were really good. However, \\"good\\" is not the word I'd use to describe Wanta Bet? I'd probably be willing to give it a little more leeway had it not been rife with grammatical errors (which, as usual, often show up in the form of \\"way too many commas per sentence\\"); it's somewhat obvious that the Freeman clan not only published the book, but edited it, as well. Casual fans of the history of the various forms of American pari-mutuel wagering (not only playing the horses, but also dog racing and jai-alai) might find some interesting tidbits of history here-- the pari-mutuel industry's technology has come a long, long way in the past quarter-century-- but that's about all. If you're an obsessive collector of books on the subject, hunt this one down, but it can otherwise be safely avoided.	2005-07-26

Dennis Cooper, Jerk (Artspace, 1993)<br /><br />Dennis Cooper's short story \\"Jerk\\" here gets the royal Artspace treatment, with odd puppet sculptures by Nayland Blake that perfectly complement the text. While it predates the obvious comparison, think of this as a really, really dark and twisted Being John Malkovich without the ear tunnel.<br /><br />David Brooks was one of serial killer Dean Corll's two teenaged associates. As the book opens, Brooks has been in prison for some time, and has turned to puppetry as a form of art therapy. With the exception of a few closing pages, the entire story takes place at one of Brooks' puppet shows; Brooks has the audience (and us) read two pieces which he hasn't yet been able to conceptualize in puppetry yet, and plays out long scenes with the puppets at other times. (Note; don't take any of this, despite the historical accuracy of some of the characters, as accurate; it is Corll's other associate, Wayne Henley, who has become known for turning to art therapy in prison; his paintings are in demand on ebay.) Having now read a few of Cooper's novels, I have to say that the short form, I think, works somewhat better for him; \\"Jerk\\"'s brevity plays up the essential weirdness of the scenes Cooper creates, without ending up at an emotional state that comes off as overly world-weary.<br /><br />Nicely done, and a pretty good intro to the weird world of Dennis Cooper.	2005-07-26

Charles Bukowski, In the Shadow of the Rose (Black Sparrow, 1991)<br /><br />It only makes sense that if you're the world's most prolific and bestselling poet, two truisms will occur: first, that anything your publisher puts out in limited edition will cost a painful amount of money to procure, because it will sell out in pre-order, and the rest of the world will pay vast sums to get their grubby hands on it; second, that not all of your material is going to be of the highest quality. The biggest problems in a writer's career occur when these two events coincide.<br /><br />Unfortunately, such is the case with Bukowski's limited edition In the Shadow of the Rose. Dedicated to actor/activist Sean Penn, the book has (not surprisingly) quite a bit to say, in general terms anyway, about some of Penn's pet projects (in the activism, not the acting, world), and as we all know by now, message poetry tends to be boring and ugly, with a vastly overinflated sense of its own self-importance. Many of the pieces to be found here fall into this category. (It should also be noted,with some amusement, that some of the pieces here are far longer than anything in the similarly-limited Beauti-Ful and Other Long Poems.) Sure, there are some places where the spark of Buk's well-documented brilliance shines through-- it even happens in the political poems a time or two. But for the price you're likely to pay for a copy these days, you can (and should) buy the whole corpus that's still available for cover price; much of it's a lot better than this.	2005-07-26

Lemony Snicket, The Grim Grotto (Scholastic, 2004)<br /><br />The Baudelaire orphans continue their adventures in this eleventh book of the celebrated series. A Series of Unfortunate Events has gone through ups and downs over the years, and it's recently been in something of a down phase; this looks as if it's the beginning of an upward swing, and thus I'm cautiously optimistic about book twelve (due out, as I write this, a few months from now).<br /><br />If you've liked the series so far, you're not going to find much different here, and it should do right by you. If you've not liked them, or not experienced them, you should probably either go back and start at the beginning (with the aptly-named The Bad Beginning) or, as Snicket cautions many times, just put the whole thing down and walk away.	2005-07-26

Dennis Cooper, Horror Hospital Unplugged (Juno, 1996)<br /><br />One has to wonder whether Cooper has the same morbid fascination for the movie Horror Hospital evidenced by others of my acquaintance. Why else would he name his wannabe-Nirvana characters after a relatively obscure (and not so relatively silly) British B movie from the seventies? This graphic-novel adaptation of a Cooper short story details the lives of four youths in a band called, not surprisingly, Horror Hospital. Their lead vocalist, Trevor Machine, seems to attract (...) men wherever he goes (and comes out with Cooper's favorite line, \\"But I'm not (...).\\", as many times as a number of his other characters, despite its ringing just as false; it would almost be refreshing to meet a single Cooper character who's secure in his sexuality), resulting in failed relationships that Machine mines for his self-obsessed lyrics. Things get even weirder when David Geffen takes note of the band, and Machine is visited by the ghost of River Phoenix. Folks, you can't make this stuff up. Except that Dennis Cooper, in fact, has.<br /><br />The book is drawn by usually-competent artist Keith Mayerson, and there are certain panels where his competence comes through; for the most part, though, it looks rather like Mayerson was drawing in control-freak-Ronald-Searle mode, but without Searle's particular eye for biting satire. Coupled with the usual Cooper ulta-postmodern disdain for plot linearity, the whole thing ends up coming off, more than anything else, as hard to read, and not in the good way other Cooper works (e.g., My Loose Thread) are hard to read.	2005-07-26

Garth Ennis, Preacher: Salvation (DC Comics, 1999)<br /><br />If you've not yet found your way into the ever-growing cult of Preacher-worship, I'd advise you to do so at your earliest convenience by picking up a copy of Preacher: Gone to Texas. Ignore the wannabe rabblerousers and the like who will tell you how blasphemous the thing is and get yourself hooked.<br /><br />As with most stuff the unthinking crowd denounces as blasphemy without having read it, there's a great deal of spiritual benefit to be found under the surface. In this seventh episode of the nine-book series, Jesse, now separated from Cassidy and Tulip, finds himself back in Texas, in a little town called Salvation. Through various machinations, he finds himself the sheriff of the town, and immediately at loggerheads with Odin Quincannon, owner of the local meatpacking industry. You've been reading. You know what's gonna happen.<br /><br />Under all the grease and grime, Jesse Custer is the classic good guy. He stands for what's right, opposes what's wrong, and tries to get everything back on an even keel (though granted, lots of stuff blows up in the process). And what could possibly be blasphemous about that?<br /><br />No surprise that, once again, Ennis and Dillon have put out a winner. Some folks seem to have missed a minor part of the point (here's a hint: the name of the book, and the name of the town, point the way to figuring out why \\"coincidences\\" pop up here). Another solid entry in an exceptionally solid series.	2005-07-26

Henry House, 1991)<br /><br />The book's attribution is a slight misnomer, though one that will pleasantly surprise readers as yet unfamiliar with it; while Tom Hambleton is a respected enough name in handicapping, the book is actually co-authored by Hambleton, Dick Schmidt, Howard Sartin, and Michael Pizzolla (author of the recent, and fantastic, Handicapping Magic). The book itself, however, is nothing of the sort; this is the introductory primer to pace handicapping a la the Sartin Methodology, and it has gained almost universal fame among horseplayers in that regard. It's a bit pricey for the two-buck crowd in new release, but used copies are often reasonably priced; if you're even a casual horseplayer, it behooves you to pick this book up, read it, study it, learn it, and live it if you want to get back more than pocket change for your bets.<br /><br />The authors promise there's nothing in this book that can't be done with a pencil and paper, and they deliver on that promise, though a few of the tasks are (the first time you do them, anyway) somewhat tedious and time-consuming (compiling track-to-track adjustments being an example). Yet, pound for pound, you're going to be sitting around with pencil and paper for a lot less time with Phase I of the Sartin Methodology than you will with other handicapping techniques. (Brohamer's Modern Pace Handicapping, which comes a few phases later in Sartin development, is complex enough that you'll likely need at least a spreadsheet if you want to spend less than an hour per race, for example.) This is good, solid stuff, and well worth using. The only reason its rating is so (relatively) low is that much of Michael Pizzolla's work here has more recently been expounded and improved upon in his Handicapping Magic, which is even simpler. That said, there's a good deal of information here worth knowing even if you're already a devotee of Pizzolla's book (as all serious horseplayers should be); it definitely deserves a place on your handicapping bookcase.ould be); it definitely deserves a place on your handicapping bookcase.	2005-07-26

Wood, Jr., Killer in Drag (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1965)<br /><br />Ed Wood will forever be remembered as the man who made Hollywood's worst movies. It probably shouldn't be a surprise that his novels are about half a step above stock porn writing. I knew what to expect when I picked up Killer in Drag; somehow, though, I expected it to have the naïve charm of a Plan Nine from Outer Space. More fool me; I should have realized earlier on that books don't have cardboard props that can fall over in the stiff breeze caused by an actor walking past them.<br /><br />Wood resurrects Glen/da, the transvestite he made infamous in Glen or Glenda?, this time as a Syndicate hit man. Erm, woman. Oh, you know the drill. Glen... er, Glenda... wants to get out of the business, and has resigned herself to an assignation with a very rich old queen in order to get the money to finance a sex-change operation, flee to the islands, and get out of the murder business for good. Except that an ex-boyfriend of said old queen bursts in during the height of passion and murders him, leaving Glen a prime suspect (in pumps, no less) and mandating his fleeing the city. It only gets more twisted from there.<br /><br />It's your basic pulp novel-- square jaws and big bosoms (as a recent Russ Meyer biography was titled), even if the bosoms, in this case, are falsies. Wood does impart a little extra dimension into his main character, as the fight for dominance between Glen's and Glenda's personalities raises what would be some interesting opportunities for Wood to really make Glen into a three-dimensional character. Unfortunately, though, Wood chooses to use these bits in the pursuit of quick suspense more than anything else, and they don't go anywhere.<br /><br />Silly and predictable, but certainly no more so (and even a tad less so) than most books of its type. Recommended for Wood and pulp fans, but the rest of you can probably ignore it.	2005-07-26

Mike Carey, John Constantine, Hellblazer: All His Engines (DC Comics, 2005)<br /><br />I'll admit, I was one of those who thought that the departure of Garth Ennis from the Hellblazer fold was going to be synonymous with the gradual falling off in quality that would ultimately result in the title's death. Well, it's been a number of years now, and John Constantine has gotten himself drawn by a whole bunch of different artists, and he always seems to come out pretty clean in the wash. The newest (as of now) title in the series, All His Engines, has the look and feel of a sitcom episode more than anything else-- John finds himself pulled into negotiations between a number of different demons, and with characteristic style and panache, manages to make everything come out right in the end by outfoxing the smarmy so-and-sos. There are tendrils leading to books before (and, one figures, groundwork laid for the next series or two), but All His Engines is very much a self-contained episode. This makes it an excellent place to start if you're not yet familiar with the series, is the writing and artwork is competent; it doesn't have the flair of some of the earlier episodes, but you won't get lost in the plot, either.	2005-07-26

We get a good deal of insight into Jesse's character, which is all well and good, and meet a bunch of new bad guys (and Jesse's family are the least of the lot, to be sure).

Cormac McCarthy, No Country for Old Men (Knopf, 2005)<br /><br />The defining trait of every Cormac McCarthy novel to date is that it has defined the notion that the more difficult a book is to read, the more rewarding it will be than any author's work since Gunter Grass completed the Danzig Trilogy. When I got a new McCarthy novel, I sat myself down and prepared for three months of struggling with language, but knew that I would have, at the end, read one of the finest, most fulfilling novels I had read that year.<br /><br />Now, eight years since his last published work, McCarthy drops No Country for Old Men on the heads of an unsuspecting public. And McCarthy has created in this book something he has never created before: a truly readable novel. I got through the three hundred five pages (and it's slight for a McCarthy, too-- perhaps his shortest book since Child of God) in slightly over two weeks. It took me twice that to read Child of God, for heaven's sake.<br /><br />One might reasonably expect that an increase in the readability (which of course translates to \\"commercial accessibility\\") of McCarthy's output might lead to a concomitant decrease in the satisfaction one gets from a McCarthy novel. I can very happily say that such has not in the least occurred. While No Country for Old Men is not the pinnacle of brilliance that was Blood Meridian, very few novels are, and it is almost unfair to compare anything, even McCarthy's other works, to the perfection of Blood Meridian. No Country for Old Men, however, easily holds its own with the rest of McCarthy's considerable opus.<br /><br />The book centers, as much as it can center, on Ed Tom Bell, the sheriff of a small border county in Texas. One of the residents of said county, Llewellyn Moss, stumbles upon a drug deal gone very bad out in the desert. He finds a cache of money in the wreckage and takes it for himself, triggering a manhunt both by hired assassin Anton Chigurh and by Bell, who wants to bring Moss in and protect him. Bell is the key character only by virtue of the fact that he gets the most screen time (a short monologue of Bell's opens each of the novel's thirteen chapters); Moss and Chigurh also get a good amount of time, along with some minor characters.<br /><br />The story is told, as fans of McCarthy's will not be surprised to find, in impressionist fashion. In a Cormac McCarthy novel, there is no such thing as a climax, a denouement, or any of the other literary terms you hear even less often than those. There is a narrative, and McCarthy spins it, telling you as much by the pieces of the story he leaves out as by those he relates, forcing the reader to fill in a number of details, looking for things that don't really exist. It is a country that is solely McCarthy's, at this point in time, and he treads it well. But he's carved out a new section of this territory, one that's closer to what you're used to reading. This book is more a conventional thriller, as much as anything McCarthy writes can be called \\"conventional,\\" and it seems the holes one expects with impressionist writing are slightly smaller (with one exception, early on in the novel, that will be easily recognizable).<br /><br />To heap any Cormac McCarthy novel with the usual superlatives (\\"a stunning achievement\\" keeps buzzing around in my head) would be to do a disservice to the novel. Charles Hatton said of Secretariat, after his record-shattering Belmont Stakes victory, \\"his only point of reference is himself.\\" Cormac McCarthy is one of the handful of living American novelists (Wendy Walker, Kathe Koja, and Barry Hannah being the other three I'm aware of) to whom that statement can be applied without reservation.

Michael Moynihan and Didrik Soderlind, Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground, revised edition (Feral House, 2003)<br /><br />If ever a book was meant to be read in tandem with Mother Angelica: Her Life Story, this is it. Moynihan and Soderlind trace the emergence of Norwegian black metal (touching on its rise in other countries, of course, but focusing on the antics of Norway) through both the musical and criminal aspects. By now, the whole world is probably well aware of what the supposed \\"Black Circle\\" were getting up to in Norway in the early nineties (assuming there ever really was a Black Circle; Moynihan and Soderlind don't much opine on that subject, and their interviewees give conflicting information). The authors seek here not to glorify everything that happened, but to document it in the most objective of ways, giving ample airtime to both sides of every argument. There are times when that may seem like overkill (specifically, an interview with Emperor vocalist Ihsahn is followed by two interviews with others, one of whom believes Ihsahn means everything he says, the other doesn't), but what emerges is a picture that's as balanced as it can be when the topics under discussion are not only very loud music, but also murder, grave desecration, church burning, and that sort of thing.<br /><br />It's a pretty good guess that anyone who actually dives into this book is going to have at least a skeletal familiarity with both the crimes documented and the major players, but the book is written in such a way that, I believe, even those with no concept of what black metal is will quickly get everything straight in their heads. There's a pretty big cast of characters, especially early on, but they're pretty easy to discern from one another. Also, Moynihan and Soderlind don't make the mistake that so many chroniclers have of treating the music as if it's nothing more than talentless banging; they offer opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of various bands from the perspective of people who have actually spent enough time listening to the material to be able to pick such things out.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of black metal or not (for that matter, whether you're a fan of rock music at all or not), there's a great deal of interest here. This is as much a piece of true crime writing as music journalism, and seems one of the more balanced pieces of writing in either genre.

Dennis Cooper, My Loose Thread (Canongate, 2001)<br /><br />My Loose Thread is above all a difficult book to read. Not just because Cooper is obviously a born-and-bred postmodern writer, but because this is not subject matter that's going to sit well with most folks, and the confusion engendered by both the style and having a narrator who gives new meaning to the word \\"unreliable\\" can make this book into something of a chore. However, once you get down to the meat of the novel, it's worth it.<br /><br />Larry is a teen who is, shall we say, somewhat messed up. He's having problems dealing with confusion. A whole lot of problems, in fact. Not only is he struggling with his emerging homosexuality (he denies, to himself and others, that he's gay, but it's pretty obvious to the reader he's in denial), which comes out in part in a sexual relationship with his younger brother, but also with the death of his friend Rand after the two of them fought. Even though Rand seems to have died of natural causes, Larry can't help but blame himself, for relatively obvious reasons. Thanks (we gather) due to the new mystique surrounding Larry in certain circles as a result of Rand's death, he's been approached by Gilman Crowe, head of the school's Nazi sect, to kill a fellow student and get the kid's notebook. (Whether Larry is then supposed to turn the notebook over to Crowe or destroy it is a piece of the puzzle which shifts throughout the novel.) As the book opens, Larry is doing the deed with the help of his on-again off-again girlfriend Jude and her other lover Pete; Larry comes into possession of the notebook, reads it, and finds his world tilting even further askew. Why this is, we never quite find out, but some conclusions can be drawn by the rest of the novel's events.<br /><br />The first point of artistry the reader is likely to notice here is that Cooper never actually quotes from the kid's notebook-- it achieves a sort of iconic status as the novel progresses, but the reader can only infer the vaguest details about its contents. It's the literary equivalent of the nameless thing-in-the-trunk in Pulp Fiction; no one knows what it is, but everyone who comes into contact with it is in some way changed. The second point is that despite Larry's inability to be honest with himself (and thus the reader, as the book is told from Larry's POV), we emerge with a relatively complete picture of him. We can never quite be sure what he's doing, but by the end of the book, we have an idea of why he's doing it. The act of getting to know Larry is the reader's basic task with this novel, and rest assured, you'll have to work for it. If you succeed, however, you will definitely feel as if the time you've spent mulling over the events here was well worth it.

Mike Huckabee, Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork (Center Street, 2005)<br /><br />One doesn't expect diet books from the governors of Southern states. But that's exactly what one gets with Mike Huckabee's Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork. Well, perhaps \\"diet book\\" isn't quite the proper term. Huckabee is not talking about getting thin through dieting here; he's talking about the same thing doctors have been telling us for years, that changing our eating and exercise habits is what will ultimately lead us to good health. While the book does certainly have its shortcomings (anyone advocating \\"the size of my fist\\" as a realistic portion size in twenty-first century America has, simply, lost touch with reality), Huckabee puts forth common sense in a way that most people can understand-- to the point where I'm rather confused the Republicans haven't kicked him out as a traitor yet. (If it happens, Governor, we Libertarians will be happy to have you.)<br /><br />The most important thing Huckabee does here is put forth the idea of starting small and working your way up. The ludicrous idea that you have to work out for a certain length of time in order to get any positive benefit is nowhere to be found. Instead, Huckabee suggests starting with slow walking for twelve minutes. I can hear fitness gurus and authors of fad diet books shrieking in agony now at the very suggestion that one might get positive benefits from twelve minutes of slow walking, but that such a thing could be helpful to a completely sedentary person should be obvious to any thinking human being. And that's what's ultimately worthwhile about this book-- Huckabee wrote it for thinking human beings.<br /><br />I never thought I'd be saying \\"recommended\\" about a nonfiction book by a Republican that was written after the time of Calvin Coolidge, but there you have it.	2005-07-07

Kelly Cherry, Rising Venus (Louisiana State University Press, 2002)<br /><br />Kelly Cherry's fifth book of poetry is a decided step down from her previous work. Flashes of the brilliance that informed earlier collections are still here, but overall, this was something of a disappointment. There are full sections of the book that have a throwaway feel to them, as if the pieces therein were simply dashed off to have something to put into the book, rather than crafted with the usual care and skill. The meter and rhyme are often lost altogether, leading to rather uncomfortable places where rhyme and free verse mix with all the harmony of gasoline and styrofoam. Yet, still, the book does have its moments; the section of ekphrastic pieces, while some of its poems could have been trimmed (or omitted altogether, in one or two short cases), gives the reader some semblance of what Cherry can accomplish when she's really on her game.<br /><br />Definitely not a good starting point with Cherry's work; get familiar with her through one of the earlier collections of poetry or one of the books of short stories instead.	2005-07-07

Dan O'Neill, Mother Angelica: Her Life Story (Crossroad, 1986)<br /><br />As I write this, Mother Angelica has recently turned eighty-two years old. I was mildly surprised to find out she's still alive, but she's soldiering on, as always. O'Neill's thin tome on Mother Angelica's life, published almost twenty years ago, is crying out for a revised-and-updated edition to bring us up to speed on what the woman's been up to for the past two decades besides keeping Mother Angelica Live one of the highest-rated religious programs on television, but the 1986 edition is a halfway decent start.<br /><br />The book's title accurately reflects it contents: a brief life of Mother Angelica, the Franciscan nun who, if you've been living in a cave for the past quarter-century, made headlines all over the place by starting the Eternal Word Television Network, the first Catholic mouthpiece of its kind. One has to wonder at how accurate some of the reflections are here; O'Neill states more than once that much of the text for the book came from interviews with Mother Angelica, and never mentions doing much legwork to back any of it up. Ironically, Mother Angelica's life reads, in this text, rather like one of the Lives of the Saints which she disparages because they make the saints seem too saintly; \\"we need to see more of their human side,\\" she says. Such is also the case here. Mother Angelica's pre-convent life is painted as a truly dire set of circumstances, which (aside from trials of faith) makes a complete reversal upon her becoming a nun. Not to say that's not exactly what happened; Mother Angelica spent her childhood and youth during the Great Depression and World War II, and circumstances were dire for many people. But were the convents really that much better off?<br /><br />The book ends up sounding like your typical tale of inspiration, which probably has much more to do with O'Neill's writing style-- the language used and the sentence structure read more like a young adult biography than one written for the over-18 crowd-- than it has to do with Mother Angelica herself. Still, as far as tales of inspiration go, this one's a pretty easy read. And you can't help but admire the woman.g adult biography than one written for the over-18 crowd-- than it has to do with Mother Angelica herself.

Tina Chang, Half-Lit Houses (Four Way, 2004)<br /><br />In my review of Brigit Kelly's The Orchard, I talked about lighter reading, and I didn't necessarily mean that in a bad way; some poetry is brilliant, but light reading (and no, cod help us, I'm not talking about light verse); Li-Young Lee's stuff comes to mind. It's got all sorts of depth to it, but you can read it for the surface and still get something out of it. Those who wish to pursue deeper meanings may do so. Everyone's happy. The vast majority of poetry falls into either this category or that of Kelly, where you're basically forced into deeper meanings.<br /><br />Tina Chang seems to fall somewhere in the middle, which is exceptionally rare. There are pieces here that force the reader into needing to look deeper, but they are few. There are pieces that can be read for surface beauty alone and have the option to go deeper, but they, too, are few. The rest of the pieces here sit in a place in between those two things, and it's a place I'm not quite sure I know how to describe. Wherever it is, it's delicate and beautiful, and Tina Chang deserves a far, far wider audience than she presently has.<br /><br />This is poetry of family, stretching back from before Chang's birth (at least, if the one passing reference she makes to the age of a narrator is to be taken as her own) to the present day, presenting the stories one hears about families with a rich history, doing so in a lush, precise language. There's not a single poem in this collection that misses the mark. It's easily one of the two or three best collections I've come across this year, and is well worth your time.	2005-07-07

Tom Piccirilli, November Mourns (Bantam, 2005)<br /><br />Tom Piccirilli's last novel, A Choir of Ill Children, did more for the southern gothic genre than any single book since Flannery O'Connor was in her glory days. Now, with November Mourns, Piccirilli gives us another piece of that same pie, and like the last one, it's mighty tasty.<br /><br />Piccirilli is less in Peyton Place mode and more in the realm of Sam Spade in November Mourns. Shad Jenkins has been in prison for two years after assaulting a boy who attempted to rape his sister. Shortly before he is released, his sister is found dead on Gospel Trail Road, with no mark but a light scratch on one cheek. Shad goes home to find out what happened to his sister, and in the process find out why it is that everyone in town has said for many years to never go up Gospel Trail Road.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, there's still more than enough of Grace-Metalious-meets-Appalachia here for the most ardent tabloid reader to get a real kick out of this book, but there's more of a focus on an actual goal here. Shad wants to find out what happened to his sister, and just happens to uncover a bunch of dirty little secrets along the way. Because of the goal, November Mourns ends up being a slightly easier read than A Choir of Ill Children was, and Piccirilli's seemingly native ability to pace a novel has more influence here; this is one of those books where you start out looking up every so often and seeing you've gone ten pages, then halfway through you look up and see you've gone fifty, and you've no idea where the time went. His main characters are well-drawn, though some of the minor characters suffer (mostly for simply not having enough time in the book; there's a much bigger cast here than there was in Choir), and Shad Jenkins is one of those characters who will stay in your memory for quite a while after you've finished turning pages; it's almost as if someone uprooted one of S. E. Hinton's urban youths, turned him redneck, and dropped him into the mountains. Great stuff.

[note: approximately 150 words cut from review due to Amazon length requirements.]<br /><br />Steven Erikson, Memories of Ice (Bantam, 2001)<br /><br />That a book makes me cry is something of a rarity, despite the fact that movies make me cry at roughly the drop of a hat (one of the reasons I usually avoid chick flicks). That a book makes me cry for fifty solid pages? Unheard of.<br /><br />Memories of Ice is the third novel in Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series, which is already a major player in the current field of high-fantasy epic series. That's saying something, because that field is probably more crowded than it has ever been, and with that much more being published, an author has to do a whole lot more to write something truly exceptional. In Steven Erikson's case, he's focused on two aspects of Tolkein that have been sadly neglected in most fantasy writing since-- martial writing and the gritty detail of worldbuilding. Post-Tolkein martial writing in fantasy languished for a number of years before finding a worthy outlet in Elizabeth Moon. I'd hoped that we'd get some really good stuff after that, but Moon started writing more science fiction, where there's always been more good stuff on troop movements, and it disappeared for a while. Erikson has revived it, and on a far wider scale than either Moon or, indeed, Tolkein ever imagined it. Sure, anyone who writes sword-and-sorcery stuff that involves fighting has to do some martial writing, but comparing most authors' battle writing (including such greats as George R. R. Martin) to Erikson's is like comparing a level 1 wizard with a dagger fighting a kobold in Dungeons and Dragons to an all-out epic-level \\"we need eighty more boxes of miniatures for this...\\" battle in Chainmail. They both have their place, but for grandeur, there's no comparison.<br /><br />As for the world-building, again, everyone does it. You have to. And most people will throw in an odd detail or three to make you sure that this isn't, in fact, an alternate Earth (unless you are the aforementioned Martin, whose epic does, in fact, take place on an alternate Earth). What Erikson has done with this series is impressive; about the only things his world has in common with Earth is that they both have ground, water, and air, and you may question even those assumptions a time or two. This is a world that is, for all intents and purposes, utterly alien, and with overwhelming amounts of complex detail, and yet Erikson has written it all in such a way that the reader will be able to get it all figured out in his head for too long.<br /><br />Here I'm going on about the brilliance of the whole series, rather than this book. Deadhouse Gates, the second book in the series, was a brief diversion from the continent of Genabackis and the exploits of the Bridgeburners. Memories of Ice picks up where the first book, Gardens of the Moon, left off, and the timelines of the two books run concurrently. This time, the Bridgeburners are fighting the Pannion Domin, a tyrannical empire looming up from the south who seem unstoppable. In order to do so, they have to ally with their enemies from Gardens of the Moon, Anomander Rake and his pal Caladan Brood, as well as gathering as many allies from the surrounding areas as possible. Needless to say, though, there are machinations within machinations, and both allies and enemies are cropping up where the Bridgeburners never expected to find them.<br /><br />Unlike the first two books in the series, Memories of Ice gets a faster start, and is more readable from the get-go, but it's still a pretty slow starter. Erikson is obviously happiest when he's writing big battles, and fully the latter half of this nine-hundred-page doorstop is taken up with descriptions of two battles and their surrounding events. Despite us having a number of old friends to look forward to seeing again, there are a number of new characters we need introduced to, and we get them in the first hundred fifty pages or so, along with some reacquainting of ourselves with the Bridgeburners still on Genabackis, Anomander Rake, Kruppe, and the rest of the bunch. Everyone eventually sets off for Capustan to stop the Pannion Domin in its tracks, and once again, as with the first two books, when the swords start swinging and the cussers start blasting, you will forego food and sleep to find out what happens next.<br /><br />It's about as good as Deadhouse Gates, and I had intended to give it the same rating until I got to the last chapter. The last battle has been fought, and all the loose ends are being tied up, but it's the way in which Erikson ties them up that's so stunning. He'd already given new meaning to the phrase \\"kill your darlings,\\" laid the groundwork for the next two books (House of Chains and Midnight Tides are both presaged here) at least, destroyed a couple of major cities, etc. What more can the man do? In short, wraps things up, and in Memories of Ice, he does so with the same spirit and depth that infuses his martial writing. These are characters with whom we've spent, in some cases, upwards of sixteen hundred pages, though the most poignant passages in the wrap-up here occur with characters we've met just in this novel. It is testament to Erikson's ability to characterize that a reader can empathize so deeply with Erikson's characters, despite so much of the book taking place on so massive a scale.<br /><br />This is an amazing novel in an amazing series. If you're a fan of fantasy-- and even if you're not-- and you haven't given Steven Erikson's Malazan books a try yet, you're doing yourself a disservice.

John Hollander, Types of Shape, revised edition (Yale, 1991)<br /><br />John Hollander first appeared in the public eye way back in the fifties, when his first book was selected for the Yale Series of Younger Poets. Since then, Hollander has carved himself an exceptionally distinguished career in American letters, and deservedly so. Types of Shape is a worthy addition to the Hollander bookshelf, with the revised 1991 edition (it was originally published in the late sixties) just adding more of a good thing.<br /><br />Types of Shape collects a number of Hollander's shape poems (these days perhaps better known as calligrammes, after Guillaume Apollinaire's term for them). In essence, it's a poem that takes the shape of whatever it is the poem is written about, be that a harpsichord, New York state, an arrow, etc. You probably wrote one of these back when you were in grade school, didn't you? (It's okay to admit it. Writing poetry is manly now, didn't you know?) Don't make the mistake, however, of passing this type of thing off as exclusively kid stuff; Hollander more than capably shows here that form can enhance the meaning in an already good piece (he states in the introduction that if it's not a good poem when the lines are flush left, then it's not going to be a good shape. Amen), not to mention lending it an air of playfulness and artistry.<br /><br />If you're not yet familiar with Hollander, the thirty-five pieces here are a great start. If you're already a fan, you should already have this.	2005-07-07

Jeff Lindsay, Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Doubleday, 2004)<br /><br />The thing I keep hearing about this novel, over and over again, is how original it is. Okay, folks, listen up, 'cause I'll only say this once-- the serial killer who only kills bad people is not a new concept. (Anyone remember The Toxic Avenger?) For that matter, it's come into something of a renaissance recently, so much so that the series premiere of the new TV show The Inside dealt with it. If scriptwriters for a TV show are onto something, guys, it's old news.<br /><br />That said, Darkly Dreaming Dexter is still quite the fun read. The pages turn quickly, and Dexter truly is a likable sort of guy, though he continues the recent trend in my reading of narrators so unreliable you have to wonder about the sanity of their creators. Dexter constantly refers to himself as a sociopath, unhuman. The first may be true, but much of Dexter's development throughout the book is not a struggle to become (or against becoming) human as much as it is a struggle with himself to keep from recognizing his own humanity. Dexter, while a far more likable protagonist, shares a lot of traits with Larry, the disaffected (to put it mildly) youth in Dennis Cooper's recent novel My Loose Thread.<br /><br />While the plot of Darkly Dreaming Dexter definitely plays second fiddle to us getting to know Dexter (this is the first book in a projected series), there is, in fact, a plot, and it's a pretty good one; Dexter, who when he's not out killing bad folks is a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police, gets drawn into an investigation of a serial killer who's not taunting the police in general, but is definitely trying to send some sort of message to Dexter in particular. The problem is that Dexter can't figure out whether the killer's trying to say \\"I'm coming after you\\" or \\"Hi! Want to play?\\"<br /><br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter is your basic beach read-- empty calories. It's a good book, but not one that's destined to stick with you for a long time after you close the cover. (I finished it five days ago, and just now, while thinking about it, had trouble remembering the identity of the killer.)

Brigit Pegeen Kelly, The Orchard (BOA Editions, 2004)<br /><br />The Orchard is the kind of book one doesn't see too often these days; it's poetry that's \\"academic\\" in the trust sense of the word, thick almost to the point of unreadability with diction that's just this side of archaic, layer upon layer of symbolism, and all that sort of thing that makes high school and college English professors foam at the mouth. There is little doubt in my mind, having read this book, that Kelly is on the fast track to canonization; this is substantiated by The Orchard having been nominated for a National Book Critics' Circle Award this year. Because of all this, there's the temptation to compare her to poets already in the canon (there's certainly a good argument to be made for comparing her style and diction, and probably substance, to that of, say, Pound, or to a lesser extent Eliot). I'll try to avoid it, given the length limits I'm stuck with, but those with more room than I have might want to take a crack at it.<br /><br />The basic problem with the canon is that, while it's often beautiful work (as is the case here), it sometimes lets the simple factors of readability and accessibility fall by the wayside in order to be deep. The best poets who flirt with canonization-- Li-Young Lee is the one who springs immediately to mind-- have the depth and flavor, but also have that surface layer that says \\"here's a poem; if all you get out of it is what you see on the surface, that's okay.\\" Kelly's work has a marked absence of this trait; the language itself almost seems to be pointing the reader toward the depths, saying \\"in order to get anything out of this poem, you'd best come armed with a knowledge of mythology, and an OED would probably help as well.\\" Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but it's likely to turn away those not yet familiar with poetry these days; as we all know, at the turn of the twenty-first century, \\"those not yet familiar with poetry\\" is, well, almost everyone.<br /><br />Recommended for advanced readers.

Plumptre's short, heavily illustrated work surveys the glory days of British racing with an amused, slightly jaundiced eye. It's a pleasure to dip into now and again, though the average reader isn't going to want to go through it from beginning to end.<br /><br />It's not only racing fans who will cotton to this one; fans of royalwatching will also find a good deal to like here, both in the contemporary descriptions of royal life quoted by Plumptre and the obvious pleasure the contemporary press took in seeing various royalty fall to scandal and disaster throughout the era. Both groups of readers will find a good deal to like here; others may find it rather stuffy, but amusing.	2005-07-07

Pete Hautman, Godless (Simon and Schuster, 2004)<br /><br />A wonderful idea of a young adult book resides in these pages-- what would happen if a couple of teenagers started their own religion? And they do. Jason Block (never explicitly shown as a school outcast but implied as one throughout) has had it with religion, bullies, and pretty much everything. While he and his friend Shin are out collecting snails for Shin's gastropodarium, Henry, the local bully, comes along and punches Jason out (for no reasno we're ever given, but Jason isn't the world's most reliable narrator). While lying on the ground seeing stars under the town's water tower, Jason forms the idea of a religion that worships the water tower-- Chutengodianism. Shin comes along for the ride, and the two of them begin, slowly, to gather converts. Needless to say, that's when everything starts to go wrong.<br /><br />Godless is by no means a perfect book (towards the end, astute readers of an advanced enough age will start seeing extreme similarities to Rona Jaffe's Mazes and Monsters, not a bad thing, but does carry a slight odor of copout), but it's certainly a fun one. Raises a good number of questions that are well worth raising at the reading level where one would be picking this book up (Booklist pegs it for the 7th-10th grade crowd, but adults will get a kick out of it as well). Won a National Book Award this year. I'll leave you to decide whether it deserved one, but it's certainly a good read.	2005-07-07

James Jessen Badal, In the Wake of the Butcher (Kent State University Press, 2001)<br /><br />On the back of In the Wake of the Butcher, mystery writer Les Roberts says, \\"...In the Wake of the Butcher reads like a suspense novel.\\" If this is Roberts' idea of a suspense novel, I think I'll be passing on his books.<br /><br />In the Wake of the Butcher is, not to put too fine a point on it, dry as dust; it's almost as if Badal were consciously attempting to write a textbook. While the subject matter is inherently interesting-- a recap and dissection of Cleveland's notorious Torso murders from the Depression years-- somehow, the narrative and diction manage to make the information as boring as your basic police report, but with the added monotony of a State of the Union address.<br /><br />The first half of the book is a chronological recounting of the discoveries of various bodies, both those officially attributed to the Torso killer and those only suspected of being his handiwork (the more famous Black Dahlia murder, often linked to the Torso killings in the media consciousness, is not mentioned until a few brief paragraphs at the end of the book, however). The latter half is a recounting of the various serious suspects the police investigated and whether or not the evidence bears them out as real suspects. It will not surprise anyone remotely familiar with the case that the greatest number of pages in the book is devoted to Francis Sweeney, long believed to be the best fit for the murderer, and yet Badal ultimately dismisses him.<br /><br />This could have been a truly gripping account of one of the darkest (and most underexposed) pieces of criminal activity in American history; instead, it's probably worth reading for those with an already-established interest in the case. Others will want to avoid it.	2005-07-07

Frank Miller, Sin City: The Hard Goodbye (Dark Horse, 1994(?))<br /><br />The Hard Goodbye was the first of the Sin City collections, retitled for its 2005 reissue that coincided with the film. Those of you who have seen the film, this is the story of Marv and Kevin. Those of you who haven't, this is the story of Marv, a two-time loser framed for murder, and Kevin, a shy, retiring boy who never speaks. In the world of the comics, it served more to introduce a number of characters we'd be seeing later on in the series (Nancy, the girls of Old Town, Lucille, etc.), but the story's a corker as well. Miller roared out of the darkness with this one, creating a series that remains to this day one of the most popular modern comics in existence.<br /><br />Why is it so popular? It's not just the impeccable skill of the drawing and the oppressive noir atmosphere Miller creates. It's not the many, many nods to forties and fifties hardboiled detective novels. It's not action that moves at the speed of a barrelling freight train about to derail. All of these things make the Sin City books a pleasure to read, to be sure, but what truly separates Sin City from the pack is Miller's characters. Miller is the Stephen King of comic writers; where most authors will spread getting to know the characters over the course of a number of issues in traditional comics style, Miller's characterizations tend to show up with a few well-placed lines and well-chosen words, allowing for the creation of minor players just as deep and complex as the main characters (Lucille, especially, is particularly well-rounded-- no pun intended). It all combines into a thick, meaty stew that's a true pleasure to the palate. ****	2005-06-28

Frank Miller, Sin City: That Yellow Bastard (Dark Horse, 1997)<br /><br />Miller's epic Sin City continues apace with this fourth book in the series, another used in the movie (it's the frame within the frame, with Bruce Willis as Hartigan and Jessica Alba as Nancy). This one, I have to say, suffers a bit, having seen the film, if only because the effectiveness of the jarring between the two halves of the story is a little more effective when you've got a bunch of stuff going on between the two pieces.<br /><br />Frank Hartigan is a cop who's on his way to retirement. On his last day, an informant drops him a piece of news regarding a long ongoing case that involves the son of Senator Roark torturing and killing young girls. Hartigan goes to get the guy, and through a series of misadventures, ends up shooting him, but getting plugged pretty good himself. Fast-forward eight years-- Hartigan has been framed for the girl's kidnapping and has spent the intervening time in solitary confinement. Now he's out on parole after giving the board a false confession, only he's being trailed by a sick, pathetic jaundiced guy; how does he fit into it all?<br /><br />Well, okay, the book makes it a little more obvious a little earlier on than the movie does (in the movie, the revelation really is a revelation; in the book, it's more \\"well, duh\\"). Still, everything about the whole series that makes it great is present here in the same proportions, and Miller has turned out yet another compulsively readable story from the eight million that make up the naked city. Erm, wait, that's a different comic. But anyway, Miller's doing some fantastic work, and it's well worth your time. ****	2005-06-28

Rick Geary, The Beast of Chicago (ComicsLit, 2003)<br /><br />Man, this is a brilliant idea: a graphic novel about H. H. Holmes, who after decades of obscurity has returned to prominence thanks to The Devil in the White City. (Put aside that Allan W. Eckert attempted to revive the Holmes mystique in the thrilling The Scarlet Mansion twenty years before, one of the formative books of my childhood and youth, and one that desperately needs to come back into print at this particular point in history.) Think of all the fun stuff you could do with a serial killer graphic novel! Oh, wait, you don't have to, you can read From Hell. (And you should.) But, let's face it, we know a lot more about H. H. Holmes, and we suspect even more, and all the great floor plans for that fantastic house are simply begging for graphic novel treatment.<br /><br />So why is Geary's attempt at the subject matter a paltry, albeit quite gorgeous and wonderfully packaged, eighty pages long? I've no idea. (As a side light, this is the first graphic novel I've read recently where the people who catalog this stuff at the library shouldn't be fired outright for putting it in the YA section, which is rather ironic given its subject matter.) He could have spent eighty pages just on drawings of various aspects of the house, with all its twisting passageways, secret rooms, laboratories, and the like. Instead, the Castle itself gets about a fifth of that, with Holmes' exploits both before and after taking up considerably more room.<br /><br />His is worth checking out, because it is quite beautifully drawn and does shed light on a much-neglected chapter of American history, but it seems more like a skeletal outline than a finished product. Hopefully, there will be a revised, expanded edition somewhere down the line that does Holmes-- and his victims-- the justice they deserve. ***	2005-06-28

David Auburn, Proof (Dramatists Play Service, 2001)<br /><br />I spent a good deal of my elementary and junior high school years reading plays, as I fancied myself an actor back in the day. A somewhat bad actor, to be sure, but I did manage to score the role of Reb Nahum in our fifth-grade production of Fiddler on the Roof. (Go me!) Acting in theater, however small, gave me a taste for reading plays, and it was quite enjoyable. Somewhere along the way, though, I tailed off, and it has only been recently (as in, in the past month) I've rediscovered the pleasure of reading a stage play. Proof is the second one I've encountered since starting again, and if the quality of these two is anything to go by, I've obviously been missing out on quite a bit in the quarter-century I haven't been keeping up.<br /><br />Proof is the story of a guy, a girl, and a mathematical equation. Which may not sound all that interesting when put that way, but it is. The girl is the daughter of a mathematical genius who suffered, while still young, a debilitating mental illness. (Think A Beautiful Mind without the paranoia and racism.) The guy is one of his doctoral students from the recent past, when he had a lucid year and briefly advised students at the local university again. The mathematical equation-- well, you'll just have to see, or read, the play.<br /><br />In a very short span of pages (seventy-four, to be precise), Auburn creates two compelling characters (and a few equally compelling minor players), puts them into a situation, and gives us enough to care about them in the most minimal fashion possible; while there's too much going on for the brevity of the play to really focus on the two of them, the reader still comes to understand much about their depth and various quirks. (It's not for nothing this play won a Drama Pulitzer.) There's no real revelation here; it's almost as if Proof is actually the prequel to whatever it is Auburn really wants to write about these characters. But it works, and it works very well. Enjoyable, and highly recommended. ****rs. But it works, and it works very well. Enjoyable, and highly recommended. ****	2005-06-28

Jason Brannon, Puzzles of Flesh (Silver Lake Publishing, 2002)<br /><br />I'm a pretty big fan of the horror anthology. I've been reading them almost as long as I've been capable of reading, and my tendency to do so may have run a little more sparse now that I have more disparate interests, but I do try and read a few of them every year that I haven't previously happened across. I stumbled upon Jason Brannon's anthology in a Half Price Books that has been wonderful at yielding small-press horror into my hands over the past couple of years, and I tucked into it with all the anticipation of a guy who really, really hates turkeys sitting down to a twenty-pounder at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />In retrospect, I might have waited a bit. I've just recently read two of the strongest horror anthologies to come across my desk in years, Greg Gifune's Heretics and Dale Bailey's The Resurrection Man's Legacy and Other Stories, and thus Brannon's book jets compared simply by juxtaposition. It is found wanting, though not, admittedly, by much.<br /><br />Brannon's great strength is that the man is full of fantastic ideas. I mean, really fantastic. Coming up with a great story these days is mostly a matter of putting a new twist on an old plot (there are, after all, only thirty-six plots, so pundits tell us), and Brannon's ability to add fierce originality to old bones is more striking than, perhaps, any writing of short-form horror since the days in which Clive Barker penned the Books of Blood some twenty years ago. Communicating with the dead is certainly nothing new. Communicating with the dead through a computer chat room? Now that's sexy. It's also obvious that Brannon isn't just spreading the veneer on because it seemed like the thing to do; he knows what he's on about with this stuff, and everything meshes well because he can tack on the correct details to let those who patronize Internet chat rooms know that he knows his stuff.<br /><br />Countering that strength is that Brannon is still something of a diamond in the rough. The prose gets a little purple now and again, but that's nothing a bit more experience and a good editor won't take care of over time.<br /><br />The end result is that if you pick this up, you might be holding some of the first work of a future superstar in the horror realm. Never a bad thing-- just ask the folks who have mint first editions of the Books of Blood. You will, however, find a few places on the path where the mortar isn't quite joined, and you may stumble a few times. ***hat Brannon is still something of a diamond in the rough.

Michael Casey, The Million Dollar Hole (Orchises Press, 2002)<br /><br />Michael Casey returns with another book of military-fueled poetry, thirty years after the buzzsaw that was Obscenities, which was chosen for the 1972 Yale Series of Younger Poets award (and remains, to my knowledge, the best-selling volume in the history of that august series). It would likely be somewhat flip to compare Casey to James Jones, but I kept coming back to the comparison; where Obscenities was Casey's The Thin Red Line, The Million Dollar Hole is From Here to Eternity, but without Deborah Kerr around.<br /><br />This is the military in peacetime, the day-to-day life that is both boon and bane to soldiers who aren't off fighting a war. Casey captures the underlying sentiments all to well. When his vets reminisce, the reader can hear both the vestiges of terror and the paradoxical ghost of a wish that there were still action to be had. (One of the characters in this book, in fact, seems to find ways to bring the action back to the hinterlands of Missouri, and the reaction by his comrades is a perfect mirror to that of soldiers remembering the scarier moments that shadowed the face of Obscenities.)<br /><br />Casey wears the heart of the Beats on his sleeve, and the book's shortcoming is hat, at times, it bleeds a little too much. The Beats could write novels, but the poetry they turned out was often gut-churningly bad; it's little wonder to any discerning reader of poetry that the really good poets working in the era distanced themselves from the Beats as far and as fast as possible (the obvious example here being Charles Bukowski). While Casey is a far better poet than any of the lot, there is still at times a little too much of an echo of the prosaic. Don't let that stop you from reading this; hopefully, there are enough of the legions who bought Obscenities still buying poetry to make this into another major seller. Just be prepared for a little lag now and again amidst the otherwise fine work. ** ½otherwise fine work. ** 	2005-06-28

Jay Ingram, The Velocity of Honey (Thunder's Mouth Press, 2003)<br /><br />There is a kind of niche genre in publishing that involves taking complicated science and stripping it of all its jargon to make it (somewhat) understandable to mortal men. Some authors are good at it. Some are great. The reigning king of \\"great,\\" of course, is Martin Gardner (Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?), and thus it is that, in general, all books of \\"stripped-down science\\" will eventually get compared to Gardner. And thus, we come to Jay Ingram, whose The Velocity of Honey has been all the rage among in-the-know readers for the past year or so.<br /><br />Jay Ingram is good. His short pieces do a capable job of taking controversial things that require numerous long, unintelligible equations to explain and phrasing it all in such a way that the great unwashed have a chance of grasping the science behind it all. And his topics are by and large interesting, such as the title essay, on why it is that honey does that whole bending-over-on-itself thing when you drizzle it onto your morning pancakes.<br /><br />But good is not great. When you stack Ingram up against Gardner, Simon Singh (Fermat's Enigma), or Mitchell Waldrop (Complexity, one of the most underrated science books of the past decade), his prose just isn't as readable. And, really, that's what stripped-down science books are all about-- readability. If you wanted its lack, you could just read the relevant articles in dusty book-bound copies of magazines in your library's reference section, right?<br /><br />It's worth picking up if you're into this sort of thing, but expect to spend far more time on it than you would a comparable tome by one of the greats. ** ½	2005-06-28

Stephen Berg, X= (University of Illinois Press, 2002)<br /><br />X= is, above all, an audacious book. Put aside the actual subject matter for the moment. The form of these poems itself is hubris in the extreme, a lone guy in chainmail hoisting a longsword to the heavens and cursing the gods in the midst of a lightning storm. Sixty-two pages of sprung-rhythm chant, with almost every line in the book beginning with the word \\"he.\\" It's an invitation to the muse not of poetry, but of boredom. That Berg manages to keep it interesting is in itself a triumph of, perhaps not the human spirit, but... well, something, anyway. For that alone the man deserves some mad props.<br /><br />And now, back to the subject matter. The \\"he\\" of these poems is involved in your basic midlife crisis (one marvels at the lack of mention of the protagonist buying a cherry-red Corvette). Obsessed with attempting to figure out meaning behind various chaoses ranging from Rwandan genocide to his own failing physicality, our humble narrator stumbles around in circles, with each attempt to find answers raising only new, equally unanswerable, questions.<br /><br />Put it all together and it's obvious that the chant form here is meant to convey an immediacy to all this, the alternating revelations and confusion of the protagonist. And, in the books' best segments, it works. The immediacy is palpable, urgent. The problem is that it doesn't work all the way through. If it did, this would be a book to be devoured in one sitting, that would command the reader to not put it down until the final page had been turned. It is not. Why this is is likely a debate best left to people who do that sort of thing for a living, so I won't try to figure it out here.<br /><br />There is some good to be had, enough for a hesitant recommendation, but if you've got other books of poetry on your TBR stack, this one can wait. ** ½	2005-06-28

Antonin Artaud, Watchfiends and Rack Screams (Exact Change, 1995)<br /><br />Will Exact Change ever put out a bad book? I fervently hope the answer to that question is \\"no.\\" That said, Watchfiends and Rack Screams suffers from much the same problem as most ponderous tomes of selected works from major poets; it's simply too much of a good thing.<br /><br />The translation here is in the hands of the always capable Clayton Eshleman, who treats Artaud with all the reverence the man deserves. Eshleman is certainly no stranger to translating Artaud's later work (the translation of \\"Artaud le Momo\\" which appears here first appeared in Eshleman's fantastic anthology of translations Conductors of the Pit, which I cannot urge you enough to seek out), and he does the same fine job as usual here. Almost three hundred pages of it, however, tends to be a bit much all at once. This is a book to be lingered over for months, perhaps years, going back to it again and again as time passes and absorbing another bit of it at a time, rather than one to be read straight through. As well, Eshleman's introduction runs close to fifty pages. While it's certainly interesting enough stuff, fifty-page introductions are, in general, bad form. If you're going to add a fifty-page essay to a book of poetry, please, for the sake of the reader's sanity, make it an afterword, not a preface.<br /><br />All that said, the influence of the work of Antonin Artaud on modern poetry cannot be understated, and any serious aficionado-- and certainly any serious poet-- should have a copy of this on the bookshelf. It is a fascinating, disturbing portrait of a man's mind torn not only by the inner workings of his own nature, but also by a convergence of brutal external forces that cannot be comprehended by most living human beings. *** ½	2005-06-28

Tracy, Monkeewrench (Putnam, 2003)<br /><br />I admit it, I avoided this book for a while-- even though I'd read the first few pages via chapteraday and been intrigued-- because of the really annoying title. However, after getting a couple of recommendations from people I consider generally trustworthy about such things, I decided I'd go ahead and read it; after all, it's a genre mystery, it won't take up too much time, right?<br /><br />Right. It's everything one expects from a genre mystery, and one of the things one most expects from a genre mystery is that it keeps the pages turning at a relatively hot pace. Monkeewrench certainly does that, and more besides.<br /><br />The cops in Minneapolis are baffled by two murders in two days, until they get a call from Grace MacBride, one of the partners of Monkeewrench Software, telling them that the killings are staged identically to those in a new game Monkeewrench is developing. And everyone's confused as to how the Minneapolis murders tie in with the murder of an old married couple in a church hundreds of miles away. (They do, obviously, as they're in the early chapters of the book.)<br /><br />Tracy, the pseudonym of a mother/daughter writing team, creates a good pace, fine characterization (if a bit stereotyped, especially where the police are concerned), and a mystery that twists around enough that you should only be able to guess the major revelations at, or not long before, the characters do; this, of course, makes it an above-average mystery from the start. And when you get to the revelation of the killer, well, you can say you knew it all along, but really, you're lying to yourself, aren't you?<br /><br />Good stuff. Very well done. ****	2005-06-28

Joyce Carol Oates, I Stand Before You Naked (Samuel French, 1991)<br /><br />Joyce Carol Oates is, of course, best-known as a novelist, almost as well for her short stories. You'll find the occasional non-hardcore fan who's aware she writes criticism. But get to the level of the poetry or the drama, and the legions of Oprah zombies who joined the cult after the success of We Were the Mulvaneys will give you long blank stares. So be it.<br /><br />I Stand Before You Naked is a play of sorts; it is better classed as a series of vignettes for the stage, tied (very, very loosely) together by the opening and closing scenes. If you've read a Joyce Carol Oates work previous to this, you're going to recognize the archetypes of the characters to be found here; Oates is not well-known for straying off in vastly different directions with the characters she examines. What makes each work fresh and immediate is that those characters always seem like they're new people suffering from the same ailments (which gives rise to a whole new analysis of Oates' work that is, obviously, well beyond the capacity of a one thousand word review to contain). As it has been so many times, so it is here. Oates gives us characters, puts them in situations, and then writes scenes that will mess with us. It's a formula, of course, but unlike such formula writers as Dame Barbara Cartland, Oates is never content to stick within the dead center; even formula has its boundaries, and Oates is intent on exploring them. I Stand Before You Naked is another entry that takes a few fine pokes. *** ½	2005-06-16

As I am so often finding these days, it's in Kent's Wick Chapbook series, therefore it's tremendous.<br /><br />The Genuine Negro Hero, though, stands out even in this ocean of high-quality releases. Perhaps it's because Ellis has simply been doing it longer (longer, at least, than those in the series whose bios I've been able to find on the web), but the poems in this book come off as being more accomplished, more relaxed, as if the others in the series were trying too hard (albeit succeeding quite well). Ellis has a fine eye not only for what makes a poem work, but for what makes an effective poem in the first place:<br /><br />\\"A naked bulb on the dresser next to where<br /><br />they made me made them celebrities, giants, myth.<br /><br />I watched their black shadows on the wall,<br /><br />half-expecting fade-out and something romantic<br /><br />as the final scene of Love Crazy, my father<br /><br />a suave William Powell, my mother's slender body<br /><br />a backwards C in the tight focus of his arms...\\"<br /><br />(--\\"A Kiss in the Dark\\")<br /><br />Thomas Sayers Ellis is the real deal.

Anita Scialli, Inside Track 1999 (Cormorant Press, 1999)<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out exactly what this is. It seems as if it might be a periodical of some sort, but it looks, and is priced, like a book. I'm also wondering who it's aimed at. Most of the text seems as if it's for horse racing neophytes, but there's a section on wagering strategy and track bias that will likely not make sense to anyone who's not read at least three or four handicapping books.<br /><br />Whatever it is, it seems to want to justify its somewhat exorbitant cover price with its bulk (it's roughly half the size of Playbill for a play with a sizable cast). It starts off somewhat promising as a basic horses 101 kind of thing, with quick discussions of the triple crown and Breeders' Cup races, after which comes that odd betting and bias bit. That covers about twenty-five pages, all told. After that comes a rundown of the year's Triple Crown contenders (in the book's only really ironic moment, Scialli talks in the into to this section about hos sometimes horses no one's heard of show up in triple crown races, and how rarely they win; absent from her list of contenders for 1999 is Charismatic, who ended up missing the whole triple crown by three strides after breaking his leg), which fills up much of the rest of the book's bulk. Afterwards comes a \\"wagering journal,\\" which is Cormorant Publications-speak for \\"you just paid ten cents per blank page on that, buddy.\\"<br /><br />I've seen worse-structured racing books before, though I can't remember any offhand, and racing books that were worse put-together, one of which I reviewed just last week, but this is a combination of the two that will, hopefully, remain unique. * ½	2005-06-16

Rosemary Griggs, Sky Girl (Fence Books, 2003)<br /><br />Sky Girl is a very difficult book. Not necessarily because of its subject matter (though the book's stated subject matter, the examination of the lives of stewardesses in a post-9/11 society, would probably be difficult for some people), but because of the way that subject matter is presented. Whether some of these poems are poetry at all would be subject to very vigorous debate, no doubt, especially the one-line, one-sentence \\"poems\\" which read more like things jotted on a notepad during a phone conversation.<br /><br />\\"I saw her one time after that. I said that's a nice dress on you, your arms don't look that fat in it.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"She's not pretty but she has an accent\\")<br /><br />Yes, that's the whole thing.<br /><br />So the difficulty comes in piecing all this together. Like a double-sided jigsaw puzzle that's nothing but one shade of blue, some of the pieces do fit together in obvious ways (the whole September 11 thing, for example), but others (like, for example, the piece above) don't seem to fit in with the overall picture, even when turned upside-down and rotated in every way possible.

Garth Ennis, Preacher: Dixie Fried (DC Comics, 1998)<br /><br />After I finished Gone to Texas, I checked with the library immediately to get my hands on Pracher: Until the End of the World. But they didn't have it. In fact, I had to go all the way up to book five before I found another one at my local bibliophilic haunt. I resolved not to read it until I could read books two through four, so I'd keep going in sequence. I've forgotten a whole lot about the adventures of Jesse and co. over the intervening years.<br /><br />That resolve lasted all of three hours. I cracked the cover on Preacher: Dixie Fried the next evening, and like Gone to Texas, it took two sittings to get though (one sometimes has to stop for The Shield's season finale).<br /><br />Not much has changed in Preacher's world. Jesse is still looking for God. Tulip is still trying to figure out why. Cassidy is, well, still Cassidy. The book opens with a quick look back at the time just before Cassidy met Tulip, and through her Jesse, then comes back to present day, where Jesse has decided to avail a voodoo shaman, one of Cassidy's friends from the bad old days, of an offer to put him into a trace to see if he can get closer to figuring out what it is Genesis wants from him. Then, of course, you can add in old enemies, new enemies, and the usual bag of tricks thrown in their way.<br /><br />Dixie Fried, like Gone to Texas, is simply superlative. The artwork and story are both fantastic, the characters are three-dimensional creatures with real lives and emotions, and everything is so well-presented that it demands to be read in one sitting-- unless he Shield's season finale comes along before you can finish. **** ½	2005-06-16

And See How Much You Learn! (self-published, 1998)<br /><br />Take on the World is an odd combination of memoir and inspirational business book. Taft obviously wants to share both and illustrate the relation between the two. For an amateur writer, he didn't do a horrible job. Which could well be why the book is self-published.<br /><br />The core of the book is the self-help stuff. It's a bit wordy, even in a seventy-nine page book, but good, solid common-sense stuff. Some of it will only apply in certain situations, however (e.g., setting up a nonprofit corporation), and there are probably some places where he could have gone into greater detail. Surrounding the self-help stuff is the memoir stuff. Which isn't quite as interesting as the self-help stuff, because the old truism is actually true (no one finds another person's life as interesting as they do their own), but it does, in fact, server to illustrate the self-help stuff in a \\"here's how I lived, and here's the result\\" kind of way. The main problem is that there's a good deal of overlap between the two, and repetition that comes with it (some stories are told three times, others two).<br /><br />Still, not horrible. I've read a lot of self-published books far worse than this. However, were this a manuscript being submitted to a major publisher, it would still be rejected out of hand. ** ½	2005-06-16

Enki Bilal, The Nikopol Trilogy (Humanoids Publishing, 2002)<br /><br />There is no denying that the Nikopol trilogy is eye-catching. Artist and film director Bilal has created something of striking beauty in the three comics that come together to comprise The Nikopol Trilogy. And there's certainly the sort of weirdness one has come to expect from the plot of a graphic novel-- Egyptian gods who travel the heavens in a pyramid, a frozen astronaut, a paranoid mechanical soldier who gets roped into a gubernatorial race, a city on the equator where it never stops snowing... it's all here, pretty much.<br /><br />Set against all that is the fact that the characters in this story are cardboard cutouts there solely to advance the plot. There are a few moves towards giving the characters a bit more shading (especially the character of Jill Bioskop, who in the film based on the book takes center stage-- hmm, wonder why?), but none is entirely successful; these are characters straight out of a fifties dime novel, with no more depth than the page they're printed on.<br /><br />A decent read, but not something that will keep me coming back over and over again. ***	2005-06-16

Chas Balun, Lucio Fulci: Beyond the Gates (Fantasma, 1996)<br /><br />Lucio Fulci is, depending on to whom you talk, either a derivative hack or one of the finest directors of the latter half of the twentieth century. (To be fair, the same can be said of David Lean.) I'm a longtime fan, over a quarter of a century now, and I've always thought of Fulci kind of in the middle; cheesy, but fun. I'm guessing that the folks who put this book together would consider me somewhat lukewarm, and worthy of spitting. These are the extreme militant Orthodox branch of the Cult of Fulci, headed up by Chas Balun, one of the guys who was on the bleeding edge of the horror-film fanzine way back when.<br /><br />This book is, essentially, an extended eulogy. Written not long after Fulci's 1996 death, it contains as prefaces and afterwards testimonies from a number of other \\"name\\" fans (at least, to those in the world of underground horror) framing Balun's extended essay. The whole thing is, as is to be expected from a book on the master of low-budget horror, made on a shoestring budget, but the pictures are still excellent (and the quality's at least passable), the emotion is communicated well, and the tribute is about as fitting as one could write. As with all Irish-style wakes, it gets a little sappy now and again (did Balun really have a straight face when writing that Fulci had \\"gone on to the Beyond\\"?), but if you're a Fulci fan, readnig this is kind of like reminiscing with some of your and the man's mutual friends. ***	2005-06-16

Kent Maynard, Sunk Like God Behind the House (Kent State, 2001)<br /><br />Another entry in the Wick Chapbook series, which is rapidly proving itself to have achieved what may be the highest average quality over a series in the past half-decade. Maynard's book chronicles moments from a stay in rural Cameroon, and the poems have the feel of having been written in that short span of time between being a tourist, when everything's worth noting, and being inured, when nothing's worth noting. The end result is a selection of fine observations that both delineate the differences between the lives of the subjects and the life of the reader and stresses the commonality of the human condition, as all good \\"outsider\\" poetry should do. Maynard does get a tad heavy-handed with the symbolism on occasion, but this isn't a book whose politics are going to stand up and slap you in the face.<br /><br />As with all the Wick Chapbooks I've read and reviewed so far, this one comes with an unhesitating recommendation. *** ½	2005-06-16

Garth Ennis, Preacher: Gone to Texas (DC Comics, 1996)<br /><br />I wonder if the person who put this in the \\"youth services\\" section of my local library ever got fired? After all, right on the back, it says \\"suggested for mature readers.\\" Someone must have missed a memo about what \\"mature\\" means.<br /><br />Gone to Texas is the beginning of the Preacher saga, which involves the title character, whose church went up in flames while the whole town was inside; his ex-girlfriend Tulip, whom he ran out on five years ago for reasons we don't know; and Cassidy, a drifter who rescued Tulip from a bad situation. The plot twists come fast and thick, so it's pretty much impossible to tell you what goes on, but the basis of the story (or the framework from which Ennis created this delightfully twisted tale) is that Jesse, the preacher, is suffering a major crisis of faith, and needs to find his way back to God. Over the course of the story, however, Jesse realizes that his crisis of faith isn't all internal, and that finding his way back to God may take a little more doing than he originally thought it would. Oh, and did I mention he's being stalked by a killer not of this earth, and talks to John Wayne? Didn't think so.<br /><br />Even if the artwork wasn't top-notch, the simple weirdness of the story, and the way Ennis twists it, would make reading this like staring at a particularly gruesome car accident (and the quote is especially appropriate here; Ennis' way of bending cliches and Biblical references to make completely new things out of them should be putting the reader very much in mind of Clive Barker's early short stories). But the artwork is top-notch, indeed, and the two combine to make for a particularly compelling read. You will find yourself wanting to read this in one sitting. And take my advice-- that's not something you want to do if your library system doesn't happen to have the next book in the series. Now I have to wait for it to show up in my mailbox... **** ½... **** 	2005-06-14

An excellent combination, to be sure. Eshleman was still in his obsessive-love phase (in fact, much of this book reads almost like a preparation for The Gull Wall, released the following year and one of the highlights of Eshleman's literary career, from this reviewer's standpoint) and Jaffe's drawings are perfect reflections, simultaneously erotic and disturbing. The poems are interrupted by a short essay from Eshleman that branches the erotic obsession out and gives a slightly more prominent nod to the amazing breadth of knowledge that often seems to come out as afterthoughts and glancing references in the poems; reading this essay is in some ways intellectually daunting. As with reading some of Ivan Arguelles' finer moments, one gets to thinking that perhaps Mr. Eshleman has forgotten more about any of hundreds of subjects than we will ever know. That may scare readers away, which is unfortunate; not only is reading a Clayton Eshleman book, especially one from this period, a great pleasure, it's also an interesting learning experience. Taking some of his offhand references and doing a little research can lead to all sorts of nifty things.<br /><br />As with most of Eshleman's books, I unhesitatingly recommend picking this up. As with most of Eshleman's books, you're probably going to have a hard time doing so for less than collectors' prices. That said, you're probably better off picking up The Gull Wall, which is still available at times for close to cover price, and using it to get a taste of whether your ideas jibe with Eshleman's. If they do, by the time you're finished with that book, you'll discover what a few of us already have-- Eshleman is not only obsessed, he's an obsession in himself. Once you've started, you will not want to stop. *** ½	2005-06-14

Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, and Rene Char, Ralentir, Travaux (Exact Change Press, 1990)<br /><br />Written over the course of five days, Ralentir Travaux (Slow Under Construction) is a series of collaborative poems written by Breton, Eluard, and Char during the height of the surrealist movement. (No word on whether they're exquisite corpses or just regular collaborations.) If you're a fan of any of the three, you're going to like this. (If you're a fan of any of the three and not of all three, for the love of god why?) If you've never been introduced to the work of any of them, it makes a great starting point; the quality is about the same as you'd get from any of the three individually, but the style is slightly different from any of them on their own. And, as always with Exact Change, the quality of the book itself is just as high as the writing contained within it. From the point of view of the simple joy of holding a well-constructed book, as I keep saying, Exact Change has been heading the field for a long, long time. This small volume may be the best way to acquaint yourself with Small Change's offerings; you can not only fall in love with the quality of their books, but with three poets at the same time.<br /><br />If there is a downside to the book, it is that Keith Waldrop's translation sometimes seems uncharacteristically flat. I'm a fan of Waldrop's, along with being a fan of the poets who wrote the original manuscript, and usually love his translations; here, it seems like once in a while a line got translated a bit too literally, perhaps, without the usual thought to whether the rhythm of the piece in English would work the same way it did in French. However, it's a minor thing, that affects maybe half a line out of every five to ten pages of the book, and certainly shouldn't drive you away.<br /><br />Another winner from Exact Change. *** ½	2005-06-14

Edgar, Meditations in an Anatomy Laboratory and Other Poems (Philosophical Library, 1979)<br /><br />I am, to say the least, not a big believer in copyright. In fact, I despise the very notion. But I have found one minor point of usefulness in its favor. One assumes, when one peruses the catalog of \\"other books published by this press\\" on the back of a book, that the quality of other books published by said press will be at least of a rough equivalent to the other books in the catalog; for a small press, anyway. So when you look at a Philosophical Press roster and see names like Sartre, Schweitzer, Voltaire, Gide, Kant, and Bacon, and see that the book you happen to be holding is by someone you've never heard of before... well, one does tend to get excited. Ah, but here's the catch; all the good stuff listed is under public domain, and can be printed by, well, anyone with a printer. (Or read, of course, at Project Gutenberg, but that didn't exist in 1979.) And having now read Irving I. Edgar's Meditations in an Anatomy Laboratory and Other Poems, I can say with some authority that to put Edgar in the same class as any of the folks above is at best the height of folly, at worst sacreligious.<br /><br />Edgar's poetry is the sort of painful teen-angst crap written by lovelorn high schoolers pining after characters in Anne Rice potboilers. Granted, Edgar (a doctor of some note, one assumes from the CV on the back flap) has a little more life experience than your average high school goth, but it certainly didn't translate into an ability to write better poetry. In fact, calling it poetry at all is often going too far.<br /><br />\\"See now!<br /><br />Crowds of students are dipping their hands<br /><br />into greasy cadavers, and gangrene wounds;<br /><br />and these hands and fingers<br /><br />are dripping and reeking of death.<br /><br />These hands and fingers they place<br /><br />upon the abdomen and birth canals--...<br /><br />And shrieks of pain pass from their lips...\\"<br /><br />(--\\"A Semmelweis Phantasy\\")<br /><br />It could be worse.

Edgar takes what is, admittedly, an intriguing setting in which to speculate on the greater truths of life, the universe, and everything, and comes up with some of the most boringly conservative answers one would expect.

Ed Gambera, The Unique Way to Make Money at the Racetrack (Hillsdale, 1992)<br /><br />There are so many things to say about this book that I can honestly say I have no idea where to start. That it was published at all is somewhat amazing to me. Hillsdale is either a name cooked up for a self-publishing deal or a vanity press of the lowest sort, as it's obvious no proofreading was done at all on the manuscript, where at least three or four grammatical errors can be found on each page, and lapses in sentence structure occur almost constantly. Forget about more subtle things like paragraph construction. Amusingly, one can tell where the author invested the text with extra emotion by watching the increase in number of grammatical errors and decrease in coherence. For example, in a passage where Gambera is talking about Andrew Beyer, you can see him getting really het up:<br /><br />\\"Most of the top handicappers have written more than one book, and it amazes me, how this elite group keeps praising each other, as to how successful their books are, and as a reader of most of them, I could never win following their methods, because of the technicality and the difficulty to understand what they were preaching.... The readers should also understand, that Beyer and most of the top handicappers, that have published, are usually making money from their royalties, their salaries as writers for newspapers, and from their seminars, and 900 numbers, and not by playing at the racetrack.\\"<br /><br />I triple-checked that to make sure I had all the commas in the right places. If you were laughing by the time you finished that except, welcome to the club.<br /><br />Worse, if you can get past the grammatical mess that is this book, Gambera heartily embraces the one mistake that will drive a player to bankruptcy faster than any other: the idea of a horse being due. (If you have the intestinal fortitude to pick this book up, should you come across it, read the section on \\"missing odd\\" horses-- yes, that's \\"missing odd,\\" not \\"missing odds\\"-- and do exactly the opposite if you want to preserve a red cent that's in your pocket.)<br /><br />There might well be some useful information here during those times when Gambera isn't trying to be soon (as in \\"a fool and his money are soon parted\\"), but this book was such a painful experience I can't bring myself to try any of it out. Gambera finishes the book with a postscript:<br /><br />\\"P:S: I do not intend to write another book so I hope that this one is a winner.\\"<br /><br />Thank you. We could ask for no less. Half a star because I, for some reason, finished it.\\" not \\"missing odds\\"-- and do exactly the opposite if you want to preserve a red cent that's in your pocket.)

Ivan Arguelles and Jack Foley, Saint James (Pantograph Press, 1998)<br /><br />Ivan Arguelles is the singlehanded savior of modern American surrealism. Jack Foley is one of his longtime friends.

It's got all the usual hallmarks of Arguelles' work, but they're not as finely-honed as they are in most of his books. This could be just the fact that he's only got slightly over half of a less-than-forty-page book with which to work, but Arguelles is excellent at obsessing grandly in very small amounts of space; the language here is simply looser, easier, as one would expect from email. It gives great insight into what the man thinks about before whipping it all into poetry. Foley's work, which I have not encountered previous to this book, is definitely enough to warrant my looking for more of his stuff. Brash, exuberant, a great straight man for Arguelles.<br /><br />If you're new to Arguelles, however, start with some of the more recent (and thus more findable) books in the Pantograph cycle; Hapax Legomenon and \\"That\\" Goddess are both wonderful.	2005-06-14

Bennett relatively late in the game, having first discovered his work in the early nineties in a small, long-gone store in Lakewood, Ohio, in a small chapbook entitled Was Ah. That book is one of my prized possessions. I have, with little success, been trying to hunt down some of Bennett's earlier chapbooks ever since. Imagine my delight when I discovered that not only does the Ohio U. library have an extensive collection, but they allow them out through Interlibrary Loan. Burning Dog was the first of them to find its way into my hands.<br /><br />Was Ah was published in the nineties, and Burning Dog, ten years previous, is an entirely different animal. Whereas the more recent chapbook has dispensed with all surface meaning whatsoever, the short, punchy poems here still convey an image, however out of one's frame of reference that image may be:<br /><br />\\"I felt a<br /><br />flame come through my head my<br /><br />guts get tight I stood up on a<br /><br />bridge a woman singing far below I<br /><br />staggered back I<br /><br />tried to breathe I felt her hand touch my chest<br /><br />my panting start to speed<br /><br />then I sat down on the street<br /><br />saw three black mailbags waiting on the curb<br /><br />her suitcase smoking full of meat\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Burning Dog\\")<br /><br />What does it mean? If you're asking, you're asking the wrong question.<br /><br />If Ivan Arguelles is the savior of modern surrealism, Bennett is the savior of modern dada. Students of the history of modern poetry should definitely acquaint themselves with John M. Bennett's work, and this is an extremely interesting place to begin.	2005-06-14

John Fante, Prologue to Ask the Dust (Black Sparrow, 1990)<br /><br />Actually, the title of this book is something of a misnomer; it is not a prologue to Fante's brilliant novel, it's a letter Fante wrote to his publisher (and never sent) about why said publisher should publish said novel. It was lost for half a century after being written, found by Fante's widow after his death, and published soon after by Black Sparrow.<br /><br />If you know Fante's work, you probably know what to expect here. A good argument could be (and has been, many times) made for Fante being the progenitor of the beat Generation, and here, in a short piece of nonfiction, perhaps the best case is made; the style of Fante's 1938 letter obviously informed such writers as Kerouac and his crowd, though they'd have gotten their Fante fix through the novel itself, where it's somewhat diluted. This, folks, is the strong stuff, and it's utterly fantastic. Without the need to hold things together with a narrative thread, Fante jumps around like a manic patient at the lunatic asylum, always returning to Camilla, the model for Dust's man character, and Fante's obsession with her. (As a side note, Fante's inconsistent reference to himself as Arturo Bandini, the hero of his first novel, presage Bukowski's constant references to himself as Chinaski; Bukowski's love for Fante is well-known by anyone who's read Buk's many poems referencing Fante.) The portrait that emerges is of a deeply disturbed, perhaps deranged, but brilliant human being. And the note on which Fante ends the letter redefines sucker punch.<br /><br />With the demise of Black Sparrow a few years back, it's probably not terribly likely this volume will see print again. If it does find its way into your local bookstore, however, snap it up. It is the stuff nightmares are made of.	2005-06-14

Elise Grilli, Sotatsu (Kodansha, 1956)<br /><br />Assuming you're reading this in America, you've probably never heard of Sotatsu. That's okay. There are a few of his works in museums scattered across the country, and what little scholarship there is on him in English is long out of print. For example, there is this small book (literally a pocket book-- exactly the size of the back pocket in my jeans) by Elise Grilli, written at just about the time scholars were starting to find a number of anonymous works that could be directly linked to Sotatsu. An exciting time for an art historian, indeed. Despite that, Grilli's text (not a translated version of the Japanese version of the book, but completely new text for the American edition) stays on an even keel; there is an introduction to what little is known about Sotatsu's life, and the rest of the text is examinations of the paintings. As well it should be.<br /><br />There could have been a bit more of the paintings themselves, but one assumes Kodansha were trying to keep the book thin (that whole pocket thing, you know), and it's a good overview, for what it is. If you chance upon a copy of this long out-of-print tome and you're a fan of Japanese art, it's well worth picking up.	2005-06-14

Michael Gruber, Topic of Night (Morrow, 2003)<br /><br />The number of superlative adjectives that have been thrown around in relation to this book is nothing short of amazing. I should have realized, however, when Martin Cruz Smith's blurb on the front compared it to Smilla's Sense of Snow that I was in for a long, somewhat boring read. To be fair, it does pick up towards the end.<br /><br />We open with Jane Doe, a woman who ironically, in order to hide herself, had to take another name (her real name is, in fact, Jane Doe). She's hiding from her husband, for reasons we are not made privy to until much later. Meanwhile, detectives Jimmy Paz and Cletis Barlow are working on a particularly gruesome murder in Overtown, a lower-class Miami neighborhood. Of course, these two things tie together somewhere down the line.<br /><br />The main problem with the book is that it takes everything way, way too long to tie together. Gruber is in desperate need of a few classes on how to pace a thriller; the first three hundred pages of this just-over-four-hundred-page novel are setup. Which, when done right (cf. Palliser's The Quincunx, with over twice the amount of setup), can be just as gripping as the actual action, but here it's not done right in the least. We switch back and forth between Jane in the present, Jane in the past as revealed through her journals, and Paz/Barlow's investigation. Of the three, the last is the only one that really works. These chapters speed by, leaving the reader wanting more. The stuff that comes between, well, that can end at any time. But it never seems to, it just keeps going on and on.<br /><br />Once the storylines mesh, the pace picks up. The problem here is that at this point the book becomes predictable. Gruber has set everything up in such a way that you're no longer faced with a mystery, but he still has pieces of that mystery to unveil. Unfortunately, as is the case in most mysteries that fail, the reader's figured out the final pieces long before the characters do.

But I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, since most of the main characters are well-drawn enough.

Scatoni, Six Secrets of Successful Bettors (DRF Press, 2005)<br /><br />So you want to be a professional horseplayer. What's the first thing you should do? Well, okay, the first thing you should probably learn to do is become a decent handicapper. But if you want to take it to the professional level, sooner or later you're probably going to have to do what everyone needs to do if they want to make it big in any profession: network. Talk to the guys who have already made it. Get pointers on how to do so. Maybe talk to some people not in your chosen profession, but related to it, to get some more universal ideas on theory and practice as well.<br /><br />Previously, that step, unless you got lucky and had a pro in your backyard (not out of the question if your home track is Keeneland; if you frequent, say, Anthony Downs, however, you're going to be looking a long time), would have required a good deal of searching, a good deal of groveling (after all, the guy's not going to know you from Adam), and probably traversing the country a few times. A pretty expensive itinerary, to say the least, and you need to keep your bankroll up. But now Frank Scatoni has interviewed a bunch of them for you and boiled it all down into this book, which will cost you a whole lot less than plane tickets crisscrossing the country.<br /><br />Scatoni gets words from some of the best-known professionals in the game, both the pundits (Crist, Beyer, Quinn, etc.) and the guys who've never written a word, but still make their money at the game (Ernie Dahlman, especially, and some players who chose to remain anonymous). He also pulls in a player from the world of baseball betting, a former top Vegas odds-line maker (Roxy Roxborough), some poker and blackjack players, and the like. The end result is a book about why these folks are successful, largely in their own words.<br /><br />You would expect some conflicting and confusing information. That's life; there are many different ways to win this game. Beyer concentrates his play in exactas, Crist in pick sixes. They both make a living betting. One bettor puts twenty grand through the windows a day, another, if I was extrapolating his numbers right, bets in the vicinity of seventy-five million a year. They all make livings doing it. And a lot of what they have to say has been said time and again in books on handicapping, and you never really picked up on it before, did you? Well, give it another shot, and soak up the new info, as well. One way or the other, this is definitely one you want to pick up before quitting your job and going to the track full-time-- or even if you're a Christmas-and-Easter bettor who wants to get a little more disciplined like yours truly. *** ½ys to win this game.

Roy Bentley, Boy in a Boat (University of Alabama Press, 1986)<br /><br />Boy in a Boat is not a bad little book. Not at all. There are a number of very good poems here, and most of the rest are good, occasionally slipping down into the territory of average. Overall, though, it's an above-average collection. The problem is, there's really nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other above-average poetry collections put out by University presses; no reason for me to say \\"buy this one, rather than these others over here.\\" But if you happen to have the disposable income and are looking to pick something up that will be enjoyable and look better than the newest Jodi Picoult non-thriller while you're reading it on the bus, Roy Bentley is certainly one of the avenues worth considering.	2005-06-07

Dale Bailey, The Resurrection Man's Legacy and Other Stories (Golden Gryphon Press, 2003)<br /><br />A little over a year ago, I read and reviewed (quite favorably) Dale Bailey's novel House of Bones. (ed. note: May 10, 2004) I'd been meaning to get round to reading him again since then, but somehow a year passed before I picked up my next Bailey book: this substantial collection of short stories. I knew from reading House of Bones that I should be expecting good things, but then I read the introduction, penned by no less a personage than Barry N. Malzberg, author of more underrated science fiction classics than you can comfortably shake a small alder at (if you've not read The Sodom and Gomorroah Business, at least, shame on you). Malzberg's introduction to this book is jaw-dropping, especially for a man who, the few times he blurbs something, always seems to be damning with faint praise. Here, he is heralding a collection that, he intimates, should be canonized immediately, comparing it to the definitive collections of John Varley and Theodore Sturgeon. That, folks, is some heady stuff. Now, as I said, I knew Dale Bailey was capable of good, perhaps great, things. Malzberg's introduction had me believing I'd be placing this on the short shelf next to Piccirilli's A Choir of Ill Children as one of the finest achievements in modern dark fantasy.<br /><br />The comparison turned out to be more accurate than I could have guessed. Bailey, a North Carolina boy, has assumed the mantle of southern gothic, mastered it, and bent it to his will in quite the same way Piccirilli has, and with similar results. This is not to say that The Resurrection Man's Legacy... is a collection of southern gothic tales; while a few are certainly in that vein (\\"The Census Taker,\\" especially, has a distinct smell of whatever herbs were used in Carson McCullers' coffin), Bailey's palette of influences stretches a mite farther than Yoknapatawpha County. The collection's title story has its roots quite obviously in \\"I Sing the Body Electric,\\" and anyone who's read that story knows what's going to happen here. (Not that this, either, was a surprise; House of Bones has its roots in more haunted house tales than one can count, from The House on Haunted Hill to Poltergeist III.) What separates Bailey from your run-of-the-mill plagiarist hack is that at no time while reading \\"The Resurrection Man's Legacy\\" will you get the impression you're actually reading \\"I Sing the Body Electric.\\" Nor, for that matter, that you're reading anything other than Dale Bailey. His is a voice that is as distinct as the sound of winter wind down the face of Stone Mountain. Bailey has obviously taken into consideration the old saw that there's nothing new under the sun; here, he takes the old and makes it new again in a number of cases. Of course, there are others, where taking the old and making it new again takes on, well, a whole new set of meanings (\\"Death and Suffrage,\\" for example, is a wonderful spin on the clich&eacute; that the dead have been voting in Chicago since Prohibition).<br /><br />Dale Bailey is, in fact, a fantastic writer. If you haven't yet gotten to know his work, you should. The novels are likely easier to find these days, but if you get the chance, hunt this collection down.

Ron Penton, Data Structures for Game Programmers (Premier, 2003)<br /><br />I don't normally get all googly-moogly over programming books. In fact, I just took a quick look back at my reading log since 1999, and a select few have gotten four stars, but nothing above that. But I picked up Penton's nine-hundred-page tome on Thursday and I finished it on Sunday. Nine hundred pages in four days. I've only been keeping track of page counts over the past year, but the books I've read that have come closest, page-wise, have been Robin Hobb's lovely novels, three of which I read earlier this year hovered around eight hundred pages. I read the shortest of them in eight days. And I love Robin Hobb.<br /><br />Data Structures for Game Programmers is a wonderful book in no small part because Ron Penton was still an undergrad while writing it. Which is, of course, also the book's main problem, because someone like me who last saw ivy-covered halls well over a decade ago is likely to be sick with envy that some little greenhorn has already found his way into the world of professional computer-book publishing (and by \\"professional\\" here I don't mean \\"published by recognizable press,\\" I mean \\"the kid's already published three books in three years, and they're ALL monstrous tomes, when does he have time to program?\\"). But let's face it, you expect something different when you read a book by a young writer, be it the hot new novelist or the new kid on the programming block. And Penton delivers it; Data Structures for Game Programmers is, if you're a programmer, the most readable computer book you've ever come across. Penton seems to have a healthy disrespect for textbooks, which he alludes to a few times in the course of the book, and it shows in his writing; he wants to write something that will teach you more than a textbook by being more accessible. And in this goal, he succeeds. Brilliantly. I learned more about C templates from reading this book than I have in any other three books devoted to nothing but templates, and here they're just referred to a few times in passing. How is this possible? Because Penton explains things in language far easier to understand than that of most programming books; simply put, he hasn't yet been so overwhelmed by jargon that he can't see when he's written something the layperson might not be able to understand, which is a common ailment among programming authors.<br /><br />Also, there's been some minor grumbling from some critics about the book's insistence on reinventing the wheel. Of course it does. That's how you learn to program-- you bang away at it, doing something that's already been done, until you figure out why it's done that way. There may be five or six people on the planet who can read it in a textbook and immediately figure out why it's the case (and, one assumes, they are the same people as those critics), but the rest of us are much happier seeing it this way.<br /><br />If any computer book publishers happen to be reading this, you, especially, should be reading Data Structures for Game Programmers. See what it's like. Try to get the rest of your authors to emulate it. You'll have much happier customers that way.<br /><br />This is one of the handful of books I've read since getting a library card again (a total, in fact, of four since 2003) that, after returning it to the library, went back on my Amazon wish list, because I want a copy for myself.e books devoted to nothing but templates, and here they're just referred to a few times in passing.

Francesca Lia Block, Weetzie Bat (Harper, 1989)<br /><br />I've been hearing the names Francesca Lia Block and Weetzie Bat thrown around for a number of years, usually in relation to Block's novels being challenged in school libraries. Somewhere along the way I got the idea that they were horror novels, perhaps Buffy the Vampire Slayer for an intelligent, discerning audience. I couldn't have been more wrong; actually, Weetzie Bat and her creator put me far more in mind of Kathy Acker than Sarah Michelle Gellar (and I cannot tell you what a relief that is).<br /><br />Weetzie Bat, the first of the five (as of this writing) novels in the series, is a rather short piece of work which introduces us to the characters, gets them into a few amusing and less-than-amusing situations, eventually rolling around to dealing with the situation that so many ultra-hip books were dealing with at the time (in case you're living in as much of a cave as I was, and are still under the impression Weetzie Bat is a vampire slayer, I'll not mention the nature of said situation) and which has since passed into the realm of such things as Lifetime Original Movies and sappy poetry. I say this because it's a warning to the unexpecting; you'll be tempted to read the crux of this novel as dated. (To an extent, the whole novel reads as dated; imagine, again, Kathy Acker, but as if Kathy Acker had been writing during the Eisenhower era; while the effect is quite wonderful, it does play up this effect.) I know it's something of a cop-out to say, and the inevitable flipside to it is \\"this hasn't aged well,\\" but consider the time in which the book was written, and then take the nostalgic feel of the beginning and middle of the book and contrast it with the final chapter. A whole different picture emerges.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if you end up having that many problems now, the simple fact is this book won't age well at all; by the time a new generation comes along, it'll resemble an improperly-stored camembert.

Harryette Mullen, Sleeping with the Dictionary (University of California, 2002)<br /><br />I have found there to be a weird dichotomy in the world of poetry: in my experience, the better a person is at reading in front of a crowd, the worse their books are bound to be. I have seen some people give awful performances in front of a mike from some of the best-written books of poetry in my collection. (To be fair, my experience with poets who have both published and read is limited, and there are certainly exceptions to the rule; T. H. Cornell's Magnetosphere comes immediately to mind, as does Stan Heleva's \\"Palm Sunday.\\") I saw Harryette Mullen read on a show called Lunch Poems on one of the university-sponsored channels no one ever watches on Dish Network, and I found the experience to be such that I immediately put this book on hold at the library, figuring it would be one of poetry's enduring classics.<br /><br />Parts of it, in fact, are just that. Mullen has a way with sound that comes through on the printed page, rather like Timothy Donnelly. As with Donnelly's recent release, Mullen's book is the kind of thing that should be studied, with great care, by the legions of wannabe \\"slam\\" and performance poets who get up there and try to pass off what they do as poetry week after week. Contrary to what you, the reader, will likely experience if you drop in unannounced at a poetry slam, poetry and sound do, in fact, mix, and sometimes they do it exceptionally well. The best pieces in Sleeping with the Dictionary are sterling examples of this.<br /><br />The book's main problem is that sometimes the sound is all that's there. While it's a far better curse with which to be afflicted to sound good and be meaningless than to be full of meaning and sound like a gravel pit (in the world of poetry, anyway), sonic-minded poets of the twentieth century have always realized that for this sort of thing shorter is better. When Mullen gets her sonic mind into five- to ten-page pieces, it's hard not to look at the tricks used in the creation of these poems and see them as just that: tricks. It is impossible to argue that they're not deftly manipulated, and that if this were cabinetwork you'd be looking at the creations of a master craftsman, but lord knows a lot of master craftsmen have done some hideously rococo scrollwork over the years.<br /><br />If you pick this up (and you should, especially if you aspire to read your poetry aloud before an audience of strangers), start by concentrating on the shorter pieces here, and absorb the way Mullen makes the sounds bounce and click off one another like billiard balls. That's what poetry's supposed to sound like. Which makes me wonder why it just didn't work in a spoken forum.e pieces, it's hard not to look at the tricks used in the creation of these poems and see them as just that: tricks.

Why it took me close to two decades I've no idea, but I finally have.<br /><br />Smoke is a very, very good book.

Steven Skeina, Calculated Bets (Cambridge University Press, 2001)<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about Calculated Bets is that it is, by far, the most readable book you will ever pick up from Cambridge University Press. One wonders, in fact, how Skeina got past the stuffiness factor that distinguishes so much academic publishing to get this book released. A distinguished university putting out a book on, for all intents and purposes, building a system to bet jai-alai? And yet, I know it exists, as I have held it in my hands and read it.<br /><br />And a good read it is, too. Skeina takes a look at what may be America's most overlooked and underrated spectator sport and how he created a computer program to automatically bet on jai-alai that actually beat the game (and the book's major failing, in my opinion, is that he didn't get farther into the actual algorithms he used), and uses it as an introduction to jai-alai and an introduction to theoretical programming at the same time. It's not a book for programming junkies as, as I alluded to, you're not going to get anything even remotely resembling hard code. It's also not really a book for handicapping devotees, because while Skeina does talk briefly about the basics of the stuff he plugged into those algorithms, he's going to leave you to do all the real work. And yet, despite both of these things, I loved this book. It may just be the novelty of reading something non-fiction from a University press that actually didn't require having a dictionary next to me (I should note here that much of what I read from university presses is linguistic and literary theory translated from obscure Eastern European languages, and poetry that might as well have been written in those languages and remains untranslated). Skeina has produced an enjoyable piece of work that seems almost marketless. That is a shame, because it's a fun book, and well worth reading.	2005-06-07

Faye Kicknosway, Mixed Plate (Wesleyan, 2003)<br /><br />I've been having a hard time writing this review, which is kind of odd with a book I liked so much. Faye Kicknosway's poems are what would happen if the pathetic, annoying flower children of the sixties and seventies had actually mastered the art of poetry (instead of becoming a legion of Helen Steiner Rice wannabes headed by the Evil Twins known as Rod McKuen and Susan Polis Schutz) and then grown up to get really, really bitter and cynical, while still realizing that despite the fact that people are, essentially, well beyond the point of being saved, there is still enough beauty in the world that not everything you write has to sound like it's coming out of the mouth of a goth band's singer.<br /><br />Kicknosway's poems are never less than sensual, often earthy, and it's a mark of her considerable mastery of the form that she can take such ingredients and make them sexy or not, as she pleases. More so that the sexy pieces can be juxtaposed with pieces that reflect brutality without there being any sort of blending effect; the same linguistic mechanisms are used, but the process used to get to the effect is completely different.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm still having a hard time writing this review. Well, I tried. Would it help if I just said, \\"this is an excellent piece of work. Read it.\\"?	2005-06-07

Alfred Hitchcock (ed.), Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum (Random House, 1965)<br /><br />Back before most of you were born, Alfred Hitchcock was not only a film director. Not at all. He had a rather successful television series, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour; he appeared as a character in the Three Investigators series of novels, written (well, the first eleven of them, anyway) by his friend Robert Arthur; and he edited a series of short story collections for younger readers (also, in fact, ghost-edited by Arthur). All of this has fallen quite a ways into the background now, with Hitch being remembered primarily as the director of a large number of classic films. But all of them are well worth rediscovering, both for nostalgia buffs old enough to remember it all and a new generation of younger readers looking for something more challenging than the standard pre-YA fare available these days.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum is certainly that. The majority of these stories were originally penned for adult readers, though the reading level of the collection would be solidly termed \\"young adult\\" these days. I first read this book at the age of eight or nine, and would encourage parents whose kids show an interest in monsters, pre-teen horror novels, etc., to challenge them with this. You're likely to find yourself answering a number of questions about slightly dated language (after all, while the book was compiled in 1965, some of the stories therein were originally published decades earlier), and a larger number of questions about words that the average nine-year-old in today's educational system hasn't had a hope of encountering, but the kid will come out the other end head and shoulders above his classmates in reading, vocabulary, and spelling.<br /><br />The stories themselves, as usual in anthologies, vary somewhat in quality. All of them, however, are notable for having images that will haunt the reader well into adulthood (I originally picked the book up again because I wanted to re-read Joseph Payne Brennan's \\"Slime,\\" which while a somewhat trite and predictable tale, is definitely an imprinter, and discovered that I remembered lines, and sometimes whole scenes, from other stories, the names of the authors of which at the time meant nothing to me-- Stephen Vincent Benet, Ray Bradbury, and Manly Wade Wellman are just some of the names I was startled to discover I'd been reading as a pre-teen), and nothing convinces a kid to read like throwing a good scare into him every now and again. The book has a definite wide range of things to scare the tykes, from mutant flying alligators to primordial living ooze to the common housecat dressed up in a tie and tails, so your kid's bound to find something in here that works.

Linda Berry, Death and the Walking Stick (Wheeler Publishing, 2005)<br /><br />Here's a quick hint for those of you who set reading goals for yourself: if you really want to crank up the page count, I have three words for you: large print books. I picked up the large-print version of this one from the library by mistake, and it's almost twice the page count of the regular paperback. Woo!<br /><br />In any case, it's got the same content. Still trying to figure out quite how I feel about said content. Berry's head honcho, Trudy Roundtree, is a small-town cop in the southern United States, which is seemingly a hotbed of all sorts of strange crimes. (One detects a scent of southern-fried Murder, She Wrote.) In this episode, Althea Boatright, crotchety old woman, runs over an old man, claiming that her dog got in the way of her feet and she couldn't brake properly. Which is all well and good, and the police are trying to find a way to get her out from behind the wheel legally, when Althea herself keels over. Thanks to a coffeeklatsch full of nosy neighbors, Trudy allows herself to be convinced that Althea's death is a bit more than it seems, and the investigation is on.<br /><br />Combining the cozy with the police procedural doesn't really strike me as the best possible idea, but for what it's worth, Berry makes the best of it she can by going heavy on the cozy and light on the police procedural (with most of the police-procedural style details, amusingly, given us by the police chief's mother, a woman who's never even seen, let alone read, a Lawrence Sanders novel. This is a good thing). Still, the mixture jars a bit, kind of like eating mustard ice cream; it's perfect for connoisseurs, but the rest of the world will find the idea somewhat revolting. (This doesn't mean you shouldn't try mustard ice cream. It is a beautiful thing.) Done correctly, it is pure balm. Here, however, it's not quite correct; while not completely predictable, it's predictable in its unpredictability. The red herrings are so obvious they might as well have pictures of fish tattooed on their forearms, most of the characters are just this side of stereotypical, and while Berry gives us some tantalizing peeks into the deeper lives of some of her characters, she never fleshes them out enough to turn these folks into real three-dimensional people the reader can care about.<br /><br />Decent genre mystery, but not good enough to send me rushing back to the library for the next installment. ** ½redictability.

Frank Miller, Sin City: The Big Fat Kill (Dark Horse, 1996)<br /><br />If you're one of the uncounted millions who've seen Robert Rodriguez' big, sprawling epic film based on the Sin City comic books, you're likely to think you don't need to read The Big Fat Kill (or the other four parts of the series upon which the film was based). You might be surprised. Much was made of the frame-by-frame faithfulness between the graphic novels and the film, but there's one very big difference-- the scene Tarantino directed, which is part of this book (Dwight's drive to the tar pits, conversing with John's corpse). Of course, the differences between Tarantino's scene and the rest of the film only serve to highlight the faithfulness of the rest of the film, but there you go.<br /><br />Sin City is great noir. Hopefully, by now, everyone's aware of this. Miller combines the natural impressionist approach of the comic book with the strong narrative structure of the dime novel, and the result is pure magic. If you've never treated yourself to the graphic novels, and you enjoyed the movie, what are you waiting for? ****	2005-05-27

While it's collected under a title, and thus (one would expect) has a theme to it, the theme of the book (which is basically John and Kit pining for one another) is addressed at length in only the third issue found here (\\"Heartland,\\" which features Kit visiting Dublin and seeing family and friends), and only touched on in the other four, which are short episodes of Constantine doing what Constantine does. Amusing, but without the thematic coherence of Dangerous Habits. More comic-like than graphic novel-like-- which, I admit, is sometimes a fine distinction. ***	2005-05-27

Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead: Miles Behind Us (Image, 2004)<br /><br />Robert Kirkman has begum what promises to be the next big thing in comics: The Walking Dead. This second volume of the series follows Rick and his small band of survivors as they break camp and try to find somewhere safer to rebuild their lives. As with the first volume, Days Gone Bye, Miles Behind Us spends much more time focusing on the human factor and how peoples' relationships to one another change in the face of sudden, worldwide devastation. Kirkman has done an excellent job of drawing the psyches of his characters, and it makes the series almost compulsive reading.<br /><br />Miles behinds us does, though, suffer slightly in comparison to Days Gone Bye. There are a couple of times when the reader gets the sense that characters are leaving the story arc simply because they're no longer convenient (this is the case with one character in particular; it'll be obvious, when you get to that bit), and some of the new characters introduced aren't given nearly enough time to develop before we don't see them any more. However, there's a good deal going on here, and one thinks that the book would have been twice as long if Kirkman had devoted that much time to them. Still, I would have much preferred a two hundred seventy-two page book and more depth in the minor characters. Not that that'll stop me from reading the third volume as soon as I possibly can; The Walking Dead is definitely worthwhile stuff. *** ½	2005-05-27

Lemony Snicket, The Slippery Slope (Scholastic, 2003)<br /><br />As we approach the end of the Series of Unfortunate Events, I don't want to say that the quality of the books is slipping. After all, books eight and nine showed Lemony Snicket going in a new, and very interesting, direction. Unfortunately, The Slippery Slope does nothing more than coast on the coattails of the smash hit series.<br /><br />It's not that The Slippery Slope is a bad book, it's just a predictable book. The sense of delight and wonder that has been a hallmark since the series' beginning seems to have lost a deal of its lustre, and while it's just as readable as the other books in the series, this is the first time one of them has really left me wondering if the series is going downhill since The Wide Window. Well, it picked up after that; I have guarded hope that The Grim Grotto will see the Baudelaire children back to being, well, the Baudelaire children. ***	2005-05-27

Isaiah J. Shain, State Income from Horse Racing (University of California at Berkeley, 1947)<br /><br />There are, perhaps, thirty people in the world who will find the subject matter of this small book interesting. It was prepared for the California legislature in 1947 as an overview of the current California tax situation as it pertained to horse racing, and to give them enough background to decide whether to increase the tax rate. Me, I think it's absolutely fascinating. More interesting to most people is, likely, how a copy of a typewritten manuscript from the California legislature in 1947 got into the Cleveland Public Library system. (I don't know yet. They're checking into it for me.)<br /><br />If you like this sort of thing, though, it's an excellent piece of work, a clear and concise overview of the financial side of California horse racing in the late forties as compared to that of other states, and a look at where we've come since 1947 (not to mention what's stayed the same).

Greg Gifune, Heretics (Delirium Books, 2001)<br /><br />Unless you're one of a select few horror fans, you've probably not yet heard the name Greg F. Gifune. As it sometimes is in these situations, this is truly a crime. Gifune has been quietly making a name for himself in the horror community for quite a while now, publishing deeply disturbing tales in a myriad of small-press magazines. Heretics is a collection of a select few of these tales (four, actually), with some unreleased (as of 2001, anyway) material to flesh the collection out. Delirium released it to a storm of acclaim back in the day, and it sold out very quickly. (Gifune's new novel, being released by Delirium in July of 2005, has already sold out its limited editions in pre-orders with insane prices; this should give you an idea of the guy's rep in certain circles.) One can only hope that Delirium either brings it back into print with a much wider release and a whole lot of publicity (not to mention really good distribution) or they sell the rights to someone who'd be willing to publish the collection (Leisure comes to mind immediately) who's already got the publicity and distribution channels in place, because Heretics is a fantastic book, and deserves a much wider readership than it presently has.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Greg Gifune writes the sort of extreme horror one sees from an author like Charlee Jacob (though Gifune never pushes that envelope out to the edge)-- and it wouldn't surprise me one whit to see Gifune's career explode the way Jacob's did a few years back-- but it's extremity wrapped in a cloak of atmosphere. Gifune isn't just going to go for the gut, he's going to disturb you on deeper levels while he's at it. The title story in this collection, a novella-length piece, is an excellent example of how good he is at it, but the real gem here is a shorter piece called \\"The Snow Angels.\\" In fifteen all-too-short pages, Gifune goes for the extreme, then doubles back and shows how effective the power of suggestion can be. It's a shocking twist on the way things are normally done, or as shocking as anything in the horror biz can be these days, and it's powerfully effective. \\"The Snow Angels\\" alone is worth the cost of admission here; the other stories are icing on the cake. But what icing it is. There's not a single dud here; for that matter, there's not even a place where Gifune's mastery slips. While the majority of the horror-reading public is busy being satisfied with the ponderous tomes turned out by Stephen King, Dean Koontz, et al., like clockwork, and the slightly more hip have discovered Leisure's recent catalog of writers, the in crowd are being blown away on a regular basis by two of the best horror short-story writers of the last century; Greg Gifune is one of them. (For the record, the other is a guy named Dale Bailey. You'll be seeing as effusive a review of his book The Resurrection Man's Legacy and Other Stories from my keyboard in the very near future.)<br /><br />Gets four and a half because of five through no fault of Gifune's; the editor at Delirium seems to have gotten drowsy towards the end of the book, and there are some really odd typos (there's quite a few underlines, of all things, peppered throughout the final story; one every six or seven pages). But make no mistake, this book is the real deal. A shoo-in for my twenty-five best reads of the year list in 2005. **** ½effective the power of suggestion can be.

Joyce Carol Oates, Come Meet Muffin (Ecco Press, 1998)<br /><br />Now, there are only three things about a picture book intended for the five-and-under set that would make me read it. It would either have to be written by one of my favorite authors, published by a press who are known for publishing works of exceptional literary value, or in some way rabidly controversial. Well, two out of three ain't bad, and Come Meet Muffin fits the first two. I'm relatively sure that Come Meet Muffin is the first children's picture book published by the redoubtable Ecco Press, and it was certainly the first written by the redoubtable Joyce Carol Oates, a woman whose Nobel is long overdue.<br /><br />While getting text from JCO is always a pleasure, there's really not much you can do with writing style, or chronicling the decay of society, in a twenty-eight page picture book that's only got a sentence or two on each page. (I'm sure by now someone has made an attempt to write a dissertation called Muffin's Journey and the Decline of the Modern Housewife. That person, however, is not, and will never be, me.) Nope, this is a little story about a stray cat who gets adopted by the Smith family, hops out the window one morning to guide some deer back to their mother, and gets lost. (Can you see the dissertation forming in the mind of a desperate grad student? I knew you could.) It's simplistic, straightforward, and, well, aimed at the five-and-under set. What makes it so lovely is not, surprisingly, Oates' text, but the wonderful illustrations of Mark Graham. There is a richness and a depth to them not normally found in children's picture books. Well, not when I was a kid. Maybe things have changed.<br /><br />In any case, another book I'll be picking up a permanent copy of for the kids' room. ****	2005-05-20

Charles Bukowski, Beauti-Ful and Other Long Poems (Wormwood Review, 1988)<br /><br />Wormwood review puts out lovely single-author collections as issues of the magazine every once in a while. This is the second I've come across (the first being Lyn Lifshin's Parade), and in all honesty I could probably cut large sections of the Lifshin review and paste them into this one without needing to change anything. The two books are almost identical; solidly-constructed limited-edition chapbooks on paper of somewhat surprising quality, with decent, if not consistently excellent, work from each of the authors represented. The name of the collection is something of a misnomer; I was expecting these forty-seven pages to contain three, maybe four, pieces. The poems may be slightly longer than the Bukowski norm (there's nothing here that fits on a single page), but nothing you can't find a good number of examples of, lengthwise, in any big collection since Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame. The average quality of the pieces themselves is good, but there are few surprises (and you've likely seen a number of these in other collections since; \\"Number 2 Pencil,\\" especially, stands out). With the current cost of out-of-print Bukowskis (as I write this, the cheapest one to be found on Amazon is going for $89.25; you can find one at (...)), only collectors are going to want to go after this one right now. You can wait till the market dies down or, if you've got a pretty comprehensive selection of the books he released on Black Sparrow between 1987 and 1994, you've likely got almost all of these pieces anyway. *** ½	2005-05-20

Jana Harris, We Never Speak of It: Idaho-Wyoming Poems, 1889-90 (Ontario Review, 2003)<br /><br />We Never Speak of It starts out with a bang, as good poetry books probably should; \\"Crossing Lava Creek,\\" a poem that (and I feel like this is a spoiler) describes what can only be a tornado coming out of nowhere, but doing it in such a way that it's hard to tell it's anything but an everyday storm. Just, in other words, in the voice of its eleven-year-old narrator.<br /><br />What happens after this is really the deciding factor as to whether this book is or is not one of the best books of poetry I've read in the past few years, and I still haven't figured that out. Either Harris is so in tune with her subjects, and manages to use the diction in which they speak, so much that the time period in which these poems take place becomes second nature, or the poems themselves slide into the realm of the good rather than the realm of the fantastic. (The end result is the same; everything that comes after \\"Crossing Lava Creek\\" seems rather an anticlimax, even the other storms.) The difference between the two is whether it's a conscious trick of technique (as in, say, the novels of Cormac McCarthy) or whether familiarity, in this case, bred contempt. I am more than willing to give Harris the benefit of the doubt, and wouldn't have even considered the other possibility save that such a talent is so very rare; as readers of McCarthy will attest, using such a rhythm so that it is both effortless for the author and for the reader is even more rare. If that really is what's happening here (and reading a few more books by Harris, which has shot up my list of priorities as I made my way through this, should tell me if it is), then, as is becoming increasingly common in the past few years, I have uncovered another seemingly overlooked gem in the pantheon, another poet whose work is in desperate need of being read by, well, anyone and everyone. If not, it's a book chock full of good, solid work, and should be read at least by those with a liking for poetry, for history, and especially for the combination of the two.<br /><br />This rating may go way up in the future. *** ½solid work, and should be read at least by those with a liking for poetry, for history, and especially for the combination of the two. <br /> <br />This rating may go way up in the future. *** 	2005-05-20

It's great in small doses, but if you get too much at once, you're going to get sick. Poems Before and After, which is for all intents and purposes the Collected Translations up to 1990, is verging on the too much.<br /><br />Miroslav Holub is a brilliant writer, one of the same generation of Eastern European writers that produced poetic giants Charles Simic and Vladimir Holan.

And there's no denying that the work here is, for the most part, fantastic. Absolutely lovely stuff. But there's so much of it, and Holub's work is so dense, that the reader is best advised to read this book over a space of months, dipping into it now and again before retreating and mulling over what he's read. This is one for your permanent collection; you'll be going back to it over the space of years.

Takami Koshoun, Battle Royale (Viz, 1999)<br /><br />While I can't find any publication figures on Battle Royale, Viz' blurb on the back assures me it was a runaway bestseller (their words) in Japan, and that the manga which is based upon it has sold similarly well. For that matter, Kinji Fukasaku's film adaptation has very little box office information about it at IMDB, though I am prepared to accept that it, too, was a smash; pretty much everyone I know who likes (or is even curious about) modern Japanese film has either seen it or wants to see it. (Unfortunately, as of now I still fall into the latter category.) It is a film that comes readily to the fore when a Japahorror newbie asks, \\"so what should I see first?\\" In other words, in all sorts of media, Battle Royale has turned into something of a phenomenon (assuming one believes Viz' assertions, which I've no reason not to).<br /><br />Like the not-nearly-as-deserving Da Vinci Code, reading Battle Royale will show you pretty easily what would cause it to become a major bestseller. With a few exceptions (the introduction and first chapter are interminable), Koshoun keeps the pages turning in this six-hundred-plus-page epic. The pace is exceptionally done once you've gotten to page forty or fifty, the subject matter has that \\"beauty of a particularly gruesome auto accident\\" feel to it, and the main characters are well-enough drawn that you can at least empathize with them on a surface level.<br /><br />The plot is exceptionally simple: a junior high school class, forty-two students, are taken to a remote, evacuated island and ordered to participate in what is called The Program. It's a game of sorts in which the objective is exceptionally simple: be the last surviving student. To that end, students are equipped with basic survival equipment and a random weapon or two with which to defend themselves against, and kill, their classmates. There are a few extra rules thrown in to make sure the game doesn't stagnate, but that's the gist of it. And really, what could be more fun than six hundred pages of fifteen-year-olds killing each other?<br /><br />As a straight genre thriller, the book works on just about every level. It's prime genre writing, right down to characters wandering around with \\"kill me\\" stamped on their foreheads and the final battle being, for all intents and purposes, obvious by the time you've reached the end of the first few chapters. In the larger picture, though, it's not quite as successful as the cover blurb and the adaptations would have you believe. It's obvious that Koshoun meant Battle Royale not just as a thriller, but as both a satire on modern civilization and a rant against fascism (how much fascism Koshoun attributes to current-day Japanese civilization is a valid question, but one to be answered with far more authority by a Japanese critic, or at least someone living in the country capable of reading the novel in the original), Battle Royale leaves way too much out to really be effective. Every once in a while, some of the characters stop what they're doing and mouth various platitudes about how awful the government is and how they'd like to strike against it, or how awful a civilization must be that would allow such a game to go on. None of it really works, at least in translation. Ironically, the places it works best are in one student's assessment of the government as unbeatable, simply because despite how awful it is, it works (cf. Mussolini making the trains run on time), which rather undercuts the satire angle.<br /><br />Another place it fails somewhat, and this is obviously no fault of Koshoun's, is in the English translation. Where other translators might have glossed over some of the Japanese idioms, or at least made them more familiar to human ears, the translation seems almost literal in places, to where the text, especially in internal monologues, sounds like badly-dubbed dialogue from a sixties Godzilla movie. This, of course, leaves the reader somewhat jarred (but with, it should be said, a feeling of amusement).<br /><br />Despite all its various faults, I will emphasize my earlier statement that Battle Royale is a good-- no, a great-- genre thriller. The back cover compares it to Lord of the Flies, but it seems to me that a better comparison would be to \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" with the twist that everyone is both hunter and hunted. This is one hell of a fun ride, so pony up your E ticket and hop on. *** ½urse, leaves the reader somewhat jarred (but with, it should be said, a feeling of amusement). <br /> <br />Despite all its various faults, I will emphasize my earlier statement that Battle Royale is a good-- no, a great-- genre thriller.

(As I write this, Days Gone Bye has been out for less than a year, and vol. 3 is due to come out any day now; Kirkman is really cranking away on this one.) While it opens with one of the most common scenes in modern zombie lit, Kirkman's stated intention is very different than much of what we've seen recently, and at least in the first installment, the practice goes hand in hand with the theory.<br /><br />Rick Grimes is a Kentucky cop who gets himself shot at the opening of the story. He wakes up from a coma some time later to find a deserted hospital. Upon searching, he finds that the walking dead of the title have pretty much taken over the planet. Rick heads for Atlanta, seeking his wife and child, and meets up with a group of survivors. While zombies form the frame of the story, what's at the core of this book is the dynamics between the survivors; the zombies are just the spice to their meat.<br /><br />This is exceptional stuff. If the series continues to be this good, I can easily see it taking a place beside Watchmen on my very, very short shelf of the graphic novels I liked so much I actually went out and bought copies. ****	2005-05-20

(Ecco, 2003)<br /><br />Like Come Meet Muffin, another JCO-penned, Mark Graham-illustrated, Ecco-released picture book. Like Come Meet Muffin, about the Smith family and their daughter Lily (I have not been able to ascertain whether the Oates family has a daughter/granddaughter of that name from a quick web search). Like Come Meet Muffin, about a cat who hops out the window (though for a different reason this time) and gets lost.<br /><br />Now, we all know that Joyce Carol Oates is, in fact, a human-shaped robot who does nothing but write (or keeps one chained in her basement, because someone has to be writing a thousand pages a day while she's teaching classes), because there's no human being on the planet who can turn out that much consistently good work at that rate of speed, let alone doing it for coming up on half a century now. But one wonders if the CD player in the robot's head skipped, because Where Is Little Reynard? is almost identical to Come Meet Muffin. Granted, five years passed between their release dates, but still. It's very un-JCO, otherwise Beasts would be functionally identical to Foxfire, which would be functionally identical to Because it Is Bitter..., which would be (you get the picture), and such is emphatically not the case. One is left, well, rather confused.<br /><br />The saving grace is, of course, Mark Graham's lovely illustrations, which are themselves well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />This one will probably stay a library loaner, unlike Come Meet Muffin, which I'll definitely be buying. But it's definitely one the kids will see at some point. ***	2005-05-20

Garth Ennis, John Constantine, Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits (Vertigo, 1994)<br /><br />It is entirely likely that anyone reading this review doesn't need me to say a thing about it. You already know who John Constantine is (even those of you who don't follow comics, thanks to the recent Keanu Reeves vehicle). You probably even know what issue numbers are contained in this book, which was the beginning of Garth Ennis' stint as the primary writer, and what happens in them. On the off chance, however, that someone who's not into comics stumbles across this review, I'll go ahead and say \\"get this.\\"<br /><br />Chain-smoking, hard-drinking John Constantine, rake, magician, and all-around bad guy, has just found out he has terminal lung cancer. He's going to die. He has few to turn to for help; most of his friends are dead, and both friends and adversaries still alive are loath to help him for various reasons of their own. Thus, Constantine has to come up with a typically brilliant, diabolical plan in order to get himself out of an inextricable mess.<br /><br />Granted, this is a regular day in the life of the Hellblazer, but Ennis, the man behind the great Preacher, brings a style and energy to Constantine's character that's undeniable and attractive. He's a bit less comfortable with some of the minor characters from older issues, as if he's still getting used to being thrust into their skins, but as this story arc is highly centered around Constantine and a new character, that doesn't play as important a part as one might at first think. (The Snob, especially, is... well, downright boring here.) Ennis' writing is as witty and wiseacre as ever, and, well, it's simply a load of fun. If you're not familiar with Constantine, you may want to hunt down Original Sins before this, but this is one you'll definitely want to go on to. *** ½	2005-05-20

Simon Maginn, Sheep (Severn House, 1994)<br /><br />Simon Maginn's name is almost unknown in America, and that's a crime. While other, some might say less deserving, modern Brit horror authors have crossed the channel with a good deal of success (Tim Lebbon immediately comes to mind), Maginn works away, languishing in obscurity, for reasons unknown.<br /><br />Sheep, Maginn's first novel, struck me repeatedly as I was reading it as doing everything David Searcy's novel Ordinary Horror tried, and for the most part failed, to do. Maginn's writing doesn't have quite the lustre of Searcy's, but the book holds together much more nicely, and the characters are just as well-drawn without the long, drawn-out internal narratives that stop the (almost nonexistent) action in Searcy's book at least once per chapter.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one: city family goes to country to inhabit dark, foreboding house. Odd things start happening to already-unstable mother and seemingly impenetrable kid. Father watches somewhat helplessly as life goes rather sour around him. There's nothing terribly unpredictable here (though it's possible those who aren't very well-read in the science fiction and horror genres won't see the book's major twist coming); what sets Sheep apart and makes it worthwhile is Maginn's ability to take the old and make it fresh again. He does this not only with his main characters, who are perfectly drawn, but with an odd and wonderful assemblage of minor characters; their gay ex-army sheepfarmer neighbor next door, the religious couple down the road, a quite addlepated doctor and his motherly nurse, etc. The reason old plots can come off so fresh is that some authors are capable of imagining people in them that haven't seen them before, and all the different reactions that go along with same.<br /><br />As difficult as it may be to find the work of Simon Maginn, go out of your way to do so. It's subtle, quiet horror that may well renew your faith in the languishing atmospheric side of the genre. ****the languishing atmospheric side of the genre. ****	2005-05-20

Dale Bick Carson, The Plant People (Franklin Watts, 1977)<br /><br />I tracked a copy of this down last week. I hadn't read it since it originally came out; we're coming up on three decades since then. Despite the estimated fifteen thousand books that have crossed my eyes since then, images from this book were stuck (most of them distorted, as it turned out, but still kind of accurate) in my head after all this time. It obviously made a pretty serious impression on me when I was nine years old. What else could I do but grab the library's copy and take a trip down memory lane?<br /><br />For the most part, it was a satisfying trip, but I am somewhat depressed to say that much of the pleasure was of a purely nostalgic bent. Looking at it with considerably older eyes, I saw all the flaws in the book that may well explain why it's been so obscure for so long. The paper-thin story revolves around Mike, a teen from Cactus, Nevada, who rides back into town one evening to find the town covered with fog that contains small dancing lights. Soon after, members of the community start changing; they get docile, almost catatonic, and odd markings begin appearing on their skin. Things are looking very, very strange in Cactus...<br /><br />There's so much potential for a great horror story here, as evidenced by the fact that the same premise has been used a number of other times and come up with winners. But Carson's revelation of why the fog affects some people and not others is handled so woodenly it might be one of the town's namesake plants, and the social criticism at the heart of the book is handled in painfully amateur fashion. Ten-year-olds could do (and, in some cases, have done) better in school book reports.<br /><br />But what made such an impression on me as a eight-year-old, and what remains so effective on a second reading twenty-eight years later, are the pictures. Rather than your typical illustrated kids' book, The Plant People is illustrated with photographs, almost film stills. These are truly chilling (and while I don't remember for sure, I'd hazard a guess that to a nine-year-old obsessed with monster movies, they were nightmare-inducing). They are definitely worth checking out, especially if you're in your impressionable years. ** ½phs, almost film stills.

243088:US	50068216	RL1DBP64GN6V	0965104265	128768868	Torture Garden	Books	2	8	24	N	Y	Henry does Dallas	Octave Mirbeau, The Torture Garden (RE/Search, 1899)<br /><br />A new edition of a nineteenth-century classic of decadence is usually a good thing, right? The problem being that nineteenth-century classics of decadence often end up reading more like Henry James-- in his long-winded later years-- than actual decadence. The Torture Garden is redeemed in this respect only by being shorter than most.<br /><br />While it cannot be argued that, along with its brevity, The Torture Garden was certainly one of the most explicit books of its time, that time is long past, and one has to ask the question of whether the book has any relevance at all to the modern reader. In most cases, the answer will be no. Today, The Torture Garden is going to appeal to an extremely select group of people-- those who both hunger for the explicit and have enough tolerance for the diction of nineteenth-century writing to be able to get the explicitness out of it.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way during the twentieth century, fiction got a lot less heavy on the description and replaced what was missing with an emphasis on plot. Now, normally I'm the first person to rush into the breach, screaming about how awful an idea this usually is. It leads to things like Danielle Steel selling uncounted millions of novels that are not, one presumes, being used for their most appropriate purposes (e.g., lining cat pans). However, the parallel to this is that there had to be some sort of previous description-heavy movement, and it had to lead somewhere decadent enough that the literati felt the need to rebel against it. The previous remark about Henry James in his later years is quite an excellent example of where it had led-- bloated, flowery books that weren't really about anything, in any meaningful sense of the word. The Torture Garden is one of these, minus (thankfully) some of the bloat, and literally flowery. There is much breast-beating, a good deal of horror (in the beginning, anyway) at the thought of women showing their ankles in public, the common trope of a faraway country (in this case, China) being picked as a setting because no one really knew all that much about it, and a whole lot of description, but underneath, there's really nothing at all. Worse, Mirbeau seems to have decided to ignore such things as continuity (contrast, for example, the endless, intensely boring frame at the beginning of the novel with its final page, and wonder how the narrator got from point B to point A). To the reader of the modern pornographic novel, this will not be new. In fact, it's a mark that's branded the cheap, low-quality pornographic novel... well, seemingly at least since the turn of the twentieth century. **thought of women showing their ankles in public, the common trope of a faraway country (in this case, China) being picked as a setting because no one really knew all that much about it, and a whole lot of description, but underneath, there's really nothing at all.

Lyn Lifshin, A New Film About a Woman in Love with the Dead (March Street Press, 2002)<br /><br />Lyn Lifhsin's poems are an almost unbearable compulsion. They are not always consistent, and they are not always perfect (as no poet's output ever is), but they are always readable, at the least.<br /><br />A New Film About a Woman in Love with the Dead is the dissection of a long-ago relationship. An old lover has died, seemingly unexpectedly, and the speaker seems to have taken it worse than she had expected to. Still, all that aside, there's still the pithiness one expects from a well-turned Lifshin piece, the punning and asides coming off here as sardonic more than anything else.<br /><br />I have often said that Lifshin's writing has improved as she's gotten older, and A New Film About a Woman in Love with the Dead is another piece of hard evidence to back that hypothesis up. This is fine stuff, and definitely deserves to be read by more folks than it has been up till now. If you've never been exposed to Lifshin, I suggest grabbing one of the recent Black Sparrow collections from your local library (Before It's Light is phenomenal), and, if you find it to your taste, hunting down a copy of this (available through both Amazon and directly from March Street); you'll not only be getting yourself a very good book, you'll also be supporting a small press who are in the midst of dire financial struggles. And that, too, would be a wonderful thing. ****	2005-05-12

Joi Brozek, Sleeleveless (Phony Lid Books, 2002)<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about Sleeveless is that it's a difficult book to read. Not in the way Henry James is difficult to read, but rather it's the kind of book that, periodically, you'll need to put down and walk away from for a while. Thankfully, it is also the kind of book that, once your head's back on straight, will draw you back to pick it up again.<br /><br />Lisha is a high school girl in New York in the late eighties. She's chock full of emotional problems anyway, but as the book opens, we're treated to the spectacle of a DIY abortion performed on her younger sister which goes fatally wrong. From there, Lisha goes pretty much completely over the edge. The end result of this is that she turns cutting (one does not speculate as to whether she was a cutter before the incident, which is actually a pretty important point) into art-- which becomes the new fad at her school.<br /><br />It's not nearly as linear as that synopsis (or the synopsis on the back of the book) makes it sound; it's far more a character study than a plot-driven novel. This, of course, is a good thing, especially as Lisha is not, in any way, a likable character. Identifiable, yes, but Brozek hasn't invested her with a single shred of likability. Lisha's treading of the line between sanity and insanity and the line between art and murder turn the book into an odd, appealing amalgam of William Herrick's ...kill memory... and Dennis Lehane's Shutter Island, but without the plot-driven feel of the latter novel.<br /><br />Good stuff, definitely worth your time. ****	2005-05-12

Robin Hobb, Fool's Errand (Bantam, 2002)<br /><br />Robin Hobb has, not surprisingly, done it again. Fool's Errand, the first book in the Tawny Man trilogy, is wonderful. The main characters from the Farseer books are back, but that doesn't stop her treading into Liveship Traders territory enough to draw in the fans of that series as well, and the whole makes for a wonderful introduction to the two books that follow it.<br /><br />The time is fifteen years after the events in Assassin's Quest, and an unknown but short time after the events in Ship of Destiny (certainly no more than a year). Fitz has spent a good deal of the last decade and a half in seclusion, living in a previously-abandoned cottage not far outside Forge, renouncing both his heritage and the duties of his office following the Red Ship War. As we open, Kettricken is in the process of negotiating a trade alliance with the Outislanders that will involve the betrothal of her son, Dutiful, to a noble daughter of an Outisland clan. Fitz is approached first by Chade, then by the Tawny Man himself (if you don't know who the Tawny Man is-- and it's a pretty simple process of elimination if you're familiar with the first trilogy-- I'll not spoil the surprise for you), requesting he come back to Buckkeep as a teacher and mentor for the prince. Fitz, now living under the name Tom Badgerlock, refuses until a nameless rider beings bad tidings, and Fitz is once again forced to take up the role he has always played-- the Catalyst to the White Prophet.<br /><br />That Hobb's writing is great swords-and-sorcery is no secret to anyone who's been reading her stuff. Now, though, she's got the full wight of twenty-five hundred pages apiece of two trilogies behind her, and five thousand rich, detailed pages of worldbuilding, and that just makes it all the better. Hobb does do the whole \\"flashback to reacquaint the reader with stuff\\" thing that's been so annoying in, say, recent novels by Terry Goodkind, but here it's far less obtrusive; Hobb doesn't assume that her readers have the same memory span as your average goldfish, and the premise of intelligence by the writer on the part of the reader is certainly refreshing. The only question is, if Hobb can spend five hundred pages on this, which seems a rather minor incident in the greater scheme of this story, how on earth is she going to get the whole thing told in only two more books? (A quick check at Amazon reveals part of the answer; they're both much longer than this seemingly introductory volume.)

Snicket is almost to the point of ranging out of children's territory here. That said, the quality of the writing is about as good as it ever was, and if you like the humor in the series, it doesn't let up here; it just has a much, much blacker twist to it.

Karen B. Chapman, The Marino Mission (Wiley, 2005)<br /><br />An excellent idea for a book-- write a short novel aimed at teens that contains one thousand SAT vocabulary words. Pick a subject that will probably resound with the teen population and run with it. Granted, your language is going to be a bit highbrow, but that's the whole purpose of the thing, right?<br /><br />Chapman comes pretty close to getting it right. The target audience will not be the wiser when she stumbles a bit trying to fit one of the words in (using \\"prototype,\\" for example, to describe the last instance of something, rather than the first, or an early, instance), and the plot gets a bit clunky at times. Still, for what it is, the books succeeds pretty well. Also comes with a good number of vocabulary exercises and the like for students to get the new words they're exposed to here cemented in their heads. ***	2005-05-12

Andrew Beyer, My $50,000 Year at the Races (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978)<br /><br />Now, I rush to start by saying that while a $50,000 year at the races doesn't look so spectacular when some guy in Phoenix just cashed for $1.7 million on the Derby superfecta (on a quick-pick ticket, no less), remember that you need to figure in 1978 dollars, and this was back in the days when the exacta was the hot new thing, unless you happened to be in Mexico, where they had the Pick Six at Caliente. Most horseplayer were still grinding it out with win bets. And as anyone who's tried to make fifty grand betting $100 a race (or even, as Beyer did in his serious bets in this book, a grand) on win bets will tell you, it's a pretty serious achievement.<br /><br />Andrew Beyer has always been somewhat crass, elitist, and off-putting. These traits don't come out much in his handicapping books, Picking Winners and The Winning Horseplayer, but his editorial columns almost always spark some sort of minor furor among a minority of racing fans. This being a memoir of sorts, you can be sure you're going to get the same attitude here, and you do, in spades. If you don't like Beyer's Washington Post style, you're probably going to want to pass this.<br /><br />Even though this is a memoir, however, Beyer offers a number of common-sense tips that many horseplayers have probably either never learned or forgotten about; for example, the idea of specializing. Beyer shows how to do it while still betting aggressively, putting your cash down on a number of races that would cause most pros to turn somewhat green, and still make money. This is something you need to know, but you're not going to find it in any respectable handicapping tome.<br /><br />A definite must for students of the game. I have long through that handicapping books should be not in the gambling section of the bookstore, but in self-help; stick this one in the inspirational section. ****	2005-05-12

Bill Benson and M. J. Beckman, The Law That Never Was, vol. I (Constitutional Research Associates, 1985)<br /><br />The idea behind this book is a powerful one: that the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America (for those of you who fell asleep in civics class, it's better known as the \\"income tax amendment\\") was never ratified, and thus the government's collection of income tax every year is fraudulent. What American wouldn't jump at the idea that you don't have to give a third or more of your income tot he Federal government every year?<br /><br />Well, unfortunately, out of three hundred million of us, the answer's probably in the vicinity of two hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred fifty thousand, and that's being generous because the book's been out for twenty years. I'm hoping copies of it have passed through fifty thousand hands. And yet, how many of those people have stood up and asked questions about this? Very, very few.<br /><br />Part of the reason so few people have read this book is its expense. It is no longer sold without its companion, volume II (despite that they were published a year apart, and each is a stand-alone volume), and the set is quite expensive for a country where the average person spends less on books in a year than this set costs. It's possible that another part of the reason is that, if you care at all about language and presentation, it's simply impossible to recommend this book. All the great ideas here, and all the evidence, is presented horribly.<br /><br />The Law That Never Was, vol. I is three hundred sixty-six pages long. I didn't actually get out the ruler, measure, multiply, and extrapolate, but I'm estimating that a full fifty pages of that amount was repetition-- exact repetition-- of two key pieces of legislation that the ratifications of most of the states broke and paragraphs of explanatory text surrounding them. Another fifty to seventy-five pages was taken up with lists of the details that made the ratifications incorrect, many of which were repeated from state to state. Perhaps, one thinks, a two hundred fifty page books would have cost less to print than a three hundred sixty-six page book, and might cost less to the consumer; however, when one is self-publishing, one does not have the services of a good editor to point out the incredibly annoying repetition. Nor would that editor point out that exclamation points, especially in a chapter heading, especially when there are more than one of them at a time, especially when they are meant to convey a threat, are just begging for ridicule of the authors. Such things make for schoolyard bully taunts, not good legal writing.<br /><br />This is a fabulous idea, and so important in the general scheme of things in America that it should be read by every tax paying American. However, most tax paying Americans will find it very hard to get through-- not just the legalese, but the general unreadability of it. And yet, it is worth persevering, because this is not information you are likely to get from anyone else. Certainly, the IRS will never tell you they're criminals. ** ½the details that made the ratifications incorrect, many of which were repeated from state to state.

Timothy Donnelly, Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove, 2003)<br /><br />There are millions of poets in America for whom Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit should be required reading. Specifically, the slam poets, the performance poets, and those on the opposite end of the spectrum who haven't yet figured out that rhythm is still an essential component of free verse.<br /><br />Richard Howard, in his brief but effusive introduction to the book, seems focused on the fact that most of the poems in this book are not, to the unschooled eye, really about much of anything: \\"I am perfectly well aware,\\" Howard opines, \\"that the first (and probably last) question that will be asked is 'What's it all about-- what's he saying?'\\" As I have said repeatedly, folks, if that's the first question you ask when you read a poem, go to whatever school taught you poetry and demand a refund. It's the wrong question by a mile. The first thing you should be asking yourself after reading a poem is \\"how does it sound?\\"<br /><br />In the case of Timothy Donnelly, the answer is, for every one of these poems, \\"fantastic.\\" Donnelly may be a young poet publishing his first (as far as I can tell, anyway) book, but he's obviously already paid his poetic dues. He is a master of aggressively free verse, but free verse which uses with a surgeon's precision both rhythm and internal rhyme. This is poetry that is truly a joy to read aloud.<br /><br />\\"See before him compost, a mound of it, the moist<br /><br />rot monitored with heart.

Jack Priest, Ragged Man (Bootleg Books, 2003)<br /><br />About a year ago, having been out of the \\"scene\\" for so long, I stuck my ear to the floorboards again and started listening around for the names of the hot new horror authors, the guys who weren't big enough yet to have been tabbed for a Leisure Books contract, but who were going places fast. I came up with five names, eventually. Adam Pepper. Monica J. O'Rourke. Carlton Mellick III. Mark McLaughlin. Jack Priest.<br /><br />The first full-length I've read by any of the five (I've read lovely short stories from both McLaughlin and O'Rourke that have made me want more) is Jack Priest's debut novel, Ragged Man. While I'm not terribly sure I'd actually call it a horror novel-- more like a Michael Slade thriller combined with the movie Fallen-- I certainly liked it well enough to warrant reading more Jack Priest stuff.<br /><br />Rick Gordon and his wife Ann, competing in an Australian off-road race, get lost in the dust and off the track, wrecking their car. While they're trying to decide what to do, an old man and his wife approach them with a very strange request, which they honor. That's when things start to go a little weird. \\"Weird\\" as in the people close to Rick and Ann start dying...<br /><br />Ragged Man has two speeds: fast and breakneck. (In this, it reminded me a good deal of Doug Winter's fine novel Run, which I believe was the only other novel I've read in recent memory that has this runaway feel to it.) This works to its detriment slightly in the first few chapters, while we're still getting to know some of the characters (and while the action, if you haven't seen Fallen, will be slightly confusing), but things settle in right quick after about thirty pages, you've got a picture of what's going on, and it's time to sit back and enjoy the ride. The other main problem I had with the book can't be revealed without a major spoiler, but one of the turning points of the book happened a little too conveniently. (It does make sense, reflecting on the book as a whole afterwards, but I wish there had been just a bit more to link it to the events that helped it make sense, upon that reflection. And that, I must say, is a very convoluted sentence, and I apologize.)<br /><br />Other than that, though, it's an adrenaline-fueled slasher novel with the punch of an action flick. Its goal is to roll over your head with all the subtlety of a steam hammer, and it succeeds admirably in its goal. If you're looking for a good, fast-paced thriller, you need look no further than Ragged Man. Recommended. *** ½ting on the book as a whole afterwards, but I wish there had been just a bit more to link it to the events that helped it make sense, upon that reflection.

Charles Simic, Hotel Insomnia (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1992)<br /><br />If I ever meet Charles Simic, I am likely to ask that one question every author really hates: \\"Where do you get your ideas?\\"<br /><br />It's not that the overarching, grand design of Simic's work is incomprehensible or anything. In fact, in Hotel Insomnia, if anything, it's more noticeable than ever; for once, the book's title really does tie into almost everything in the book. Insomnia is a major theme in these poems, and it runs throughout like a bad infomercial on late-night TV in the background, bleary-eyed, beer in hand, in its boxer shorts, and yet strangely appealing.<br /><br />No, it's not that. It's in the details, those damnable little snippets of poetry that make Charles Simic's poems little gems of wide-eyed brilliance:<br /><br />\\"There's a painting over the cash register:<br /><br />Of a stiff Quaker couple dressed in black.<br /><br />They hold a cat under each arm.<br /><br />One is a tiger, the other is Siamese.<br /><br />The eyes are closed because it's very late,<br /><br />And because cats see better with their eyes closed.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Caged Fortuneteller\\")<br /><br />This is a guy who knows something about you. No matter who you are. And in every book he releases, he will reveal a little of it, until you're paranoid, hiding in a darkened room, peeking out of the blinds, unable to sleep, just waiting for Charles Simic to come knocking on your door, because you're convinced he's coming for you.<br /><br />And isn't that what it's all about? **** ½	2005-04-29

Willie Perdomo, Smoking Lovely (Rattapallax, 2003)<br /><br />I picked this up blind from the library, and as soon as I saw the word \\"Nuyorican\\" on the cover, I braced myself for the worst. Reflex action. Pound for pound, I've seen more bad non-poetry coming out of the Nuyorican scene than just about anywhere else.<br /><br />True to form, when Perdomo is writing poetry, well, he fails. It's non-poetry of the most banal sort; image plays no part in the work at all, leading to prose chopped up into lines to make it look good. Well, it doesn't make it look good, it makes it look either pretentious or like an affectation used to make the pieces take up more room on a page (thus, leading to more pages, thus, leading to faster book publication).<br /><br />The prose pieces here, though, have more of a grip to them. When the author is on his game, he's really on his game. Short, punchy paragraphs that (ironically, given the above paragraph) are all about helping the reader see through the author's eyes. Unfortunately, the strength of the prose makes the weakness of the poetry all the more apparent. **	2005-04-27

Nancy Spector, Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle (Guggenheim, 2002)<br /><br />Nancy Spector's tome may just have been meant as an accoutrement to the Guggenheim's massive Barney exhibition in 2002, but as an accoutrement, it stands out. Not only in its physical dimensions (Amazon's website says the shipping weight of this book is 8.6 pounds, but after lugging it around for six weeks, I'm willing to put money on the idea that it's closer to twenty-five; it's over a foot tall, and easily as thick as one of the larger volumes of the unabridged OED), but in the concept itself. Spector's essay on Barney takes up the first ninety-two pages, after which comes a glossary of Cremaster terms that reads better than any other glossary you've ever read (think of The Dictionary of the Khazars to get an idea, but using all terms that relate to the Cremaster cycle). Then, of course, the photographs. Mostly video and production stills from the films, but also photos of pieces of Barney's original sketches and storyboard, the sculptures made after the films, and other wonderful little oddities. Good stuff, and a must-have for any Barney fan. Those who have just heard the name, but not seen the films, will get an excellent overview of what you've managed to miss. Those who have no idea who Matthew Barney is, check it out to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />In other words, you want this. ****	2005-04-27

Lemony Snicket, The Hostile Hospital (Scholastic, 2001)<br /><br />The Baudelaire orphans continue their adventures, and Lemony Snicket finally abandons, for good, the episodic nature of the early part of the series, in The Hostile Hospital. There's not really much to say about the eighth book in a series, as far as talking about the plot, the characters, and all that other good stuff; if you've made it this far, you know all that (unless you're my daughter, who for some odd reason decided to start with book ten and work her way backward). In this case, however, what's worth talking about is the book itself. Mr. Snicket has taken a rather drear turn over the past couple of books in the series. The tone has gotten considerably darker, and while there are still a number of laugh-out-loud-funny scenes, and the inevitable definitions, things have gotten very grim indeed. The episodic nature of the books ha gone away, as I mentioned before, at the same time, and Sunny's learning to speak, while it's becoming obvious that Mr. Snicket and his beloved Beatrice play much more than an observer's role in things. Are all these facts related? You won't be able to tell by the end of The Hostile Hospital, but I guarantee you, if you're already a fan of the series, you'll be opening the cover of book nine (or putting it on hold) within minutes of finishing this one. Pity the poor souls who read it the second it came out, and found it necessary to wait for the publication of the ninth book. *** ½	2005-04-27

Mark Cramer, Value Handicapping (City Miner Books, 1994)<br /><br />The most frustrating thing about Mark Cramer's handicapping books is always that Cramer's handicapping process is so right-brained that, while he's explaining what you do with an odds line in an accessible manner, you've no idea how he actually comes up with it. Value Handicapping gives far more insight into this than the rest of his books, and in all honesty it's a whole lot simpler than any of us have likely thought (he makes one horse 3-1 simply because its connections are hitting 25% in that particular kind of race, for example).<br /><br />Cramer takes races here and breaks them down into various recognizable race types, giving us variations on how to make an odds line for each (though some are of the usual \\"what is he doing?\\" variety readers of The Odds on Your Side, etc., will easily recognize), for the most part updating information found in some of his earlier books, adding some new things here and there.<br /><br />Basically, if you're already a Cramer fan, you probably want this. If you're not familiar with his work yet, you may want to start with Kinky Handicapping or The Odds on Your Side first to get some idea of that man's rather quirky writing style. *** ½	2005-04-27

Lucius Shepard, Viator (Night Shade Books, 2004)<br /><br />Lucius Shepard is one of America's most underrated writers by any standards. The man comes out with book after book of gorgeous prose and gets, for the most part, not a breath of press about it. Viator, his latest offering (but not for long; Shepard has two coming out in 2005), continues the trend both of wonderful writing and lack of anything even remotely resembling press coverage.<br /><br />Thomas Wilander, homeless, rootless, and unstable (his own word), has been hired by a Manpower temp agency in Alaska to go out to a wrecked ship called Viator and head up a team of four other men in assessing the value of the wreckage as scrap. Wilander goes about his business, rarely seeing the four other men, and eventually striking up a relationship with the owner of the trading post in the nearest town, Kaliaska. The other man, all of whom have been on the ship longer than Wilander, have become absorbed in obsessions with various parts of the ship (one is fascinated with the formations of the rust, one with the ship's glass, etc). As time goes on, Wilander starts to feel the tug of the ship as well, and becomes absorbed in his own obsessions, while those around him become ever more fearful of his sanity.<br /><br />The book has almost a Heart of Darkness feel to it, though granted the ship here is washed up on shore. Shepard's lush descriptions and deliberate pacing keep the reader always wondering what's just over the horizon, while simultaneously not wanting to leave whatever details Shepard is inking at the time. It's beautiful, beautiful prose, and it demands to be savored.<br /><br />The book's only real letdown is the ending, as other reviewers have noted; the book jumps from Heart of Darkness to The X-Files a little too quickly, and it's likely to jar the unsuspecting reader. Still, there is a good deal to be liked here; this is Shepard doing what Shepard does best, and he does it very well indeed. *** ½*** 	2005-04-27

Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle (Greenwillow, 1986)<br /><br />I admit it-- I have fallen completely under the spell of Diana Wynne Jones. Howl's Moving Castle is a delight of a fantasy novel, taking things that should be predictable and making them not so (as in, you're saying \\"I should have known that was coming\\" at least ten times as you read it).<br /><br />Sophie Hatter, the eldest of the Hatter sisters, is convinced that she's destined for failure because, well, she's the eldest. Her father dies suddenly, and her not-so-wicked stepmother inherits the business, giving Sophie an apprenticeship and sending her two sisters off to apprenticeships with other artisans (a baker and a witch) in order to make ends meet. Sophie manages to offend the Witch of the Waste, a rather all-around nasty sort, and gets cursed. In order to get the curse lifted, she makes a desperate attempt to throw in her lot with the wizard Howl, whose moving castle (you knew that was coming, right?) putters around the outskirts of Market Chipping, the town in which Sophie lives, despite the widespread rumors that Howl like to eat girls' souls...<br /><br />This is great stuff. Young adult fantasy that, like all good young adult material, is sure to hold the interest of adults as well. Jones' writing style is (for want of a better term) sprightly, and keeps the pages turning, and the characters are quite well-formed. (If there is a place where the book dips, it's that Jones does a bit more telling of the characters' emotions than showing, though she does offset the effect by couching it oftentimes in amusing dramatic monologues).<br /><br />If you haven't yet become a fan of Diana Wynne Jones, this is a fine place to start, especially with the recent film adaptation (by no less a personage than Hayao Miyazaki) getting ready for release in the western market. ****	2005-04-27

Rochelle Theo Pienn, The Claws in the Eiderdown (Bloody Someday Press, 1998)<br /><br />I wrote a review for this book three days ago, after which my word processor decided to vomit up its innards. I lost this review, and two and a half others, in the process. I'm going to try and take it as a sign that I shouldn't be quite as effusive in my praise for Rochelle Theo Pienn's first book, The Claws in the Eiderdown. I'm not sure, however, I will be able to succeed.<br /><br />It's rare that I read books of poetry that fill me with the kind of excitement this one does. It's rarer still to find a poet's debut book that does it. Even more odd about it is that Pienn is one of two kinds of poets, both exceptionally rare, and I can't figure out which. She's either one of those Rimbaud-like enfants terribles who's never studied poetry, but who has so much of the art innate in her that her artistry transcends her naivete, or she's one of that handful of poets who has both studied and practiced poetry to the point where the rules are so second nature that she knows exactly how to break them for maximum effect<br /><br />without weakening a piece:<br /><br />\\"In the smaller hours,<br /><br />tired, tired,<br /><br />ten times tired,<br /><br />the calls of stranger<br /><br />animals than man<br /><br />strengthen in the mix of<br /><br />dreams and caravans<br /><br />of happy hour traffic jams.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"The Dream Weaver\\")<br /><br />Horrid line breaks (which are the norm for the book), abstractions, repetition, but it all sounds so gorgeous that the reader simply can't care.<br /><br />The repetition should be especially noted, for there are a number of times in this book that Pienn shows herself better at the judicious use of repetition than many poets who have been writing (judging by the picture on the book's back, but note that I'm a notoriously bad judge of age) twice as long as this woman has been walking the planet.<br /><br />Yes, you can study that sort of thing, and you can even internalize it. But combine it with her apparent age and the relative constancy of those breakings of the rules, and I keep coming back to the enfant terrible thing. No matter who you count in that category, you have to admit that there haven't been more than a handful since Rimbaud. Mull that over for a few minutes.<br /><br />All that said, why isn't the book getting five stars? It's not Pienn's fault. There are a few typos that are probably understandable (especially given the way proofreaders at even the major publishing houses have seemed to be slacking off recently), but a few of them jar the reader out of the reverie into which Pienn's poems seduce:<br /><br />\\"Quite street right before<br /><br />Rain. How to freeze<br /><br />that moment in time?\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Passing\\")<br /><br />This, folks, is the debut of a major new talent in poetry. I hope that twenty years from now I'll be able to sit here and say \\"I told you so\\" when she's jetted off to wherever to pick up a Pulitzer or what have you. But I cannot recommend strongly enough that you get your hands on a copy of this book, right now, and read it. Stunning. **** ½t.

Charles Bukowski, What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire (Black Sparrow, 1999)<br /><br />With the exception of The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship, the posthumously published Bukowski material just doesn't live up to the stuff he published while he was still alive; cynical readers will likely say he made his reputation while alive, then left the leftovers to be published afterwards. Be that as it may, that's not to say the posthumous stuff isn't worth reading. Bukowski hit his stride as a poet in the mid-fifties, and snatches of greatness continued up through the late seventies/early eighties with regularity; much of the material here was written during the latter half of that time period, and, as expected, flashes of brilliance show through. Flashes, however, are not likely to sustain a reader coming to Bukowski for the first time over the course of four hundred nine pages of poetry; the neophyte would be well advised to turn to Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame or War All the Time for a first crack at the man who made it all look so easy. What Matters Most... is best left for after you're an established Buk fan and know how to separate the what from the chaff. This is about half and half, but remember, chaff is a whole lot lighter, and so you can pack more of it in, pound for pound. ** ½	2005-04-27

David Searcy, Ordinary Horror (Viking, 2001)<br /><br />What to say about Ordinary Horror? A number of reviews have already said most of it. The book is derivative (most notably of Ramsey Campbell), with a pace that is an insult to pedestrians, and seems to have been vastly mismarketed by Viking, though one can't well blame that on Searcy. To call Ordinary Horror a horror novel would be to call A. M. Homes' Music for Torching (with which this book has a good deal in common, though Music for Torching is better-paced and is, at least, about something) a horror novel; it just don't work.<br /><br />So then why did I end up giving it a (slightly) above average rating? Because of Searcy's use of language. The book is readable in the same way Joyce Carol Oates' books are readable; the language is so thick and tangled that at times it's impossible to sort out what's going on, but most of the time, you're too busy wallowing in the language to really care. That can be enough of a reason to read a book, and somewhat unfortunately, in this case it has to be.<br /><br />Frank Delabano is a man living alone in his seventies. He has problems with gophers in his rose garden, so he orders a plant called Gopherbane to get rid of them. Once he plants them and they bloom, things start to go a little odd in the neighborhood.<br /><br />There's a great premise here (in fact,t here's more than one great premise), but it seems as if the premises themselves end up being red herrings for Searcy's Homes-like satire on suburban life in America at the end of the twentieth century. There's real promise here, especially in the way Delabano's interactions change with his neighbors over the course of the book, but everything's left hanging at the end-- it's not a few loose ends, the end of the book is one massive loose end. Still, if you allow yourself to get carried away by the language, you may end up not caring too much. ***	2005-04-27

I was somewhat surprised (and, I admit, a little nonplussed; sometimes you just need to give SOMETHING a bad review, no matter what it is) to discover that The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Poetry is actually a pretty decent stab at sticking a writing course between two covers. There are some pieces of text where I wanted to cringe (the idea that line breaks are arbitrary, the idea that haiku is a 5-7-5 strict form), and a few that seem to contradict one another (mostly having to do with meaning and message), but overall not a bad little book.

It might be a bit beyond the target audience, but it's sure to please the parents reading the book with their children. As for the book itself, it's about, well, Skara Brae, the prehistoric fishing village on the coast of one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, from the time the original settlers came till the time of the second discovery of the ruins. Which seems like an awful lot to put into thirty-six pages, but then, fifteen hundred-odd years of Skara Brae's history can be summed up in the word \\"buried.\\"<br /><br />Good stuff for youngsters with an interest in digging things up (and what youngster doesn't have an interest in digging things up?). *** ½	2005-04-27

Which is not something one normally thinks to say about a book by John Hollander (one that contains a poem dedicated to that antithesis of fun, John Ashbery, no less). The late seventies saw Hollander turning a bit more towards the absurd and a lot more toward the erotic (culminating in Town and Country Matters in the early eighties). This can be seen as kind of a workshop building up to Town and Country Matters, but it's a great workshop:<br /><br />\\"We rode gently over evening fields<br /><br />Together: we were our own one steed.<br /><br />Faster and faster we went<br /><br />Until no trees swept by: they became<br /><br />Part of the color of ground and sky.<br /><br />And when the great hedge loomed up<br /><br />Then we took it in a long, slow leap.<br /><br />Now in our dark, soundless boat<br /><br />We lie on the wide water.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Land and Water\\")<br /><br />Very good stuff.

Ira Sadoff, Grazing (University of Illinois Press, 1998)<br /><br />I find it very hard to write reviews of Ira Sadoff's books; there's nothing I can say about Sadoff's work that will be objective in the least. I am a slavish fan to the pen of Ira Sadoff, and find each of his books to be pure delight. So when I say that Grazing may well be Sadoff's best book (arguably, the brilliant Emotional Traffic stacks up), it's saying something.<br /><br />Grazing is, above all, an angry book, and the poems where it's not angry seem almost as if they're lulls during the storm. And despite the fact that Sadoff is one of those \\"academic\\" poets who are so often sneered at in the small press for being dry, dusty, and antiquated, it's impossible to read Grazing and not feel anger radiating off the pages. After all this anger, the book's final piece, \\"The Inner Life,\\" resounds with a desolation it might not otherwise have. It's impossible to instill a sense of the way this poem works with the rest of the book by excerpting it here, but it still deserves quotation:<br /><br />...\\"Going off like a buzzer<br /><br />in a factory, where we charge out of the doors denouncing<br /><br />the one who sticks his head in a stack of papers<br /><br />then comes out shrugging, giving us the thumb.\\"...<br /><br />This is powerful stuff, folks, and well worth the time it takes to hunt down.

Adrienne Rich, The School Among the Ruins (Norton, 2004)<br /><br />One of the blurbs on the jacket of Adrienne Rich's latest book proclaims Rich one of the poets whose every new book is cause for excitement. I can think of at least an hundred others for whom that should be true, and Rich is not one of them, especially if The School Among the Ruins is anything to go by.<br /><br />It's obvious from some of the pieces here that Rich does know, or at least remember, that image should be the heart of all poetry; in the rest, however, she seems to have completely forgotten that fact, descending to the realm of political prose broken up into little lines to make it artistic. Little lines do not make poetry. Image makes poetry, and there is precious little of it to be found here. You'd be better off turning to one of the books by one of those poets whose every new work should be cause for excitement (Charles Simic, Ira Sadoff, Ted Kooser, Rochelle Theo Pienn, Debra Allbery, Heather McHugh, Elizabeth Willis, Peter Gizzi, and Dzvinia Orlowsky all come to mind very quickly), leaving this for once you've exhausted the rest of your local library's new releases shelf for poetry. **	2005-04-27

Crystal Williams, Kin (Michigan State University, 2000)<br /><br />I knew I was in for a bumpy ride when the second line of the first poem of this book contained the word (or phrase, I never can tell with such typographical tricks) \\"dust  y\\". Oh, boy. Someone else who thinks that putting spaces in the middle of words, and words in odd places on a line, makes something poetry.<br /><br />I was wrong, for the most part, for which I am quite thankful.<br /><br />Crystal Williams' Kin (rather like Trish Reeves' In the Knees of the Gods, reviewed above) seems to have a split personality. Part of that personality writes very good poems. They're not great, they could still use a spot of work here and there before they get to the point where they melt the hair off your head and cause you to fall to the ground in epileptic seizure, possessed by the spirit of Polyhymnia, but they're pretty well on their way. The other part of that personality commits the only sin worse than writing message poems full of vague judgment words: it writes message poems full of vague judgment words written in dialect. Just as Hollywood blockbusters contain emotional shortcuts to tell you how the characters feel rather than take the time to show you (the main reason so many Hollywood movies suck), poems like this figure that all you need to know about the situation can be contained in the dialect in which the poem is written. Why use images to show your angry black woman is angry when you can simply write in dialect? Because the end result will suck, pure and simple. And such is the case here.<br /><br />It almost seems to me as if the book is comprised of two types of poems, poems that were written for publication in magazines/journals/whatever and slam poems. And this collection is just another volume adding more ammunition to my argument that no one will ever write a piece fitting the latter description that will ever be a tenth as good as any poem that fits the former description. The evidence is here, stark, in black and white, impossible to ignore.<br /><br />There is some good work here. In fact, the majority of the book is good work. But the bad parts are awful, and you'll have to wade through more than a few of them to get the good stuff. ** ½evidence is here, stark, in black and white, impossible to ignore. <br /> <br />There is some good work here.

Melissa P., 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed (Black Cat, 2003)<br /><br />Ah, the worldwide fascination with kiddie porn. You disagree? What would you call it when a book detailing the sexual exploits of a sixteen-year-old girl sells millions of copies? Okay, it may not really BE kiddie porn, because only the most neanderthal among us still believe that a sixteen-year-old of either gender isn't an adult. But it's hard to deny that part of the attraction of this book has to do with the fact that, if you tried to create a film version of it in America without changing the ages of the participants, you'd probably get arrested. But you put it in book form, and it becomes a bestseller. I love this country.<br /><br />The main thing to know about 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed is that it's not erotica. You may think it's erotica, and the people blurbing it on the back may think it's erotica, but the simple truth of the matter is that there's more of the erotic to be found in the movie The Terminator than there is here. But then again, it's not really pornography, not in the sense of, say, the works of Marcus van Heller, whoever that particularly boring rake was, or the anonymous Victorian who published the infamous magazine The Pearl. Certainly not in the way Peter Sotos is pornography. Yes, there are some sex scenes, and it's slightly possible that the idea of multiple partners, or same-sex partners, might still shock one or two people who have been living in a cave their entire lives. Besides, it doesn't have the classic (and clich&eacute;) pornographic structure; the heroine wouldn't sleep with five guys as the first major sex scene in the book in a pornographic novel, that would be the last. Unless the author was a fetishist of some sort, in which s/he'd save that for last. It's a \\"fictionalized memoir,\\" whatever that may mean. Kind of like Bukowski's Factotum or Ham on Rye, I guess, but without the wit, the panache, the style.<br /><br />The one thing 100 Strokes... has going for it is that it's readable. The hundred seventy pages of this book will pass before your eyes very quickly. And, well, reading about a (as the cover blazons) \\"sexually ravenous girl\\" is not really difficult.<br /><br />But if you're looking for pornography, you'll look a whole lot more erudite reading Georges Bataille, and you'll probably get more of a kick out of it. ** ½kes... has going for it is that it's readable.

Guillaume Apollinaire, Alcools (translated by Donald Revell)  (Wesleyan, 1995)<br /><br />What is there to review about Alcools itself? It's Guillaume Apollinaire. It was published ninety years ago. It's one of the documents Tristan Tzara was reading obsessively while forming the dada movement, and thus was also a heavy influence on surrealism, and between the two was an influence on most modern writing. It contains some of Apollinaire's best-known poems. If you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for? It's a literary classic, and one that should be in every home.<br /><br />What I'm reviewing here is Donald Revell's new translation of Alcools. I hadn't got the book out thinking that; I was planning to use this as a platform to mouth the same old words about the greatness of Apollinaire and how you should have all read him already, in high school if not before, and how horrible it is that our educational system doesn't teach the man. But then I read Revell's (thankfully brief; I hate fifty-page introductions to books of poetry in translation) intro to this, and I realized that at least writing, if not reading, this review would be more interesting than usual. For Revell talks about the poetic license he took with the original text in order to preserve the spirit of Guillaume Apollinaire, rather than be slavish to the original words.<br /><br />For the most part, it works pretty well. Revell, after all, is a fantastic poet in his own right, and you can trust his judgment as to what sounds good and what doesn't. Those who know French (or even a smattering of French, or those capable of easily recognizing cognates) will be able to check the original text, on the facing page, and see differences pretty readily. One wonders whether the perceived strengths and weaknesses in this translation (as one must wonder with all translations) have more to do with the original translations of these poems a reader has read than with the original (because it's very rare to find a poem that translates literally and still sounds poetic in the new language). I cut my teeth on Apollinaire with the translations in The Poetry of Surrealism (mostly by Michael Hamburger, with a few contributions by other translators), and I've always thought of those as the definitive translations of the Apollinaire poems included in both volumes. \\"Zone,\\" for example, sounds completely different in the two books; it keeps the same spirit, of course, but other things (the pace, specifically) come off completely differently.<br /><br />In the end, it most likely comes down to the reader. For the newcomer to Apollinaire, you may get more enjoyment out of this book than the seasoned reader. Yet the seasoned reader will find a good deal of enjoyment here as well, and possibly much food for thought on the nature of translation, as well. *** ½o find a poem that translates literally and still sounds poetic in the new language).

David B., Epileptic (Pantheon, 2005)<br /><br />Let's stop for a moment and reflect on the fact that the first two books in this review edition were both published in 2005, and I'm reviewing them in 2005. I don't think that's ever happened before.<br /><br />That aside, here's Epileptic, a graphic novel from the somewhat prolific pen of L'Association co-founder David B. Originally released in six parts in France, stretching between 1996 and 2003, it's now been released in an English translation by Pantheon, so those of us on this side of the pond, not to mention the Brits and other English-speaking folk over there who don't know a lick of French (do any still exist?), can see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />What the fuss is about is, for the most part, the drawings themselves. That's what all the rave reviews harp on. David B. is an exceptionally talented artist, one who can integrate, interpret, and regurgitate just about any artistic school, or specific artist's style, to which he sets his mind, as well as having his own style, which is pretty uniformly dark and brooding. (Think of an illegitimate cross between Frank Miller and Rich Little. On second thought, don't, because I don't want to be responsible for you being struck simultaneously blind and insane.) There's also the storyline, but, I mean, it's a memoir, whether my library has it in the fiction section or not; there's a knack to writing about your family so that someone wants to read it, but when it comes right down to it, when writing a memoir, you don't have to go that far for material.<br /><br />What most impressed me about Epileptic is that it's the first graphic novel I've read since Watchmen that really has a strong sense of time. It's not so much that it's linear; David B. jumps back and forth in time on a fairly regular basis. It's that you know what he's doing without needing any special tricks to proclaim it (though he does tell you every time he starts relating a dream). Even in David B.'s phantasmagoric world, the symbols are so deeply ingrained, and so well-rendered, that the reader can tell where reality ends and flashback (or forward) begins with no problem. There's none of the sense of impressionism that seems to have taken American graphic artists by storm. And thank heaven for that. Epileptic, as a result, is an incredibly readable piece of graphic art, and one that comes highly recommended from this camp. *** ½David B.'s phantasmagoric world, the symbols are so deeply ingrained, and so well-rendered, that the reader can tell where reality ends and flashback (or forward) begins with no problem.

Linda Ferri, Enchantments (Knopf, 2005)<br /><br />Enchantments is a very small, quite lovely little novel that doesn't really seem to be about much of anything until you get to the very end. Thus, it's impossible to tell you what the book is about without ruining it in some way. Just trust me, it really is about something. Kind of.<br /><br />Enchantments is an impressionist treat, twenty-five small still-lifes that together give us the coming of age of a privileged Italian girl. The girl herself is not all that likeable, when it comes right down to it; she's self-absorbed, mean, and uncommunicative in the extreme. But we're not here to admire the would-be heroine, we're here to admire the scenery. And what scenery it is.<br /><br />Ferri paints her scenes here with all the subtlety of the truly observant (which is what really gives this away as fiction, not memoir; the narrator couldn't possibly be observant enough to pick up all the lush detail to be found here) and all the mastery of the fictional painter who did a portrait for some guy named Dorian Gray. Everything is ripe, except for those parts that look as if they've already gone over the edge and slipped into decay. There are never enough decayed bits to overwhelm the painting; the flies haven't started buzzing yet, but you can always feel them quivering under the skin of whatever fruit you imagine when you think of the term \\"still life.\\" It's the interplay between beauty and decay that truly charms the reader here, and charming it is. It's small, readable, and, well, enchanting. *** ½	2005-04-15

Magraret Laurence, The Olden Days Coat (Tundra, 1979)<br /><br />Why do I continue to read kids' books at the age of thirty-six? In my more cynical moments, I think it's to increase the count on the number of books I read per year, But every once in a while, I stumble across something like Randall Jarrell's The Bat-Poet or Margaret Laurence's The Olden Days Coat, and these books remind me that things that are written for, published for, and marketed to the under-twelve set are sometimes able to combine the literary weight of the work of a great writer with that certain magic that is the exclusive province of the children's book.<br /><br />The late Margaret Laurence is, of course, one of Canada's foremost authors, and left us on Earth with a body of her work that is, quite simply, stunning. From the perspective of overall quality and beauty, the complete corpus of Laurence's work is matched by that of few authors who write/wrote in the English language, living or dead.  The Olden Days Coat, weighing in at a slim twenty-six pages (with roughly half of those full-page illustrations), is not just a short story; it is a distillation of Margaret Laurence's craft.<br /><br />The story is a simple one, and oft-heard. Sal goes off to spend Christmas at her grandmother's house. While digging around in a chest of old things, she finds an old coat. When she puts it on, she's transported back in time, and meets a girl her own age. I'm pretty sure you can see where this is going already; why finish? As with any plot that's well-used, there are all sorts of possibilities for the writing to slip into clich&eacute;. It never happens. Laurence is razor-sharp here, her prose sparkling as fiercely as it does from every page of The Diviners, her finest moment.<br /><br />A fantastic piece of work, once that I'll be buying for my own children. Its only true failing is that I didn't want it to end. **** ½	2005-04-15

Jim Fairhall, At the Water Puppet Theater (Word Press, 2002)<br /><br />It's really getting to the point now where Vietnam War poetry has gotten to be something of a clich&eacute;. Still, there are thousands upon thousands of people, some of them poets, who still have a lot of things to work out with themselves. Poetry as therapy is all well and good, but eventually one has to ask himself whether it's possible to write yet another book of poetry about the Vietnam War that doesn't sound trite.<br /><br />Thankfully, the answer is yes, and Jim Fairhall did it with At the Water Puppet Theater. He did it partly by writing not just about the war itself, but about his trip back to Vietnam, that (we get the impression) was part of that thing-dealing for Fairhall (and a part that seems to have worked, at least to an extent). The other part of how he did it was the surprising number of formal poems in this book. One doesn't expect rhyme about the Vietnam War (at least, not from anyone but the Charlie Daniels Band). Fairhall, a literature professor, is acquainted enough with the ins and outs of what makes good formal poetry that the work here doesn't sound like what one fears just about any modern formal poem not coming from Marilyn Hacker will sound like (heavy on the end-stops, with words that make other poets cringe in terror, like \\"soul\\"). Fairhall's diction has an easy grace to it, and he seems to have almost mastered the art of making formal poetry sound as easy as just sitting around shooting the breeze. There are a few times when this knowledge fails him (\\"Country Journey,\\" especially, has a wince-worthy quality to it), but those times are few and far between. Jim Fairhall's turned in a good, solid piece of work, and one worth reading. *** ½	2005-04-15

Brite, Prime (Three Rivers Press, 2005)<br /><br />There's something thoroughly satisfying about reviewing Prime during lunch on a day when I'm sitting down to, well, not a gourmet meal, but about the best I can do given my current equipment and financial status. Hey, its got grilled fennel bulb as a side dish. I love fennel. It's subtle, sweet, tasty, and when you eat it for dinner, you wake up the next morning still having a slight taste of sambuca on your breath. In other words, it's rather like Poppy Z. Brite's new novel.<br /><br />Well, okay. \\"Subtle\\" may be pushing it a bit far. But this is Brite, a woman whose idea of \\"subtle\\" has, at times in the past, run to kicking the reader in the face with a boot that doesn't have a steel toe. I have acquaintances who are still traumatized after reading certain passages in Exquisite Corpse ten years ago. I get the feeling I'm going to have a difficult time getting them to read Prime, but I'm still going to try.<br /><br />Prime, Brite's third novel following the exploits of Rickey and G-Man (after The Value of X and Liquor), opens with Liquor doing good business, but its financial backer, Lenny Duvetaux, being investigated by New Orleans' notoriously crooked DA. Rickey wants to by Duvetaux out in order to keep the restaurant's name as clean as possible. This might well be helped by the offer of ten grand Rickey's just gotten for doing some consulting work at a restaurant in Dallas. There is, however, a fly in the ointment; the head chef at the place has something of a spotty past with Rickey. Complications, etc.<br /><br />First, kudos to Brite for not jumping on the current \\"include recipes in your fiction\\" bandwagon. That said, this may be the first book I've read where I really want the recipes. Does that foie gras cr&egrave;me brulee really exist? How do I make it? (And this coming from someone who doesn't even like foie gras.) It sounds divine. And you're certainly not going to get a veal cheek recipe from the latest Tamar Myers mystery, buddy.<br /><br />As you may have surmised, Prime is a novel for (though I hesitate to use the term) foodies. I can pretty much guarantee that the more orgasmic you get over the thought finding a black market supplier for wheels of real, unpasteurized Danish havarti or traditional haggis, the more you are going to revel in the joy that is this novel. (If your idea of a gourmet meal is White Castle, you are likely to find yourself hopelessly lost.) Yeah, okay, there's a good deal of dramatic tension in all the right places. And there's even a mystery to be solved, though it really doesn't get geared up until well into the second half of the novel. That the reader is unlikely to care is a testament both to the power of good writing about food and the considerable aplomb with which Brite can wield a pen. There's action when necessary. But all the way through this book, I kept thinking to myself that it could all have been absent, and I'd still have loved it. Just a book on the day-to-day lives of chefs working at a restaurant, coming from this particular pen, would have been just fine with me. Part of that is, well, I love a good veal cheek as much as the next guy. Part of it is that Brite is good enough at pacing that she can make a description of what someone at an expediting station does just as readable (and even more memorable) than a description of the aftermath of a suicide. The rest of it stems from the fact that the characters are well-drawn enough that you don't have to have followed them throughout the series to get to know and care about them (as evidenced by the still-strong sales of Liquor, despite the relative obscurity of The Value of X). You toss it all in a tortilla, roll it up, and you have one hell of a novel.

Moreover, they (for the most part) get their messages out of the way and let the images do the talking, like all good poems do.<br /><br />Thus the reason for my confusion. It's a technically fine book of poems, but nothing about it really fired me up, the way a book by someone like Charles Simic or Elizabeth Willis does. The only thing I can really think of to say about it is \\"it's good.\\" But not great. Thus, it would seem, my problem; it doesn't merit effusive praise, nor does it merit disparagement.

The most recent BkMk book to find its way to my desk is Trish Reeves' In the Knees of the Gods. And \\"small pleasure\\" defines it almost perfectly.<br /><br />In the Knees of the Gods seems to have multiple personality disorder. Blurbing on the back, David Ray says \\"...this poet seems to alternate between letting it all out and not spelling it out.\\" Indeed. One wonders, amused, why such a levelheaded critique would be considered a blurb. I'd fire my publisher, or force them to fire the person who let it through. But then, I'm not on BkMk. David Ray, however, is entirely correct, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the book's strongest points are when Reeves doesn't spell anything out, letting the simplicity of the pieces be their own power, while the book's weakest passages (which are, thankfully, concentrated in one section) are when she spends far too much time spelling out, overwhelming the power of the words themselves with artificially imposed meaning and message. Poetry is like beef; the closer you get to organic, the better it's going to be. Reeves spends most of her time allowing the words to speak for themselves, and writing very good poetry because of it. When she does the poetry-as-therapy thing, though, the book falls apart. That, however, is only temporary. It gets back on track and stays there.<br /><br />Recommended.

Does the book deserve the prize?<br /><br />You haven't read every book of poetry released in 2004. I certainly haven't. So neither of us is likely qualified to answer that question. I can say, however, that Ted Kooser's book is a lot better than some that have previously been awarded the Pulitzer.<br /><br />Kooser writes about simple things, accessible things, and this alone should be putting him in the spotlight; reading a couple of Ted Kooser poems in high school now and then might be one of the cure for the American educational system's present ability to turn almost every student that goes through its meatgrinder off poetry for the rest of their lives. When the main complaint of students is that the stuff they're forced to read is well nigh unintelligible (and given some of the stuff in the canon, they've probably got a point), it might do a world of good to hand students something like this:<br /><br />\\"A farmhouse window back far from the highway<br /><br />speaks to the darkness in a small, sure voice.<br /><br />Against this stillness, only a kettle's whisper,<br /><br />and against the starry cold, one small blue ring of flame.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"A Winter Morning\\")<br /><br />That's about as symbolic as the poems in this collection get. It's stuff that the average high school student can easily figure out (well, as long as they've encountered a gas stove in their lives).<br /><br />The only real downside to the collection is that Kooser ends his poems at times with lines that ache to have \\"the moral of the story is...\\" right before them.<br /><br />\\"...Years later,<br /><br />wherever we've gone, whatever we've come to,<br /><br />our ignorance spoils the creamed corn.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Creamed Corn\\")<br /><br />The word \\"ignorance\\" is one I hope to never see in a poem again.<br /><br />Still, most of the time, Kooser gets it right, and most of the poems in this collection are gems. This is a fine piece of work, and one that deserves the (relatively) widespread recognition receiving the Pulitzer will bring it. Check it out. ****to, <br />our ignorance spoils the creamed corn.\\" <br />(--\\"Creamed Corn\\") <br /> <br />The word \\"ignorance\\" is one I hope to never see in a poem again. <br /> <br />Still, most of the time, Kooser gets it right, and most of the poems in this collection are gems.

(...)Jack Ketchum, The Girl Next Door (Overlook Connection Press, 1989)<br /><br />Stephen King, in On Writing, said some good words about Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door. Immediately, the book became impossible to find in its original printing, with collectors snapping up every extant copy, and new ones coming on the market fetching prices that make no sense for a mass market paperback. Overlook Connection put out a new edition of the book, but really, twenty-six bucks for a two hundred eighty-three page trade paperback? And this they call their \\"affordable\\" line?<br /><br />That said, if any eighties horror novel of comparable thickness is worth the insane prices it fetches either on the collectors' market or in its new edition, The Girl Next Door is it. I've read a whole lot of eighties horror novels over the years, and I can safely say that not a single one of them affected me as did The Girl Next Door.<br /><br />Not that, fifteen years after its original publication, there's much that's out-and-out shocking about The Girl Next Door's content. In the age of such stars ascendant as Robert Devereaux, Charlee Jacob, and Monica O'Rourke, tales of the extremes of human degradation are starting to look positively old-school. However, even the brilliant work of all three of those authors, who are some of the best in the business today, lacks some sort of component present in The Girl Next Door. I honestly don't know what that component is. Perhaps it's the complete lack of motive for the events in The Girl Next Door; while Jacob's characters suffer far more extreme fates on a regular basis, the shadows of war, drugs, and other spectres are always in the background, on which the reader can conveniently pin some blame for the forces therein. Ketchum gives us a reason for one character to behave as that character does in the novel-- a descent into dementia that accelerates as time goes on. (And, really, it's something of a lame reason, which is entirely the point.) But what causes all the rest of them to go nuts? No one knows. And that, folks, is the essence of horror.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. For those of you who have not yet found the time and money to track down a copy of this gem, a quick synopsis. Davy is your typical 1950s kid-- the world is bucolic, in that odd, nostalgia-tinged way that you know from talking to anyone you know who was alive during the decade, but Davy is an observant enough kid to know that not everything is copacetic (the shadow of the cold war hanging over the country, for example). Davy's life takes a turn when, just as he's hitting puberty, Meg and her sister Susan move in next door. Meg is your basic twelve-year-old's-ideal-girlfriend-- older, beautiful, and naïve about the ways of the area into which she's moved after the death of her parents in a car accident. Moreover, she's literally the girl next door-- the girls are staying with their aunt Ruth, Davy's next-door neighbor and mother to Davy's best friend Donny.<br /><br />The problem is that Ruth is going insane. Slowly. (We get an idea that Davy's parents are, or were, aware of this previously; there's a mention of something that occurred between Ruth and Davy's parents some years before the narrative. We are never told what it is.) Her kids are already somewhat cracked, especially young Ralphie, called Woofer by his friends. Eventually, this particular madness affects, to some extent, every child in town, even Davy. All except Meg and her sister Susan. And they, of course, are the objects upon which the madness unleashes itself.<br /><br />Coupled with the reasonlessness of the events that unfold in the book is a profound sense of connection with the characters. It struck me while reading that Ketchum's decision to use Davy as the narrator, rather than Donny, or even Meg or Ruth, was primarily responsible for this in some way I couldn't quite discern. Perhaps it's Davy's puppy love combined with his odd, detached sense of horror at everything that unfolds, or maybe it's just that Davy isn't quite so affected by everything around him, and therefore keeps a less emotional eye to the proceedings than one might expect from a different point of view. Or perhaps it's the contradiction inherent in those last two sentences, which does not come off as in any way implausible in the book. Whatever the reason, the reader is drawn to a profound sympathy with Meg and Susan, and to a lesser extent Davy, that makes the book resonate that much more.<br /><br />At its core, though, the effectiveness of The Girl Next Door is enhanced by orders of magnitude when the reader is informed (not in the book; one must do a little digging to find this out) that, like the eighties' other classic of violence, Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, The Girl Next Door is, in fact, based on a real occurrence. While Ketchum went back a bit in time (no doubt to draw the contrast of the fifties and the murder), there can be no doubt that The Girl Next Door is closely based on the case of Sylvia Marie Likens. And that, of course, makes it far more horrible than it already was.<br /><br />The Girl Next Door really is the amazing piece of work Stephen King claims it is. Ketchum gets under the reader's skin in ways that few horror novels have ever been able to achieve, and the result is a stunning success. I suggest trying to hunt down a copy of the original paperback printing (on Warner Books) rather than trying to get ahold of the \\"affordable line\\" Overlook Connection trade paperback-- but however you get hold of it, do so. This is a book worthwhile at any price. *****just that Davy isn't quite so affected by everything around him, and therefore keeps a less emotional eye to the proceedings than one might expect from a different point of view.

Jim Bolus, The Insider's Pocket Guide to Horse Racing (Taylor Press, 1990)<br /><br />The main problem with The Insider's Pocket Guide to Horse Racing is the copy on the back. As with most Thoroughbred-themed books aimed at the adult populace (save biographies of great horses), the copy on the back cover promises you that The Insider's Pocket Guide to Horse Racing will tell you how to pick winners. And, to the copywriters' credit, Bolus does spend some time introducing the reader to the fundamentals of handicapping. That is not, however, the book's sole, or for that matter, main goal. The Insider's etc. makes a good overall introduction to the game; Bolus spends more time introducing the reader to then-current lists of the top trainers and jockeys, and giving brief bios of them (as well as interview excerpts), letting the reader know about the country's most beautiful tracks, and other such things, than he does teaching the reader how to handicap a horse race. All of which, of course, is entirely well and good, and certainly has its place. If you're expecting a handicapping manual, all you're likely to see is about an hundred pages of filler.<br /><br />Filler, however, it is not. It's a solid intro to the world of horse racing. Buy copies for your friends who don't know that, at the track, a fog isn't something green and croaking, and grabbing a quarter doesn't mean you're broke and need to call home. ***	2005-04-12

Nick Mamatas, Move under Ground (Night Shade Books, 2004)<br /><br />Nick Mamatas does more than fulfill the promise of his first novella, Northern Gothic, in his debut novel. In fact, he's more than fulfilled the promise of any five young new writers. No matter how you end up feeling about the book itself, you just have to admire the guy's hubris at attempting to take two subgenres of fiction that passed the clich&eacute; stage decades ago and add in the exceptionally risky practice of incorporating historical characters into fiction. That the result is at all readable would have been a triumph. That it's actually good is nothing short of miraculous.<br /><br />Jack Kerouac is recovering from a nervous breakdown in Big Sur when he gets a strong urge to go find Neal Cassady, who (if you'll remember from the end of On the Road) ditched him in Mexico. Knowing Cassady will likely be in San Francisco, Kerouac sets out, and soon stumbles upon a sight neither he, nor anyone reading the opening pages of this book who's somehow managed to miss all the synopses, expected to see: R'lyeh, no longer sleeping, rising from the waves. Yes, folks, the Great Old Ones are back, and Jack Kerouac and his longtime travelling companion have to save the world. However, along the way Kerouac realizes that not only is Neal acting strangely-- does he want to save the world, or is he just looking for the ending of his next novel?-- but that the Earth is only a minuscule part of the bigger stakes of a war between Cthulhu and Azathoth...<br /><br />I mean, come on. You can't read that synopsis and not tell me it's not a recipe for absolute disaster. But Mamatas does things of beauty with both Beat and Lovecraftian literature, spicing the tale with subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to works in both, but keeping it on such a level that the reader doesn't need to have read extensively in either genre to get something out of this book. You probably don't even have to know who Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady are; they're just two guys driving across the country trying to save the universe from descending into utter chaos.<br /><br />Come to think of it, that sounds rather like the plot for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but believe it-- Nick Mamatas can write rings around Kevin Smith. ****al Cassady are; they're just two guys driving across the country trying to save the universe from descending into utter chaos. <br /> <br />Come to think of it, that sounds rather like the plot for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but believe it-- Nick Mamatas can write rings around Kevin Smith. ****	2005-04-12

Kathe Koja, Talk (Frances Foster Books, 2005)<br /><br />There are few writers on the planet today whose every new novel brings such pleasure as Kathe Koja. Talk, Koja's fourth novel for young adults and ninth overall, continues the trend.<br /><br />Kit Webster is in high school, in the closet, and generally not the kind of guy you noticed when growing up. His best friend Carma convinces him to try out for the male lead in the school play, Talk, and he gets the part. He is quite surprised to find he has a real flair for acting, as is his female lead, Lindsay Walsh, the queen of the drama department. Instead of things going smoothly, of course, complications must arise, from Lindsay dumping her boyfriend to concerned parents protesting that the subject matter of the play is too controversial for young minds to handle.<br /><br />While it's not of the same brilliance as her four mid-period novels (Skin, Strange Angels, Kink, and straydog), Talk delivers on many levels, as do almost all of Koja's novels (Bad Brains being the sole exception). Short, punchy, readable, and powerful. Some of the characters, especially the minor characters, fall into stereotype, but it's hard to avoid that when so many real gay-bashers try their best to emulate the stereotype. There's really no way around it. Kit and Lindsay are quite well-drawn, and they carry the story (told alternately in chapters narrated by each) wonderfully.<br /><br />Another winner from the Koja stable. **** ½	2005-04-12

Witte, Redneck Haiku (Santa Monica Press, 2003)<br /><br />What would Jim Goad do?<br /><br />That was what I kept thinking as I turned the pages in this small tome. Would the author of the celebrated, reviled Redneck Manifesto be deeply offended, or would he be laughing his ass off?<br /><br />Probably both.<br /><br />The worst factor in the writing of American haiku these days, and it affects almost every otherwise-non-poet (and far too many actual poets) who attempts to write haiku, is the slavish devotion to 5-7-5. Pick up a few books on how to write haiku, people. Or a few books of haiku by recognized American masters, or recognized Japanese masters translated by someone worth their skin. 5-7-5 is an upper limit, not an upper AND lower limit. The shorter your haiku, the better. Slavish devotion to 5-7-5 leads to filler. Yes, even in haiku. There's more than one piece here that could have used a few words carved off here and there. (That said, there are some surprisingly excellent pieces as well.)<br /><br />Now, ask yourself the question: will you feel guilty laughing at stereotypes? Sure, it's a redneck writing about rednecks (Witte, according to a recent interview, grew up on a farm outside Tulsa, and swears that some of the events she depicts in this book really happened to family members of hers), but do you feel guilty for laughing about it? Maybe you should. That said, this stuff ranges from the grimly amusing to the down-and-out hysterical. If Jim Goad wants to kick my ass for thinking so, that's his right, and I'd probably let him do it, too. ***	2005-04-08

Kenneth Thomas Zadrovec, It Started with a Prayer (Dorrance Publishing, 2001)<br /><br />Let me start by saying I'm not going to be coming down on Kenneth Thomas Zadrovec because he's a Christian writer. The annals of history are filled with great Christian writers. We even had a few of our own in the last century; Karl Barth, Francois Mauriac, and Madeleine L'Engle, among others, held their own with the best the rest of the world had to offer.<br /><br />And truthfully, when Zadrovic sticks to his homily, It Started with a Prayer is not all that bad a book. Well, okay, with one exception, the painful \\"Aliens at St. Augustine.\\" There are passages in there which make one wonder if these really were homily, because I can't imagine anyone reading them out loud and not being embarrassed (and there are a select few passages that defy logic as to how one would read them aloud at all).<br /><br />The poetry, however, is atrocious, even for the non-poetry that so regularly passes my eyes these days. This is work that shows no signs at all that the author has read bad poetry, let alone good poetry; if he has, he has refused to learn even the least thing from doing so. Image is the farthest thing from his mind; all he wants to do is impart a message. That's not the function of poetry, that's the function of homily, and hopefully Zadrovec will realize this before he attempts any other publications that contain non-poetry.<br /><br />Readable in places, but thoroughly awful in others. Probably one to avoid. * ½	2005-04-08

Robin Hobb, Ship of Destiny (Bantam, 2000)<br /><br />A little less than halfway through Ship of Destiny, the final novel in Hobb's Liveship Traders trilogy, you will suddenly realize how it's all coming together. That's the moment it turns from a good book into one of the best books you've read this year.<br /><br />A plot synopsis would both be rife with spoilers for the first two books and, if you've read the first two books, completely unnecessary. (If you haven't read the first two books and would like a plot synopsis, you can see my reviews of Ship of Magic and Mad Ship here and here, respectively.) We do get the revelation at one point that yes, this is definitely set in the same world as the Farseer and Tawny Man books, somewhere quite a bit farther south on the east coast, from what I can gather (characters come from the Six Duchies, \\"a near-barbarian land,\\" and brief reference is made to the events of the Farseer series), but if the Farseer and Tawny Man books are fresher in your head, you probably caught onto that long before I did. That added a nice touch.<br /><br />But the thing to truly marvel over is the intricacy of the plotting, and how it all unfolded over the proper pace in the almost 2,500 pages of the Liveship Traders books. Halfway through this one, everything you know is suddenly wrong, but not in such a way that it will cause you to complain that she's changing the rules on you; she's just laid events out as if this were a huge, complex mystery instead of a romantic adventure fantasy, or whatever subgenre you'd like to try and lump this into. And it's laid out, in that regard, a lot better than many mysteries I've read over the past few years.<br /><br />An amazing achievement, and well worth the large time investment required by the trilogy. **** ½	2005-04-08

Miltos Satouris, With Face to the Wall: Selected Poems (Charioteer Press, 1968)<br /><br />Miltos Satouris died not long ago, celebrated in many parts of the globe as one of the twentieth century's foremost poets. America, of course, is not one of those countries. Finding copies of Satouris' books in America is like pulling teeth. I managed to dig up this very small collection, forty pages collected from his first six books, in the library. It's almost forty years old, and has been out of print almost that long, as well (it was originally a limited edition). Even the press that published the book seems to be long-mouldering in the dust (the last Chrioteer Press mention I could find on the web was a 1980 copyright for a book by Melih Anday).<br /><br />Why this is I've no idea. The surrealists, at least, and those many who have branched off from their roots, should be aggressively shoving the name and work of Miltos Satouris in the faces of every poetry devotee in the country, and conspiring to find ways to slip his name into the consciousness of the other 99% of the country as well. Satouris really does live up to the hype the rest of the world puts on his shoulders. He truly understands the truth of Marianne Moore's oft-quoted but seldom followed postulate that \\"poetry is all nouns and verbs,\\" and just as importantly, translator Kimon Friar did an excellent job in conveying that in English, as well.<br /><br />BEAUTY<br /><br />He sprinkled ugliness with beauty<br /><br />he took a guitar<br /><br />and walked along a riverbank<br /><br />singing<br /><br />He lost his voice<br /><br />the delirious lady stole it<br /><br />who cut off her head in the crimson waters<br /><br />and the poor man no longer has a voice to sing with<br /><br />and the river rolls<br /><br />the tranquil head with its eyelashes closed<br /><br />Singing<br /><br />This is really, really good stuff, and it should never have been allowed to go out of print.

Well, okay, it wasn't a recommendation so much as it was a mention in passing during a blog entry about the sudden, inexplicable rise in frequency of Scots-themed romances being published. So, being the Scot I am, I had to go see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Basic romance, expect set in the Scots highlands. Now, it occurred to me while reading this novel that most romances would be a quarter of their length if their protagonists new how to talk to one another, and didn't keep saying things like \\"I will not speak of it!\\" Do people really do this stuff? (And as an ancillary question, do the same people who buy romances also tend to buy self-help books about how to make your partner communicate with you? Folks, you may need new partners.) Not that I'm complaining about four hundred twenty-one pages of easy reading, mind you.<br /><br />Plot: boy meets girl. boy marries girl. boy has taken a vow of celibacy, but desires girl anyway. boy refuses to talk to girl about why he has taken a vow of celibacy. girl spends three hundred pages frustrated before starting to find the chinks in his armor. hundred-page climax with lots of action. girl gets boy.<br /><br />In other words, nothing out of the ordinary. Welfonder's written a romnce novel, and these days, the difference between chick-lit and romance novel is that romance novels still follow the traditional formula. (I'd better watch out, I'm ranging dangerously close to calling Mary Janice Davidson chick lit.) It's safe, it's easy, it's escapism. The book version of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Welfonder keeps the pages turning, does a relatively good job of coming up with three-dimensional main characters, adds bloodshed when necessary, etc. It's readable, it's fun. It's genre writing, but decent genre writing. If you're stuck in a reading slump, this may be just the thing to get you out of it. ** 1/2g, but decent genre writing.

When you see his name on the spine and you pick the book up, you know you're going to get a cleverly-constructed mystery/thriller where nothing is quite what it seems, and while he uses all the conventions one expects of the mystery/thriller, he at least puts them in a framework that keeps you guessing about what's going on. I got my copy of Company Man in the mail on Friday, and true to form, I'd finished it by Sunday. Like Paranoia, Company Man is a book that demands you set aside anything else you're reading and devote your full time to it. It's a little long for most folks to put away in one sitting, but Finder should start putting money-back guarantees on his books; you're certainly going to try.<br /><br />Here we have Nicholas Conover, CEO of office furniture manufacturer Stratton Corporation. Conover used to be the golden boy, son of an assembly line worker made good, beloved of the whole town. Until, that is, the company was bought by an outside firm, and Conover was forced to cut half the work force. Since then, someone's been breaking into his house, leaving graffiti, and causing his family some consternation. Well, most of his family, that is. Conover's wife is also recently departed, having fallen victim to a car accident. All the ingredients are in the soup, all you have to do is stir them. When the unknown home invader ups the ante, everything starts to crumble under Conover's feet, and he finds himself walking a number of thin lines, waiting for something to snap, knowing what snaps will probably be him.<br /><br />One of the problems with Company Man, from the perspective of the reviewer, is that trying to describe the book without revealing major plot twists is next to impossible. They start coming early, and they come thick, and much of what makes this book so readable is thus impossible to describe. Just trust me on this. If you liked Paranoia (and who didn't like Paranoia? If you haven't read it yet, it just came out in paperback, go read it right now), you're going to like Company Man, too. Finder isn't out on the bleeding edge here quite as much as he was in Paranoia, but that's not so much a problem as it is a stylistic decision; Company Man is a more conventional book, more mystery than thriller this time, but Finder delivers on the level of mystery. You're going to keep guessing right up till the last few chapters, and you will most likely be wrong. Isn't that what a good mystery is supposed to do? (The other problem with Company Man can be found in a description of Dairy Queen products.)<br /><br />Another hit for Finder. Recommended. *** ½. Just trust me on this.

Snicket keeps the soap-opera (as opposed to sitcom) method going here, continuing on the events of The Erstaz Elevator. The orphans are being sent by Mr. Poe to be raised by an entire village (because it takes a village to raise a child, of course), and the orphans discover that one of the towns they can choose from is called V.F.D. Believing they've solved the mystery at last, they head off for V.F.D., only to find that not only have the solved the mystery, but, as usual, not all is right with the world. In fact, most things are very wrong with the world. This, of course, is nothing new to the Baudelaires.<br /><br />It almost seems as if Lemony Snicket is writing a surreptitious primer on how to write a novel in these books. In this one, he introduces the concept of foreshadowing by clue (and does so with a nice, unexpected subtlety). Otherwise, it's your basic Baudelaire orphans novel.

Cathy East Dubowski and Mark Dubowski, A Horse Named Seabiscuit (Grosset and Dunlap, 2003)<br /><br />Now, I know this is a book for kids, and not kids who are proficient readers. Still, that doesn't excuse some of the omissions here (for example, the reason Seabiscuit lost his first Big Cap-- Red Pollard's blindness). Kids like drama just as much as adults. They could handle the blind-in-one-eye thing.<br /><br />Still, Seabiscuit's career is a tough thing to compress into forty-eight pages. The Dubowskis did try, and to some extent, they succeeded. They managed to do so without getting into anything too technical, which is a credit, but I think it was that unwillingness to get into the technical aspects that caused some of the more glaring omissions.<br /><br />It's my hope that this will encourage kids to look for more complete kids' books on Seabiscuit (Ralph Moody's classic Come On Seabiscuit!, for example) once they get old enough to handle the larger books. But this is a decent beginning. ***	2005-04-04

Nick Mamatas, Northern Gothic (Soft Skull Press, 2001)<br /><br />More and more books from Soft Skull Press seem to be falling into my hands over the last year or so. You may never have heard of Soft Skull Press, but you will. They have a mission to publish the best indie authors they can find, and while they slip on occasion, they also uncover gems every now and then. Nick Mamatas, who's been steadily making a name for himself in the underground horror community for the past five years or so, is one of those gems.<br /><br />That he's made such a name for himself intrigues me, as Mamatas' fiction runs counter to what seems to be the trend these days; rather than the extreme horror of such present hot young things as Charlee Jacob, Mamatas goes for the atmospheric. He doesn't tie up his loose ends, leaving the reader with more questions than answers; he's a lot more Stanislaw Lem than he is Brian Keene. And the horror here is almost a stretch to even call horror; it's more a quiet instensity.<br /><br />Ahmadi Jenkins is gay, black, and living in New York City for the past three weeks, still getting accustomed to the world around him and his present state of out of the closet-ness. In a parallel story, William Patten, an Irish dockworker, is trying to scrape up three hundred dollars to buy his way out of the Civil War draft in 1863, but suddenly finds himself spearheading one arm of the Draft Riots. The two stories collide when an offhand comment Patten makes in a bar about not caring for the darkies finds its way onto Jenkins' answering machine.<br /><br />Mamatas gives us just enough rope. He never comes right out and tells us that time's doing weird things, he just gives us enough hints through the action and setting that we know something really odd is going on. He's not going to tell us what it is, we have to fill in the blanks ourselves. This is the mark of great literature.<br /><br />Not to say that Northern Gothic is great literature; there are a few too many holes for the work to come off a a great piece of impressionism (though given the choice, I'd much rather have too many holes than too few; horror is always better when you have to imagine it yourself), and Patten and Jenkins, despite being relatively well-drawn characters, don't really jump off the page at you. That said, it should be obvious to the discerning reader of horror that Nick Mamatas is soon going to be a force to be reckoned with, and wouldn't you like to say you knew that guy back when? Well, \\"back when\\" is fading rapidly. Read Nick Mamatas now. *** ½few too many holes for the work to come off a a great piece of impressionism (though given the choice, I'd much rather have too many holes than too few; horror is always better when you have to imagine it yourself), and Patten and Jenkins, despite being relatively well-drawn characters, don't really jump off the page at you.

Roald Dahl, The Twits (Puffin, 1980)<br /><br />I have long been a huge fan of Roald Dahl's work, both the kids' books and the adult stuff. Some few pieces of his oeuvre have escaped me over the years, and so I figure it's time to track them down.<br /><br />The Twits is an amusing little tale of a husband-and-wife team who are ugly, mean, and stupid (perhaps presaging the parents in Matilda?). They train monkeys and eat bird pie for supper once a week. The monkeys and birds get fed up, and decide to give the Twits a taste of their own medicine.<br /><br />It's amusing, for what it is, but it doesn't seem to have quite as much heart in it as do Dahl's great efforts. The Twits themselves don't really have the depth to make them the memorable characters one normally finds in Dahl's best books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Danny the Champion of the World, etc.), and the plot of the thing feels more as if it's been stuck on with Hugtight Sticky Glue than it does an integral part of the story.<br /><br />Fun, but if you want to become a true Dahl fanatic, start somewhere else. I'd suggest Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was what made me a lifelong devotee when i first read it as a six- or seven-year-old. ***	2005-04-04

Taban Lo Lyong, Another Nigger Dead (Heinemann, 1972)<br /><br />I am a big, big fan of Heinemann's wonderful African Writers Series. The west wouldn't know about 90% of the writing that came out of Africa from the fifties through the eighties were it not for Heinemann. It's not all great, of course, but I'm thrilled to at least be able to read a good deal of it.<br /><br />Taban Lo Liyong is a pretty good example of \\"not great.\\" He's good, when he's on his game, which is not surprising for a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. And when he does prose (the final piece in the book), he's got a good wit and an eye for satire. Unfortunately, though, most of his poetry treads a boundary that lies between confessional and socially conscious, and he's too busy trying to get his message across to so things like give us images to work with. The majority of the poems here are two- to six-line pieces, three to a page, and one would think that an author working in such compact forms would understand the power of image. He doesn't, though, and so his poems come off as aphorisms most of the time, rather than actual poems.<br /><br />Still, there's enough good here to give this a slight recommend. Save it for a rainy day, though, when you don't have anything better on the nightstand waiting for you. ** ½	2005-04-04

Funny, I thought it was Gentlemen. And Cigar was retired after the 1996 Jockey Club Gold Cup? News to those of us who watched him finish third in the 1996 Breeders' Cup Classic). That aside, this is a fine little book to introduce kids to the various aspects of Thoroughbred racing behind the scenes-- breeding, training, and history. It's a slim book, only sixty-four pages, yet it packs a good deal of (simplified, as expected) information in a rather accessible package.

Costello (eds.) Bend, Don't Shatter: Poets on the Beginning of Desire (Red Rattle Press/Soft Skull Press, 2004)<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this collection is the folks they got to blurb it. The back cover contains high praise from poet Mark Doty (\\"These poems are for every young person who feels alone and full of longing...\\") and Academy of American Poets Associate Director Charles Flowers (\\"These poems find their power in a language forged by desire and survival...\\"). The introduction, by David Groff, promises that \\"The poems in Bend, Don't Shatter will pluck chords in you, chords so complex and resonant that you feel them in your spine. You'll hear truths so exact you can't explain them.\\" I hear stuff like this and I expect to be blown away by what's between these covers.<br /><br />Honestly, I should have known better. The narrower the theme for an anthology, the more inconsistent the poetry therein is liable to be. An anthology of love poems puts you on pretty solid ground. An anthology of teen love poems (putting aside for the moment that the ratio of good teen love poems to bad teen love poems is smaller, perhaps, than any ratio of good to bad in the whole realm of art) is going to cause that ground to sift under you. When you constrict it to gay teen love poems, you're pretty much ensuring you're going to pull the rug out from under yourself. What do you think's going to happen when you confine it to poets writing about the inception of gay teen love?<br /><br />The reason for this is simple: the ratio of good poetry to bad poetry in the world is already so small that the restrictions are bound to find you swimming in mountains of bad poetry, while you may not find even a single piece that's actually poetic. From that standpoint, Bend, Don't Shatter is actually a resounding success. There are, in fact, whole poems in this anthology that deserve, that demand, to be read. Fine pieces of work that truly understand what poetry is all about. They get \\"show, don't tell\\" right. They draw the picture and let the reader figure out the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the collection does not. As should be expected, you've got your fill of message poetry that would be exactly the same written out in prose. You have a couple of astonishingly bad formal pieces scattered throughout for good measure (the rest, of course, being free verse). You have some pieces that show real potential, where a line here or there is truly excellent, but the rest needs serious work. In one particular case in this anthology, you have a piece that starts off brilliant and, before your eyes, degenerates not only into message poetry, but the kind of horrible message poetry that could only sound good read from a soapbox on a streetcorner by some guy wearing a backwards collar, being laughed at by passersby.<br /><br />Interestingly, the anthology gets better as it goes on; I've no idea if the editors intended this effect, but the closer you get to the back of the book, in general, the better the stuff you're going to find. (One is tempted to counsel the reader to read it backwards.) In particular, Scott Hightower's \\"Cruising a Hungry World\\" is fantastic, a really good formal poem in an age when really good formal poems are few and far between (it has not escaped this author's notice that one of the best formal poets extant today, Marilyn Hacker, is both gay and infatuated with the sestina, and that Hacker's influence is worn thick on Hightower; that said, there are far worse influences to have, and most poets seem to have them).<br /><br />By all means, give this a look, as long as you don't mind wading through swine to find a few pearls. **at poetry is all about.

Feraca, Crossing the Great Divide (Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters, 1992)<br /><br />The good thing about being a thirty-six-year-old fanboy is that sometimes you stumble across gems like this. I started hunting for Crossing the Great Divide because Dominick Fernow, the brain behind Prurient, uses many of Feraca's pieces as lyrics in his material, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So I finally tracked a copy down.<br /><br />(The bad thing about being a thirty-six-year-old fanboy is that, well, you're a thirty-six-year-old fanboy.)<br /><br />Crossing the Great Divide is for the most part a good, solid book of poetry, the kind of thing that will make you remember the author's name, but won't stand out in your head once you've finished it; more Debra Weinstein than Debra Allbery. However, there are a select few pieces in here (most of them coming in the book's third section) that can only be described as sucker punches. These are pieces in which it seems some form of fog has been lifted from the reader's mind, and all the images click into place with a clarity completely unexpected given what has come before. The language turns a notch more sensuous, the descriptions become a bit more descriptive, and the reader realizes, hopefully, how fine a line there is between good poetry and great poetry, because the reader is getting a perfect example of how a poet sometimes crosses that line. (One is tempted to make amusing puns on the collection's title here. One will resist.)<br /><br />This is a fine piece of work, and was well worth the trouble I have put in over the past six months looking for it. (Established Feraca fans will want to be on the lookout for Prurient's albums, especially Troubled Sleep, released a few years back by Truculent Recordings, to see just what can be done with poetry adapted to lyrics.)	2005-03-31

Pornographic writing has always focused (obsessively, some might say) on what's taboo in society, and explored it. In detail. Probably in more detail than you would really want to read.<br /><br />Olympia Press' webpage calls Linda's Strange Vacation \\"One of the few 50s-era Paris books not by Olympia that's worth republishing.\\" (Note: I corrected punctuation in that quote.) One quails at the thought of reading 50s-era Paris books (of pornography, again, one assumes) that weren't worth reprinting, considering how incredibly distasteful Linda's Strange Vacation is.<br /><br />If you really need a plot synopsis, Linda goes to spend a weekend with her Uncle Arthur, cousin Robert, their maid Alice, and Arthur's young girlfriend Lola. Things that one can't really call complications ensue.<br /><br />As with the majority of pornographic novels, there's nothing of a plot to get in the way, little dialogue, and polymorphous positioning. I've long held a theory that every pornographic novel published since 1928 has been a knockoff of Story of the Eye. This may well be true of Linda's Strange Vacation, but, like most pornographic novels, the very elements that make Story of the Eye such an uncomfortable pleasure to read (not just the fact that everyone has sex, and lots of it, but all the underlying reasons for them having sex, and Bataille's gleeful explorations of why they're all having sex) are, of course, absent, leaving one with nothing but a series of sex scenes strung together, some of which (especially towards the end of the novel) will only be erotic to certain fetishists. * ½	2005-03-31

Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Fishbone (Snail's Pace Press, 2000)<br /><br />It should tell you something about Fishbone that this incredibly slim volume, which has been out of print for only a few years, is presently commanding prices on the open market that equate to approximately six dollars and fifty-seven cents per page. You can get that sort of scratch for an original Codex Seraphinius (currently selling for nineteen grand) or, at the height of the craze, before it was released in a trade paperback, a first edition of King's The Gunslinger. But for art or a popular story collection, even, that might make sense. How to explain it for a book of poetry, an artistic medium currently enjoying the least amount of favor in its history in America? More, how to explain it for a poet that criminally few people have ever heard of?<br /><br />Actually, it's quite simple: because Aimee Nezhukumatathil, despite having only a small following, has the same sort of small following as did, say, David Koresh. We are few in number, but make no mistake, we are fanatics. We have discovered one of those few writers who is struggling to hold the American literary presence together, and of those few, one of the best, and we will simultaneously hoard the sacred words and proselytize to the ends of the earth until Aimee Nez gets the recognition she deserves. Her name rests quite easily among such other giants of modern America poetry as Hayden Carruth and Ira Sadoff. (And if you don't know who those two are, shame on you.)<br /><br />So why am I only giving Fishbone four stars, all that said? Actually, it's because I read Miracle Fruit first. Many of the poems here look familiar. Not because they all share Nezhukumatathil's wonderful, visceral style, but because many of them are the same poems. (One wonders if the person who just paid $184 for a copy on amazon knew this beforehand.) Now, don't get me wrong-- these poems are well worth reading, no matter how you come by them. But Miracle Fruit is much easier to come by these days, and will set you back a lot less cash. But if you happen to find a copy of this at your local used bookstore, I suggest grabbing it. Not only because it's a great book of poems, but because you can make a ten thousand or so percent profit on it pretty fast. ****is much easier to come by these days, and will set you back a lot less cash.

Ivan Arguelles, Enigma and Variations: Paradise is Persian for Park (Pantograph, 1995)<br /><br />Another piece of Arguelles' epic masterpiece, Pantograph. In the greater scheme of things, I can't say enough good things about Pantograph (though lord knows I've tried in the reviews of the books I've so far managed to track down). It is a brilliant piece of work. Arguelles is, perhaps singlehandedly, keeping alive the true spirit of surrealism on American soil in this amazing journey; all we can do is hitch ourselves to the wagon and hope we survive the long, fast, exceptionally bumpy ride.<br /><br />Enigma and Variations is, unfortunately, one of the less pleasant bumps, but don't let that in any way stop you from reading this alongside the other works in the piece. While Arguelles' stream-of-consciousness style remains intact, and his language is as precise and potent as ever, Enigma and Variations is the first piece of the puzzle I've read that actually seems as if it didn't flow forth from the pen, all of a piece, Athenalike. There is the air of craft about it, the air of revision.<br /><br />Now, normally, this is not a bad thing in poetry. In fact, there are thousands upon thousands of pages of poetry extant in the world today that could use far more craft, and far more revision, than they have. The problem with it in this case is that Enigma and Variations is not quite the same swirling, chaotic, beautiful mass that the other books in the series (those I've read, at least) are. For a few pages, scattered here and there, the subconscious effect disappears, and we see the various obsessions spread out along their various threads. The evil spectre of message poetry rears its basiliskesque head and attempts to stare us in the face. Now, to Arguelles' great credit, said gorgon never fully rises out of its murky pit and takes over the place to break all the glass and make us pay to clean up the mess. At best, we find ourselves rubbing only slightly against the flying glass, and we emerge relatively unscathed. But still, when compared to such amazing journeys as Hapax Legomenon, Enigma and Variations is a bit rougher of a trip, just that much less readable than its brethren and sistren. Now, I rush to add that \\"just that much less readable\\" (emphasis there, strongly, on \\"just\\") means it's still better than 99% of what you'd pick up off a store shelf randomly, and it's still very much worth your while to hunt down and read. However, if you're an Arguelles newbie (and if so, I envy your your first dip into the bottomless black pool that is Arguelles), you may want to start with Hapax Legomenon or, outside the Pantograph epic, the brilliant Looking for Mary Lou: Illegal Syntax. The local china shop will thank you. *** ½flying glass, and we emerge relatively unscathed.

Steven Erikson, Deadhouse Gates (Tor, 2000)<br /><br />I finished up page 598 of Deadhouse Gates, and my next act was to go to my library's website and put the third book in the series, Memories of Ice, on hold.<br /><br />Deadhouse Gates is Erikson's second entry in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, which, despite its rather clumsy series name, is bang-up stuff. Few authors write martial scenes quite this well in high fantasy; Tolkein's final battle in Return of the King, Elizabeth Moon's depictions of day-to-day troop life in The Deed of Paksennarion, just about every aspect of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Yes, I'd rank Erikson with those three. Easily.<br /><br />Readers of Gardens of the Moon may find themselves slightly confused when opening up Deadhouse Gates, no doubt because it takes place half a world away from Darujhistan, the city at the heart of Gardens of the Moon. You'll remember that everyone was worried, at the end of that novel, about something called the Pannion Seer. Well, you'll not see the Pannion Seer, nor most of the surviving characters from Gardens of the Moon, here (from the description I just read, that tale continues in Memories of Ice). Instead, a select few characters have fled east across the sea for various reasons, and only they link the tales.<br /><br />Like Gardens of the Moon, Deadhouse Gates is an ensemble tale, but is even more sprawling in scope; at any given time, Erikson is following between two and six plot threads in alternating sections of any given chapter. There are four main plot threads, through they meander towards and away from each other, split off, and join together differently, throughout the text. The first concerns a trio pressed into slavery-- an ex-priest of Fener the Boar God, a noble-born teen, and a barbarian, none of whom seem to have anything in common, yet who are forced by circumstances to forge an uneasy bond. The second revolves around Duiker, the Imperial Historian (mentioned, but never met, in Gardens of the Moon), who accompanies the Seventh Army on a grueling overland journey from the northern city of Hissar to the southern city of Aren. The third involves Crokus, Apsalar, and Fiddler, three of the characters from Gardens of the Moon, who have come east to try and get Apsalar home to her father. The fourth involves another refugee, Kalam, who has come east for decidedly different means.<br /><br />Deadhouse Gates is, essentially, a tale of journeys. In epic fantasy series (and this one is truly epic in scope; the first three books alone total close to twenty-five hundred pages), the book of journeys, or the book of transitions, is often the weakest in the series (cf. Martin's A Clash of Kings, or King's The Waste Lands). Erikson, on the other hand, has crafted an amazing piece of work in Deadhouse Gates, investing the journeys, and the underlying transitions, with more than enough action and intelligence to keep the reader going, while still getting all the boring stuff out of the way under the surface. Everyone gets where they're going, all the plot threads are eventually sewn up (except those left as obvious hooks into the remainder of the series), all the details that one almost expects, these days, to see disappear into the dust of all these riders on their journeys come to satisfying conclusions. Erikson's eye for detail is truly astounding in some cases.<br /><br />One word of warning, though, in case you hadn't yet realized it after reading Gardens of the Moon. Erikson is just as hard on his main characters as is George R. R. Martin; some of the characters in this novel have a decidedly Janet Leigh air about them, but Erikson never once, in the hundreds of pages before he dispatches them, lets you know which ones they'll be, and their deaths often come with the same surprise (and surprisingly-felt sorrow) as the surprising death at the climax of A Game of Thrones (the identity of the victim of which I shall not reveal here to spare those handful of you who have not yet started that equally brilliant series).<br /><br />An incredible piece of work, quite likely to find its way onto my Best-I-Read list for 2005. **** ½l here to spare those handful of you who have not yet started that equally brilliant series). <br /> <br />An incredible piece of work, quite likely to find its way onto my Best-I-Read list for 2005. **** 	2005-03-31

Jay Slater, Eaten Alive!: Italian Cannibal and Zombie Movies (Plexus, 2002)<br /><br />I was hoping, in Eaten Alive!, for a real critical study of the cannibal and zombie subgenres of Italian horror in the late seventies and early eighties. That's not what I got. Instead, it's a list, with reviews of the films by various folks (mostly Slater himself, but with guest reviewers of some stature as well, e.g. David J. Schow) and a few interview pieces with various cast and crew on various films.<br /><br />For what it is, it's a good enough book. Slater obviously has quite a comprehensive video collection, and there's probably at least one flick in here you've never heard of, no matter how well-versed you are in the genre (I'd heard of about ninety percent of them before reading this, and I've been well-versed in the genre since... well, I remember seeing the original TV trailer for Fulci's Zombie, if that tells you anything). Just expect Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese instead of Four Senses of Dante Alighieri in Film, and you're liable to enjoy it much more. ***	2005-03-31

Sorley MacLean, Dain do Eimhir (University of Glasgow Press, 2002)<br /><br />Actually, I shouldn't be attributing this book to Sorley MacLean. Of its two hundred seventy-four pages, less than an hundred were actually written by MacLean. Christopher Whyte, the editor of the book, wrote most of it. And in its way, it's rather an impressive thing. How does one write six pages of commentary on one line of a poem?<br /><br />But the central piece of the book is MacLean's \\"greatest achievement\\" (as per the cover), the poem cycle Dain do Eimhir (Poems to Eimhir-- Eimhir, by the by, being the wife of Cuchulainn). And thus the obvious question follows. How are the poems?<br /><br />The concise answer to that question is \\"unpoetic.\\" MacLean obviously did not come from the \\"show, don't tell\\" school of thought. (Whyte realizes this, at least subconsciously, as he attributes some of the difficulties of translating some of MacLean's poems to the frequency with which MacLean uses abstract nouns; abstraction, of course, is anathema to poetry.) MacLean is constantly talking about how beautiful his addressee(s) is(are), but the only concrete detail about her/them we ever get is hair color. (In fact, Whyte's assertion that there's more than one Eimhir stems solely from this one detail.) Poetry doesn't tell us something is beautiful, poetry shows us something is beautiful. Otherwise, it's prose (and unacceptably vague prose, at that) chopped up into short lines, whether it rhymes or not.<br /><br />Mildly interesting for the scholarship Whyte attaches, but the poetry, well, isn't. **	2005-03-15

Terry Provost, Compassionate Imperialism (and its \\"links to terror\\") (deep cleveland press, 2004)<br /><br />I truly wish I could give this book a good review.<br /><br />It starts off with a piece Provost wrote in the late seventies, and there's a good deal f promise there. It's not perfect, by any means, but it's poetry. The next sixty-two pages... well, no.<br /><br />\\"No ideas but in things,\\" William Carlos Williams said half a century ago. Such remains the rallying cry for what distinguishes poetry from prose. And it seems, subconsciously or not, to have been an idea that Provost was at least trying to embody in the seventies. For the rest of this collection, though, which was written over the past decade, he has completely abandoned the idea (at least for these poems). Instead, he's content simply to relate, to excoriate, and to screed, with no thought whatsoever to the poetry of the words being used:<br /><br />\\"The CIA engineers the overthrow of Mossadegh,<br /><br />replaces him with the Shah of Iran whose secret<br /><br />police, Savak, trained by American overseers from<br /><br />Langley, becomes infamous for torture.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Ancient History, Like You, Today\\")<br /><br />Artless and, at the same time, without a shred of craft. Nothing about it even remotely resembles poetry. And yet, it's marketed and sold as such for reasons unbeknownst to me. I find this all the more depressing because in so many pieces here, Provost obviously has his political head screwed on straight (certainly far straighter than any other overtly political poet I've come across since Carolyn Forche), and had he actually put some real effort into crafting poems instead of speeches for political rallies, he could've likely come up with some powerful, persuasive material. All the evidence you need that this is the case is embodied in that first, early poem, which sits inexplicably at the front of the book showing you what could have been, and most assuredly is not.<br /><br />Half a star because I finished it.star because I finished it.	2005-03-15

Jon Fasman, The Geographer's Library (Penguin, 2005)<br /><br />The advance readers' copy of Peter Rushforth's monstrously huge novel Pinkerton's Sister trumpets that it will be \\"one of the most talked-about novels of 2005.\\" (I have amusing images in my head of it being discussed mostly in free clinics, doctors' offices, and emergency rooms around the world as being the cause of a number of back problems, hernias, etc.) If Jon Fasman's The Geographer's Library is not another one of them, then there is something utterly wrong with this planet.<br /><br />The Geographer's Library is an exquisite novel. Actually, it's three exquisite novels (I'd insert the obligatory comparison to House of Leaves here, but The Geographer's Library has a far more regular structure to it). The first takes place in the present time and details a young reporter's search for information to put in the obituary for a professor who taught at his alma mater. The reporter, Paul Tomm, quickly discovers that said professor had a much weirder life than anyone gave him credit for, and gets embroiled in figuring out exactly what the man was up to during the last years of his life. The second takes place from the year 1155 up through the fall of the Soviet Union, and details the lives of a number of seemingly unrelated artifacts stolen from the house of a minor noble by a thief at the beginning of the story. The third is a catalog of the artifacts, rather like an auction catalog if it were written by, say, Wallace Stevens.<br /><br />Fasman shamelessly manipulates the things happening in the second and third bits to throw things at the reader while he's embroiled in the first (which is, arguably, the \\"main\\" story here, though all are acceded equal importance in the novel), but everything's set up so precisely the the reader ends up not caring a whit that Fasman is nakedly manipulative in his placements of various crucial details to solving the mystery surrounding the professor. This is a symptom of the novel's true brilliance, which is simply Fasman's ability to write; here are three threads, each of a separate piece, and each in such a completely different style that the reader is truly charmed into believing they were written by different hands.<br /><br />The pace is deliberately slow at the beginning as you get to know the characters and the general scene, but when you get about halfway through the book, things pick up. (I suggest, if you're reading at night, stopping and turning out the light when you get to Paul and Joe's first meeting. You will not want to put the book down once you get past that scene until you turn the final page.)<br /><br />We may only be three months into 2005, but we've already had the good fortune to have one of its best novels published.

Will Toedtman, The Several World (Kent State University Press, 2003)<br /><br />I have quickly realized over the past few months that much of what is exciting in academic poetry today can be found within the covers of the slim volumes, four per year, published in Kent State University's Wick Poetry Chapbook series. The most recent one I've happened upon is Will Toedtman's The Several World, and there is very much to like about this up-and-coming author. Toedtman, according to the rather thin bio, is a student at the University of Cincinnati. This is not information we'd have really needed, short the location; Toedtman's work is obviously \\"student\\" work, both in its tendency to roam the full map of both strict and free verse, and in its choice of subject matter, which has the close, slightly unsightly odor of the confessional about it. But the subject matter does nothing to inhibit the power of Toedtman's language, which is considerable even in one so young:<br /><br />\\"Instead, he noticed things: a trash can jostled<br /><br />by a raccoon; so many flecks of glass<br /><br />(the detritus of other nights)<br /><br />glinting in the tarmac of the street;<br /><br />the Washington Memorial lit up<br /><br />tooth-white within a wrought-iron fence, the general's<br /><br />statue at the top, attending to<br /><br />what might be British flags outside the harbor<br /><br />or the flags of mercenaries-- who could tell<br /><br />at such a distance, their colors being equal?\\"<br /><br />(--\\"An Idea of Order on Charles Street\\")<br /><br />One can see the student-ness in the allusion to Stevens, even. But so, there is an undeniable appeal to Toedtman's pieces that keeps the reader perusing, and there is an obvious direction to the man's work. Will Toedtman is going places, have no doubt about it. I can speak from personal experience when I say that in ten years, Mr. Toedtman may be embarrassed he published any of the early work, but I can also speak from experience when I say that, as a reader, I'm quite grateful he did. A an added bonus, for a Wick book, this one's positively massive, clocking in at thirty pages, so you get more Toedtman goodness than one would expect from a Wick book. And the extra pages are well-deserved. Read this. *** ½did.

Lemony Snicket, The Ersatz Elevator (Scholastic, 2001)<br /><br />Lemony Snicket just keeps getting better. This sixth book in the Series of Unfortunate Events sees its pint-sized protagonists taken from their horrible boarding school and dropped quite suddenly into the lap of luxury, \\"luxury\\" here being a seventy-one bedroom apartment on Dark Street, a few blocks from where they grew up. One gets the feeling Snicket plotted all six of the first books at once, building them up to a moment about fifty pages from the end of this volume (the longest in the series so far, I might add, clocking in at over two hundred fifty pages). I can't tell you what it is, of course, because that would be cheating.<br /><br />The best (and \\"best\\" here means \\"the reason you should rush out and pick up a copy of this book, after you read the first five, of course\\") thing about The Ersatz Elevator is that things are actually starting to develop. The series is quickly losing its episodic flavor, as more characters are found coming from book to book, the events in certain books are starting to come back to haunt the characters, etc. It feels more like an actual series, with a concrete beginning/middle/end than a sitcom. As well, the characters are developing (as is the subtlety of Snicket's humor in the words he has Sunny bark out every once in a while, which are less random-seeming and more based on foreign languages with each passing book; she even manages an English word now and then.)<br /><br />If the rest of them continue this trend, books nine, ten, and eleven may make my best reads of 2005 list. If you got bogged down in the first couple because it seemed like you were trapped in a bad British sitcom, rest assured, things improve immensely. ****	2005-03-15

Adam Fawer, Improbable (Morrow, 2005)<br /><br />I'm sure you all remember The Da Vinci Code. How can you possibly have forgotten it? Hasn't it been on the bestseller list since the beginning of time? That such a perfectly average thriller could have garnered such a huge following, and still be selling that many copies per week, is absolutely astonishing to me. Especially when so many better, more intelligent thrillers roam the world looking for that kind of devoted readership.<br /><br />Improbable is one of those thrillers. It attempts many of the same things as does The Da Vinci Code, but where Dan Brown's book fails so miserably in its attempts, Improbable often succeeds.<br /><br />David Caine is a gambler. He spends most of his nights in the basement of a Russian private club playing Texas Hold 'em and trying unsuccessfully to avoid synaesthesia, usually followed by crippling seizures. One night, after losing a hand he had almost no chance of losing (and going deep into the Russian mob's debt in the process), Caine loses consciousness, only to wake up in the hospital later. He's faced with one last shot at alleviating the problem: an experimental treatment that's never been tested on humans before.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a CIA agent is selling secrets to the North Koreans, and a professor obsessed with tapping into the unconscious is performing experiments on a grad student he also happens to be sleeping with. How does it all tie together? Wonderfully.<br /><br />The plot itself, however, is not the true pleasure of reading Improbable. Nor is it the characters, who are somewhat inconsistently drawn; some of them are deep, rich creations, while others are cardboard stereotypes. No, the best thing about Improbable is that Fawer can take you through so many different things that need explaining, explain them, and not break the flow of the story, much less come off sounding didactic. He assumes (perhaps rightly) that his readers know nothing about the ground he's treading, and he fills us in on what we need to know for the book to pack maximum punch.

(Buccaneer Books, 1986)<br /><br />It has been my experience for the past half-decade or so that when I want to read good horror, I don't go to the horror section of the bookstore. I go to the non-fiction section. There is a short but powerful list of nonfiction books that are guaranteed to put a good scare into you, and I seem to have stumbled across the majority of them. Stanton Peele's The Diseasing of America. Robert Weinberg's One Renegade Cell. Glenn Gaesser's Big Fat Lies. Add to the list Allen and Abraham's None Dare Call It Conspiracy.<br /><br />Allen and Abraham here attempt to make the case that the events of recent world history, from the Bolshevik Revolution forward, have been brought into being and controlled by a relatively small group of insiders, mostly international banking magnates and (later on) the Council on Foreign Relations. While it's certainly conspiracy theory, Allen and Abraham have done a fine job of backing up their assertions with a huge amount of primary and secondary source material (just looking up the titles in the bibliography took me the better part of two hours). Whether you're a fan of conspiracy theory or not, the facts presented, and the conclusions drawn, in this book, are thought-provoking and outrageous.<br /><br />I defy any reader of this slim volume, conservative, liberal, neocon, free-thinker, what have you-- not to be incensed by it. Even if you only believe a fraction of what Allen and Abraham put forth in this book, it cannot but make you want to do something to stem the tide. And there is certainly a tide; the book, originally written during the Nixon administration, can be looked at now with three decades of hindsight. There's no denying that much of what Allen and Abraham forecast for America's future has either come to pass or is in front of the Cabinet as we speak. (Michael Badnarik dissects the final chapter of this book, and points out a number of ways these predictions have already happened, in his book odd to Be King). Whether you believe that there really is a conspiracy afoot (and, really, \\"follow the money\\" does work here) or whether you believe it's all the result of incompetence, stupidity, and lack of communication, there's no denying it's happening. All you have to do is step outside and look around.<br /><br />Terrifying. A must-read. Do whatever you need to do to hunt a copy down.

Tristan Corbiere, The Centenary Corbiere (Dufour Editions, 1975)<br /><br />Tristan Corbiere, for those not following along, was (to oversimplify things a bit but stay relatively accurate) the father of symbolism. Those who began the symbolist movement were all huge fans of Corbiere, and is influence has come down to use today to the point where almost every modern American poet has felt, however indirectly, the influence of Tristan Corbiere (mostly through T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, both of whom were much influenced by the young Breton). Given that, doesn't it strike you as just a bit odd that Corbiere's complete work wasn't available in English until 1975? Two selected volumes had previously been released (1947 and 1954), and both quickly went out of print. Sad to say, Val Warner's edition, the most complete ever available in English, suffered much the same fate. (A new translation of Les Amours Jaunes is forthcoming in April 2005. We'll see how long it lasts.)<br /><br />That it stands as the only English translation of Corbiere that made any real attempt to collect his complete writings makes The Centenary Corbiere invaluable to poets simply by its existence (at least until an actual Complete Works comes along). Warner's sixty-five page (!) introduction bogs down in places, but is certainly worth reading for newcomers to Corbiere. Fans of modern poetry, either European or American, will find a good deal to like here, as the influence Corbiere has had on modern poets is quite visible through his own words. (Diamanda Galas fans will also want to pick this up for \\"Cris d'Aveugle.\\")<br /><br />Quite worthwhile. ****	2005-03-04

Charlee Jacob, Guises (Delirium Books, 2002)<br /><br />Charlee Jacob went from publishing obscure short stores in small-press and online magazines to the toast of the horror community virtually overnight with the 2002 mass-market publication of her 1998 debut novel, This Symbiotic Fascination. Haunter, which appeared the next year, has solidified Jacob's rightful position at the top of the horror heap. While much of the shorter work she has published (over six hundred pieces, to date) remains uncollected, fans will definitely want to head out and pick up the two currently-available small-press collections of her shorter work. Of the two, Guises is the easier to find (though not by much). (Note to clarify: other collections of her short work have seen print; however, you'll pay collector's prices to get them. These two you can still find for cover price.)<br /><br />Which is kind of depressing, because Dread in the Beast (released in 1999 by Necro Publications) is the better book. Slightly, I grant you. If you pick up Guises, and you know Jacob's work, you are likely to not be disappointed. Like Dread in the Beast, Guises contains an eclectic mix of stories, some of them the drenched-in-gore work fans of the novels have come to expect, and some (which are usually the more compelling stories) lighter on the gore and heavier on the atmosphere. The title story in \\"Guises\\" is one of the latter variety, and of the short work of Jacob's I've read, it may be the finest piece. It alone is worth the price of admission here. A few of the other stories also stand out (\\"A Window for Anon\\" and \\"The Vanishing Point\\" worked especially well for me).<br /><br />After the story collection is finished is a poetry collection. Which, I should note, is large enough on its own to have been a single-author collection of poetry (sixty-five pages). And really, there's some decent stuff here at times; Jacob obviously knows how to stick to image, and occasionally does let image get a word in edgewise. Unfortunately, \\"some\\" is the key word. Unlike her short stories, her poetry here varies widely in consistency, craft, and talent, and I found myself skimming more than once. Which shouldn't put you off the book, for the bulk of it is quite wonderful. Just be prepared for the quality to slip a notch here and there. ***d in edgewise.

Robert Vavra, Horses of the Sun (Morrow, 1995)<br /><br />Blurbed by James Michener and introduced by William Shatner (and this was before the Priceline days, mind you). Can you get any cooler?<br /><br />Horses of the Sun reminds me of another book that's crossed my desk quite recently, Barbara Livingston's Old Friends: Visits with My Favorite Thoroughbreds. Maybe if I hadn't read that one so recently, this one would have appealed to me more (but I don't think so). About the only place where Vavra's book doesn't pale in comparison is that he covers more breeds of horses (but then, you expect from the title of Livingston's book she's only photographing one breed for it) and covers each horse with more photographs than Livingston. Other than that, however, Livingston's book towers over this.<br /><br />As should be the case in two books of photographs, the main thing to compare is the photographs themselves. Barbara Livingston shoots clean, spare shots with an eye for a good background. Vavra's photographs are always very cluttered, and he has a thing for overly-dramatic double-exposure shots. (Oh, my, does he have a thing for overly-dramatic double-exposure shots.) Now, one overly-dramatic double-exposure shot, on its own, is fine (for example, the one that hangs over the entrance to the Kentucky Horse Park). But in a book of over two hundred pages, where you've got at least two for every horse he's photographing, the effect gets to be a bit much. To say the least.<br /><br />Livingston also gets comparative points for the text in the two books, though it's a bit harder to put a finger on why. Both of them are writing about horses they've loved over the years, and both approach a tone of hero-worship quite often in the text (which, for a book of photographs, is extensive in both). I think, perhaps, it's the same thing as it is with the photographs; Livingston's prose is cleaner, less flowery. It's almost as if, in comparison, Vavra's book is a two-hundred-fifty-plus page Hallmark card.<br /><br />Nice to look at, but if you're a Vavra fan, check out Barbara Livingston's work. ** ½ifty-plus page Hallmark card. <br /> <br />Nice to look at, but if you're a Vavra fan, check out Barbara Livingston's work. ** 	2005-03-04

Anna George Meek, Acts of Contortion (University of Wisconsin Press, 2002)<br /><br />Anna George Meek is that rarest of birds, a \\"message\\" poet who's able to shut up and let the images do the talking. Even if the poems to be found in Acts of Contortion were simply pedestrian, mundane exercises in the art of poetry, that alone would make this book worth reading, and possibly (it's still too early to tell) one of my best reads of 2005.<br /><br />But these poems are not pedestrian or mundane. They sometimes come off in one-trick pony style (Meek, a violinist, tends to play with music as metaphor a but strongly here), but they are never less than accomplished.<br /><br />\\"No one will get hurt in the green world.<br />The wealthy summer will spend its humidity<br />generously, fresh silver in the morning streets.<br />But you must prepare for it....At this very hour, whole armies<br />are serving asparagus, repairing their nations<br />of grief, the terrorism of illness, of beatings.\\"<br />(\\"The Pacifist Dreams of an Apocalypse\\")<br /><br />There is subtle humor, wit, and breathless discovery to be found here, but never cynicism. Surprising, considering much of the work comes from the wellspring of abused womens' shelters. Meek confronts her subject matter with empathy rather than anger, and that makes all the difference.<br /><br />Anna George Meek is a name you should know. ****	2005-02-28

Lemony Snicket, The Austere Academy (Scholastic, 2000)<br /><br />The poor unfortunate Baudelaire orphans are back for their fifth trip through the lively imagination of Mr. Lemony Snicket. This episode sees them carted off by their guardian, Mr. Poe, to the Prufrock Academy, prep school for... well, you're never really sure for whom. There's another pair of orphans, who used to be triplets; there's Carmelita Spats, an elementary school child out of the nightmares of everyone who ever went to elementary school; there's the tone-deaf vice-principal, a pair of teachers who actually quite remind me of a professor I had in college, and there's Count Olaf, of course. (There's also Beatrice, but she plays very little part in the overall story, and can be summarily dismissed from everything save Mr. Snicket's mind.)<br /><br />Those who have already started reading this amusing, well-written series don't need a review from the likes of me. Those who haven't, go back and start at the beginning, or you'll be hopelessly lost. There's a major development in the writing style in this book, but as it concerns the last chapter, to reveal it would be a spoiler (a word which here means \\"a sentence which would defeat the purpose of me telling you to go out and read the book, already\\") of disastrous consequences. Suffice to say you'll notice something of a difference.<br /><br />As usual, well worth reading. *** ½	2005-02-28

Northrop's pieces somehow avoid the density of the common poem without hearkening back to pre-modernist days. There's a good deal here, mind you, but it's presented in almost spare, windblown style, despite never straying far from the poetic mantra of  \\"image, image, image.\\"<br /><br />\\"When he enters the room,<br /><br />the walls darken,<br /><br />just slightly, and a cloud<br /><br />covers the lake.

Brian Knight (ed.), Rare: An Anthology of Rare Horror (Disc-Us Books, 2001)<br /><br />Okay, so I was perusing the table of contents on this a few weeks ago and the name Monica J. O'Rourke jumped out at me. Good enough a reason to pick it up and give it a shot. And thus, here we are.<br /><br />Rare is an anthology gathered from an online writing group (which one it is, no one says; probably by design), of which all the contributors are members. Now, any of you who've been involved in an online writing group are liable to cringe when you hear that, and not without good reason. I rush to tell you this is not your average collection of online fare, not by any means. This is an anthology where the writers who've never been in print before are few and far between,  and the majority of the stories here are solid as can be. There are far more heavies here than one would expect, including O'Rourke (Suffer the Flesh) and Knight himself (the upcoming Broken Angel). Knight's story, in fact, can be singled out as one of the best in here; rare (pardon the pun) is the self-published piece that's actually worth it, but Knight's story is quite lovely. It'd be impossible to single out everything here worthy of it, especially in the thousand words one gets from Amazon, so I'll stop by mentioning the first story in the collection, J. Newman's \\"When Satan Sings the Blues,\\" which has all the tone (and wit) of a particular old Night Gallery episode that fans of the series will remember just based on the title of the story.<br /><br />The quality is a bit on the inconsistent side, naturally, as is the case with most anthologies. Don't let that scare you off. Rare is one you can sink your teeth into (sorry, sorry, I couldn't resist). ***	2005-02-28

Henning Mankell, Sidetracked (Vintage, 1995)<br /><br />Mankell's fourth Kurt Wallander mystery has won awards (or so the Vintage Books blurb on the back cover tells me; I can't seem to find any press releases that actually say which award[s] the book won), been made into a film, and been translated into almost as many languages as your favorite swear words. And yet the name is completely unfamiliar to the vast majority of the American book-buying public, even the mystery fans. Why is that? Because it's on Vintage, whose catalog is more \\"where we've been\\" than \\"what's hot today?\\" (The Vintage Crime backlist is littered with names like Jim Thompson, Patricia Highsmith, Raymind Chandler, and Dashiell Hammett; the only \\"now\\" author a modern-fiction-blindered fan is likely to recognize is Jonathan Lethem, whose mysteries are, shall we say, decidedly different from what one picks up when one goes for the newest Mysterious Press titles.) Is it because reading translated fiction is kind of like watching a subtitled movie to a certain kind of intellect? Is it because Vintage only gets stray pennies of Knopf's advertising budget? We may never know the answer to this, and other pressing, questions, but we can try to put things right.<br /><br />First off, if you're a mystery fan of whatever stripe, you should be buying the whole Vintage Crime catalog. Period. Pick up any random book with \\"Vintage Crime\\" on the spine and you're going to be well-rewarded. You'll either get a classic, like those mentioned above, something so far out of the mainstream you'd never have discovered it (like Lethem or the spit-funny mysteries of Joe R. Lansdale), or stuff from other countries that's good enough a bunch of people said \\"hey, why haven't we read an English translation of this guy yet?\\"Swedish writer Mankell falls into this last category. If you don't know anything about Swedish mysteries, just equate Sweden with Lapland. If you're really a mystery fan, the name Erik Skjodbaerg should come to mind immediately. (Skjoldbaerg wrote and directed one of the finest mystery films of the past thirty years in Insomnia. Forget the watered-down American crap you were spoon-fed a few years back and rent the original, if you haven't seen it.) Sidetracked is no Insomnia, but then, few things are. It's certainly good enough for what it is.<br /><br />What it is is a police procedural, kind of Giles Blunt crossed with Robert B. Parker with a lot more attention given to the weather and the World Cup. Wallander is awakened one morning close to Midsummer and sent out to a farmer's rape farm, where a girl of indeterminate age has been lurking. When Wallander gets there, she sets herself (and the farmer's crop) on fire. The next day, Wallander and his team are called in to investigate the murder and scalping of a former Minister of Justice. The bosses are hot to get the latter case wrapped up, while Wallander can't shake his interest in the former. Meanwhile, the department faces imminent cutbacks (a familiar refrain to American police-novel readers, no doubt), the World Cup is going on, and Wallander's trying to figure out both how to reconcile with his long-estranged father and balance a relationship (carried over from a previous novel in the series). There's quite a bit going on here, obviously.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the end result is that some things get lost in the mix. Notably, the relationship between Wallander and Baiba is almost nonexistent here, leading me to wonder if Mankell couldn't have just ignored it for the space of this novel, or relegated it to an even farther seat in the back than it already is. Also, the language stumbles at times, breaking the novel's pace (perhaps reading a translated novel really is like watching a subtitled movie). But still, overall, a very good mystery, and a worthy addition to the mighty Vintage Crime line. *** ½d come to mind immediately.

Brecher, Beating the Races with a Computer (Software Supply, 1980)<br /><br />There are few books on handicapping that can be considered indispensable. It's likely that, a quarter of a century after its original publication, Steven Brecher's Beating the Races with a computer is no longer on that list. After all, the handicapping game has changed quite a lot in the ensuing twenty-five years. However, Brecher's means, methods, and processes are just as valid as they were then; the reader just has to change a few things in their application.<br /><br />Brecher's book came out not long after Bill Quirin's groundbreaking Winning at the Races, and what Brecher does here is, to some extent, simply revise and extend the excellent work Quirin did. History has, of course, borne out Brecher's prediction that computer processor power would continue to come down in price (and his breathless exclamation that someday in the future, the racing fan would be able to take the whole database to the track came true with the advent of the laptop), and thus this book, instead of languishing in its present obscurity, would seem to be even more important to the do-it-yourself punter. Brecher describes ho to set up your own system for computerized handicapping, including a brief discussion of multiple regression analysis and how to set up a database, and then shows you his own findings. Where the present-day reader will find the most value in this book is in Brecher's descriptions of how the statistics work; it's pretty easy to read between the lines and figure out how most of the automation was done. And, of course, these days it doesn't require a minicomputer that costs \\"about as much as a Chevrolet;\\" your old 486 gathering dust on the shelf can handle this stuff easily.<br /><br />If you're a handicapper who dabbles in programming your own handicapping software, this book will be absolutely invaluable. Do what you need to do to hunt down a copy. **** ½	2005-02-21

Clive Barker, Abarat (Joanna Cotler Books, 2002)<br /><br />Clive Barker can't be said to have hit a slump after Sacrament, because his books are usually (The Damnation Game excepted) a cut above anything else anyone's releasing, but is two post-Sacrament books, Galilee and Coldheart Canyon, didn't seem up to the standard Barker had set for himself in such fantastic journeys as Sacrament, Imajica, and the books of the Art. With Abarat, however, Barker has returned to the fantasy milieu in which he is the strongest, and has turned in quite a fine piece of work.<br /><br />Candy Quackenbush lives in Chickentown, Minnesota, a place that really defines \\"nowhere special.\\" She feels, however, that she should be somewhere else, and very soon after the book starts, she finds that somewhere else-- the Abarat, an archipelago in a sea somewhere not of this earth. Abarat, the first book in a projected series, introduces the main players, sets up (we assume) the events of the forthcoming books, and introduces us to the Abarat itself.<br /><br />Barker's strength has always been the creation of dense, detailed mythologies in which to set his stories. He doesn't reveal everything, so the reader doesn't feel the need to sit with copies of a Biblical concordance and various creation myths in attendance while reading one of Barker's novels, but he gives the reader enough that there's an understanding that there's a whole complex scenario working behind the scenes. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings series operates in the same way, as do Herge's Tintin graphic novels. Barker's worlds often feel as if they have that same level of detail, which is one of the things that separates him from other writers of books like this, and make his work such a pleasure to read. Abarat may well be the most detailed of the lot to date, surpassing even the attention to detail paid to Imajica. Though it's obvious that Abarat is mostly setting up things to come, it's a joy to have one of the modern masters of high fantasy back on form and writing stuff this lovely. ****of high fantasy back on form and writing stuff this lovely. ****	2005-02-21

Stephen Woodworth, Through Violet Eyes (Dell, 2004)<br /><br />I picked this up on a recommendation from the LiveJournal booktards group, and I'm quite glad I did. Stephen Woodworth has created an alternate world that's not completely thought-out, but still intriguing, and there's not enough detail to let the tears in the fabric show though. The result may not be seamless, but it looks so, and that's really what matters.<br /><br />In this world are humans known as violets, because of the color of their eyes (and whether this dig at the \\"violet eyes\\" clich&eacute; in romance novels was intentional or not, it's amusing). Violets are capable of communicating with the souls of the dead, and are therefore invaluable in the criminal justice system. The problem is that someone is killing violets, and is smart enough to never let his or her face be seen, so the victims aren't able to identify the killer any more than the police can. Enter Dan Atwater, FBI agent who's both trying to track down the killer and protect Natalie Lindstrom, a violet that the FBI believes is on the list of targets thanks to her closeness to a number of the existing victims.<br /><br />It shouldn't surprise anyone that when you've got a male and female lead who are pushed together in a book that you're going to have a romantic subplot. This is one of the book's problems; Woodworth attempts early on to show Dan as being uncomfortable around violets, but never gives us enough of this aspect of Dan's personality that the reader is going to buy it. When the inevitable happens, we wonder why it's in there in the first place. (Insert much hypothesizing here about the book's underlying message about racism, which I'm sure is intended, but Dan's attitude at the beginning of the book is one of the few places it seems to be, and there's not enough detail in the book to support interpreting in that way.)<br /><br />That, however, is one of the book's only problems. When Woodworth stops trying to make his characters uncomfortable, and gets them working on figuring out who the killer is, Through Violet Eyes becomes quite a fine little mystery. It's genre thriller stuff, to be sure, but it's very good genre thriller stuff. Woodworth keeps the pages turning at the proper pace, and by the time you're halfway through, you'll find yourself wanting to stay up long enough to finish just one more chapter before you go to bed. It never gets to \\"you find yourself still reading at six in the morning,\\" but it's pretty close. Definitely recommended. *** ½racters uncomfortable, and gets them working on figuring out who the killer is, Through Violet Eyes becomes quite a fine little mystery.

Elizabeth Willis, Second Law (Avenue B, 1993)<br /><br />Sometimes it seems like tracking down books by certain authors could become a life's work. I finally managed to lay hands on the last Elizabeth Willis book of which I'm aware, Second Law, last week. Unlike her other collections, Second Law is a single long poem, split into five sections and an envoi (actually, this is debatable, as the second portion of the book is entitled \\"Second Law,\\" while the others remain without title). While it doesn't have the punch of Turneresque, Second Law is a wonderful thing in itself. Willis manages to use L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E conventions in subversive ways, keeping the oddness without letting it divert from what's going on in the poem itself. Her language, as always, is pointed, precise, and evocative.<br /><br />It's somewhat difficult to build a library of Liz Willis' books, but it should be the goal of anyone interested in the many different and wonderful things language can do. *** ½	2005-02-21

Charles Bukowski, If We Take-- (Black Sparrow, 1970)<br /><br />If We Take-- was one of the celebrated New Year's Greeting cards sent by Black Sparrow to friends, intimates, and those willing to pay an obscene amount of money for very little material. This one, an edition of four hundred copies, contains a single Bukowski poem. A quick trip to bookfinder.com shows that it's going for between $75 and $100 these days, or well over ten dollars a page. (There were another two hundred issued in 1994 to commemorate Buk's death. Don't bother, they're going for the same price.) While it's questionable whether any poetry is worth more than ten bucks a page, \\"If We Take--\\" is one of Buk's finer achievements. He both keeps the language at the \\"elevated\\" level definitions of poetry call for and, as a bonus, sticks pretty close to the image, as much of his best material does. As well, unlike most Buk poetry, this is (obviously) a very small dose, so the reader isn't confronted with four hundred plus pages of Bukowski.

Lemony Snicket, The Miserable Mill (Scholastic, 2000)<br /><br />The Baudelaire orphans continue their travails in The Miserable Mill, book four in the seemingly unending Series of Unfortunate Events from Lemony Snicket. In this episode, the orphans are sent to Paltrytown, a small place in the middle of nowhere sustained by a large lumber mill, of whose boss the children are to be put in the care. All well and good, except that the boss and the foreman both expect them to work in the mill (over the protestations of the boss' partner Charles, a very nice, if ineffectual, man). Needless to say, Count Olaf is lurking in the wings, and even when Olaf isn't doing his thing, life is not very nice for the Baudelaire orphans... not very nice at all.<br /><br />The Wide Window was something of a disappointment from the Snicket camp, and it's quite refreshing to see that The Miserable Mill shows a return to form. The book feels far less episodic throughout than did The Wide Window (though, obviously, pieces of it still feel that way), and Snicket, seemingly bored with the formula (or assuming the readers would be), mixes things up a bit in order to keep them interesting. And keep them interesting he does. (He also indirectly answers a question I've had in the back of my mind since the beginning: \\"is Sunny actually speaking a language?\\")<br /><br />Very nice, and makes me look forward to book five. *** ½	2005-02-15

Fred S. Buck, Horse Race Betting (revised edition) (Arco, 1971)<br /><br />First off, this book is not about horse racing, except in the general sense. There are some nifty pictures of horse races. But what this book is about is money, and specifically the history of how money has been taken at the races, as well as new (at the time) developments in the field of how cashiers take that money. Which sounds, on its face, like an incredibly boring book. Let me add to this, to stack the deck even more, that Buck's tome is thick with mathematical proofs. How could such a book be fascinating?<br /><br />Yet it is. Buck's overview of the history involved and his descriptions of machinery of various sorts, along with the calculations used by the humans in the back to check the accuracy of the machines, makes for very interesting reading. How this is, I've no idea. But I certainly cannot deny that it works. The book, originally written in 1946, was updated by Buck in 1971 with various developments that had taken place between the two times; one wishes Buck (assuming he is still alive today, which is possible, but not very likely) would release a third edition covering the changes since 1971, which have been massive.<br /><br />The book's one major failing is its last section, on the growth of harness racing. It is of a completely different tone than the rest of the book, focusing not on the mechanical aspects of what goes on behind the scenes, but a publicity brochure for the United States Trotting Association (if they haven't quoted it frequently and at length, they have missed out on an enormous publicity opportunity). Coming after all the wonderful mechanical stuff, it jars, and its constant tone of upbeat insistence gets very tiring after very few pages. The last section turns what would have otherwise been a four-and-a-half star review down a bit, but the rest of it is still very highly recommended. Check this one out, even if you've no interest at all in horse racing. *** ½ing. *** 	2005-02-15

Guillaume Apollinaire, The Self-Dismembered Man (Wesleyan, 2004)<br /><br />This selection of Apollinaire's war poems, translated by Donald Revell, is not the \\"first substantial translation\\" the jacket claims (both the Selected Poems and Michael Benedikt's must-have collection The Poetry of Surrealism contain extensive selections from the same time-period), but it certainly is a substantial work, and one that everyone who claims to be a fan of surrealism needs to read, and pronto. Revell's translations have an almost singular ability to keep Apollinaire's subtle wit intact, and his word choices often allow a number of different interpretations to come through. Not to say that some of Revell's word choices emphasize certain interpretations; there's no way to avoid this when translating poetry. Still, he seems to have made a conscious effort to be as ambiguous as Apollinaire wherever possible, which is a wonderful thing.<br /><br />The only slipping point is the final poem, \\"La Jolie Rousse,\\" but then I've had problems with every translation of \\"La Jolie Rousse\\" since Hamburger's a quarter of a century ago, so my thoughts aren't to be trusted on that one.<br /><br />Very good stuff, well worth picking up. ****	2005-02-15

Suehiro Maruo, Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show (Blast, 1992)<br /><br />Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show was the first of Suehiro Maruo's manga to be translated into English, and it's pretty easy to see why he developed a cult following among extreme horror fans almost overnight. From the opening panels of this twisted, disturbing graphic novel, Maruo is going to go for the gut. You're probably going to like it for the images alone. Which is good, because the story is told in impressionist form, to the point of losing a good deal of the story (an old folk tale about a girl tricked into becoming the slave of a sideshow) in the process. Granted, some of that could be happening in the translation, but I doubt it; pages of panels would have to be intercut for a truly faithful retelling of the folk tale.<br /><br />Still, it's a very pretty thing, as long as extreme gore fits your definition of pretty. *** ½	2005-02-15

John Russo, Hell's Creation (Ravenmor, 1995)<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of John Russo's novels from the first time I picked one up (it was The Majorettes, and that was more than a quarter of a century ago now), and for quite a while there I had a complete collection of John Russo novels. Then came 1995, and Russo released Hell's Creation, a new novel on Ravenmor that coincided with their reprinting of all his earlier novels. I went on, blissfully unaware, until about a year ago, then discovered this gaping hole in my collection. I finally filled that hole last week, and needless to say, I sat down and devoured Hell's Creation pronto.<br /><br />There are two possible things I can say about Hell's Creation. One is that it's kind of obvious why Pocket never printed this book, and the other is \\"man, were John Russo's novels always this cheesy?\\" Yeah, they were, but not in quite as bad a way as this. Oh, not to say Hell's Creation is unreadable; nothing of the sort. (Do yourself a favor, though, and ignore the blurb on the back cover, which talks about events in the last hundred pages; you'll be quite confused if you expect to find the events mentioned on the back cover near the beginning of the book.) It's got the same basic goofiness, softcore-porn mentality, and out-and-out fun with violence as do Russo's other novels. But there's something missing here. I can't quite put my finger on what it is. But the almost Spillane-esque writing from such earlier novels as Bloodsisters and Black Cat has changed into something that feels more hackneyed than hacked up.<br /><br />John Russo was one of the best of the eighties-horror novelists (and well ahead of his time; Russo's first novel was the classic 1967 Night of the Living Dead), and if you're a fan of the genre, you should be doing whatever you need to do, and paying whatever prices you need to pay, to grab everything the man wrote up through the late eighties. Hell's Creation should eventually find its way into your collection, but don't make it a priority; spend the cash on the limited-edition Imagine Books hardback of Voodoo Dawn instead. Newbies to Russo should definitely stay away; any of the books I've already mentioned in this review would be a fantastic way to start with John Russo, and all are highly recommended. ** ½to your collection, but don't make it a priority; spend the cash on the limited-edition Imagine Books hardback of Voodoo Dawn instead.

Kiernan, The Dry Salvages (Subterranean, 2004)<br /><br />There's something utterly cool about a book whose back jacket lists the author's last publication as a huge unpronounceable stream of words published in an obscure archaeological journal (well, obscure to everyone save archaeologists). Especially when the book you're holding will not be filled with the same types of unpronounceable words. Such is the case with The Dry Salvages, a short sci-fi novel from the always-fine pen of Cait Kiernan. The setting is Piros, a small red moon orbiting a gas giant in another galaxy. The players are four scientists and an unknown number of artificial persons headed to Piros to work with a bunch that's already there. The plot is... hmm. Well, basically nonexistent. This is a character study about the interactions of four people with themselves and others, told by one of them many years after the events in question.<br /><br />After watching the flood of negative reviews come in for the last book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series, I can see a lot of people hating the way this novel ends. I, personally, thought it was the bees' knees. Your mileage may (and likely will) vary. Can't say more than that for fear of spoilage.<br /><br />Kiernan hasn't yet writ the book not worth reading. This one is another fine addition to the library. *** ½	2005-02-15

Liz Waldner, A Point Is That Which Has No Part (University of Iowa, 2000)<br /><br />After my last jaunt into the land of Liz Waldner, I was looking her work up on the Internet to research the review, and most of what I was finding on line seemed quite superior to the work in the volume I'd just completed. So I gave her another shot, and what came out of the library system's game of chance was this collection of prose with a few poems scattered through. While much of the work turns on the same punning as that in Etym(bi)ology, there are points in the book where it all comes together, and what you get is the subtle wit of Shakespeare rather than the meat-cleaver punning of a tabloid headline writer. While those points are few and far between, their sublimity is not to be missed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, much of the rest has the same feel as did the newer collection; while the overtly political aspect that made Etym(bi)ology so noxious is mostly absent here (Waldner concerns herself more with the politics of interpersonal relationships), the stream-of-consciousness feel that simultaneously says \\"this poet has never revised a poem in her life\\" and \\"this is performance art/slam work, not poetry\\" is still all too much in evidence. I have little doubt these pieces perform admirably at readings, but on the page, they often read as strings of disconnected thoughts begging for being shaped into poems. **	2005-02-15

I've yet to find an entry that disappoints, and Leonard Kress' Orphics continues the trend. Short, sweet, and filled with, not surprisingly, orphics, all of which revolve around, not surprisingly, Orpheus. (He does attempt a pindaric at one point, and succeeds rather well, for being Orpheus and not Pindar.)<br /><br />Kress takes the point of view of Orpheus transported to modern America, and achieves the expected mix of the modern and archaic in doing so, along with a subtle, understated \\"what changes time hath wrought\\" feel that runs through the short series of poems. The language is quite nicely done; it's more form than author wordiness that allows the critic to say the work could use a little tightening.<br /><br />\\"Here among the just-shorn lambs, helpless,<br /><br />pathetic and shy, I bask on a cool creek rock,<br /><br />uncoiled like a snake, straight as a crook<br /><br />some shirtless sheepfoul boy might misplace...\\"<br /><br />(--\\"An Orphic Version of the Pastoral\\")<br /><br />Like all the other books in the Witt series I've reviewed to date, Orphics is worth picking up (or at least a look-through at the library, if the idea of spending six bucks on a twenty-four page book makes you wince). *** ½	2005-02-07

Terry Goodkind, Chainfire (Tor, 2005)<br /><br />It will be, as I am writing this, three years tomorrow since I opened the cover of Wizard's First Rule. I know some people who have been with the series since the day the first book came out (we're going on eleven years now). Given how I feel, having finished this, I can't imagine what they're thinking.<br /><br />Chainfire is the ninth book in the Sword of Truth series, and (supposedly) the first book in the final trilogy. While the idea that opens the book is unabashedly brilliant, it seems obvious from the presentation that neither Mr. Goodkind nor Tor wants to do anything but get this series over with. The good news is that that probably means we'll get books ten and eleven relatively quickly. The bad news is, we can probably expect the same drop in quality we saw in the last two books.<br /><br />Goodkind has finally changed the way he works the endless amounts of rehash, but he has done it in the worst way possible; rather than giving us a hundred fifty pages of rehash, it's now scattered throughout the novel, almost to the point where it feels like the novel is taking place in two different timeframes, and you've already read one of them. Add onto this that the series, whose preachiness took a jump in the previous book, takes another, larger jump here. Goodkind spent seven books quite nicely showing and not telling, but in the past twelve hundred odd pages of this series, we've had far too much speechifying for novels. It needs to go away.<br /><br />That's Goodkind's side of the letdown. Tor's is the incredible number of typos to be found here. The series has never been exactly pristine in proofreading, but the work that was done here is truly pathetic. Hundreds of typos got through. Someone at Tor really needs to be fired over this.<br /><br />Probably the only thing that kept me turning pages, aside from the fact that I've already logged three years with Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd, is that Goodkind really did come up with a great twist to kick off the final trilogy. Richard awakes after a random battle (truly random; one of the men stumbled, almost literally, upon one of Jagang's scouting parties) and a very nasty healing process to find that Kahlan is missing and, what's more, no one around him remembers her existence. Goodkind toys with this idea quite nicely throughout the novel (when he's not rehashing stuff we already know; unfortunately, this device does allow him to do a lot more of that), taking It's a Wonderful Life and putting a much darker and more wide-ranging spin on it. If Goodkind can keep up the originality, he'll at least keep me for the last two novels in the series. If he can pull himself back to the incredible ability he showed in the series' first four volumes, he might also manage to pick up a whole lot of new converts.<br /><br />Fans of the series may want to skim books eight and nine, and spend the next year with me fervently hoping that books ten and eleven improve on them. ** ½really did come up with a great twist to kick off the final trilogy.

Lemony Snicket, The Wide Window (Scholastic, 2000)<br /><br />It's somewhat hard to find something new to say about the Series of Unfortunate Events books, which have stirred up all sorts of hornets' nests over the past five years. The Baudelaire children have gnashed their way into the hearts and minds of countless thousands of youths (and adults) worldwide, so much so that the franchise has now spawned a Jim Carrey film, and reflecting on that popularity is the stuff of a few reviews, but not enough for the whole series. In this episode, the Baudelaire orphans are sent to live with their overly cautious Aunt Josephine in a rickety house well above Lake Lachrymose. Josephine is a grammar nut (one thinks that had this book been written a couple of years later in the series, Josephine would have got on quite well with Lynne Truss, had the two chanced to meet) who is afraid of everything from the kitchen stove to realtors. (As a sidelight, Mr. Snicket is demonstrably wrong about one thing in this novel; it is eminently reasonable to have a fear of realtors.) Count Olaf, of course, is not far behind.<br /><br />Of the three I've read so far (I'm going in order), this has seemed the weakest of the three. The series, being as it is a one-trick pony, is necessarily episodic; this book seemed to emphasize the point a bit much. Still, it's a fun read in the same vein as the previous books, and if you liked the first two, you're probably going to find you feel the same about this one. *** ½	2005-02-07

Liz Waldner, Etym(bi)ology (Omnidawn, 2002)<br /><br />There are some books that just make you want to tear the eyes from your head, roast them with red peppers, and serve the whole mess up to your unsuspecting dinner party guests, because what will ultimately happen to them is better than turning even one more page in such a book. Etym(bi)ology is one of those books. It is, at times, physically painful to read, and yet you find yourself completely unable to stop, locked in the hope that if you turn the next page, you'll find something slightly more readable.<br /><br />Waldner lets this hope live in you by name-dropping. It's quite obvious that she's read the greats, and will take as many opportunities as possible to let know know she's read them, both by dropping epigrams in here and there and by simply mentioning them. What Waldner utterly fails to have done, it seems, is to recognize what makes the greats great and assimilate any of it at all into her own work, which alternately takes the form of unpoetic political screed, unpoetic L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E work, and unpoetic boring prose chopped up into little lines to make it look more artistic.<br /><br />\\"Ok, ok, I ask you. Is it not like the streets? If more women went out at night, it would be safer for women to go out at night. (If no men went out at night, it would be safer for women to go out at night.

(If no one were deciding the value of your being based on the size of your breasts, it would be safer for women to go out at night.)\\"<br /><br />(--\\"Etym(bi)ology\\")<br /><br />I'm sure Catherine MacKinnon beamed as she read this. No poet, however, should even think of doing the same.<br /><br />When that's a piece of the first so-called poem you read, it can't get any worse, right?

Cindy Glander, Worm (iUniverse, 2004)<br /><br />While plagued with the usual typos one expects from an iUniverse release, and something of an overenthusiastic back-cover blurb writer (also typical of iUniverse), there's a lot to be liked in this little tale of a New England serial killer. The young Worm, a typical social outcast (there are a few at every school), grows up transformed by a stint in the army into a devoted police officer, befriended by his partner, Hank. Hank's best friend Sam had died as the victim of a random crime, and Hank promised to keep watch over Sam's son Maggie as the man died. Maggie took over Sam's pet store after Sam's death, and now Maggie is torn between an attraction for Jake and one for Frank, part-timer at the pet store who also works at the hardware store down the street. Amidst all this, Hank and Jake are tracking a serial killer in New Milford, Connecticut.<br /><br />Yep, a serial killer in Connecticut, and one whose motives are (to say the least) deeply odd, seeming almost random at the beginning of the story. This adds to the confusion at the beginning, of which there is a great deal. Once you've gotten to the point where you know the characters, however, things progress more smoothly. The mystery angle here is pretty stock stuff, as is the romance angle, and both get relatively predictable about halfway through the book. The pleasure in Worm, however, is seeing how the late Glander gets from the point where you realize who the killer is and who Maggie will end up in love with to getting to the actual scenes, and what sorts of obstacles will get thrown in everyone's way while getting from point A to point B.<br /><br />Worm isn't likely to grab you by the throat and proclaim itself the best mystery you've ever come across, but it's certainly good reading for those times when you're in need of a good, predictable genre piece that'll keep you turning the pages. ***	2005-02-04

Laine, The Weight of Dust (iUniverse, 2003)<br /><br />Laine, co-editor of the fantastic magazine Erosha, exposes her second volume to the world, if you'll pardon the pun. The Weight of Dust is another slight book that, while inconsistent, does know how to pack a punch.<br /><br />Laine has something that very few poets do (and in the greater scheme of things, looking at ratios, fewer and fewer poets have it every year): an almost innate ability to find the proper sounds to put together to make words come out in the best possible ways to give the reader pleasure. It is very rare, aurally, that any word on any poem in this collection is out of place. These are words that sing, cry, and take the reader to another place.<br /><br />Which is where the book's weak spot comes into play. Too often Laine loses her sense of image, concerned more with telling the story than letting the reader see the story. Coupled with this is a disturbing tendency to add a few \\"the moral of the story is...\\" lines at the end of some poems that kills any power they had:<br /><br />\\"Each time I went there,<br /><br />I slept on a foldout sofa<br /><br />in a room full of his books.<br /><br />He had no education<br /><br />but gathered knowledge<br /><br />and kept it on shelves.<br /><br />He is gone now--<br /><br />I saved him in those pages.\\"<br /><br />(\\"Inheriting Books\\")<br /><br />This would normally make for a \\"throw it to the dustbunnies and move on\\" kind of experience, but there are too many places in this collection where Laine shows a real eye for observation, and an ability to translate observation to the page. It shouldn't surprise the astute poetry reader that the book's section of haiku is where this manifests itself strongly, and as a result it's the book's strongest point.<br /><br />\\"The trees were crooked<br /><br />like old bones, under the weight<br /><br />of cloud-cover clothes\\"<br /><br />It took me a while to decide whether I liked this book enough to give it an above-average review, and what finally convinced me was the speed with which I finished it; Laine kept the pages turning well enough, and there are enough snatches of brilliance to be found in these lines, to give it a recommendation. Not the best book of poetry to cross my desk so far this year, but worth your time. ***, and what finally convinced me was the speed with which I finished it; Laine kept the pages turning well enough, and there are enough snatches of brilliance to be found in these lines, to give it a recommendation.

Stan Brown et al., Bertrem's Guide to the War of Souls, vol. 2 (Wizards of the Coast, 2002)<br /><br />I came to read this book before the actual War of Souls trilogy thanks to my library. They had the book listed in the catalog as just Dragonlance, rather than by its actual title, and I was intrigued. So I put it on hold, and this is what ended up on my desk.<br /><br />Needless to say, a person who has read the War of Souls trilogy is likely to get far more out of this than I did; the characters will likely be more familiar, and the situations in which said characters find themselves will probably have more meaning. So I can't really speak to how good the book is on that level; all I can talk about is the quality of writing.<br /><br />It really only flags that greatly in one place, but unfortunately, that one place is in the book's longest piece, an almost-seventy-page monster by Stan Brown whose unfortunate placing very early in the book causes it to drag early on. Brown's other monstrous piece in here (weighing in at over forty pages) goes more quickly. Don Perrin and Mary H. Herbert, the other two contributors, are time-tested and goat-approved Dragonlance writers, and you can be generally assured when you pick anything up from either, you're going to get a good story. (One of Herbert's, \\"Mirage,\\" will bring home the \\"you'll get more out of it if you've read the War of Souls trilogy\\" angle better than anything else in the book.)<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but read the War of Souls books first, and skim Stan Brown's first story. ** ½	2005-01-31

Nothing, however, could be further from the truth; Sinatra's book is almost impressionist in its approach, preferring to (almost) completely ignore the numbers in favor of the overall impressions one should be forming when handicapping any given race. It's an interesting approach to writing a handicapping manual, and certainly one that deserves more shelf space than it normally gets (the only other author I'm familiar with who writes in such a way that puts out anything worth reading is Mark Cramer; I thought of The Fast Track to Thoroughbred Profits more than once while reading this).<br /><br />As (I am finding more frequently as time goes on) is seemingly common with smaller-press books, various spelling and grammatical errors abound, so if that sort of thing bugs you, be prepared.

He has races named after him, he picked more winners in more races than anyone else in newspaper handicapping (then or now), and he got prices. Fans clamored for a book for years, and in 1945, they got one. Fresh off picking Pensive in the 1944 Kentucky Derby, Newborn released his first bits of wisdom to the public.<br /><br />These days, after almost sixty years, Newborn's words will be old hat to most horseplayers. But at the time, much of what is here must have come as nothing short of heretical. I've read handicapping literature going back to the turn of the century, and Newborn is the first writer I've come across, chronologically, to completely discount weight as a handicapping factor. (Some books, and many systems, still use it. That alone will tell you they're worthless.)  He mentions the idea of track variants, in passing, thirty years before Andrew Beyer came up with a practical method of computing track variants in Picking Winners. He talks about recent and less recent form, layoff horses and trainers, and many other things no one had thought to address before. Most have since been mistakenly credited to Tom Ainslie's far more popular books, but Newborn got there first by twenty-three years.<br /><br />Common Sense at the Races is a fantastic piece of work. Hopefully, over time, Newborn will come to receive the fame he justly deserves in the racing world outside the Midwest. Unfortunately, Helpful Hints for Horseplayers is less worthwhile once you've read Common Sense at the Races; Helpful Hints for Horseplayers is really nothing more than a revised and slightly expanded edition of Common Sense at the Races. (He alludes to the fact that the expanded work came from his second book, published in the interim, which I have yet to track down.) There is good information there, but anyone who's read Common Sense at the Races will have seen a whole lot of it before.<br /><br />Common Sense at the Races: *** ½<br /><br />Helpful Hints for Horseplayers: **e fact that the expanded work came from his second book, published in the interim, which I have yet to track down.)

Perry Lefko, Thoroughbred Racing's Greatest Day (Taylor, 2003)<br /><br />First, be advised: this is not a new book. If you've read Lefko's The Greatest Show on Turf, this is a revised and updated edition to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the first running of the Breeders' Cup. I hadn't read the book the first time around, so I can't compare the two, but take note if you have.<br /><br />They changed the title, but didn't really make it any clearer: Thoroughbred Racing's Greatest Day is about the Breeders' Cup. Non-fans are more likely to think it has something o do with the Kentucky Derby. Hardcore fans will think any of a hundred days (the Dubai World Cup? Grand National? Melbourne Cup, a national holiday in Australia?), the Breeders' Cup being one of them. The last group are right. Various and sundry stories about specific Breeders' Cup days, specific Breeders' Cup horses or families of horses, owners, trainers, Lefko pretty much covers the gamut of stories here.<br /><br />It will do the reader well to remember that Perry Lefko is a journalist. He is also unaware that a book-length piece requires a different writing style than a newspaper article. It is best to treat this book as a series of very long newspaper articles; it'll help you get through it quite well. If that were the book's only problem, I'd probably give it an above-average rating and move on. However, the book has a number of errors that it's hard to believe any horse fan would make (most notably, the sporadic misspelling of the names of champion horses, like 1998 Breeders' Cup Distaff winner Escena). While I tried not to let it affect my judgment, Lefko, like most of the rest of the media, is obsessed with the Most Overhyped Event in American History(TM), and in any passage of the book dealing with the 2001 or 2002 Breeders' Cup, there will be far more mention of 9/11 than could possibly be warranted.<br /><br />Recommended only for already-established racing fans. The rest of you would do far better to start off with something better-written (unfortunately, I'm not familiar with anything focusing specifically on the Breeders' Cup in book form that's better-written); William Murray's The Wrong Horse is a lovely introduction to the world of Thoroughbred racing, as is Bill Barich's classic combination of novel and memoir Laughing in the Hills. ** ½u would do far better to start off with something better-written (unfortunately, I'm not familiar with anything focusing specifically on the Breeders' Cup in book form that's better-written); William Murray's The Wrong Horse is a lovely introduction to the world of Thoroughbred racing, as is Bill Barich's classic combination of novel and memoir Laughing in the Hills. ** 	2005-01-28

Hans Habe, Off Limits (Crest, 1957)<br /><br />A review on the front cover of this turkey calls it \\"the finest novel yet released about the American occupation.\\" If that's the case, people were writing some serious drivel after World War II. There's not a single word anywhere in this book that conveys anything other than Habe's utter boredom with his subject. Two-dimensional characters, both American and German, move through occupied Berlin just after the war, trying desperately to give their lives meaning. They fail just as much as Habe does in trying desperately to give the reader any interest.<br /><br />Thankfully, Gunter Grass came along to write much better stuff about occupied Berlin a couple of years later, and this faded into well-deserved obscurity.

Clayton Eshleman, The Aranea Constellation (Rain Taxi, 1998)<br /><br />Clayton Eshleman has been working on a very large project for very many years dealing with his favorite subject, cave paintings. He weaves into it literary criticism and personal reminiscence. The Aranea Constellation, a 1998 chapbook from the press arm of the Rain Taxi Review of Books, which is rapidly becoming a major force in the world of poetry chapbooks. (The magazine's pretty cool, too.)<br /><br />As with most large, multi-volume pieces of criticism that take decades to write, one can expect a good deal of disjointedness in the writing. The Aranea Constellation is set up almost like a journal, with reminiscences about Eshleman drinking with Joanne Kyger in 1963 butting up against pieces about Theseus going into the maze to kill the Minotaur (and how the story symbolizes the attempt of man to conquer his own bestial nature) to reflective pieces about a red spider that used to live in Eshleman's backyard to, of course, cave paintings and speculations about ancient rites of initiation.<br /><br />Eshleman's prose style, like his poetic style, is brilliant, and that combined with the brevity of this chapbook make it a stronger thing that it would otherwise be. One can revel in the language Eshleman uses and simply enjoy the little snatches, or one can delve into the heart of the thing and take a good look at how it all connects. (This is not surprising; it's a more lucid prose form of surrealism, that lovely poetic subgenre which for many years Eshleman has been the only practitioner of worth reading.) One surmises that were the whole four hundred pages of this fragmentary manuscript published all at one, it might well wear thin; twenty-four pages of it, however, is a joy. *** ½	2005-01-28

Hayden Carruth, North Winter (1964, The Prairie Press)<br /><br />North Winter, a long poem in fifty-seven parts and a poetic afterward, is something of an unexpected delight in the Carruth corpus. One assumes one is going to get the usual nature poetry, and for the most part one does. But something always seems a little off in this one. It is. But figuring out what it is is impossible until Carruth broadsides you at the closing of the postscript (at which point it all makes sense).<br /><br />There's no real use in pontificating on the poetic merit; this is Hayden Carruth. The poetic merit is unquestionable. In the fifty-seven small pieces that make up the whole, Carruth veers from formal poetry to calligrammes to free verse and just about everywhere in between. Might as well just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />\\"The dog flies with his ears<br /><br />across the snow carrying a<br /><br />deer's legbone in his jaws<br /><br />the bone flops threejointedly<br /><br />and the little hoof dances<br /><br />delicately in the snow.\\" (--\\"21\\")<br /><br />If anything, it could probably have been distilled a little better.

Donald Jones, Medical Aid and Other Poems (University of Nebraska Press, 1967)<br /><br />Amusing note: the book is actually, unlike most books whose titles are structures thus, into two parts: the longpoem/short collection \\"Medical Aid\\" and \\"Other Poems.\\" I found it worth remarking on, if only because it is rare (and offers the reader a chance to think about why so few other books do this).<br /><br />I don't really know what to say about Medical Aid and Other Poems. The book was rather inconsistent; some pieces truly shone, while others just sat there looking dull. But I have praised other books with this trait before. The poetry itself is solid, which given the year of release of this book is actually rather astounding; the late sixties turned out a thousand Jim Morrisons or Hugh Prathers for every Richard Howard, and Jones is most certainly in the latter camp. Rare is the time Jones lets the message overtake the medium, similarly rare in a book of poems that's so laced through with sociopolitical activism.<br /><br />So why is this book not getting four, four and a half, five stars?<br /><br />I have been mulling this question over for three and a half weeks now, trying to find an answer. And the simple truth of it is that I don't have one. There is no good reason why this book, so solid in its construction and at times so delicate in its art, should have left me flat. But for some reason, that is exactly what happened with it. Not to say it isn't worth reading. It most certainly is. But it seems that it is as forgettable, as unremarkable, as it is readable.

Lois Lowry, Messenger (Walter Lorraine Books, 2004)<br /><br />Lois Lowry has been around for a while, but she started making noise, and finally started getting the recognition she deserved, with 1993's The Giver. The Giver has since blossomed into a trilogy, of which Messenger is the third part. While Messenger is not the tour de force that The Giver was, it's still well worth your time. Many reviews, especially those that found the book lacking, have compared it to The Giver. I found it more amusing (and ultimately more satisfying) to compare the book to M. Night Shyamalan's recent film The Village, with which it shares both a number of characteristics and a number of major thematic elements. In comparison, the novel shines.<br /><br />Matty is a message runner in Village, a small, well, village cut off from the rest of the world by a thick, and intelligent, forest. Matty is the only person from Village capable of traveling through forest at will, which makes him incredibly valuable. Something happens to Village, though; a person known as the Trade Master begins to visit on a regular basis, and as they visit him, people begin to change, gradually. Matty, is adoptive father Seer, and the village's leader (Leader, of course) see what's going on, but are unsure how to stop it.<br /><br />The main problem with the book is that Matty is incapable of seeing a number of things that are right in front of his eyes, the seeing of any (much less all) of which would have helped the book along considerably. This makes it seem unnecessarily convoluted at times. Also, as a consequence of this, the end is clearly visible halfway or less through the book, and what should have come off quite nicely ends up sounding somewhat bombastic.<br /><br />All of which sounds like reasons not to read the book, but Lowry's style and storytelling ability do keep the pages turning, and Messenger is certainly well worth your time if you liked The Giver.

Benjamin Alire Saenz, Elegies in Blue (Cinco Puntos Press, 2002)<br /><br />I don't want to simply call Benjamin Alire Saenz' Elegies in Blue a bad book and leave it at that. Thankfully, Saenz himself provides me all the ammunition I need to back the claim up in the last piece in this book, an article he wrote a few years back called \\"Notes from the City in Which I Live: Poetry and the Political Imagination.\\" In it, Saenz spends a good deal of its twenty pages putting politics and poetry at opposites, offering up an apologia for why he writes political poetry. The end result boils down to \\"if Harold Bloom thinks it's bad, all the more reason for me to do it.\\" Which is all well and good, if it's done well. There are a handful of poets who work in the political arena whose work is consistently good (Carolyn Forche is the first who comes to mind). Benjamin Saenz is not one of them.<br /><br />Ironically, the best poem in this book, though its epigraph is something of an absurdity, does lead one to think that perhaps Saenz did take this verbatim from someone else; \\"Maria de Guadalupe Cenizeros, citizen of Smeltertown, sings a lullaby explaining the color of the headstone on her grave.\\" Saenz' voice here, be it fictional or no, grasps everything necessary to write a good poem, and does so. With the exception of the refrain of \\"I loved\\" at the beginning of each sentence, the poem stays completely rooted in the image, without delving too far into the metaphors Saenz seems to so roundly despise from the text of \\"Notes from the City in Which I Live.\\" This poem (which is entitled, I should mention, \\"The Blue I Loved\\") is a prime example of how to write poetry with a message and make it stick. Unfortunately, it seems as if Saenz didn't grasp that, and much of the rest of the work here founders in the vagueness and judgment-words that should be excised from the vocabularies of any poet, professional or inspired amateur, by the time he first publishes:<br /><br />...And anyway, who taught you how to spell<br /><br />The word injustice? People hate it when you use<br /><br />A word like that. Such a big word, Cesar.<br /><br />Too big for you....\\" (\\"What Was It All For, Anyway, Cesar, Cesar Chavez?\\")<br /><br />Saenz begins the closing of \\"Notes form the City in Which I Live\\" with the sentences \\"I am a writer. Somehow, by some great miracle, I have become a possessor of the word.\\" What we can gather Saenz does not understand is that anyone can be a writer. What not everyone can do is write well. Such is the case here. **nyway, who taught you how to spell <br />The word injustice? People hate it when you use <br />A word like that.

Repeatedly, they have shown me that such is not the case, but my mind still works that way for reasons unknown. Case in point: the 2004 entry in the Wick Chapbook Series, Philip Metres' Primer for Non-Native Speakers, which is all about English and Russian and America and Russia and is, in general, very good stuff (one piece here was in The Best American Poetry 2002, and deserved to be). Its main problem is that, well, there's not enough of it. When you're finished with the spare volume that is Primer for Non-Native Speakers, you're left wanting more of the work of Philip Meteres.<br /><br />\\"Let me introduce myself.<br /><br />I feel sick.<br /><br />How much must I pay<br /><br />For excess baggage?\\" (\\"Primer for Non-Native Speakers\\")<br /><br />Behind us: train tracks, our own crooked wake.<br /><br />We pull our shins again through the blank drifts<br /><br />of blued snow, so deep only tanks could wade<br /><br />and forget.

Not to say that the book overall is not good; it is. It's very good. But Hu starts off with such a strong piece that some of what comes after is anticlimactic. This is not really his, or anyone's, fault, and it doesn't make the book any less worth reading. There is a great deal to like here, and I recommend this book as highly as I've recommended anything that hasn't gotten five stars in the past few years from me.

Mad Ship continues the development of the characters found in Ship of Magic, bringing some of the book's minor characters to the forefront. While this, like the previous book, is an ensemble piece, the book focuses on the liveship Paragon, beached and abandoned by his family for the past thirty years. Of course, \\"focuses\\" is something of a stretch in a piece of this magnitude; there is much to be kept track of with Kennit, Wintrow, Althea, Brashen, Malta and her competing suitors, and the rest of the storylines. That Hobb can keep it all up in the air without dropping anything is quite a feat.<br /><br />If there is a weak spot in the novel, it's in the development of Malta Vestrit. Her character's development may be shown as plainly as that of any other character in the novel (for all of them develop and change over time), but for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, Malta's changes ring false at times, as if they're too facile. Still, that's a very small number of pages in such a tome, and it definitely shouldn't put you off reading this.<br /><br />Hobb is rapidly developing into one of today's finer fantasy authors.

Ira Sadoff, Barter (University of Illinois Press, 2003)<br /><br />Few things make my heart leap like the prospect of a new, unread book of poetry by Ira Sadoff, one of the best poets presently working in America. The only problem is that I tend to read them all too quickly, and am then stuck waiting for another two or three years until Sadoff releases his next book.<br /><br />Barter fits all those angles exactly. It's a book that begs to be consumed in one sitting, despite the reader's knowledge that it's going to be a while before you get any more. From the very first poem, Sadoff lets you know he's going to be breaking every conventional rule, and doing it in such a way that you can't help but be awed:<br /><br />\\"Nevertheless, I want to talk about it. Those scarred bodies<br /><br />on the hospital table, they're white chalk children use<br /><br />to deface the sidewalk. The deer fed in the gazebo,<br /><br />where the salt lick was barely safe from the fox.\\" (\\"The Soul\\")<br /><br />Not only does the man use \\"soul,\\" the most overused word in poetry, in a poem, he uses it as the title. And despite its subject matter, the poem still comes off as brilliant, original, a combination of the nature poetry of Hayden Carruth and the language poetry of John Ashbery, but with Sadoff's distinctive, authoritative voice.<br /><br />This is what poetry is supposed to be. A while ago, I proposed (in a review of Clay Eshleman's delicious Hotel Cro-Magnon) changing the canon that gets taught in schools to something that kids will actually like.

Diane Bataille, The Whip Angels (Creation, 1955)<br /><br />The Whip Angels, published anonymously in Paris in the fifties, has been widely attributed to Diane Bataille, wife of Georges, the influential philosopher and pornographer responsible for Story of the Eye. If The Whip Angels is truly Diane Bataille's work, it's quite obvious that her husband had not a thing to do with it.<br /><br />The Whip Angels is painfully episodic, written in the \\"diary of a young girl\\" style so popular in pornography from the Victorian era down through today. The diary style of pornography blends the worst attributes of the style of H. P. Lovecraft (The Whip Angels never goes quite as far as to have its protagonist leave off in the middle of a sentence with an AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!, but you get the idea) with the type of photographic-memory writing that has never made sense, especially when used in describing trauma (which is exactly what's going on here).<br /><br />Our protagonist is Victoria, the setting an English country manor in 1866. Her cousins Kenneth and Angela come from India, while her father goes off to Rome with Kenneth and Angela's parents, leaving the governess (whom, it's inferred, the father is sleeping with) and Victoria's mother with the little darlings, who turn out to be incestuous purveyors of S&M, catching Victoria up in their nightly games after everyone else has gone to bed. One wonders why the mother and governess even find their way into the story; they're not even used, except with glancing references, as objects personifying the thrill of getting caught. In fact, there seems to be no chance of anyone here getting caught at all until the climax of the story, and even then, Kenneth and Angela have found a way out of it within a paragraph or so.<br /><br />The Whip Angels is the basest kind of pornography, the stuff that today would be published in three ninety-five paperbacks from Beeline; there is no tension, no character development, an incredibly boring setup and then episode after episode of sex, all of which is quite boring. Roughly as erotic as the Seattle Fish Market on the hottest day of the year when everyone's refrigeration units are broken. You'd be far better off (not to mention a lot more titillated) reading the work of Georges Bataille and letting this slide back into its richly-deserved obscurity. *ring setup and then episode after episode of sex, all of which is quite boring.

But, despite her newfound doughnut cravings, Nikki is already involved in an online relationship with a dominant middle school teacher (yes, folks, you read that right!) named Richard...<br /><br />Whatever you do, do not read the back cover synopsis. For that matter, don't read most of the book's reviews. All of the above give away the big plot twist that comes around page fifty, making for pretty boring setup reading. (After all, YOU know what's gong to happen, and you keep yelling \\"don't go in the house!\\" or whatever you yell at dumb blondes in bad horror films.) While the romance angle is quite stock, and therefore predictable-- when was the last time you read a romance where the male and female leads did not eventually find themselves romantically entangled?-- Black has a good sense of what makes for a well-written genre mystery, and throws twists, turns, and red herrings aplenty into figuring out who the killer is. (If you know Roger Ebert's rules of mystery movies, you'll figure it out pretty quick, but Black does manage to invest the revelation of the killer's identity with a bit of panache.)<br /><br />Not a bad little book at all, although those who prefer their romances light on the actual sex, and light on the sexual profanity, will want to stay away. For the rest of us, it's a good deal of fun. ** ½	2005-01-25

Evit Kejbo Nosrep, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam Are Wrong (Immediex, 2004)<br /><br />It's pretty obvious from even the quickest trip to Immediex Publishing's website that Immediex is, in fact, one of a type of vanity press which is even more painful than the rest-- a vanity press from a self-publisher. Every title listed in its catalog was written (or compiled, in some cases) by one Richard Ohebsion. One wonders whether Evit Kejbo Nosrep (backwards and slightly misspelled, \\"Objective Person\\") is the first author save Ohebsion to be published by Ohebsion's press, or whether Ohebsion felt the need to take a pen name for what he'd undoubtedly perceive to be more controversial material. I've not read any of Ohebsion's books, so I don't know which it is. You be the judge.<br /><br />Judaism, Christianity, and Islam Are Wrong has an informative, if not a snappy, title; you pretty much know what you're getting from the get-go here. Mr. Objective spends his time in this book laying out various contradictions in the sacred texts of the three religions, using these contradictions to make his case that-- well, you know what case he's making.<br /><br />The book suffers on two fronts. The first is that, while factually the author is on solid ground with most of the contradictions he points out, the reader who is even casually familiar with both the sacred texts in question and the writer's art of poetic license will not have to think too far ahead to see into the heart of many of these supposed contradictions. The second is that the book is fraught with typographical and grammatical errors, often two or three (even more, in some notable cases) per page.

Daphne Gottlieb, Final Girl (Soft Skull Press, 2003)<br /><br />During a rather heated discussion on the merits of slam poetry, I had Gottlieb recommended to me as one of those who's capable of still taking the \\"poetry\\" half of \\"performance poetry\\" into account. Needless to say, I dug this up posthaste and gave it a go. And in deference to my worthy foil in that discussion, he's right... some of the time.<br /><br />Now, I grant you, it's been quite a while since I've been a regular member of the inner circle of the slam/performance poetry scene anywhere, but I've been a sporadic attendee ever since. I stopped being a regular because the performance started being more important then the poetry, to the point where the poetry was excluded, and the vast majority of the work (including the winner of every slam I've been to since 1993) became political or social screed chopped up into little lines to make it look poetic. And there are times when Daphne Gottlieb does this. But there are also times when she reveals an excellent eye for detail, and there are pieces in this book that shine.<br /><br />\\"When you leave for the evening--<br /><br />card games, parties, office things--<br /><br />it is your wife's closet<br /><br />I go to first.<br /><br />She's got great<br /><br />taste in shoes....\\"<br /><br />(\\"The Babysitter\\")<br /><br />\\"When he yells<br /><br />Get on your back!<br /><br />Call me Lord!<br /><br />Call me Master!<br /><br />I laugh so hard<br /><br />I drop my banana.\\"<br /><br />(\\"In a Name\\")<br /><br />Interlaced with the poems are short prose pieces of various levels of effectiveness, some exceptionally well-crafted, some not so much. Still, they're all above average, and definitely worth checking out. The oddest pieces here are not quite poetry and not quite prose, and seem to be written for a number of voices; read in such a way, they have an interest to them; read as single pieces, they're incomprehensible. I leave it to the reader to decide.<br /><br />One to check out, but too much of a rollercoaster to be a solid recommend. ** ½a rollercoaster to be a solid recommend. ** 	2005-01-12

Robin Hobb, Ship of Magic (Bantam, 1999)<br /><br />Hobb, author of the critically acclaimed Farseer trilogy, took a break from the world of Fitz and his companions to write the Liveship Traders trilogy. Only a small break, mind you; the first two books, both of which weigh in over eight hundred pages, were both published in 1999. That's a whole lot of words. Ship of Magic is the first of the Liveship Traders novels.<br /><br />The Vestrits are one of the Old Trader families who live in Bingtown, sandwiched between the sea, Jamaillia, Chalced, and the Rain Wilds. Jamillia is the country from which their charter comes, but the current leader has been ignoring his ancestors' promises to Bingtown, and in the process making things difficult. Chalced is a country of barbarians, where slavery is legal and women are treated much like perfumed cattle, and their ways are becoming more popular in Jamaillia. The Rain Wilds are a place of mystery, full of goods that command very high prices, but are also home to rampant disease and a mortality rate roughly akin to that in Europe at the time of the Black Death. Ephron Vestrit, current scion of the Vestrit clan, lays dying, while his ship is sailed by a greedy, careless son-in-law, Kyle Haven. The Vestrits, like all Bingtown Trader families, are into the Rain Wild families for generation's worth of debt, thanks to the commissioning of the liveships, worked in wizardwood, with sentient figureheads. Ephron's younger daughter, Althea, has been groomed to take over command of the family's liveship, the Vivacia, since she was very young; when Ephron dies, though, her older sister, Kyle's wife, inherits the ship, and Kyle starts making changes. Althea and the ship's former first mate, Brashen, go separate ways, but both wish to see the ship taken out of Kyle's hands. Kyle, instead, is bent on grooming his son Wintrow, a priest in training, to take over the ship, but he'd rather continue training to be a priest. Then you throw into the mix a pirate captain whose lifelong dream is to capture own a liveship, sea serpents, society parties, a mad liveship who's been abandoned on a rocky beach, the Others (half-man half-fish prophets), an illegal trade in wizardwood artifacts, and any number of other subplots and characters, and you can see why the trilogy requires 2,500 pages.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Hobb from the Farseer books, you should know what to expect here-- well-defined characters, readable prose, and in general, all the things that make a massive fantasy trilogy worth your time. It's genre writing, and never really strays outside the conventions of genre, but it's very good genre writing, and that shouldn't put you off. Fans of fantasy literature will find a good deal to like about Ms. Hobb's second trilogy. If it tells you anything, I was planning on waiting a few weeks before startting Mad Ship, the second book in the trilogy; I ended up starting it about half an hour after I finished this one, instead. *** ½the mix a pirate captain whose lifelong dream is to capture own a liveship, sea serpents, society parties, a mad liveship who's been abandoned on a rocky beach, the Others (half-man half-fish prophets), an illegal trade in wizardwood artifacts, and any number of other subplots and characters, and you can see why the trilogy requires 2,500 pages. <br /> <br />If you're familiar with Hobb from the Farseer books, you should know what to expect here-- well-defined characters, readable prose, and in general, all the things that make a massive fantasy trilogy worth your time.

The Masala Trois Collective (eds.), Desilicious (Arsenal Pulp Press, 2003)<br /><br />I will say right now that it's possible my reaction to this book has something to do with the fact that it was marketed to me as a straight poetry anthology, leading me to almost immediate disappointment. I could have handled, even, a mostly-poetry anthology with some prose thrown in for good measure. Instead, it's the opposite. Quite a letdown.<br /><br />Not that the short stories are bad, all of them. As is to be expected with any anthology, especially one with such a narrow focus as this (South Asian writers exploring sexual themes), there's a wide range of craft and artistic ability here, and that keeps the stories interesting, in its own odd way. However, ironically, also because of the exceptionally narrow focus, the stories quickly develop a sameness to them. Heterosexual, homosexual, male, female, one of the things you'll take away from the prose pieces in this book is that sexual awakening is, well, sexual awakening. As profoundly individual as it seems to each person, well, we tend to draw the same conclusions.<br /><br />The poetry here is surprising-- for the most part because some of it is so very exceptional. A few of the poets in this anthology should have published single-poet collections with major presses long ago. The opening poet, Shompaballi Datta, is someone you need to know, because this woman is going places. Which makes it all the more depressing to come upon something like Salacious Sister's \\"Snake Poem,\\" which should be taught in schools as an example of how not to write poetry:<br /><br />\\"Colorful Goddess images on the wall<br /><br />Inspire her to delve and deepen.\\"<br /><br />My heart bleeds for a generation that would call such a juxtaposition of vague, unpoetic words \\"poetry.\\"<br /><br />There is some good stuff here, but pick it up only if you feel like wading through a lot of swine to get to the pearls. **	2005-01-12

Barry Reay, Watching Hannah: Sexuality, Horror, and Bodily De-Formation in Victorian England (Reaktion, 2002)<br /><br />This is an entry in Reaktion's Picturing History series. If the other books in the series are as well-written as this one, I will be buying a large number of imports from Reaktion Books this year. (They can be had in America, usually for outrageous prices, unless you find them used.)<br /><br />Arthur Munby, pre-Raphaelite, gentleman, member of the idle rich, and friend and compatriot to any number of influential figures in many different schools of thought, was also a sexual fetishist par excellence. His particular fetish, to be overly simplistic about it, was dirt; specifically, that dirt which accrued on the bodies of the \\"working women\\" of the time (coal diggers, milkmaids, farm girls, etc.). Combined with the usual sexual fetishes to be found in the art, literature, and philosophy of the late eighteen hundreds in England, and you have quite the heady stew. Barry Reay offers another piece of Munby scholarship, but this one aimed at examining Munby's life through his various fetishes. The picture that emerges is uniformly darker than those of books previously written about Munby (both contemporary and modern), and is utterly fascinating. Through Munby's life, Reay takes the reader on a tour through Victorian sexual mores that sheds very different lights on some of what we thought was common knowledge about the people and their time.<br /><br />While the book does not spend quite as much time on the subject of Munby and his wife/slave Hannah Cullwick as one might expect given the title, the tangents into which Reay veers to illuminate other parts of Munby's psyche are just as fascinating (and in some cases even more repulsive, for example the chapter on Munby's fascination with noseless women).<br /><br />It kept me rapt the whole time I was reading it. One of the best pieces of nonfiction to come across my desk, on the readability scale, in some time, and one of the most fascinating in subject matter. Definitely a keeper. ****le, in some time, and one of the most fascinating in subject matter. Definitely a keeper. ****	2005-01-05

Livingston, Old Friends: Visits with My Favorite Thorougbreds (Eclipse Press, 2002)<br /><br />Reviewing books of photography often makes me feel guilty. As brilliant as someone like Romain Slocombe or Joel-Peter Witkin (for example) is, and as good as his books are, it seems kind of cheating to put a big photography book on one's list of books read for a given year. After all, how long does it really take to get through a book of photography?<br /><br />Not so with Old Friends. While it is, in fact, packed with the gorgeous photographs of horses for which Barbara Livingston is so deservedly well-known, every horse in here also has a small essay from Ms. Livingston, making this more a trip down memory lane than a photography book. Some of the horses in here are some of the best-known horses on the continent (Spectacular Bid, for example), some are well-known in their region of the States (Zuppardo's Prince, the leading stallion in Louisiana most years), and some even the most hardcore horseplayer has long forgotten, or never heard of in the first place. Livingston treats them all with equal dignity, and by the end of the book, we feel like we know these horses, too.<br /><br />A number of the horses here, since (and in a few cases before) the book was published, have died, and any of the rest of them are going to succumb to the ravages of old age within the next few years. But while some of their names will live in the lore of horse racing forever, Livingston has here ensured that many of the others will also not be forgotten.<br /><br />A fantastic book, and well worth having. **** ½	2005-01-05

If you are not aware of Hans Bellmer, you're probably not reading this review. So... fish!A blowdryer. Seven kinds of candy and a needle threaded with bullion stitching together tree limbs in the desert.<br /><br />Lichtenstein does a fine job of deconstructing Bellmer, not only focusing on his subversion of Nazi ideology (ground already well-trod in art criticism), but pulling in biographical data to give a clearer understanding of what forces drove Bellmer to create life-sized dolls, assemble the pieces in odd ways, and then photograph them hundreds of times with only the smallest changes in position. Her essay is clear, readable, excellent. The book's main problem is that, well, for an art book, there's not terribly much art. More pictures, please! (Especially the drawings, a side of Bellmer's art seen all too rarely.) What art there is is reproduced well, though that's to be expected from an art book, wot? The book also uses the annoying, but increasingly common, convention of end-of-the-book endnotes instead of footnotes (or even end-of-the-chapter notes, annoying but not as much so). Stopping every half-page or so to flip to the back of the book makes for not-so-happy readers.<br /><br />Still, a fine work on a sadly neglected artist. Worth your time. ****	2005-01-05

This created almost a Cult of Erikson in the States, where its devotees, who often paid insane prices for imported mass-market paperbacks, watched us getting all het up over George R. R. Martin, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, et. al., and gloated to themselves, knowing they had the real goods. Then came June 2004, and for the first time, Steven Erikson's Malazan books started being released domestically.<br /><br />In all honesty, while Gardens of the Moon doesn't have the stature (or resultant epic feel) of George R. R. Martin's truly never-ending A Song of Ice and Fire, it certainly does the trick well enough with this opening shot. To try and recount the many pieces of plot in a thousand-word review would be to demean the complexity and richness of the book. Just get it and read it for yourself.<br /><br />Erikson's characters are sometimes shallower than I'd like, but allowances must be made for this being, in essence, a book of setup; the characters do need room to expand. That said, he fills in a good deal on major and minor characters alike, and the novel does have enough characterization that the whole massive tome isn't just advancing the subplot that drives this first novel.<br /><br />The second book, Deadhouse Gates, is slated to be released in America in February 2005. Read this one before then so you don't get behind. *** ½	2004-12-28

Brian Keene, The Rising (Leisure Books, 2004)<br /><br />Warning: the ending of this book will hurt you.<br /><br />There are a number of reviews of this book that call it the same old thing, with a couple of twists and extreme gross-out scenes. I'm not sure what book those other reviewers were reading, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't The Rising, Brian Keene's first novel.<br /><br />What The Rising does is take the zombie-novel genre and turn it completely upside-down, to the point where it's pretty much a zombie novel in name only. These are zombies because they're dead and move slow, but in all other ways, they're a hybrid monster from a number of different genres. Calling them the same old zombies is rather like calling the zombies in 28 Days Later... the same old zombies. (Yes, before you say it, I KNOW the zombies in 28 Days Later... weren't actually zombies. That was why the comparison made sense.)<br /><br />As for the gross-out factor... folks, Robert Deveraux did better zombie gross-out over a decade ago in Deadweight (if you consider youself a fan of extreme horror novels and haven't read Deadweight, the book that pushed the envelope back in the day and kept it pushed to the edge for years, you don't know what you're missing. Though come to think of it, Bob's zombie wasn't really a zombie, either). The death, mutilation, et al. in The Rising is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff these days. After you've finished Robert Devereaux, turn your attention to Edward Lee, Charlee Jacob, and the rest of that pack. Then come back and give this one another read. The Rising's squish factor is actually pretty low.<br /><br />What The Rising is, ultimately, is readable. It's simple genre fiction, though as I said above it's difficult to put it into any subgenre-pigeonhole of horror. The dead are rising and eating people, but they're not your typical zombies. Bands of survivors are fighting the zombies and fighting each other. The main protagonist of the novel is Jim, a construction worker from West Virginia who's trying to reach his son in New Jersey, but the novel is far more an ensemble-cast affair than a novel that focuses on Jim.<br /><br />And this (aside from the typos, which we'll note here, sneer at, and then ignore) is the book's main failing. Keene tries to do way too much with this novel in the very small space he allots for it; The Rising, at three hundred twenty-one pages, is the shortest book I've ever read from Leisure's horror line. (Even William Schoell, back in the days when Leisure were a fledgling press, wrote monstrous novels, and when he wrote the slimmer books, published them through St. Martin's.) It should have easily been twice, maybe three times, its present length. Every character in the book could have used a good fleshing-out, no pun intended, especially the main characters and the main villain. Also, a number of scenes cut far too randomly, as if large chunks had been taken out and re-edited back in in greatly abbreviated form later (this happens most often with Frankie, one of the major characters in the novel). This could have been a stylistic decision on Keene's part, but honestly, given the inconsistency in structure, it looks more like a decision made by someone at Leisure to whom Keene was beholden. To Keene's credit, he did manage to keep the style consistent in those passages. Still, there are far too many jarring moments and far too many cardboard characters.<br /><br />The book's strongest and weakest, simultaneously, point is its ending. The reader is likely to turn the last page and wonder where page three hundred twenty-two went. The answer to that question ultimately determines my rating of the book. If it was meant in the way I think it was, it raises the book's rating a full star. If it was meant to set up  sequel, I'll be coming back, taking that star away, and revising it down another half-star for catering so nakedly to the Hollywood machine (this book, visual as it is, does scream \\"makeme into a movie\\" more than once). It moves exceptionally quickly, and as I said, its main problem is that there isn't more of it. Rather than a sequel, I hope we get an unrated director's cut, because what's here looks like the skeleton, with a few bits of decaying flesh attached, of a horror classic. *** ½es scream \\"make me into a movie\\" more than once).

Natasha Trethewey, Bellocq's Ophelia (Graywolf Press, 2002)<br /><br />A very slim volume, this, running under forty pages; it's more of a chapbook than a book, or would be had not Graywolf poured a professional amount of money into its publication. Whether the work deserved it or not is, of course, subject to argument (as it is with all books of poetry); but I get the feeling that even the most hardcore reader and collector of poetry is going to have a hard time shelling out the average price of a book of poetry-- already far greater, in terms of pennies per page, than it is for a novel or a piece of nonfiction-- for a book about half the size of an average single-author collection.<br /><br />The poems themselves are interesting, and make for quite good reading overall. Trethewey, inspired by E. J. Bellocq's photographs of a Louisiana prostitute, imagines herself from the girl's perspective, first in a series of letters to an old friend at home, then in the girl's diary. If Trethewey's mission here was to show that Ophelia was an individual, a human being, rather than just a prostitute or just a photographic subject, she succeeded nicely; phelia's voice is a strong one, and will stay with the reader after the book is finished. I just wish there had been more of that voice. ***	2004-12-28

Mary Ann Caws (ed.), Surrealist Love Poems (University of Chicago Press, 2002)<br /><br />I'm not really sure how to approach a critique of this book. For being only a hundred twenty pages, with a number of those taken up with photographs, notes, bibliography, etc., there's a great deal to be said about it. Caws is a noted surrealist biographer/critic/sociologist, and so it's to be assumed that her opening essay is going to be knowledgeable, authoritative, etc. And it is, of course. It doesn't go into the detail of many of her other excellent works on the subject, but starts the book off nicely. The poems themselves are translated (with, if memory serves, a few exceptions) by Caws herself, and all are new translations, which invites the reader to go hunting for the Collected Poems of the various poets represented (and any other translations; especially helpful here will be Michael Benedikt's The Poetry of Surrealism, a must-have in any case) to compare translations. Reading three or four translations of a short poem side-by-side will give the reader a much deeper sense of the poem and the many inflections of meaning it can have, and so any new translation of foreign poetry is a welcome one, especially a new translation of surrealist work. The photographs are chosen with great care and set the poems off well (one of the book's few proofreading shortcomings is that the page numbers listed in the back often don't correspond with the actual pages on which the photographs fall; it's easy to figure out what's what, though). The poems themselves are chosen with equal care, and while it's certainly not an exhaustive rendering of the world of surrealist love poems, which might not be possible in a book ten times the size of this, it's an excellent introduction to the machinery and mechanism that drove the core of the surrealist movement, and an interesting survey of where it went over the decades following its founding. As with all anthologies, it makes an excellent starting point for the reader interested in surrealism; find your favorites, track down the Selected, Collected, etc., and start reading. The upside of this collection, like that of The Poetry of Surrealism, is that the work chosen is of such a consistent quality that the reader can pen to a random page and find another writer whose work to go hunting.<br /><br />Excellent. ****ng point for the reader interested in surrealism; find your favorites, track down the Selected, Collected, etc., and start reading.

Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard, Alchemies of Distance (Subpress, 2001)<br /><br />I am sure there are readers out there who squeal with delight every time they pick up a book, open it, and find \\"America\\" spelled with a k. Well, folks, flock to this book, because you'll find it in abundance here. Keep the question in the back of your mind, though, why a poet-- someone who understands and communicates primarily through the written word, would feel that willful misspellings are both warranted to get across the message, and more important than communicating in such a way as to reach the greatest number of readers with the greatest understanding possible.<br /><br />Ms. Sinavaiana-Gabbard's critiques of modern American culture are more than apparent without the willful misspelling. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who reads this book and doesn't get the point. That, ultimately, is its biggest problem-- as with so many below-average books of so-called poetry, the message so often overrides the medium that the book becomes not poetry, but political screed broken up into short lines to make it look artistic. This is nothing new, and it's not overly shocking. What makes it all the more depressing in this case is twofold. First, Ms. Sinavaiana-Gabbard's introduction to the poems makes it obvious that she is exceptionally well-read in many different schools of poetry, and the lines she has chosen to quote from others to reflect different settings and feelings that drove her to write these poems makes it equally clear that her ear for poetry is far better than the voice she displays here; she knows how to recognize a great poem when someone else writes one, but falls very short in her own efforts time after time after time. The second thing is that when the hammer does hit the nail on the head, it drives it through the two by four and out the other side. Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard has written some astounding material here. For the most part, the images are washed away, quickly to be forgotten, by the political ranting, falling here and there in the screed like gold nuggets in the Colorado River. But the book's very last poem, \\"Pilgrimage,\\" a haiku cycle, is like panning for those nuggets and suddenly discovering a solid-gold cast of Shelley's famous statue of Ozymandias. It's as close to perfect as some poets will ever get, closer than most. It is precise, observant, and profound, and it is a shining example of what this poet can do when she sets her mind to writing poetry. Worse, there's obviously a political message to be had from the poem, and like all great poems, \\"Pilgrimage\\" allows the images to speak, and lets the reader glean what's between the lines for himself.<br /><br />Given \\"Pilgrimage,\\" the rest of the book looks that much shabbier. Better to have left it out altogether and present a less-than-mediocre collection than to put it in and show what could have been. * ½ed away, quickly to be forgotten, by the political ranting, falling here and there in the screed like gold nuggets in the Colorado River.

Lacina's work has an earthy quality to it that is refreshing in academic poetry; this is get down and work in the dirt poetry, not ivory tower poetry, dealing with day-to-day life as lived by us common folk, and there's not enough of that going around. Worth a look. ***	2004-12-28

Snodgrass, De/Compositions: 101 Good Poems Gone Bad (Graywolf Press, 2001)<br /><br />I figured, when I put this on reserve at the library, that Snodgrass was going to take poems from otherwise excellent (or, in some cases, overrated; it's about time a serious critic finally takes Emily Dickinson to task for every one of her poems being able to be sung to the tune of \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\") poets and breaking down what went wrong in them. I was wrong, and what I got was far finer: Snodgrass rewrites 101 poems, taking out the things that make them brilliant and turning them into everything from mediocre sludge to hysterically bad self-parody. In doing so, he highlights what is so wonderful about so many excellent poems better than thousands of pages of explication could; two or three pages of explication at the end of each section is included for clarity and closing notes, to highlight a change or two, but otherwise, Snodgrass lets the poems and their deconstructions (also, the occasional rough draft from the original poet) speak for themselves.<br /><br />I cannot overstate the importance of this book for the working poet. It should be required reading for everyone who's ever written a poem with any pretense to greatness, and for most, it should be on the short shelf of sacred reference books to which the poet will turn hundreds, maybe thousands, of times over the course of his career. No finer book on (or of) poetry crossed my desk this year; very few finer have ever crossed it. It makes my top five books of the year. *****	2004-12-28

Selima Hill, Bunny (Bloodaxe Books, 2001)<br /><br />Selima Hill's Bunny is a book that at first seemed custom-tailored for me: short poems (most running under ten lines) that stick close to the image, rather than wandering off into vagueness. Or so I thought. The vague does rear its ugly head here now and again, though not so much that it drags most poems down. Taken one at a time, there's a lot to like here. When collected into book form, however, one begins to realize that obsession, while a useful tool in the hands of many excellent poets, can be taken just a step too far. This is the second book of poetry I've come across (Debra Weinstein's Rodent Angel being the first) where whole chunks of verbiage from one poem are lifted verbatim into another. I don't suggest the poet is cannibalizing her own work here, by any means; I think it comes from having that particular phrase, sentence, whatever, being so insistent in the brain that it's forced out more than once. Which is all well and good, when you're publishing one of them and not the other in a magazine. When both show up in a book, though, it comes off sounding like a grating refrain in a popular song, or as if the book should have been one book-length poem rather than fifty or sixty shorter pieces. Either way, it grates somewhat.<br /><br />That said, don't let it stop you from picking this up, as what's here is often stark, haunting. Just be prepared to take this book, despite its slimness, at the most leisurely of paces, so when you come to each poem, you're coming to it fresh. ** ½	2004-12-28

Peter Thomas Crowell, Silverlance (PTC Publications, 2004)<br /><br />I have long held to a belief, spawned during my first days as a freelance musician (and, hot on their heels, my first days as a published writer), that anything self-published is pretty much guaranteed to be awful. I have run across exceptions over the years, but they have been predictably very few and very far between (and let me take this opportunity to once again flog the incredible work of Richard Cronshey, most of which is self-published). Thus it was with some reservation that I opened the package containing Silverlance, which I hadn't realized until I saw \\"PTC Publications\\" was self-published.<br /><br />Silverlance is one of those very few and very far between books that isn't a complete flushable. It has a few problems, but not nearly as many as one expects given the vanity-press nature of the release.<br /><br />Silverlance is a fantasy adventure, and I hear thousands of you filling in a number of blanks right now, In many cases, you're right on the mark. There's not much anyone has done new with fantasy since Tolkein, and you can expect a good deal of the same here. But Crowell does do a number of interesting things with the genre, such as switching the usual mix of humans, dwarves, elves, etc. one expects to see from one's protagonist party; there are a human and a dwarf, but also a satyr, a centaur, and two dryads. The protagonists are, of course, young, and have a number of elders helping them on the way (one looks at Peter Oatencake and thinks hard about Tom Bombadil, I'd warrant, and Hixima rather puts one in mind of the Elves, collectively, in The Fellowship of the Ring), along with a number of elders trying to stop them at every step. Temple full of monsters and traps, illusory concealed doors to other parts of the world, that sort of thing.<br /><br />As with most first novels (I assume this is a first novel, anyway), there are some problems with the pacing, and some plot holes that defy gravity. Characters disappear only to reappear at the most opportune possible times. Etc. You've read most of it before, but this is still not a bad little read. ***t holes that defy gravity.

Robert Rankin, The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse (Gollancz, 2002)<br /><br />The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse is sick. It's perverse. It's completely twisted. It's also quite funny. And well worth picking up.<br /><br />Jack is a young man fleeing a life of mindless factory work, on his way to the big city, where (he's been told) he can make his fortune. After some trip-ups on the way, he gets there and finds out that the city, in fact, is populated with toys, with the majority of the humans being nursery rhyme characters who are retired, or semi-retired (Miss Muffet, for example, has a daytime talk show, and Tommy Tucker is still doing his thing). The problem is, someone's killing off those old nursery rhyme characters, and Jack, by befriending the bear of missing private eye Bill Winkie, gets caught up in trying to find the serial killer before any more nursery rhyme characters meet ironic ends.<br /><br />The main problem the book has is that it's genre writing. What genre is subject to debate, certainly, but all the hallmarks of genre writing are here. One dimensional characters, plot herrings that should have been used satrically but weren't, chapter-ending cliffhangers, characters coming back from the brink (or over it) of death, etc. It's The Perils of Pauline with toys. For all that, it is funny, and if you've got a twisted sense of humor, you'll likely get a kick out of it. ***	2004-12-14

You'll never find a book today that features a horse named [unidentified racial slur].<br /><br />It's pretty pathetic to invoke the fifty-page rule on a book that runs only a hundred ninety-two pages, but I found myself forced to do so. I couldn't take any more of this tripe, [unidentified racial slur] aside. Cobbler's Dream, on which a sixties British TV series was based, purports to be the story of a farm for abused, injured, and retired horses, and how it affects the lives of two disenfranchised youth working there. (Despite not having got past page fifty, here's a prediction-- sometime before page 100, said two disaffected youths fall in love, but neither is willing to admit it to the other, fearing rejection, before page 189. Someone else can read it, if they can stomach it, and tell me if I'm right.) What it actually is is a political tract about how awful the abuse of animals is, and how much the British really do love horses. (Which surprises someone who inhabits the horse world and hears British race callers and columnists routinely refer to horses as \\"it\\" rather than by sex.) Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with sticking a message in your book, as long as you do it with a little finesse. \\"Finesse\\" is not defined as stopping the action (not that there is any action in the first fifty pages of this book, nor is there drama, character definition, or anything else that makes a book readable) every couple of pages to insert another few paragraphs on how hideous the British used to treat their horses, and that was awful, but now everything's just peachy.<br /><br />Godawful.

Eric Smith, Eponymous (iUniverse, 2001)<br /><br />Reviewing a book by a friend is usually a way to get oneself in deep trouble. Reviewing a book by a friend published by the normally-loathsome vanity press iUniverse.com is pretty much begging to be struck by lightning. This is the second time I've done it (Charles Sheehan-Miles' Prayer at Rumayla, on that other vanity press, Xlibris), and to put it mildly I was quite relieved when once again I wouldn't have to drag a friend's name through the mud.<br /><br />I was rather taken aback, though, when I first got the thing. The back-cover effusiveness compares Eponymous to the movies High Fidelity and Almost Famous, two of the more nauseating pictures to come across the silver screen in the past few years. Having been reading Smith's shorter work for a while, though, I should have known better. The boy's a better writer than that, and it comes out here.<br /><br />Collie Hay is a failed musician making his way as a music critic. Eponymous is the story of how he got that way, from his childhood working in the family music store in South Carolina to his band Arctangent's shot at stardom on a little Sony sublabel. It's also an exposure of self-loathing. Collie Hay does not like himself much. At all, actually. And while self-denigrating humor is pretty easy, to beat yourself up for this many pages with that kind of bitter cynicism rings both horrifying and oddly true. No one plots emotions this much, and that reality in the main character is the book's strongest point. No matter how out of control things get, there's not a single thing in the book that doesn't ring true. You will find yourself wanting to grab Collie by the shirt and smack some sense into him (and you will likely find yourself wanting to do this with a number of other characters in the book at various times) on a fairly regular basis, butt here's nothing here you haven't seen a hundred times in various friends and acquaintances of yours. Well, okay, in order to really see some of it, you may have to turn on Jerry Springer now and again, but it still rings true nonetheless.<br /><br />The same first-novel failings I noted in my review of Silverlance are apparent here (though Smith avoids falling into the fantasy-adventure-cliche trap by, well, not writing a fantasy adventure novel), especially in regards to the pacing. The book is slow to wind up, and a little overly conscious of its structure. However, that is quite nicely balanced out by one of the characters, who reads the manuscript at various times while Hay is writing it (for, yes, this is an autobiography within a novel, which is pretty obvious from the moment you crack the cover) and commenting on the pacing, structure, etc. Extra points to Smith for realizing that, taking it into account, satirizing it, and picking up the pace. (Or extra points to Lindy; you make the call.) The other major problem with the book is the ending, which is painful in an H. P. Lovecraft sort of way; readers of Lovecraft should know exactly what I'm talking about without my having to say it, and thus spoil the fun for the many millions of you who have not yet read this novel. Well, you haven't yet. You should. It's funny, in a gallows-humor sort of way, the same way Takashi Miike's movies are funny. It's thought-provoking. But more than anything else, it's real. *** ½in order to really see some of it, you may have to turn on Jerry Springer now and again, but it still rings true nonetheless. <br /> <br />The same first-novel failings I noted in my review of Silverlance are apparent here (though Smith avoids falling into the fantasy-adventure-cliche trap by, well, not writing a fantasy adventure novel), especially in regards to the pacing.

John Hollander, Reflections on Espionage: The Question of Cupcake (Atheneum, 1976)<br /><br />You never really know what you're going to get from a John Hollander book of poetry. In this case, you get a title that says \\"satire,\\" or puts you in mind of the Power Puff Girls or some like. But once you've flipped open the first page, what you find is anything but; Hollander takes you on a trip through the obsessive mind of a spy (code named, obviously, Cupcake), through nine moths of his reports both to superiors and colleagues. The effect is quite startling, and wonderful.<br /><br />There are some technical problems with the poetry, mostly in the line breaks, which are inconsistent and often irrational; the notes section (read it, for it's actually a part of the work, rather than being a real notes section) mentions in passing that the whole thing is actually rhythmic blank verse. True most of the time, but breaks in various places, leading one to believe perhaps more care could have been taken with the line breaks overall without sacrificing any of the readability herein.<br /><br />That is, however, something of a minor quibble in a work of this magnitude. Another definite winner from John Hollander, well worth seeking out. ****	2004-12-14

Elizabeth Willis, Turneresque (Burning Deck Press, 2003)<br /><br />Elizabeth Willis' third (that I've found to date) full-length work is just as gorgeous and surprising as her previous book, The Human Abstract. Willis is one of the few poets who can actually pull off the prose poem and make it sound like more than a short-short story:<br /><br />\\"Doctors sculpt a monster to disprove everything. Scaling mountains, she forgives herself the climbs of youth. Nothing can stop her dark mouth. She governs boys carelessly. You can't forge her dazzle. She stars all the time. Acts accrue against her inner caning. She lifts and shoots in furs, criming her way to newness, men....\\" (from \\"A Woman's Face\\")<br /><br />An amazing book from an amazing writer.

Sherman Alexie, One Stick Song (Hanging Loose Press, 2000)<br /><br />I have been avoiding reading Sherman Alexie's work for years. An acquaintance of mine is quite fond of his work, and it's one of those cases where I generally avoid, out of hand, anything this guy recommends. But eventually, the name stayed in my head long enough that I decided I had to at least try; after all, what if this were the one occasion where my acquaintance turned out to be right?<br /><br />Well, suffice to say he wasn't. Not completely, anyway. Alexie's short nonfiction is the strong point of this collection, and some of it is exceptionally strong. (I find it hard to dislike any piece of writing that starts with the sentence \\"I hate baseball.\\") It's avant-garde without being too avant-garde, accessible without pandering. It walks a fine line, and it's fun stuff.<br /><br />The poetry, or what passes for the poetry, in the collection is the weak spot, and unfortunately, what passes for poetry makes up the bulk of the collection. I've said it a thousand times before and I will likely say it a thousand times again before I die: if the message takes over the medium, what you have is not poetry, it's political screed chopped up into short lines for no apparent reason.

Tom Mes, Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike (Fab, 2003)<br /><br />Western audiences labored in blissful ignorance of the career of Takashi Miike for years. American and European extreme gore fans started noticing him with the release of Dead or Alive; the rest of the world snapped to attention when film festivals started showing such definitive Miike films as Rainy Dog, Audition, and Ichi the Killer. By now, Miike is Japanese culture's most recognizable export. However, we've gone from being completely ignorant to categorizing the director as a guy who does nothing but extreme gore (despite the brilliant The Happiness of the Katakuris, a twisted, and relatively gore-free, musical from 2001). Tom Mes, a dedicated film festival-goer and Miike fan, aims to show us there's more to the guy than promotional vomit bags (which were handed out to those attending the premiere of Ichi the Killer at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival).<br /><br />In the bulk of the book, Mes takes the reader through Miike's prolific oeuvre (to give you an idea of just how prolific, since Mes stopped documenting to publish, with Deadly Outlaw: Rekka, released in mid-2002, Miike has released ten films as of this writing), tracing the various themes to be found in the director's work. Rest assured, Mes is not a fanboy; he casts a rather critical eye over a number of Miike's films. The effect is for the reader to want even more to see a number of Miike's films not yet available outside Asia, for the most part (Ley Lines draws the most praise, for example, of any film in the oeuvre, with The Bird People in China, Rainy Dog, and The Guys from Paradise also getting a lot of positive play; of them, only Rainy Dog is available in the west, and that only in Britain, according to IMDB). The book is rounded out with Miike's filming diary for Ichi the Killer, a long interview Mes conducted with Miike in 2002, and some biographical info on the man.<br /><br />Needless to say, this book is a must for fans of Miike's movies, and is well worth the steep price it commands. Those who consider Miike an amusement might also do well to dip in and take a look at the structures that underlie the outrageousness Miike depicts on film. Definitely a book worth having for even the most casual fan. ****ns of Miike's movies, and is well worth the steep price it commands.

Jenny Factor, Unraveling at the Name (Copper Canyon, 2002)<br /><br />Jenny Factor is a good poet, and a formal poet, an increasingly rare beast these days. The craft which which the poems in this collection are assembled is beyond reproach. But, as the editor of a literary magazine once wrote me on one of many thousands of rejection slips, \\"the craft is good, but I suspect it's art you're after.\\" The art is where Factor's book is lacking. Not always, mind you, but in a number of places.<br /><br />The main problem is that Unraveling at the Name is, and is obviously, mostly poetry-as-therapy, poems that were written for the purpose of helping the poet get through something, and as such are just sort of there. It's an old truism that each of us thinks our own life is far more interesting than anyone else will, and the reason old truisms still exist is because, in general, they're true. Weight is added to this argument by what little material there is in this book that doesn't have to do with Factor's leaving her family to pursue her bisexual side; every once in a while she stops to consider something in nature, or writes something simple about her son at play, and all the glory that formal poetry is capable of comes shining through. Those small gems are reason enough for the poetry reader to go looking for this book, because they are truly fantastic pieces of work. You've got some slogging to do to get to them, though. ** ½	2004-12-14

MaryJanice Davidson, Undead and Unemployed (Berkley, 2004)<br /><br />Undead and Unemployed, I am both satisfied and chagrined to say, is even better than, and reads faster than, Undead and Unwed. In this one, Betsy, Queen of the Vampires, with her cohorts, is trying to track down a serial killer who preys on vampires, while trying to make ends meet. She lands her dream job, selling shoes at Macy's, but her personal life and queenly duties tend to get in the way of such things as holding down a job. As well, she's trying to fend off tall-dark-and-handsome Eric Sinclair and a high-school surfer boy with a crush on her at the same time, trying (and failing) to refuse to let her super-rich best friend sell her three-bedroom bungalow and buy her a ritzy mansion, and try to figure out who the five-year-old kid is who's always hanging around.<br /><br />A number of the minor characters in the series are a little more fleshed out, though a number of them are still barely more than stereotypes (especially Marc, the bitchy gay roommate), and one of the plot twists here is truly surprising; a shock in formula fiction, and a very pleasant one. Davidson's second entry in the series hopefully won't be the last, and if they keep improving at this rate, she'll be at the top of the romance heap in a couple of years. ***	2004-11-29

Marilynne Robinson, Gilead (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 2004)<br /><br />It's been a while since we've had a novel from Marilynne Robinson. Twenty-three years, in fact. She's published some nonfiction since, but Gilead is Marilynne Robinson's second novel, with Housekeeping, back in 1981, coming first. Housekeeping was brilliant, the kind of novel that actually inspires waiting over two decades for an author's second novel. Does Gilead measure up?<br /><br />It does, mostly. There are some things about it which are likely to be off-putting to many casual readers. The length of time it takes to get used to the rhythm of the writing, for example, mirrors Cormac McCarthy's more difficult works, and the lack of chapters, in my experience, is the kind of thing that will make many readers not even try the book. Their loss.<br /><br />Gilead is given to us in the form of a letter from one of the town's preachers, writing in the vicinity of his seventy-seventh birthday, to his son, who's eight or nine (depending on what portion of the book you're reading). The epistle starts as something of a reckoning, a father giving his son advice that the father won't be around to give himself, for he knows he's close to dying. It becomes much more than that, though. The narrator's best friend, also a preacher, named his firstborn after the narrator. Which is all well and good, except that the firstborn is a good-for-nothing roustabout, and the novel's main thrust plotwise is the firstborn coming back to town after an extended absence, and the narrator's repeated attempts to bridge the years-old gulf between them.<br /><br />There are a few shortcomings (one wonders why a preacher wouldn't recognize a crisis of faith when he sees it), but overall, Robinson's second novel is well worth the wait. Gentle, authoritative, and never boring, Gilead is definitely one that should be on your short list of books to be read in 2005, assuming you don't get to it this year. ****	2004-11-29

Mildred Mastin Pace, Old Bones, The Wonder Horse (Scholastic, 1955)<br /><br />It's hard for me to not like a kids' book about race horses. Well, okay, except Spirit Horse of the Rockies.<br /><br />Old Bones is the story of 1918 Kentucky Derby winner Exterminator. Profusely illustrated by Thoroughbred specialist Wesley Dennis, Old Bones is told in what I can only describe as Mike-Mulligan-and-His-Steam-Shovel diction; it reads more like an easy-reader than a ninety-two page book for school-agers (what the kids these days call \\"chapterbooks\\"). Still, Pace resurrected Exterminator, long out of the limelight and dead for ten years by the time this book was published, and while the book does have a tendency to gloss over a good deal of Exterminator's career (he ran one hundred races, so just going over the career alone would have taken three books of this size), Pace does hit both the highest highlights and the lowest lowlights (the fracture that ended his career being the lowest of them).<br /><br />It's possible that some of the glossing comes from no one knowing about certain things. Looking up Exterminator on the Internet brings loads of conflicting information (for example, many sites say stablemate Sun Briar, the 1918 Derby favorite, was simply off his feed, as Pace contends here, while others say he was injured in a workout days before the race). And while it's certainly impossible to draw a cause-effect line, Pace's book came out in 1955, Exterminator was elected to the Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1957; coincidence?<br /><br />An easy read, and perhaps a good way to get your toddlers interested in the ponies before they're ready for Walter Farley's books. ***	2004-11-29

Koji Suzuki, Dark Water (Vertical Press, 2004)<br /><br />Despite Hideo Nakata having made a film of the same title, Dark Water is, in fact, a collection of short stories. (The film is based on the first story in here, but it's hard to imagine how Nakata managed to get the film out of this story.) Suzuki is a crack novelist, to be sure, but his short story-writing capabilities are less obvious; the stories here all follow a sort of structural pattern which may be common in Japanese short stories, though it's not to be found in most other Japanese short story writers whose work exists in translation; I have to believe that the problem lies not with a structure defined by what's popular in Japan, but with Suzuki's writing itself. It's all the more puzzling because one of the things Suzuki does best in his novels is their endings; the epilogue of Spiral is what pushes it from a very good novel to a great one. Thus, it's doubly puzzling that the stories in Dark Water (yes, every one of them) have such abrupt, unsatisfying endings. By \\"unsatisfying\\" here, I don't mean \\"ambiguous;\\" in fact, the story here with the most ambiguous ending, \\"Adrift,\\" is also the best stand-alone piece in the book. No, Suzuki spends a good deal of time building his characters and situations, then suddenly decides to wrap everything up in a paragraph or two, completely changing pace and structural details. I could see it in one story, but in all of them?<br /><br />Those of you who pick this up on the strength of Nakata's film, be aware that the movie is, in this case, better than the material upon which it is based. Everyone else will probably feel somewhat cheated that such brilliant setups get such short shrift at the end of each story. The setups, though, are reason enough to read the stories here. Just hope Hideo Nakata has the rights to a number of them. ***	2004-11-29

Stair, Choosing a Career in Mortuary Science and the Funeral Industry (Rosen, 2001)<br /><br />I'm having a problem figuring this book out. I judge the reading level at junior high, which is about where Amazon puts it (listed as \\"ages 9-12,\\") but really, doesn't the subject matter seem, well, wrong to you? I'm all for telling kids about the funeral industry, but doesn't it seem like something they'd be more interested in post-puberty, when they get introduced to goth? (Seriously, on one goth/noise mailing list at which I lurked for about nine months, the number of people in school for various funeral industry jobs was staggering.)<br /><br />Well, one way or the other, Choosing a Career in Mortuary Science and the Funeral Industry is an interesting overview. It's somewhat broader than its title would suggest, also covering some things that go on outside the morgue and the funeral home (e.g., CSI-style forensic science careers), and in a book this short, it's trying to cover one or two too many topics for it to get into anything resembling detail; this is a seriously surface-level overview. It may, however, point kids who are interested in such things into more directed reading, which is never a bad thing.<br /><br />Still, I'd have liked to see at least a little more detail, especially of the statistical kind. Telling people that the number of jobs available in the industry is supposed to steadily climb at least until 2008 doesn't really count for much if you don't give some numbers as to what's already out there. All well and good if there are positions sitting open now, but if you've got ten graduates for every job...<br /><br />Worth checking out, but as a primer for those who want to go on to deeper reading in the subject. ** ½	2004-11-29

Fairchild, Early Occult Memory Systems of the Lower Midwest (Norton, 2003)<br /><br />For the most part, B. H. Fairchild writes good, solid, relatively unmemorable poetry that warrants second and third reads. The places he stands out, like most good poets, is when he attempts to get into long poems; Fairchild manages to avoid all the pratfalls that make many long poems unreadable, and in this book, he turns in \\"The Blue Buick: A Narrative.\\" It's not that his style is any different here than it is in his other poems, it's that he manages to keep his style going for so long without ever completely lapsing into the world of narrative. If you know Fairchild's work, you can tell any given piece of \\"The Blue Buick\\" is a Fairchild poem, and that is an excellent thing.<br /><br />\\"As with baseball and poetry, so with lathework,<br /><br />arts of precision: an able catcher sets his feet<br /><br />to avoid the extra step that makes him miss<br /><br />the steal at second, a poet hears the syllable<br /><br />before the word, a good machinist \\"feels\\" the cut<br /><br />before he measures it.

MaryJanice Davidson, Undead and Unwed (Berkley, 2004)<br /><br />Damn your toothy little heart, MaryJanice Davidson, for getting me hooked on your formulaic plot, your two-dimensional minor characters, and your fashion obsession (though I have to admit it's not nearly as bad as The Devil Wears Prada in that regard). But I cannot. Stop. Reading.<br /><br />I can't really say that I liked Undead and Unwed, but the second I'd finished reading it I went and put Undead and Unemployed on hold at the library, and really, that's what it's all about, isn't it?<br /><br />Undead and Unwed is the story of Betsy Taylor, who kicks off one night after being hit by an Aztek (truly, if you're going to be hit by a car, it might as well be a REALLY UGLY car), then wakes up in the morgue to find herself a vampire. Which doesn't seem to affect her much, she's still obsessed with top-shelf shoes. After notifying some of her closest friends and intimates she's still walking the earth, and saving a depressed pediatrician from jumping off a building to his death while she's at it, she finds herself unintentionally dragged into vampire politics; two warring factions, one headed by Nostradamus (no, not THE Nostradamus, and not really a good imitator), and the other by the tall, dark, and handsome Eric Sinclair. Nostradamus wants to wipe out the remnants of Sinclair's small band; Sinclair wants to be left in peace, but can't stop infiltrating Nostradamus' own cadre. Oh, and there's a book that vampires keep referring to which says Betsy's actually the queen of all vampires...<br /><br />yep, it's pretty much your standard romance coupled with your standard vampire novel (and not your standard above-average vampire novel, either; it's not as dumb as Anne Rice, but it treads the line a few times). The novel's strength, which lies in Davidson's ability to draw her major characters (even the fashion-obsessed ones) as likable three-dimensional characters rather than the cardboard cutouts and stereotypes that define minor character status here, are unfortunately balanced by some problems with writing style (if you're going to refer to Nostradamus as \\"Noseo,\\" it helps to have a hyphen so people know it's \\"Nose-o\\" and not \\"no seo\\", for example) and editorial gaffes.<br /><br />But it's readable, and it draws you into the series, what more do you need? ** ½nd stereotypes that define minor character status here, are unfortunately balanced by some problems with writing style (if you're going to refer to Nostradamus as \\"Noseo,\\" it helps to have a hyphen so people know it's \\"Nose-o\\" and not \\"no seo\\", for example) and editorial gaffes. <br /> <br />But it's readable, and it draws you into the series, what more do you need? ** 	2004-11-29

River Huston and Mary Berridge, A Positive Life: Portraits of Women Living with HIV (Running Press, 1997)<br /><br />It's rare that I can't think of a way to review a book. This is one of those times.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm just reading too much into the title. I keep seeing \\"A Positive Life\\" as a double-entendre, not just about living with HIV, but as some sort of resolute looking forward. And there is some of that here, to be sure, but there is also bitterness, anger, cynicism, and fear. Another reviewer said that this book \\"...helps us to remember that these people really are no different than the rest of us.\\" Indeed.<br /><br />The reader also goes on to say that River Huston is an amazing lady, and having published her first chapbook, I can honestly say \\"THAT's damn right,\\" but Huston is, aside from a brief introductory passage, nowhere to be found here. (Rather surprising; I would have thought she'd have gone for a self-interview here, as she's the most positive person, from an outlook point of view, I've ever met, with or without HIV.) Like Hal Gold in Unit 731: Testimony or Georges Bataille in The Trial of Gilles de Rais, when the subjects start speaking, the author fades into the background and lets them tell their own stories, and keeps so far out of the spotlight that there's not even a particular editorial style to be found here; you get the idea that what you see is raw, unexpurgated transcriptions of microcassettes. I doubt it, as the pieces here are quite short, but the effect is there.<br /><br />I was originally going to slag it slightly for being too short, clocking in at just under a hundred twenty pages, but the simple fact is that what's here is just about enough. There is a relentless, crushing power to these stories, both in their differences and in their similarities, to the point where the reader may find himself either numbed or on the verge of breakdown, given two or three hundred pages.<br /><br />Worth your time. ***	2004-11-29

Ivan Arguelles, \\"That\\" Goddess (Pantograph Press, 1990)<br /><br />Andrei Codrescu, blurbing the back cover of Ivan Arguelles' \\"That\\" Goddess, says that Arguelles is one of the few genuine surrealists left on the planet. Indeed. Arguelles is one of the few who's studied enough surrealism, and understood enough of what he's read, to actually be coming from the same places those old dead guys were. As a consequence, reading \\"That\\" Goddess is often reminiscent of diving into one's copy of Benedikt's wonderful anthology The Poetry of Surrealism (and one DOES own a copy of The Poetry of Surrealism, doesn't one?), but informed by a more modern sense of history and culture.<br /><br />\\"That\\" Goddess is the story (it's an epic, to be sure) of an obsession, specifically an obsession with Lisa, of Wendy and Lisa fame (for those of you who never followed spinoff bands, one of the keyboard players from Prince and the Revolution). True to form, though, the obsession branches off into many different areas, always coming back to where it started but exploring many, many wonderful worlds in the interim. Arguelles here is also reminiscent of Pound not only by the structure of the piece, which is divided into a prologue and twelve cantos, but also in the sheer depth and range of knowledge displayed; \\"That\\" Goddess reads as if Arguelles had a burning need to share an incredible, vast store of knowledge with the reader. Despite that, the tone is never condescending. It is by turns enthusiastic, horrified, contemptuous (of its subjects, not of the reader), and any other number of emotions, but never condescending. It also makes for very thick, difficult going (these hundred six pages took me just over three months to get through), but such difficulty will be well rewarded by Arguelles' impeccable poetic sense and ability to find commonality in the oddest juxtapositions. You'll never go a full page without finding something new and pleasurably surprising here.<br /><br />One of the finest books of poetry I've read this year, and I have read many. But then, I've come to expect that from Arguelles, who is truly one of the best living poets writing today. **** ½t books of poetry I've read this year, and I have read many.

John Lindley, Handicapping for Bettor or Worse (Eclipse, 2004)<br /><br />Not a bad little book, for what it is, and does provide some insight into a number of aspects of racing that will hopefully serve to demolish some myths in the more open-minded readers who pick this up. Lindley also raises the same excellent points as regards post position \\"statistics\\" that Henry Kuck brings up in Winner's File, which is quite nice to see; I'm glad that particular piece of spurious statistic-mongering, which has long been the subject of really, really stupid systems sold by faceless Las Vegas post office boxes for $44.95, is finally getting the short shrift it deserves. But, as with more and more handicapping books coming my way, Lindley's slim volume lacks the same thing that makes Ainslie, Beyer, Pizzolla, Mitchell, etc. well worth reading: any real sort of writing style to go along with the information. Andy Beyer and Dick Mitchell may annoy the hell out of you when you're reading their books, but their writing style makes what they say that much more memorable. Lindley is a writer of the \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" school, and not surprisingly, that makes even his most important sections in here somewhat unmemorable. Thus, I suggest you take notes while reading this one, as what he has to say is certainly worth hearing. ***	2004-11-29

Glenn Gaesser, Big Fat Lies (Gurze, 2002)<br /><br />Do yourself a favor-- find this book and read it as soon as possible.<br /><br />The first two sections of this book show a study in selective reasoning by the medical establishment. Gaesser provides a mountain of evidence that all we've been told by the insurance industry, the medical industry, and the fitness over the last half-century or so regarding weight loss is a lie. We hear some of it now and again on the news, especially how low weight is linked to osteoporosis, but you've never seen this much of it together all in one place. Gaesser's position is that exercise, not weight, is primarily responsible for a person's health, and that \\"exercise\\" as we know it today (high-impact aerobic exercise) is not the be-all and end-all foisted upon us. All of which points out why overweight and obese people should be reading it (and popularizing it), and they are its target audience to be sure, but Gaesser makes a lot of noise about the normal- or underweight unfit, too.<br /><br />The first two parts of the book are the theory, the third part is the practice. Gaesser provides a simple, easy-to-follow exercise regimen suggestion, infinitely customizable for the average person, and dietary suggestions without ever proposing a diet per se; his goal is to steer us towards eating healthier rather than rationing out what we can and can't eat. Again, the thin will benefit from following his guidelines just as much as the overweight. It's all common sense, of course, but he does point out a number of things that may surprise the average grocery shopper (for example, the actual amount of fat to be found in whole milk, which is staggering).<br /><br />The book's only real flaw is stylistic; Gaesser, not to much surprise, has adopted the medical-jargon use of \\"overweight\\" and \\"underweight\\" as nouns rather than adjectives, and it's enough to drive the average stickler up the wall. It is certainly not, however, enough to put anyone off reading this. It may be the most important book you read all year, and should go on the short shelf of sacred books next to Peele's The Diseasing of America. **** ½t anyone off reading this.

Tom Piccirilli, A Choir of Ill Children (Night Shade, 2003)<br /><br />Whoa. When I read The Night School a few months back, I knew Tom Piccirilli was a good writer, but it certainly didn't prepare me for this. A Choir of Ill Children was recently the featured horror novel at chapteraday.com. With books that pop up there, I usually read all five days' worth of material before deciding whether I'm going to check the book out of the library, buy it, or whatever. With A Choir of Ill Children, I stopped reading halfway through day one in order to put it on hold at the library; I'd finished it by the time I got the mailing for day five.<br /><br />A Choir of Ill Children is the best American horror novel since Kathe Koja's Skin a decade previous, and the two novels serve to illustrate in how many different directions American horror has exploded. Koja writes surreal, existential horror novels (even for young adults; her most recent novel, The Blue Mirror, is eerily reminiscent of her tour de force, Strange Angels); Piccirilli, at least in this case, is firmly rooted in the Southern Gothic tradition. While closer to Koja's horror-of-absence than King or Koontz' things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, this difference between the two is like night and day. Well, more like dusk and dawn, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Thomas is the wealthiest man in Kingdom Come, and the most shunned. His three brothers are conjoined at the frontal lobe, making the older residents scared of him, and the younger residents (who've never seen the boys, who stay in the house at all times) afraid of him the same way normal kids are afraid of a haunted house. Thomas' best friend Drabs, who's kind of a combination between a Pentecostal and an epileptic, tells Thomas the circus is coming to town, filmmakers have shown up to do a documentary on the triplets (one of whom falls in love with the narrator), and all the dogs in town are getting kicked by a vicious, but unseen, criminal. And that's what things look like before they get weird. Believe me, they get weird.<br /><br />A Choir of Ill Children isn't so much a horror novel, despite what I said above, as it is a tragedy; it's about as close to classical tragedy as American literature can get. That is to say, when the revelations finally come at the end, they're somewhat predictable, but they're supposed to be. This is more Hamlet or Oedipus than it the The Thirty-Nine Steps. Piccirilli has created a true work of genius here, and one that will stay with you long after you've finished this book. A must-read. *****things look like before they get weird.

Yusef Komunyakaa, Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems (Wesleyan, 2001)<br /><br />When they say \\"new and collected,\\" they mean \\"new and collected.\\" Clocking in at just shy of five hundred pages, Pleasure Dome does collect, as far as I can tell, the sum total of Pulitzer winner Komunyakaa's work to date. It's a massive book, even larger than Jim Harrison's recent The Shape of the Journey, almost approaching the sheer magnitude of Hardy's Complete Poems, the largest single-author book of poetry to ever reside on my shelf. (Morris' The Earthly Paradise is in twelve volumes.) And while it does get inconsistent at times, the overall recommendation on it is a resonating yes.<br /><br />Komunyakaa, a Vietnam war vet who began writing while in the bush, infuses much of his poetry with the war. This is not terribly surprising. What is is that, for atleast ninety-five percent of the war poetry, he does not allow the message to run away with the medium. That Komunyakaa's collections Toys in a Field and Dien Cai Dau are some of the most stirring work ever written on the Vietnam experience is testament to the power of McLuhan's oft-used truism \\"the medium is the message.\\" Komunyakaa lets the story tell the story, and the story is stronger for it.<br /><br />It is to be expected that no poet can be perfect, and this is true of Komunyakaa. However, the number of times he slips into messagizing mode can be counted here on the fingers of one hand, an absolutely astounding feat in a book of over four hundred pages of poetry; he is truly a master of the poetic art.<br /><br />This is a book to be browsed through at leisure, not read per se; it took me almost six weeks to get through it, and I'm a speedreader. It demands time and effort, and will offer the reader willing to put them in rewards in kind. *** ½	2004-11-11

Grant, 2004)<br /><br />\\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\"<br /><br />When the first sentence of what has become The Dark Tower was published, in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (October 1978), a few thousand souls were treated to a new Stephen King story, \\"The Gunslinger.\\" It has been twenty-six years since, and those few thousand have expanded into uncounted millions, drawn at first by the collectability of the limited edition hardback of the first volumne, put out by Donald M. Grant in 1982 and illustrated by the inimitable Michael Whelan, and then, once it was released in trade paperback, by the strength of the story itself and its characters. Now, in October 2004, Stephen King has finished the tale of Roland. What began as a short story spanning about twenty pages is an epic series of seven novels, weighing in at closer to five thousand, and with so many things pulled from other King novels (including those not considered ancillary Dark Tower novels; in this final volume, you will find three big references to novels that weren't ancillaries) that at times it has seemed everything King ever wrote is part of this one huge epic story cycle.<br /><br />The Dark Tower, like King's other work, has been inconsistent over the years. The Waste Lands and Wolves of the Calla were not high points in Mr. King's career, and some of the ancillary novels have been just shy of unreadable (what Roland does with a copy of Insomnia in this novel is, truly, what we all should have done with it ten years ago). Thus, when King finally drew it all to a close, and in the largest book he has released since the uncut version of The Stand in 1990 (clocking in at just shy of nine hundred pages, with the afterwords and appendices added), I had to look forward to the book with some trepidation.<br /><br />King's final novel (so he tells us, though he hints in his afterword that retirement may not yet have caught up with him) continues right after and/or just before (depending on the storyline) the cliffhanger ending of Song of Susannah. Jake, Father Callahan, and Oy are just about to storm the Dixie Pig, one of the Crimson King's gateways to New York City, in 1999. Susannah is in the town of Fedic with Mia, giving birth to the baby they've both been carrying for a number of books now. Eddie and Roland are off, once again, looking for things in Maine. Afterwards, the raggedy band of survivors have to find themselves and, naturally, continue trying to both save the beams and get to the tower. Nothing new here, except that, well, this is the last book; we'll get our answers. We think.<br /><br />The ending is simultaneously one of the book's greatest strengths and its greatest weakness. Without giving too much away, I'll say this; the book has two endings. King ends it in simultaneously the truest and least satisfying way he could, but then (presumably to stave off death threats from readers who just don't get it, and haven't gotten it the whole time), he adds a small continuation. It is likely to get him some death threats, too, and judging by the tone of some of the Amazon reviews it probably already has. The second ending, however, is still about as good as it can be, under the circumstances. It, too, rings true, though some will undoubtedly wish King has left it all with the first ending.<br /><br />Another of the book's strengths is that King and Grant finally went full circle and brought Michael Whelan back to illustrate. Hallelujah, because the folks who have done the intervening Dark Tower books have just not done them as much justice as Whelan both did in 1982 and does in 2004. Lavishly illustrated in both color and black and white, Whelan has given real depth to the illustrations. The series' best since the first novel.<br /><br />The book also contains a copy of Browning's original poem, and I strongly suggest that those unfamiliar with it read it. Perhaps those who don't get it will have a better understanding of some of these events after reading and digesting Browning's original work (only five stanzas of which are referenced within the text, in a single interpretation dealing with a single character; obviously, the poem has far more to do with the series' underlying context than that).<br /><br />The book's main weakness, aside from the abovementioned problems with the ending, is its overly episodic nature, which was one of the big problems in The Waste Lands, as well. Characters are set up, sometimes with the kind of foreshadowing that signals a major character ahead, only to end up going out of the story's scope within a few pages. This happens twice in the novel (and those who've read it will already know which two characters I'm talking about). The episodic nature of the first book could be forgiven. After all, it was a collection of related short stories, not a novel. This, however, is not, and it gets annoying after a while. King is a master of character development, but sometimes it seems that a petulant six-year-old takes his mind over now and again in order to overstate the importance of characters in the general scheme of things.<br /><br />The best thing I can sum up with is to ask the question, is The Dark Tower (the novel) a worthy ending to The Dark Tower (the series)? After reading it, my answer is an unqualified yes. If this is to be King's final novel, he's going out with a bang.

AD&D veteran James Lowder collected things, and he did a darned good job of cherry-picking here.<br /><br />It won't surprise the roleplaying crowd that one of the highlights of this collection is Ed Greenwood's \\"One Last, Little Revenge.\\" Greenwood, of course, is the creator of the Forgotten Realms AD&D scenario, as well as most of the books written about the Forgotten Realms that are actually worth a second read. New lights in the horror world Michael Laimo and Scott Nicholson, both with recent novels on the shelves, turn in very good stories as well. (In fact, it's pretty hard to go wrong with anything within these covers.) But the true gem here is Christine Morgan's \\"Dawn of the Living Impaired, which has shades of Dan Simmons' lovely, underrated \\"Vanni Fucci Is Alive and Well and Living in Hell\\" (published many years ago in the Night Visions books) with an ending that... well, I don't want to spoil it for you.<br /><br />A bloody fun read, this, and well worth seeking out. *** ½	2004-11-11

Sephera Giron, House of Pain (Leisure, 2001)<br /><br />Before you read the book, just open to the back cover and stare at Ms. Giron's photo. Erm, wow.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, on to the book itself. (But you can allow yourself to go back between chapters and stare some more.) I'm not exactly sure how to describe House of Pain. It certainly starts off with a bang, but then it kind of deflates (as if having its brain sucked out by one of the villains). The haunted-house premise is always a great one, and it's got some twists on it here that are, while not wholly original, at least not horribly overutilized enough to have appeared in, say, a Barbara Michaels novel. But by the last fifty pages or so, I was saying to myself \\"didn't I see this in an old Louis Gossett, Jr., movie?\\" way too many times. (And it wasn't a horror movie.)<br /><br />Worth it for the first two-thirds of the book, but be prepared for something of a letdown. ** ½	2004-11-11

Lucius Shepard, The Ends of the Earth (Arkham House, 1991)<br /><br />Lucius Shepard has been one of America's most underrated writers for years; this is one of those collections that faded into obscurity quickly, but that deserves to be taken out, dusted off, and thrust upon the nation with the marketing campaign it deserves.<br /><br />The Ends of the Earth features fourteen of Shepard's finest stories from early in his career. They span the globe from Vietnam to Guatemala to New England, taking on all things weird and wonderful, and are uniformly excellent. Fans who came to know Shepard through Twilight Zone magazine and the excellent Vietnam War fiction collection In the Field of Fire will already be familiar with \\"Delta Sly Honey\\" and \\"Shadows,\\" two of the book's strongest pieces. Others will no doubt already know the novella \\"The Scalehunter's Beautiful Daughter,\\" published on its own as a limited edition, and the kind of story that cannot be described with any accuracy; it must be read to be believed. All, and the rest of the stories here, are mesmerizing.<br /><br />That said, this is a collection of early work (well, relatively); while the stories here are undoubtedly strong, sometimes they don't reach the gloriousness of some of his later work, especially the novels. That's not to say this stuff isn't worth reading; to the contrary, seek this book out however you have to. ****	2004-11-11

Perhaps there is no better indicator of this than that Willis' The Human Abstract is one of those rare beasts, an American book of poetry printed after World War II released by the mighty keeper of all that is literary, Penguin. Established fans will already know (and may already own) some of the things in this collection, many of which were published previously as chapbooks or broadsides; don't let that stop you from shelling out for this bad boy. All the rest of what's in here is just as good as what you have. And if you've never entered the wild, wonderful, often frightening world of Liz Willis, you're in for quite a ride.<br /><br />The first thing to note about Willis' writing is that, like all great poets, she is at least as concerned (if not more so, at times) with how it sounds than whether it makes sense. Let me rush to add, since it's a different way of thinking for most people, that that is a good thing (often, about the best poems, it is the best thing; read Simic, Stroffolino, Hamburger's translations of Tzara, early Eshleman, etc. for numerous examples). The thing that first strikes you about the poems in here is how good they sound. Well, that and the way they lay on the page (which, at least in comparison to the original chapbook of \\"A/O,\\" is even toned down a bit here), which is sure to draw the eye. Read the stuff here through, first, just for the magic of sound, the pleasure of the differing flow of breath on some passages. Then delve into the meaning. And you'll probably have to delve; it's obvious from the material here that Willis is savagely intelligent, and one of those people who is driven to write by the things she's uncovered with that intelligence; you won't be sitting with a concordance, as you would with Pound's Cantos, but you might want to keep a search engine handy. All of which is quite worth it, as Willis is truly one of the guiding lights in American poetry today. **** ½t want to keep a search engine handy.

With thousands upon thousands of people asking why on earth punctuation matters as long as the passage is understandable, a question that reduces most sticklers to wordless fuming, Truss answers the question eloquently, in many different ways, as well as pointing out all the various peccadilloes that even the stickiest of sticklers may have glossed over, covering bits of punctuation history, and providing the book that really should be the punctuation primer in schools from here on out. Out the door with you, Mr. Warriner, Lynn Truss has written a better book that will teach more and is, to be blunt, far less dry.<br /><br />Perfect, except for that Oxford Comma bit.

Sharon Dolin, Serious Pink (Marsh Hill Press, 2003)<br /><br />Sharon Dolin's Serious Pink is a collection of ekphrastic poems (for those not up on their jargon, \\"ekphrastic\\" simply means \\"a poem based on a piece of art in another medium\\"). All the poems here are taken from abstract pieces, which could lead to either brilliance or stupidity. Thankfully, Ms. Dolin firmly hits the mark on the former. The title, get your dirty mind out of the gutter, is from a quote by artist Howard Hodgkin; \\"Can you imagine a serious pink next to a trivial blue or even a ridiculous black?\\" It's a wonderfully ambiguous statement, and as such makes an excellent choice of title for such wonderfully ambiguous poems. \\"Serious pink seems to lean on everything/in spite of trivial blue candy canes/curtain folds on a proscenium stage.\\" (\\"Day Dreams\\")<br /><br />The collection's centerpiece is \\"Ode to Color,\\" a long work littered with quotes from artists, magazines, manuals on painting, and the like, interspersed with memories of a speaker who may or may not be the poet, both joyful and traumatic, all centered around the color red. There are greater things in heav'n and Earth, Horatio, than you'd have imagined the color red to be useful in describing.<br /><br />An excellent performance. ****	2004-11-11

Jean-Claude Kovan, Going Deeper (Prism House, 2004)<br /><br />I really didn't think I was going to read a worse book than Roger Hailey's travesty Museum this year. And, to tell you the honest truth, I haven't... yet. One of the worst, most frustrating things about Going Deeper is that it's reasonably well-written, at about the same level of competence from that perspective as the books of James Redfield (and whatever you think about the psychospirituality behind The Celestine Prophecy, it does make a good adventure story when Redfield isn't trying to teach you a lesson). The problem is that Kovan can obviously write, and he's obviously got a message to tell, but no one bothered to hammer McLuhan's old truism into his head. Just having a message to impart is not enough; if the story doesn't tell the message, what you end up with is usually unreadable dreck. (A lesson many authors could stand to learn, not just Kovan; he just happens to be my particular target at this moment.) Kovan comes up with a decent, albeit vastly overused, setting, and some intriguing characters, but then plops said characters down in said setting and gets to teachin' without so much as a Celestinesque adventure. So despite Kovan's insistence that what's here is a novel (and despite the bits outside the novel where Kovan explains his reasons for writing the book-- which may be the furthest reaching into the fictional to be found between these covers), it reads a whole lot more like a how-to self-help book written by one of the great scammers of our age. I'm sure I don't have to name them, you all know the names, some of you have even read the books. At least Kovan as the sense not to try and pass this off as nonfiction. (zero)	2004-11-11

Viggo Mortensen, Recent Forgeries (1998, Smart Art Press)<br /><br />Did you know Viggo Mortensen, alternately by turns Lucifer, Aragorn, the American Yakuza, and Tex is also an accomplished painter, poet, short fiction writer, and musician? (Well, I'm taking the \\"musician\\" part on faith, because the CD had been removed from the copy of this I just finished by someone who is not me.) And I'm not talking \\"accomplished\\" like Jimmy Stewart, Jewel, and Ally Sheedy are accomplished. Nope, Mortensen can be a little loose with his verbiage sometimes, but the man's got it. (And, really, all those reviews from people who had never heard of the man until Lord of the Rings? Where you folks been for twenty years? You never saw The Prophecy? Albino Alligator? Witness? The Indian Runner? The awful remake of Psycho? Get thee to a video store.) And while I'm far less schooled in the arts of photography and painting than I am poetry, it's obvious that Mortensen's photographs have a definite thematic unity to them, when they show up in series, and that the man has an eye for what makes a good picture. The paintings, which have a more restrained Basquiat-esque feel (one wonders if Mortensen's dating Julian Schnabel's daughter had any effect on that), seem as if they're a bit more confused, but still powerful. I liked the representations of both here, certainly enough to go looking for Mortensen's other published works in those two areas.<br /><br />The poetry was what really floored me. The short fiction is good, but the poetry rips it up (aside, as I said, from some loose verbiage here and there). Mortensen is a man who truly understands the value of image in poetry. You'd think that obvious from someone who works in the film industry, but take a read of Jimmy Stewart's book sometime and get back to me on that. I guarantee you won't find anything as worthy of being called poetry as<br /><br />...An errant vine has sprouted<br /><br />two blue flowers<br /><br />where it reaches<br /><br />roots of the lemon tree.<br /><br />They are beautiful;<br /><br />I am suspicious.<br /><br />(\\"Cuttings\\")<br /><br />A wonderful little book.

McHugh has one of the strongest senses of rhythm, both in formal and free verse, I've come across in quite a while, and it usually manifests itself without drawing attention to the form (in those poems where one exists in this collection; the forms here are usually on the loose side anyway), an amazing achievement in a time when formal poetry may not be dead, but is lying in hospice, suffocated by the weight of a million teen-angst poets who think sonnets are for sissies and have never heard the word \\"canzone.\\" Read this. **** ½	2004-11-11

Henry Kuck, Winner's File (Morrow, 1993)<br /><br />When one is picking up a book on handicapping the horses, one is likely to find two things: outdated information and thoroughly inaccurate information. Sift through the book enough and you may well find some new ideas and things of value. The more of those you find, the better the book it is. (Hint: to date, I have not read any book on \\"smart money\\" that has a single word in it worth reading. Avoid them like the plague.)<br /><br />Winner's File, unfortunately, has little either new or accurate to offer. There is some stuff that makes it worth your time, though, but it's more a \\"take it out of the library\\" than \\"spend lots of time hunting down a copy.\\" Kuck has some interesting insights to offer, especially in the worlds of class and workouts, but most of the rest you've read before. Multiple times. It's arguable, as well, how much one can fault Kuck for his chapters on speed figures and bounce theory, both of which were relatively new as widely-accessible ideas at the time this book was written, but almost every word of the chapters he wrote on those topics in 1993 has by now been thoroughly discounted as the public has gained better knowledge about such things. (On the other hand, he's dead on about the public's use, abuse, misuse, and overuse of the term \\"track bias.\\" Go figure.)<br /><br />It's worth a look, but you probably won't canonize it. ** ½	2004-11-11

Peter Crowther (ed.), Cities (Four Walls Eight Windows, 2003)<br /><br />You're most likely going to either love this book or hate it. When it's good, it's very very good. But when it's bad, man, does it blow goat.<br /><br />Paul diFilippo starts things off with \\"A Year in the Linear City,\\" and while it's not the weakest story in the collection, it's just this side of unreadable. None of the characters is in any way engaging; the protagonist seems to attempt, over the course of it, to break out of his own self-absorbed shell (one of which surrounds every character here), but never really manages the sort of transformation that would be necessary to make the story worthwhile. Worse, everyone else is completely static.<br /><br />China Mieville then provides us with \\"The Tain.\\" Not Mieville's best work, to be sure, but certainly a refreshing change from the last bit. Readable, with the best spin on vampires since Brian Lumley took them on.<br /><br />The mighty Michael Moorcock chimes in third, with \\"Firing the Cathedral.\\" I've read hundreds of pieces of Moorcock's fiction, both short and long, and when he's on his game, he's one of the best writers on the planet. The Ice Schooner, Gloriana, the Elric novels... the one place where his writing has always been, to me, consistently lacking is in the Jerry Cornelius material. All of it that I've read, the sum total of which is the seven novels collected in Berkley's \\"The Cornelius Chronicles,\\" was disjointed, unreadable political screed masquerading as fiction. \\"Firing the Cathedral\\" is even more so than the stuff that preceded it. To call it disappointing would be a major understatement; Jerry Cornelius fans will probably like it, but if you've never read Moorcock, whatever you do, do not let this be your introduction to his work.<br /><br />Geoff Ryman rounds things out with \\"V. A. O.,\\" which is the only story in the book that demanded I sit and read it in one gulp. Imagine George Clayton Johnson's wonderful \\"Kick the Can\\" set in the world of cyberpunk and given a mystery plot. It is-- even with the presence of Mieville-- the highlight of the collection.<br /><br />Overall, though, the warm glow you get after you've finished Ryman's tale will quickly be overshadowed by your despair that you wasted valuable time reading two of the stories in here. **l \\"Kick the Can\\" set in the world of cyberpunk and given a mystery plot.

That sounds rather like utopia.<br /><br />If you pick up this book, you will learn about Orkney. You can forget tourist destinations, with the exception of a chapter in the back (which sounds much like most other travel writing). The bulk of the book is taken up with history, geology, the study of place names, population movements, that sort of thing. It's quite an excellent overview, given its brevity (just shy of two hundred fifty pages).

Get in on the ground floor.	Jim Goad, The Redneck Manifesto (Simon and Schuster, 1997)<br /><br />Three years before the publication of The Redneck Manifesto, Jim Goad was self-releasing the magazine ANSWER Me! on his own press, Goad to Hell Publications (who also published Peter Sotos' first collection, one of the only books I know of that was actively suppressed before being challenged through official channels), and standing trial for obscenity for issue #4. Fast-forward to 1997, and he's getting a hardback first-printing for a book I wouldn't have thought a major publisher would touch with a ten-foot pole.<br /><br />Maybe there IS some small hope for the world.<br /><br />That, ultimately, is what The Redneck Manifesto is about-- hope. Most people probably won't figure that out from reading it, though.<br /><br />The Redneck Manifesto is a two-hundred-fifty page rant, I grant you, but it is a savagely intelligent, well-researched, and downright laugh-out-loud funny rant, and like all the best rants throughout history, it has at its core both a simple truth, that the redneck is the last subsection of American society against which it's permissible to be prejudiced, and a solution to that truth, which in this case is that the rednecks, and the people who oppress the rednecks, have a common enemy who has manipulated them into being enemies.<br /><br />This is nothing new, of course. The power elite have been manipulating segments of the great unwashed against each other throughout human history. They're still doing it. (The Israelis and the Palestinians, anyone? The Orange Irish and the Green Irish? Shiites and Sunnis? The Tutsi and the Hutu? We could keep going like this all day.)<br /><br />Goad has a plan to get everyone clear-headed, but to say it's confrontational would be understating the case somewhat. His thrust in the first segment of the book is to make you aware that the word \\"redneck\\" is as much a slur as are many other words that we recognize as slurs now (and are thus unprintable in an Amazon review), and he does so by using them. A lot. For most people, there's going to be a shock factor, though it's surmountable-- especially if you're paying attention to what Goad is driving at.<br /><br />From there, he launches into a very well-researched history of the redneck, which further clarifies a point he made in the beginning: that the modern redneck, contrary to popular wisdom, is not the architect of American race-hatred; quite the opposite. It's the book's most \\"scholarly\\" section, but it still reads like a rant, and that's a wonderful thing.<br /><br />After that, three chapters on the culture of the redneck. It should be no surprise to those who know Goad's work that they come off kind of like a rapper telling N-word jokes; \\"it's okay, because I'm a member of the oppressed group.\\" There's more to it than that, though; Goad is a misanthrope more than he is a redneck, and you can't just turn off the jaundiced-eye filter. This, ultimately, is what gives the book its highest street-cred marks; Goad doesn't make the same mistake other oppressed-minority writers do in confusing a desire for equality with a desire for revenge. He's not talking about the redneck rising supreme to put its boot on the neck of any other oppressed minority, he's talking about all of them, with all their many faults, rising up as one to overthrow The Man.<br /><br />The book concludes with a strenuous, energetic dissection of those groups who really need to be brought down with extreme prejudice. If you don't get fired up after reading the chapter on the banking industry, pal, check your pulse.<br /><br />This is an important piece of work, and it's especially relevant in the post-2004-election atmosphere of restless natives presently pervading the country. If you're breaking your back for The Man, be you white collar, blue collar, no collar, redneck, black neck, white neck, jobless, homeless, whatever, read this book. It is, potentially, a life-changing experience.*****e-changing experience. *****	2004-11-11

Brian Overland, C++ Without Fear (Prentice Hall, 2004)<br /><br />I have commented on it before, and I will no doubt comment on it again. Second to \\"if it saves just one,\\" \\"beyond the scope of this book\\" is the most offensive phrase in the English language. It is a phrase that seems to be especially epidemic among those who write and publish computer books. Why is nothing beyond the scope of, say, a biography (especially one written by Kitty Kelley)? Or beyond the scope of larger, thicker computer books? I don't have an answer. Neither do most of the computer book authors and publishers I've talked to (the ones who don't use the phrase. The others don't seem to like to talk much). Lynn Harrison, in his introductory book on 3D Game Engine Design, hints at a probable reason: if it's \\"beyond the scope of this book,\\" the publisher can get another fifty bucks out of you when the author writes the next book.<br /><br />The main problem with C++ Without Fear, as it is with a few other books I've reviewed, is that one of those things beyond the scope of the book is Windows programming. Hey, you, computer publishers: listen, and listen well. It's 2004. Over half the people who buy your books are going to be native Windows programmers. 99% of them (excluding a few diehard Unix shell holdouts) are going to be programming in an operating system that supports a graphic interface, be it Windows, Xwindows, Mac, what have you. Not taking GUI programming into account is ludicrous; saying it's \\"beyond the scope of this book\\" is silly. We have thousands of examples of books of the same basic length of which graphics programming was not beyond the scope. We know it's a cop-out, and we recognize it as a cop-out.<br /><br />That said, the rest of the book works very well. Overland writes in an accessible, engaging tone that does a good job of demystifying some of the more complex pieces of C++ (and is even a worthwhile reference for C++ programmers who have moved into the .NET world; the way Overland explains some things will make concepts clearer in C#, for example Interfaces and Delegates). Each of his examples is thoroughly dissected, so that even the beginnerest of beginners can figure out what he's on about. He even manages to draw the distinction between pointers and reference types with greater clarity than I have ever seen in a C++ book (and I've read a lot of them).<br /><br />All that's missing is, well, the Windows. I'd speculate on whether Overland is one of those diehard Unix shell guys, but that's beyond the scope of this review. ** ½d; the way Overland explains some things will make concepts clearer in C#, for example Interfaces and Delegates).

Denis, The Gambling Times Guide to Thoroughbred Racing (Gambling Times/Lyle Stuart, 1984)<br /><br />R. G. Denis, the back of this book proclaims, is one of \\"the world's greatest racing authorities.\\" Which makes me wonder how he can think that a colt becomes a horse \\"past the age of three\\" (a colt becomes a horse when he turns five), or that Lexington's 238 winners, \\"a record not likely to ever be endangered,\\" had already been broken at least once by the time the book was written (Noholme II, who died in 1983, sired two hundred seventy-nine winners; I suspect that Glenelg broke it long before that, but can't find the numbers I need to be sure of that). The complete lack of any link to reality in the book's opening pages casts quite a pall over it. This continues thanks to a large number of errors that may also be factual, but have an equal probability of being typographical.<br /><br />Still, that's not to say there's nothing here of value. Denis discounts the two most overrated factors in handicapping, weight and workouts, and is one of the few writers before the nineties to have done so. Also, when he finally does get into handicapping (a very, very small portion of this very, very small book; barring examples, about five pages of this book are spent on handicapping discussion), there's some good common-sense stuff that most folks might have picked up on whilst learning themselves, but that I've never seen written in a book before, and I've read a whole lot of handicapping books (there are over a hundred in my bookshelf at home, and add to that those I can get from the local library).<br /><br />Still, a colt becomes a horse at four? * ½	2004-09-30

Stewart Home, The Assault on Culture: Utopian Currents from Lettrisme to Class War (Aporia Press/Unpopular Books, 1988)<br /><br />Home's first published work, The Assault on Culture is a slim survey of twentieth-century avant-garde art in which Home attempts to draw the influences that ran through various Utopian artistic movements. It was a first step in a right direction, though one no one (including Home) has picked up on in the intervening fifteen years. Pity, as Home (who knows he's only scratching the surface, ans as much as says so in the afterward) laid the groundwork for a unified field theory of the avant-garde that could be a truly groundbreaking work. If he were to return to it now, given Home's ever-increasing popularity, he could come up with a definitive volume. Look at The Assault on Culture as an outline of what might have been.<br /><br />The chapters are short and snappy, introducing the reader to various movements (most of which he's probably never heard of), tracing the back-and-forth of various artists within them and touching on the political upheavals that led to person X getting kicked out of movement A and going on to form movement B, or what have you. In one sense, The Assault on Culture is a family tree. It is perhaps best looked at this way, and as something upon which others could build future research. So what are you waiting for? Hop to it. ***	2004-09-30

Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Miracle Fruit (Tupelo Press, 2003)<br /><br />One of the fringe benefits of being a reviewer in the age of the Internet is that finding information on authors is much easier. A perusal of Aimee Nezhukumatathil's weblog shows us a woman who is (or comes across on the Internet, at least) funny, but in a quiet rather than a slapstick way; beautiful; shockingly intelligent, but with enough presence of mind to know when to dump the brain and rely on the heart, the gut, or the funny bone; thoughtful, observant; somewhat humble. It should not surprise many that her first book-length collection, Miracle Fruit, is a perfect mirror of these traits. It is also, in many places, unexpected; old ground gets fresh, surprising treatment. Even the hoary old love poem gets a new luster:<br /><br />\\"...I like to think of Orion--<br /><br />not hunting at the moment,<br /><br />but nudging fools like me out of the way, saying<br /><br />not your turn, not like this. I ignore him, press on, until<br /><br />I come to that ruddy shoulder and find it's too big<br /><br />to even try to circle around. The way it pulses just a little<br /><br />makes me think of my own blood in my veins,<br /><br />how it flows and kisses each muscle only<br /><br />as long as I stay put upon this earth. And maybe he's right:<br /><br />scribbling notes on lovers' shoulders, necks, throats--<br /><br />is not the way. But I love the trying, not the mess, the rugs<br /><br />and dust scattered. Only this sweet business of trying.\\"<br /><br />(\\"Betelgeuse\\")<br /><br />The book is full of clever twists and turns, with a gentle, self-deprecating humor that casts the poems here in molds that lend themselves to the easiest of reading, that beguile the reader into letting them linger on the tongue long after the final word is spoken. This is fine work, some of the best poetry released in recent years that's come across my desk; mark the (easy-to-remember, certainly) name Aimee Nezhukumatathil, for if there is any justice in the poetic world, you will be seeing it a lot more in the years to come. A strong candidate for my top twenty-five reads of the year. **** ½the poetic world, you will be seeing it a lot more in the years to come.

Juliana Gray Vice, History in Bones (Kent State University Press, 2001)<br /><br />It is usually the case that long poems do little in a chapbook other than take up space. With Juliana Gray Vice's History in Bones, however, the long poem therein (\\"Bird, Smoke, Crystal, Bone\\") is in fact the centerpiece of the whole book, its strongest single work.<br /><br />\\"The necromancer's future is found in death,<br /><br />the numerologist's in holy math,<br /><br />the tasseomancer's in a teacup's sodden leaves.<br /><br />And mine? Tonight, already morning's cusp<br /><br />and the new year's darkling dawn, the best<br /><br />and last I have is stichomancy, the search<br /><br />for fateful meaning in random pages of books.<br /><br />The future's a glossary of Latin roots.\\"<br /><br />(\\"Bird, Smoke, Crystal, Bone\\")<br /><br />The passage serves as an excellent synecdoche for the book as a whole, marking both the strengths (Vice's sense of natural rhythm, the deadpan delivery of her best lines, a keen sense of irony) and weaknesses (a touch of overwriting here and there, instead of understating, to get the rhythm, e.g. \\"darkling dawn\\" or \\"fateful meaning,\\" giving us things we can find ourselves). The strengths do outweigh the weaknesses, and History in Bones is a worthwhile collection for reader perusal. It may be a bit hard to track down these days, but it's worth it. ***	2004-09-30

Peter Gizzi, Some Values of Landscape and Weather (Wesleyan, 2003)<br /><br />I had the good fortune to see Peter Gizzi read at the Painted Bride in Philadelphia back in 1992 (and share a bleary late-night breakfast with him and a few others afterwards). That was many moons ago, of course, and my memory not being what it once was, the only impression I still have of that night is being very impressed with both of the night's featured readers, the other being Liz Willis. I'd picked up a chapbook of Willis' that night, so I've been able to keep my impressions vaguely fresh; not so with Gizzi. For some reason, it took me twelve years to pick up one of his books. I wish I'd done so sooner.<br /><br />Some Values of Landscape and Weather is a good, solid book of poetry in the tradition of good, solid American poetry of the latter half of the century that doesn't really correspond to a particular school; Yussef Komunyakaa would be a good parallel example. But between the good books and the very good books there is something indefinable. A way of seeing, perhaps, or a better ability than most to translate vision to the page. All the best American poets (and most likely all the rest) have it, in some fashion or another, be they as widely hailed as Hayden Carruth or as relatively unknown as Chris Stroffolino. Peter Gizzi has it. In spades. There is not a poem in this \\"long-awaited\\" (Booklist) collection that strays from whatever path it is they're on, rarely more than a word or two out of place. The descriptions and their underlying layers of meaning are as perfectly striated as the jaw muscles on a Mako. Simply, Gizzi can not only make you see, he can make you believe.<br /><br />A fantastic piece of work. **** ½	2004-09-30

Charles Bukowski, Life and Death in the Charity Ward (London Magazine Editions, 1974)<br /><br />Reading an early book (released early in his career) by an icon is often an amusing experience; it's the opposite of \\"soon to be a major motion picture!' never coming to fruition. The copywriter for LM writes that Bukowski is \\"justifiably becoming best-known for his stories.\\" News to those of us reading this thirty years later.<br /><br />The stories collected here are some of Buk's rawest material, and that's saying something. They go beyond the crude and into the obscene; it's pretty easy to see why no one has picked this one up for reprinting, though one would think a more extreme press (Creation comes to mind) would jump at the chance to get this stuff back out on the streets. The stories, which one wavers between believing autobiographical and hoping to god they're not, detail the lives of various alcoholic losers. Some of them also have amusing side traits like being rapists or child molesters. They're written in the typical Buk slice-of-life style, but the reader is left hoping that these are slices of no one's life.<br /><br />What makes them worth reading is that they are written in the typical Buk slice-of-life style. Being short stories, they never have the chance to lose their pace, the way the novels sometimes do, and while they all sound the same after a while, there are enough differences in the characters (when they're not focusing on Buk himself-- who may not be the writer in some cases, but a character with the same name-- or Buk's longtime character Hank Chinaski) to keep them separate, at least while you're reading.<br /><br />Deeply disquieting. Not nearly the book Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame or War All the Time is, but a good one for those who prefer the fiction to the poetry, or want to see just how brutal fiction could be in 1974. (They are also advised to seek out Joyce Carol Oates' best novel, Cybele, published the same year and never reprinted for exactly the same reason.) ***never reprinted for exactly the same reason.) ***	2004-09-30

Isobel Bird, Circle of Three: So Mote It Be (Harper, 2001)<br /><br />I made the mistake of reading the first book in Isobel Bird's Circle of Three series too soon after reading J. G. Passarella's fantastic novel Wither, obviously, because I read the many reviews of this book and wonder what they're talking about.<br /><br />Between Amazon and various other sites, I've come across seventy-five or so reviews of So Mote It Be, and many of them adhere to the same theme: the book's treatment of wicca. And while Bird certainly takes a more knowledgeable and open-minded approach to the subject than most authors, what's done here doesn't hold half a candle to Passarella's treatment of the same material; this is Dick and Jane to Passarella's Cormac McCarthy.<br /><br />That aside, I would have been more than willing to overlook the simplistic treatment of that aspect of the source material had the characters been worthwhile. Problem is, well, they're not. Bird violates rule number one of writing for kids/young adults: \\"don't talk down to your audience.\\" The characters here are straight out of Sweet Valley High, both the protagonists and their nemeses, the popular kids. There's no depth whatsoever to a single character to be found here. (Granted, some of them Bird is setting up for later books, and there it's excusable. But in your main characters? Never.)<br /><br />Those who found Kate an excellent role model (and again I say she would be, were she at all three-dimensional), I cannot recommend highly enough you go procure yourselves a copy of J. G. Passarella's Wither. Now. This very moment. An enthusiastic (and accurate) approach to wicca can, truly, be found in a three-dimensional character, and that character is Wendy Ward. **	2004-09-30

Bad Boy Bubby (Rolf de Heer, 1993)<br /><br />de Heer's (The Quiet Room, The Old Man Who Read Love Stories) fourth film is a marked departure from anything he'd done before; in fact, it's a marked departure from anything anyone had done before. It's twisted, grotesque, certifiable, and in its own way, incredibly sweet.<br /><br />Nicholas Hope (Henry Fool, Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid) starts in the title role, a man, perhaps autistic, who's been a bad boy (no surprise). He's been so bad that his mother (Robbery Under Arms' Claire Benito, in her only leading role) has kept him locked in the house his whole life, and he's had no human contact other than her. She's convinced him the air outside the house is poisoned, so when he is forced out into the world after a visit from his long-estranged father, he's not only completely unprepared for human contact, but scared to breathe, as well. After he leaves the house, we follow him through a series of adventures that teach him (in warped ways, granted) to communicate with those around him and with the outside world. It's the old Jeff Bridges movie Starman filtered through Oedipus Rex.<br /><br />I'll warn you, the first half hour of this film is going to drive many people away. The dynamic between Bubby and his mother is a little too weird for the mainstream mind to handle; as well, the first third of the film plays out more like a psychological horror film than the dark comedy it really is. If you have problems with the first half hour, persevere. Once Bubby gets out of the house, things lighten up a good deal (though the humor in the film is never lighter than, say, midnight blue). Bubby's arrested development, both emotional and social, makes for some wonderfully twisted comedy (and, needless to say, various adolescent obsessions that one would expect more from a Hollywood comedy, but they're done here with a little more style-- emphasis on little).Inside the whole thing really does rest a heart of gold; while Bubby may have trouble interacting with the outside world, once he meets people who understand him, the movie reveals a surprisingly sweet center inside the sour coating.<br /><br />Bad Boy Bubby may not be the best-constructed film in the world, and many viewers will likely find it somewhat crude, but it's still a must-see. *** ½d; while Bubby may have trouble interacting with the outside world, once he meets people who understand him, the movie reveals a surprisingly sweet center inside the sour coating. <br /> <br />Bad Boy Bubby may not be the best-constructed film in the world, and many viewers will likely find it somewhat crude, but it's still a must-see. ***  <br />	2004-09-24

Marzulli, Nephilim: The Truth Is Here (Zondervan, 1999)<br /><br />I have no idea what sort of odd conjunction has been having me reading so much Christian fiction this month. I had no idea what Nephilim was when I put it on hold at the library, and after picking it up and reading the back, I figured this would be an easy one: bite off fifty pages in an hour, hate it, throw it against the wall, write a scathing review of any Christian book that doesn't know how to correctly interpret Genesis 6:4 on its back cover.<br /><br />More fool me.<br /><br />Nephilim, which is an obvious satire on/parody of/homage to The X-Files given the subtitle, is the most subtle piece of Christian fiction I've read since the last time I picked up a Madeleine L'Engle novel. Marzulli's raison d'etre is to tell his story, and the preaching never once gets in the way of it, not even during the main character's conversion to Christianity halfway through the novel. This fact alone is enough to put it head and shoulders over most of the other modern Christian fiction I've found in my hands.<br /><br />Second, it does address the differing interpretation of Genesis 6:4, and while the evidence used to back it up fills only a single paragraph in a four-hundred-fifty-page book, it's evidence that at the very least Marzulli realized that the interpretation he was using as the basis for the novel's action was controversial enough that he had to justify it at all.<br /><br />Third, the novel does, in fact, have a plot. Art \\"Mac\\" MacKenzie is a former LA Times reporter who's been down on his luck since the death of his son, Art Jr. He's gotten divorced and turned into a hardcore drunk who gets just enough freelance assignments from the paper to pay the rent and keep him in Grand Marnier (those must be some nicely-paying freelance assignments; the guy buys it by the case). One day, the bone he gets thrown is to cover the opening of a new wing of a local hospital. While doing so, he hears rumors about the government keeping alien abductees on the sixth floor. What he finds when he sneaks back in sends him halfway around the world, unsure of whom to trust, to find out whether the so-called aliens are really extraterrestrials or demons working to subvert the second coming of Christ.<br /><br />No, there's nothing new here in the wonderful world of the paranormal. Not that there usually is. But Marzulli's writing is solid and readable, his characters are well-enough drawn to at least make an attempt at three dimensions (well, most of them, anyway), and while the ending is predictable, that's only the case because of the novel's Christian slant (one assumes the author will not have his just-converted protagonist go breaking the seventh commandment at will, and one is not disappointed).<br /><br />Certainly not the best book I've ever read in either the world of Christian fiction (L'Engle, of course, towers over most other authors of modern Christian fiction; she's easily in the same league with Francois Mauriac and his contemporaries) or paranormal/sci-fi action (early stuff by Greg Bear, especially Eon and Blood Music, are recommended for the Marzulli fan who wants to branch out), but it clicks very nicely on both levels, and left me wanting to read the other two books in the trilogy. *** ½s rumors about the government keeping alien abductees on the sixth floor.

Rogers, Jagutai and Lilitu (Infinitypublishing.com, 2001)<br /><br />I knew it had to happen sometime-- Christian high-fantasy porn. And I dreaded that day. But that day is here, and I doubt it's going away any time soon. I wasn't really aware of it when I started Jagutai and Lilitu, but it (the high-fantasy porn bit, at least) became obvious quite early on. The Christian bit pops in later, but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Jagutai and Lilitu begins where the first book in the series, Blood and Pearls, left off. (Full disclosure: I haven't read Blood and Pearls.) Jagutai has fled Khymir, disgusted with the city. Zancharthus has overthrown the rule of the previous despot, Dessicatorius, and ascended to the position himself, while also priming himself to become the high priest of Tchernobog, the subject of one of the city's death cults. Zancharthus, however, doesn't believe Tchernobog exists, and intends to use his power to destroy the cult as part of his efforts to reform the city. Zancharthus sends, again, for Jagutai, who doesn't want to go back. The problem is, he's an ascetic who's fascinated with a temple prostitute, Lilitu, from a rival death cult, that of Tsa Terrathu. Tsa Terrathu's previous high priestess, Torisanna, has left the cult and is now Zancharthus' paramour/wife (depending on how you want to look at it).<br /><br />And that's all in the first five pages.<br /><br />After the first couple of chapters, I didn't want to like this book. Not because of the prurience, of which I am always a fan, but because the writing in the first pages is deadly dull. I understand the author has to catch things up for those already involved in the series and introduce all the (many, many) plot threads for those who are coming in fresh. But I decided before I threw it against a wall I'd give it until the promised Possessed Pig Harem mentioned on the back cover. (It's not as funny as it sounds, as the back cover also says.) When I got through that section, which contains a reference to events covered in Book Three of the series, and I found myself knowing I was going to read said Book Three, I knew I was in trouble.<br /><br />(Now the Christian bit shows up, but I'll leave you to read for yourself. Let's just say the symbolism is not disguised in any way.)<br /><br />Once the book takes off, it really does take off. It took me a full month to read this, and I finished the last two hundred pages in just over a week. (Yes, the first hundred are that bad.) The first bit reads like a bad Beeline porn novel with not as much sex; the last bit reads like what Moorcock's Gloriana might have, if Moorcock had been drunk, stoned on pain medication, and more of an immoral lecher while writing it. (Gloriana, for those of you who've not read it, is the high point of high-fantasy erotica. Go find a copy and read it. Now.) I think the transition is that it starts taking itself a bit more seriously as a novel, as opposed to a work of Christian high-fantasy porn, and so starts reading like a piece of fiction rather than a piece of genre fiction. Some of the characters are still two-dimensional, but some minor ones get fleshed out to the point where you start caring about them, and the whole Tchernobog thing starts becoming more of a compelling point.<br /><br />That said, there are still some flaws in the latter part of the book. Most notably, Rogers introduces a whole new plotline about three-quarters of the way through with no indication it is in any way tied to anything that has come before (it is, but in the most tenuous of ways; you'll figure it out in the last few pages). Not necessarily an unforgivable sin when working in a series, but Rogers could take a tip from Moorcock, Robert Parker, or any of the other greats where series fiction is concerned on how to structure such things. (I'm assuming here that the events involved in the plotline will become important in the third book, Night of the Long Knives; depending on to whom you listen, NotLK is either the conclusion to the trilogy or the third in a five-book series. I'll report back after I read it. In any case, if said events don't end up playing a major role, I'm going to drop the rating on this one a star.)<br /><br />Readable, once you get to the meat of the story, and ends up being quite fun. Just give yourself until the Possessed Pig Harem, and if you're still not convinced, feel free to throw it against the wall. ***nding on to whom you listen, NotLK is either the conclusion to the trilogy or the third in a five-book series.

Holt, Wolf Moon (Bantam Spectra, 1997)<br /><br />John Holt's third (as far as I have been able to discern) novel is sort of a continuation of his second, The Convocation; it's another Children of the Griffin novel, this one set in the small upstate New York town of St. Claire. The town's two most important families, the St. Claires and the Balthazars, have been waging quiet war against one another for generations, and are down to two St. Claires and an unspecified (at the beginning) number of Balthazars, along with each side's various allies. A few characters from The Convocation pop up now and again, but you can't really call Wolf Moon a sequel to The Convocation in any real sense; it's more another novel set with the same parameters, a number of years later, with almost an entirely new cast of characters. One of those new characters is Freya Kellgren, an ally of the Balthazar clan who is an entity all her own who adds another dimension of oddity to the plot. Holt never quite reveals the true nature and powers of Kellgren's character; it's almost as if he's setting us up for a third Children of the Griffin novel (which has not, to date, materialized). Most, if not all, of the pieces are in place. All we can do now is hope the man gets another one out at some point in the future.<br /><br />Wolf Moon has many of the same weaknesses as The Convocation, with the principal one being that the book starts off slow. Once you've been introduced to all the main characters and have the backstory down, though, things pick up. It has all the same strengths, however, and like he Convocation, the strengths make the book well worth reading. Holt draws his characters very well, and once the pace picks up he knows how to spin a tale well enough that you don't really notice the lack of bloodshed for the first three quarters of what purports to be a horror novel; Holt spends his time getting you involved in the lives of the principals, instead, drawing the lines on the map of the battlefield and showing the reader the intricacies of the allegiances.<br /><br />Very good stuff, well worth hunting down. *** ½ap of the battlefield and showing the reader the intricacies of the allegiances. <br /> <br />Very good stuff, well worth hunting down. *** 	2004-09-14

Bennett, ed., Loose Watch: A Lost and Found Times Anthology (Invisible, 1999)<br /><br />I was surprised my library actually had this in stock. The work of John M. Bennett, and the annals of his long-running mail-art mag Lost and Found Times, are notoriously hard to find. I'm proud of my ability to have hunted down two of Bennett's books in the past ten years. To find this treasure in the stacks at the local library was astonishing.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be a faster read; Lost and Found Times has been quite graphically-oriented during the time I've been aware of its existence (since 1991). But it turns out the magazine's first twenty years were more about the text, and so while the two hundred pages here do contain a good deal of collage, word art, and other such fancies, there's a lot of text to work with, too. Be prepared.<br /><br />Lost and Found Times, over the years, has featured some of the premier avant-garde literary names (Ivan Arguelles, Bennett himself, Al Ackerman, etc.) and some that should be premier, but have unfortunately become obscure (the great prose poet Robert Nagler being the foremost of them reprinted here). Bennett reprints what he considers the best of the magazine's output over the years, and there is truly some fantastic stuff to be found between the covers of this book. There's some mush, too, but it's an anthology. You expect it. If Andrei Codrescu couldn't put together two hundred pages of top-notch work for the Exquisite Corpse anthology that came out fifteen years ago, no one else has any hope. (Codrescu gave it the good old college try, though, and The Stiffest of the Corpse falls only inches shy of everlasting greatness; a fantastic read, and highly recommended here at Goat Central. But I digress.)<br /><br />Perhaps the book's most pleasurable surprise is a series of Al Ackerman-penned prose articles called Ack's Wacks; alternately hysterical and horrifying, Ackerman gives himself free rein to be totally nuts, and does a fantastic job. This, folks, is comedy of the highest sort, and Ack's Wacks alone are more than enough reason to seek this out. But the evolution of Bennett from avant-garde wordsmith to dyslexia artist is also documented, and for anyone who's gotten a taste of the insanity that is Bennett's handwritten poetic musings (the covers of his own Was Ah and Ivan Arguelles' Chac Prostibulario are excellent examples), this is a great way to see how he got started writing close-to-indecipherable weirdness.<br /><br />There are, of course, pieces that fail to please, but the majority of what's here is well worth reading. A definitive catalogue of twenty-five years of the avant-garde in America. *** ½ally nuts, and does a fantastic job.

Harrison, Introduction to 3D Game Engine Design in C# (Apress, 2003)<br /><br />The main problem with Lynn Harrison's book is that, well, the code doesn't compile. Which isn't his fault; Microsoft made some changes in the version of the DirectX Software Development Kit that came out just after the book's release that compromised the code. But nine months go by, and no code update? Not a promising sign.<br /><br />That aside, this is a lucid, easy-to-understand book about, well, 3D Game Engine design. There could have been clearer explanation in some places, and it should have been noted at the start that the book wouldn't be presenting the code in an order the reader could type it in himself (typing in book code will beat downloading it from the website, where learning is concerned, every time). But getting past those minor problems, this is a quite workable piece of writing, and anyone who's been programming in C# for a few months should know enough to get the hang of the basics, and be able to pick up the rest from the book itself. Recommended. *** ½	2004-09-14

Anne Lamott, Bird By Bird (Doubleday, 1994)<br /><br />For years, people have been recommending I read Anne Lamott's Bird By Bird. I have always countered with Natalie Goldberg (Wild Mind and Writing Down the Bones are the best pair of how-to-write books I have ever read). Now, I will do the same thing, but I can tack on \\"well, I HAVE read Bird By Bird\\" at the end.<br /><br />Whatever else Bird by Bird is, it's exceptionally well-written. It reads far less like a how-to manual or transcripts of class lectures than it does a conversation you're sitting and having with someone over burgers and drinks. It is an easy, excellent read, and there is much to be found in it of worth. It is good to remember, however, that everyone approaches writing in a slightly different method, and what works for Anne Lamott may not work for you. Much of what's here is universal (writers, in the main, should find writing groups and workshops to get their stuff critiqued, for example), but some will only work for a select few; others may find themselves frustrated.<br /><br />Ultimately, that's why I'm still calling Goldberg's first two books the best pair of how-to-write books I have ever read, but Bird By Bird comes in a solid third. Even non-writers are likely to get something out of this. A deeper appreciation in reading, perhaps. But one way or the other, read it. ****	2004-09-14

Gretchen Worden, The Mutter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia (Blast, 2002)<br /><br />Gretchen Worden has been the director of the Mutter Museum for over twenty years now. One of the best things that's happened under her rule has been the institution of the Mutter Museum Calendar in 1994. Since then (and in rare cases before), photographers and fine artists have been coming to the school in record numbers. Here, Worden collects the best of their works, along with a couple of light introductory essays, into a collection of great beauty, but always with a hint of revulsion to it.<br /><br />There are certainly some surprises; one expects to find, say, Joel-Peter Witkin's work here, but not that of William Wegman (the weimaraner guy). Most of the photographs here are simple pictures of things that reside in the museum, but some arrange them interestingly, or come up with some weird, Witkin-esque setting, turning the pictures into true fascinating grotesqueries.<br /><br />Must be seen to be believed (Weimeraners as Chang and Eng? Brilliant!). ****	2004-09-14

Deitel, Deitel, Listfield, Nieto, Yeager, and Zlatinka, C# How to Program (Prentice Hall, 2002)<br /><br />One would think, given how much this book and CD package costs, you'd at least get a good title. Yes, the title is as above. Not even a colon to make it halfway grammatically correct. Just \\"C# How to Program.\\" Sheesh. The title does not indicate the remainder of the text, however. C#HTP (I can't bring myself to type that title again) is good, solid intro stuff, with a couple of detours out into places that C# books don't normally go (e.g., accessibility features in C# or C#'s implementations of the traditional LinkedList and Queue structures, neither of which I've seen covered in any other C# book I've read). It reads somewhat dry, like a textbook, but let's face it; the Deitels are textbook authors. You shouldn't be expecting Stephen King.<br /><br />The book itself is actually something of an afterthought, it seems. The whole thing (and extra appendices they didn't put in the book) can be found on the accompanying CD-ROM, with a whole lot of audio and video extras, programming tips, code, etc. integrated into the text. The presentation is quite nice, though the fixed nature of the pop-up code sample boxes makes a few of them somewhat harder to read than they probably should be. (\\"Fixed\\" as in you can't change the width of the blocks of text therein.) Good stuff. I'm not sure it's worth the amount it retails for, but if you can find a reasonably-priced used copy on Amazon (\\"reasonably priced,\\" here, means \\"about the same amount you'd pay for other computer books of this level of detail\\"), it's worth picking up. *** ½	2004-09-07

Barbara Libby, I Rode the Red Horse: Secretariat's Belmont Race (Eclipse Press, 2003)<br /><br />There are few things in life I treasure more than kids' books about horse racing. With attendance at the races and TV ratings so anemic, anything the sport's fans, higher-ups, and participants can do to bring new generations of fans into the fold is a wonderful thing. What better way to get them thinking about the ponies at an early age than books like this and the recent one about Seabiscuit's match race with War Admiral? Eclipse Press, to be sure, is doing their part.<br /><br />The problem is, the book itself isn't all that great. The illustrations are quite nicely-done, in an almost pointillist style, but keeping enough detail so that the reader can tell what's going on. Where the book falls is in Libby's prose. A Publisher's Weekly review of the book leads me to believe Libby simply transcribed Turcotte's own account. If so, she would have been well within her rights to take some artistic license, because the prose in this book has an odd, stilted quality to it; it's recognizably English, of course, but the grammar and sentence structure throughout are liable to make you wonder if English was the writer's first language (Turcotte, a Canada native, was born in New Brunswick, so it's possible French was his first language, but I'm not sure.)<br /><br />Because of this, the book might best be suited to those not quite old enough to read yet; let them absorb the pictures first, see the Belmont replayed on TV (which happens every year, of course, about a hundred times over during ESPN's Triple Crown coverage) a few times, and then let them get into the verbiage of the thing. Older kids who aren't yet old enough to have a good enough understanding of the grammatical rules of English, which is the target audiences of the book (grades 1-3), may be left scratching their heads, unable to puzzle out why some of the sentences are written the way they are. Which can lead to far more embarrassing questions than \\"where did I come from?\\" ** ½o far more embarrassing questions than \\"where did I come from?\\" ** 	2004-09-07

China Mieville, Iron Council (Del Rey, 2004)<br /><br />China Mieville's first three novels rocketed him to prominence in the fields of both fantasy and science fiction. His fourth, Iron Council, is another excellent book, but seems to have slipped a bit from the brilliance of Perdido Street Station. You're going to slog through this for a while, but believe me, it's worth it in the end.<br /><br />Two intertwining stories weave their ways through the novel. The first concerns Cutter and his band of renegades wandering through the woods seeking a man who's wandering through the woods seeking a legendary enclave of outcasts. The second concerns Ori, still in New Crobuzon (the vast city in which Perdido Street Station was set), a \\"doubler\\" (Double-R, a reader of the Runagate Rampant, the underground newspaper whose circulation was much discussed in PSS) who's fed up with the endless talking and wants to do something. Ori meets a man named Spiral Jacobs, who sometimes seems crazy and sometimes seems as if he can get Ori in touch with people more willing to act than talk.<br /><br />These two storylines (which do eventually come together) go quickly enough, though the one inside the city moves faster than the one in the wilderness. However, a couple of hundred pages in, Mieville puts in a completely different story, that of the Perpetual Train. (It does relate; it's the story of one of the principals, which happens concurrent to the events in PSS, if I've got my timeline right.) The Perpetual Train, which could have been a short novel in itself, is absorbing. It is also brutally slow. You'll spend more time on that part of the book than you do on the rest combined.<br /><br />Once you're past the long tale of the Perpetual Train, and everything starts fitting together, the book picks up. The ending is Mieville through and through, with all sorts of things blowing up and yet a quiet, understated feel to the whole thing that doesn't allow for explosive endings. Iron Council is a queer, murkily-colored book, quite like the rest of Mieville's material, and another fine one; it could probably have used a bit of trimming here and there to enhance its readability, but it won't steer you wrong.****on Council is a queer, murkily-colored book, quite like the rest of Mieville's material, and another fine one; it could probably have used a bit of trimming here and there to enhance its readability, but it won't steer you wrong.****	2004-09-07

Andrew Hudgins, Saints and Strangers (Houghton Mifflin, 1985)<br /><br />Saints and Strangers may be the single best debut book of poetry I have ever read. Hudgins, who has since gone on to what amounts to true fame in the poetry world (read: having published a piece of prose in the Poets on Poetry series of books), had obvious talent from the get-go, and subsequent releases have shown that this wasn't a fluke, which makes it all the more wonderful. He has a natural flair for word choice, an excellent grasp of image, and mostly gets the line breaks right. A representative sample from the eight-poem-long title piece:<br /><br />\\"...They punched him down, took turns kicking his ribs,<br /><br />while thirty old women and sixteen men<br /><br />sat slack-jawed in their folding chairs and watched.<br /><br />Just twelve, not knowing what to do, I launched<br /><br />int \\"Amazing Grace\\"-- the only hymn<br /><br />I knew by heart-- and everybody sang.<br /><br />We sang until the hunters grew ashamed<br /><br />-- or tired-- and left, taking their guns,<br /><br />their faces red and gleaming from the work....\\"<br /><br />(\\"At the Piano\\")<br /><br />Yes, Hudgins' work is probably not something to read while entertaining thoughts of slitting one's wrists.<br /><br />He only gets it really, hilariously wrong once:<br /><br />\\"In Northern Germany the bogs dispense<br /><br />the modern bodies of prehistoric men,<br /><br />the corpses lugubriously bobbing up<br /><br />like a fragile, slow, insistent dream...\\"<br /><br />(\\"The Bog of the Fathers\\")<br /><br />\\"Lugubriously\\" is not a word that should have ever been used in a poem, and the good cod willin' and the cricks don't rise, it never will be again.<br /><br />Still, despite that and a minimum of line break problems, Saints and Strangers is an awe-inspiring piece of work.

Hayden Carruth, The Sleeping Beauty (Copper Canyon, 1990)<br /><br />The Sleeping Beauty is a long (125-section) poem from Carruth, one that seems fragmented at first but gradually pulls together; mythology, dreams, jazz, all worked into something that could equally be a poem of love or hate, depending on the reader's perspective. As is usual with Carruth, the language flows, but often with the speed of cold molasses; Carruth's work goes from being accessible to being thick, sometimes within the same poem.<br /><br />Not a good place to start with Carruth (the best place is Collected Shorter Poems 1946-1991, also released by Copper Canyon), but definitely worthy for established fans. ***	2004-09-07

William Donoghue, The Donoghue Strategies (Bantam, 1989)<br /><br />William Donoghue made his name by making money, and having most of the people to whom he was a financial adviser make money, during the Wall Street crash of 1987. Scarcely a year and a half later, Donoghue codified the how-tos of what he did in The Donoghue Strategies.<br /><br />I'd probably never have come across this book had it not been so highly recommended by handicapping author Dick Mitchell in the last chapter of his book Commonsense Betting. I'm glad he pushed it, because The Donoghue Strategies combines the kinds of common sense that no one really thinks about with beginning approaches to very complex financial planning. I suspected some of the information might be out of date over a decade later, but that seems not to be the case; the products and strategies Donoghue recommends still seem to exist in today's marketplace. (I didn't, however, get around to figuring out how some of the tax laws have changed, so caveat lector, if you're closer to retirement than I; before jumping feet-first into Donoghue's tax-shelter plans, check the tax laws.)<br /><br />The book's main drawback is that it often seems as if Donoghue wrote it to hype his own services. As his products can be found in most major metropolitan newspapers and libraries, and he lists a number of them, it's pretty obvious he isn't necessarily trying to sell you things as to just get you to read them; still, there's an overuse of marketingspeak that can be a bit grating. That said, the stuff under the hood certainly seems sound enough, and it's worth a try. Donoghue's belief seems to be that no one has to retire poor. It's a very nice thought, and one worth checking into. *** ½	2004-09-07

Tamar Myers, The Crepes of Wrath (New American Library, 2001)<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I've binged a little too much on Tamar Myers over the last eight months. Like consuming too many ice cream sundaes all at once, the feeling you get after finishing your last one is more uncomfortable nausea than pleasure. When you've read four or five PennDutch mysteries in a concentrated amount of time, all the wailing will eventually get to you.<br /><br />To be fair, Magdalena does do a lot less wailing in this book, but replaces it with various other W-words. One wonders, idly, which letter of the alphabet Myers will be abusing next in Magdalena's quest to solve the various crimes too complex for her stupid brother-in-law, Chief of Police Melvin Stoltzfus, to get his head around. In this case, a teetotaling Amish woman has keeled over from an overdose of angel dust; too busy with his campaign to bother, Melvin asks Magdalena to take the case. Not that she doesn't have an innful of weirdos to deal with, as usual, and her tentative relatinship with a guy who's not only from out of town, but Jewish to boot. You can almost hear her mother rolling over in her grave. (Magdalena does, more than once, in the course of this novel).<br /><br />Tamar Myers is getting more scurrilous as time goes on (there's rather a large number of double-entendres involving Magdalena's pet kitten Little Freni; methinks Myers has developed a perfectly reasonable fondness for the British sitcom Are You Being Served? In recent years), which is always a good thing, and the book's as readable as ever. Actually, I liked it better than the earlier PennDutch mysteries I've read; Myers is getting more of a sense of how to plot as time goes on, leading to less explanation-of-the-mystery at the end (here, there's only about half a page of \\"aha! This is how I knew you were the killer!\\"). But be warned, dear reader, an excess of empty calories can lead to a tender stomach. Take Magdalena in small doses. ***. ***	2004-09-07

Joan Aiken, The Wolves of Willoughby Chase (Delacorte, 1963)<br /><br />The Wolves of Willoughby Chase was one of my whole class' favorite books in fourth and fifth grade. While looking for a copy of it on ebay once, I stumbled upon a film of the same name, based on the book, never released in America. I figured it was time to re-read the book before tracking down the movie.<br /><br />It holds up exceptionally well. Bonnie and Sylvia's adventures are just as fun forty years later as they were back when the book came out. A few of the more esoteric references may confuse younger readers (but this is a great opportunity for parents to get into \\"when I was your age...\\" stories, so we won't hold that against it). In case you've been living in a cave since 1963, the story follows Bonnie and Sylvia, a plucky pair of youngsters. Bonnie has been spoiled rotten by her loving parents, while Sylvia grew up hard on the streets of London, looked after only by a doting aunt. The two of them come together at Willoughby Hall only days before Bonnie's parents leave on a long sea voyage. To keep the girls out of trouble and oversee the house while they're gone, the parents hire Miss Slighcarp, a distant cousin none of them has ever met. Miss Slighcarp, of course, turns out to be nothing like Bonnie's parents, and complications ensue.<br /><br />Oddly, the book works partly because it shouldn't. Spoiled brats should never be as sympathetic as Bonnie is (though her transformation into a resourceful and productive member of society is a time-honored subplot done very well here), but Bonnie's engaging manner helps the reader get through the setup; it tends to jar at times, for example when she's cheerfully oblivious to her own thoughtlessness while showing Sylvia around the toyroom. All, though, goes to advance the plot nicely.<br /><br />The book's largest failing has nothing to do with the book itself, but with the dust jacket synopsis, which gives away most of the book before the cover is even cracked. Do copywriters of this sort get fired from publishing houses? I certainly hope so.<br /><br />A lovely piece of work, worth getting reacquainted with. If you've never read it, do so now; it doesn't matter if you've already reached adulthood. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase is enchanting for all ages. *** ½the cover is even cracked.

Why on earth didn't he bury some of these, or use this as a chance to apologize for some of the blunders here? He trashes some acknowledged classics here (Blue Velvet, for example, or Jarmusch's Dead Man), and his reiteration of those reviews, unchanged, seems to telegraph that he's standing his ground.<br /><br />That said, the rest of them are great. Dave Barry blurbs on the back, \\"he makes some of these movies sound so bad that now I've got to see them.\\" Indeed. Ebert takes no prisoners here, relentlessly exposing some of the worst films you are likely ever to see. (Oddly, from what I remember of Siskel and Ebert's show, though, there's not a single Dog of the Week in the book. I was quite looking forward to reading Ebert's print reviews of Motel Hell, Soup for One, and Pink Floyd: The Wall, all of which I greatly enjoyed, and all of which were Dogs of the Week.)<br /><br />My main problem with the book (aside from not acknowledging the greatness of a few obvious films) is that there are some reviews where it seems obvious he wasn't paying much attention to the movie; the odd factual error here and there about what's going on, or not interpreting a piece of the film where the intended interpretation is so obvious a half-blind six-year-old could figure it out. After all, Hollywood is rarely known for its subtlety.<br /><br />A good collection, though, and sure to add a few stinkers to Bad Movie Night. *** ½	2004-09-07

One would expect to see a book of this beauty selling for at least three times this price solely to break even. (Heed well, poetry fans. You're getting screwed on those fifteen-dollar trade paperbacks of less than an hundred pages. Not that you're surprised, but now you have hard evidence.)<br /><br />As to the content of the book itself, it's a short essay by Dickson Wright (the surviving member of the wonderful Two Fat Ladies) on the origins, history, and popularity of the dish that has come to be associated with Scotland more than any other, though it's been said the Scots invented whiskey because they had to eat haggis. With her trademark wit and charm, Dickson Wright sheds new light on the much-maligned supersausage. Maybe even enough new light to get a few folks to try the stuff. Maybe. Folks, if you have tried scrapple and thought you were eating something akin to haggis, think again. (One word: oatmeal.)<br /><br />A lovely little book.

Robert Penn Warren, Now and Then: New Poems 1976-1978 (Random House, 1978)<br /><br />Ah,the good old days. Robert Penn Warren was a horny old goat in his seventies, and Random House still published poetry. For that matter, the birthplaces of poets were still considered as possible sites for museums. What happened?<br /><br />You can't tell from this book. Well, you maybe could, but the difference is subtle (which is, of course, much of the problem in telling good poetry from bad). Warren gives us a collection of mixed formal and free verse, with the free verse having such strong rhythms it often feels as if, when you have gone from a rhymed poem to a free verse poem, there's something missing in the free verse. Would that all rhyming poetry had such a quality to it.<br /><br />Warren free verse, as well, is excellent, and there are thousands, maybe millions, of would-be free verse writers who could (if they knew what they were looking for) learn a great deal about how to write effective free verse from this collection of work. Warren, who's been writing poetry since before some of the modern-day bards' grandfathers were alive, was the last of a breed when he died in 1989. The last of the original New Critics, not old enough to remember the Civil War, but old enough to have gotten firsthand tales from relatives. (One resists the urge to tie Warren to Allen Gurganus' oldest living Confederate widow. It is difficult, but one does so.) Old enough, certainly, to not only remember when poetry was considered a good part of this nutritious breakfast, but to have been publishing at the time. Not only that, but to be good enough at it to have landed a major contract with a major publishing house.<br /><br />The problem is that it's sometimes, as I said above, very hard to tell what makes for good poetry and what makes for bad poetry. In 99.9% of cases, poetry that strays from the image makes for bad poetry. Poetry and value judgments do not mix, in the main, though millions have tried to make them do so. If the poem doesn't make you see tings in your head, it's not a poem. Most of the time. There are a handful of poets over the years who have been able to pull it off (and most of their stuff is very much in the imagist tradition, they just know how and when to stray). Robert Penn Warren is one of those poets. Explaining why is rather like trying to bottle and market smoke without using mirrors.

John Hollander, The Night Mirror (Atheneum, 1971)<br /><br />John Hollander's work is often inconsistent (e.g., his debut, A Crackling of Thorns, selected for the Yale Series of Younger Poets but rightly called to task by its selector, W. H. Auden, for a few things). His work is also, often, exceptionally difficult (Town and Country Matters may be the best example of this, poetically at least). But not until reading The Night Mirror did I encounter a John Hollander book that is both.<br /><br />I have no idea what, exactly, about The Night Mirror makes it so much more difficult than, say, Harp Lake, or the fantastic The Head of the Bed; I've been mulling over the question of what makes for \\"difficult\\" writing for a number of years now, trying to figure out why, say, Gunter Grass' Dog Years is so much harder to read than Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, despite both being (in a sense) war novels, or why Bataille's The Tears of Eros is such easier going compared to his Visions of Excess. I think it has something to do with word choice and sentence structure, but if I ever come up with a definitive answer, I'll let you know. For now, let's just say that The Night Mirror is, in places, some of the most difficult poetry I have come across in many a day (and I read a whole lot of poetry). This is not to say it's bad, of course. Difficult reading is often the most rewarding (cf. McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Walker's The Secret Service, or the aforementioned Dog Years). And in this particular collection, it's not always the difficult poems that ring hollow. In fact, the book's easiest reading, a piece of (intended, one assumes) doggerel called \\"A Poem of Pooballs,\\" is so empty that if you strike it, it will likely shatter. Pooballs, indeed.<br /><br />While there's nothing else here quite so silly, there's some material that requires slogging though, as opposed to the normal mode of reading Hollander, which falls somewhere between enchanted and impressed. And a number of the poems here do pull that off. The title poem is especially grand, and requires a number of readings just to get all the subtleties of the sound working in your head before you even start thinking about what it may mean. But unfortunately not everything in the book is of such grand scale. ***of the poems here do pull that off.

Charles Bukowski, Open All Night: New Poems (Black Sparrow, 2000)<br /><br />I note the \\"new poems\\" in the title (I don't normally with Buk books) because it's not entirely true. There's at least one poem in here which was published at least fifteen years ago. I know this because I used a piece of it as an epigram to something I wrote in 1992. (It's one of Buk's series of \\"yes\\" poems, which started in War All the Time in the early eighties; I can't remember offhand the title of the one reprinted here, though.) But then, I guess one poem in three hundred fifty pages isn't that bad. After all, with the number of three-hundred-plus-page poetic epics that have come out since Buk's death, it's obvious Linda had a whole lot of stuff to go through.<br /><br />Open All Night is not Buk's strongest work (but then, you have to figure much of the posthumous stuff, written over the fifteen or twenty years before his death, was unpublished for a reason), but every once in a while a piece shines. There are a few poems in here that sounds as if they were written in the late fifties, Buk's strongest period (viz. Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame), and a whole lot that sound as if they weren't. There are a number of unexpected surprises; I strongly suggest reading The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship just before reading this to catch some of the parallels towards the end. This book has the tales in poetic form, Captain has the tales in prose, and the reader can decide which voice works better for him. In my case, the prose took the cake every time, because much of Buk's poetry, towards the end, felt somewhat flabby, at times incoherent.<br /><br />But, as I said, there are gems, as there are in every book of Bukowski's, and a few of the gems here shine brighter than much of the posthumously-released work. They alone are worth the price of admission. ***	2004-08-24

Nelson, Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese (Harper, 2000)<br /><br />Quite a surprise this book turned out to be. I've been a lifelong non-fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000; the movies were often fun, but the skits in the middle made me throw things at the TV. So when Mike Nelson pops out a book of reviews, despite recommendations from friends (whom I have long suspected of being closet MST3K fans), I did approach it with a good deal of trepidation. Now I'm wondering, how did the writer of this book come up with a show as profoundly and steadily unfunny as Mystery Science Theater 3000?<br /><br />Despite some obvious blunders in the movies he chooses to attack (and those will likely vary from person to person; Mr. Nelson is not, oddly, the first person with whom I am acquainted who believe Se7en to not be one of the best movies ever made. The poor, deluded fools), this compendium of reviews, rantings, reflections, and other assorted skullduggery is laugh-out-loud funny more often than not. If I could write reviews half this good, I'd have already dethroned my arch-nemesis, Harriet Klausner, as the Ruler of the Amazon Universe. (But Mike Nelson wouldn't make it at Amazon, either. Nary a review to be found here is under a thousand words, even if you cut out all the extraneous stuff about nose hair, jelly beans, nuclear weaponry and its effects on the African Rhododendron, hippo lovin', and other assorted amusements. But I kid with the reviewer.) Surprisingly, despite his share of easy targets (he accurately notes that bashing Carrot Top, for example, has become a national sport), Nelson is also willing to take on some overblown, overrated windbags that have long needed air taken out of them (e.g., Basic Instinct).<br /><br />Anyone can do comedy with bad movies, though. Ebert once said bad movie reviews often write themselves, and how true he is. What truly surprises about Nelson's compendium of collagen-crusted crap is its eruditeness. Nelson thinks nothing of dropping in an oblique reference to Zeffirelli, throwing in a paragraph on Aquinas, tossing off a nod to the horrible, and yet oddly annoying, Road House. These things appear in places where they should never, by the light of all that is moly, ever be. (Speaking of, how many movie reviews have you ever seen make reference to molybdenum? There's one here!) And yet somehow, he makes them fit. This just adds to the humor.<br /><br />Surprisingly wonderful. I'm now wondering if I should be approaching Ebert's I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie with trepidation. Nelson may have put me off serious reviewers for life. *** ½thing of dropping in an oblique reference to Zeffirelli, throwing in a paragraph on Aquinas, tossing off a nod to the horrible, and yet oddly annoying, Road House.

Collings, Naked to the Sun: Dark Visions of Apocalypse (Borgo, 1987)<br /><br />Michael Collings, the director of creative writing at Pepperdine University, is, it would seem, an inveterate science fiction fan. And while it needs to be said that not all genre poetry is bad, and a few of the pieces in here back that up, the plain fact is that the majority of it is either bad, very very bad, or just plain worse. The same can be said for this slim volume.<br /><br />When Collings is good, he is very, very good. For me, the mark of how much I appreciate a rhymed poem, assuming it's not in some form that calls attention to the rhyme scheme (e.g., a villanelle or a canzone), is how far through the poem I get before I realize it rhymes. One of the early poems in this book, \\"Betrayal,\\" had me three lines before the end before I realized it was rhyming. That's impressive. Some of the other poems scattered throughout here are similarly inventive with form, structure, and rhyme, making them real pleasures to read.<br /><br />Then there's the rest of the book.<br /><br />Naked to the Sun feels less like Collings chose the poems specifically for this book as much as said, \\"hmm, I've written seventy-odd pages of poetry, perhaps I should book it up and see what happens.\\" What happens in those cases, to a one, is inconsistency. Bukowski was notorious for it, as were a number of the beats. Ginsberg, towards the end, just kept a recorder with him at all times in the belief that every thought he uttered was poetic. 'ware, aspiring versifier. No matter how good you are, you ain't that good. Neither was Ginsberg. Neither is Collings.<br /><br />Frustrating. I can't figure out whether to recommend it or not. If you don't mind wading through the mediocre to find the gems that are here, it's probably worth your time. Fantasy and science fiction fans will likely get more out of it than many folks. The rest, enter at your own risk. **	2004-08-16

Haoru Kotetsu, Iron Chef: The Official Book (Food Network, 2001)<br /><br />When Iron Chef ended its six-year run in Japan in 1999, it was the undisputed king of cooking shows. Already nominated for a number of Emmy awards in this country before it had even found a distributor, it was ready-made for the American market. Things were sluggish, though, until Iron Chef Morimoto battled American challenger Bobby Flay in a special battle in New York in 2000. After that, the show caught fire here just as it did in Japan. Capitalizing on this, the Food Network took the then-recently published Japanese book on Iron Chef, expanded it, and released it to the American market.<br /><br />The book serves as a teaser more than anything else. (For example, two Iron Chefs battled in Kitchen Stadium whom, as I write this, American audiences have never seen in a show, despite us having been seeing it now for four years of endless reruns.) For the obsessed, it might also serve as an episode-checkoff list, as each episode is listed. Not in the detail of, say, the must-have show-by-show Twilight Zone guide serialized in the magazine that shared the show's name, but as a roster, it'll do.<br /><br />The book also contains interviews with the chefs themselves and various cast and crew members, a number of recipes, profiles of winning challengers, etc. Your basic compendium of trivia.<br /><br />I must say, however, it never did clear up a question I've had since the beginning of the show's run in America: what if it's all a big joke? If so, it's a massively expensive one (just running down Kaga's list of ingredients in the preface made my wallet beg for mercy), lavishly produced and with enough Europeans and Americans in on the act to fool millions of daily Food Network viewers. But somehow, I've never been able to shake the idea that Kaga and co. are all sitting in Asakawa sharing a carafe of sake and having a good laugh at our expense.<br /><br />The book shares this general tone of over-the-top theater, which will probably endear existing fans of the show and make those who already find it slightly distasteful stronger in their views. But then, only those who like the show in the first place are going to go seeking it out, so no problem. ***ne of over-the-top theater, which will probably endear existing fans of the show and make those who already find it slightly distasteful stronger in their views.

Passarella, Wither (Pocket, 1999)<br /><br />It is surprising, to say the least, that a non-A-list horror novelist got a book out through a major press in 1999. It is even more surprising that said novel was the authors' debut. It is not surprising, in fact it's downright boring, that the cover blurbs compare the book to... Stephen King. Why is it that every publisher who puts out a horror novel, from the Big Five all the way down to (and what more of a Stephen King connection could there be?) Overlook Connection press, has to have at least one cover blurb on every book comparing the author's writing to that of Stephen King? You should know better, people. All horror is not alike. Wither has far more in common with Barbara Michaels than it does with Stephen King.<br /><br />Passarella, in actuality author John Passarella and screenwriter Joe Gangemi (Eliza Graves, etc.), and the two of them combine to turn in a creepy, compulsively readable first novel. More importantly, they also take a lot of the \\"emotional shortcut\\" conventions that plague mainstream American media these days and throw them out the window, creating a book with a completely different atmosphere than most.<br /><br />Wendy Ward is a college student with problems. She's a Wiccan in a small Connecticut whitebread-Protestant town. Worse than that, her father is the president of the college. Not exactly a recipe for fitting in with your classmates. Things get even more sticky, though, when she is noticed by one, and a jock, no less. Add in a three-hundred-year-old curse on the town, and you've got all the makings of your basic supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Passarella's devil is in the details. Never, in any horror novel I have read (and I have read hundreds, perhaps thousands), have I seen such a fair and balanced treatment of Wicca. Wendy Ward is not a stereotypical goth (viz. the lovely Fairuza in The Craft), nor is Wicca here used as trappings for a spooky story; Wendy Ward is a complex character who, ironically, is just like you were at that age, expect she wears all black and communes with mother nature via magical spells. It's rare, if not unique, in horror (if not in all literature). Thankfully, this thread of finger-in-the-face-of-convention pops up everywhere in the novel. In an unusual and refreshing turn of events, the reader is wondering less about what will happen with the plot than when Passarella and Gangemi will come up with another fantastic twist in the personalities of one of the characters. There are very few cardboard cutouts here, and even the ones who walk around with \\"kill me\\" stamped on their foreheads get some fleshing out. (There's one complete stereotype. Guess who the first person is to die in the book. Well, the authors needed SOME conventions...)<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Lemony Snicket, The Reptile Room (Harper, 1999)<br /><br />The Baudelaire orphans are back, and things haven't gotten any better. Which should be no surprise to the readers of Snicket's twistedly humorous Series of Unfortunate Events (of which this is book the second, which means \\"he wrote one before it, and an unspecified number afterwards.\\" \\"Unspecified,\\" here, means...). We pick up not long after we left off, with Poe having found the children a new relative to stay with, herpetologist Montgomery Montgomery (with all the literary allusions, one marvels that Snicket didn't call him August August, and a hundred points to anyone who gets the reference), to whom the children grow quickly attached. However, these are the Baudelaire children, and nothing good can happen to them for very long. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop, and Snicket never fails to deliver.<br /><br />When the shoe finally does drop, it is, surprisingly, both predictable and unpredictable at the same time; you know what Snicket's going to do, you just don't want to believe you're right. (Alas, you are.) The book wends its way along with the same black humor and sometimes-educational-sometimes-not definitions, and fans of the first are sure to enjoy the second. Those who found the humor in the first too black, though, are probably going to wonder if Snicket is actually a serial killer in disguise with this one, so be warned. The more twisted your sense of humor, the better, where Snicket is concerned. *** ½	2004-08-16

Lyn Lifshin, Leaning South (Red Dust, 1977)<br /><br />I wondered, idly, while reading this, whether the publisher, Red Dust, took umbrage at Lifshin's then-upcoming title Blue Dust, New Mexico (which is listed in this volume as \\"forthcoming;\\" it was released five years later).<br /><br />Leaning South, a collection containing three older chapbooks (North, Old Houses, and Other Houses), is earlier work of Lifshin's, and to be honest it shows. The subject matter is wonderful; North deals with the lives of the Inuit a thousand years ago, and Old Houses is steeped in the history of New England (Other Houses deals with Lifshin's personal history, which is intriguing, but better-explored in some of her later works, up to and including her most recent releases). But while on the surface her style then is the same as her style now, something happened, presumably in the early eighties, that took Lifshin's short, choppy lines and gave them a newfound flow, which has steadily improved to this day. This mid-seventies collection is still of the short and choppy variety; which is fine, if you like that sort of thing. She was already working with raw image, however, which makes even the early efforts worth reading; it's not fantastic in comparison to her later material, but compared to the other stuff being released at the time, Lifshin stands with a select few others (Carruth, Simic, Bukowski, and another handful or two out of the thousands publishing at the time; remember, the late seventies were the time of McKuen, Schutz, and Rice's greatest popularity. In other words, the Great American Poetic Nadir) head and shoulders above the crowd. Well worth reading for Lifhsin fans, and anyone intrigued by the subject matter therein; Lifshin neophytes would likely be better off picking up one of the more recent collections (I highly recommend Before It's Light: New Poems) before delving into the earlier work. ***	2004-08-16

However, I enjoyed it in a kind of \\"enjoyed-with-reservations\\" way; it always seemed like it was teetering on the brink of either completely coming apart or just falling into crashing boredom. Face, unfortunately, is not able to straddle that line.<br /><br />The premise of the book is relatively simple; a family stops to pick up a hitchhiker on their way home from a vacation. The hitchhiker is a very odd duck, to say the least; from the very beginning of the novel, we're introduced to his ability to do things like throw his voice and unsettle Christians (Megan, the mother of the family, is of the zealous born-again variety, for reasons that become obvious later on). The hitchhiker, who calls himself Brand, disturbs the family to the point where Megan throws him out of the car in the middle of a snowstorm. Bad idea, as he begins stalking them. But this is no ordinary hitch-hiker. He likes manipulating people and situations for, it would seem, his own amusement, and right now, this family and their friends are his amusement.<br /><br />The actual identity of Brand (never explicitly stated, but should be obvious to most readers by page fifty, if not by the description above) is rather obvious early enough on in the book to not offer any tension whatsoever, and a combination of Brand's acts simply sounding like high-school pranks and Lebbon's lack of editorial guidance in the opening chapters (\\"opening chapters\\" here equates to, roughly, \\"first two hundred pages\\") conspire to make the first two-thirds of this novel just this side of too-boring-to-keep-reading. It does pick up at the end, slightly, going from the snail setting on the blender to the sloth setting. But even that great leap in mastery of pace doesn't help, by that time.<br /><br />If you're going to read Lebbon, I rather suggest starting with The Nature of Balance and leaving this on the shelf. But why bother, when you've got authors like Tom Piccirilli, Simon Clark, etc., writing in the same general vein of not-quite-psychological-but-not-gross-out horror who do it that much better? Piccirilli's The Night Class or Clark's Blood Crazy would be a far more satisfying, and compelling, read than this one. **on the shelf.

Denise Levertov, This Great Unknowing: Last Poems (New Directions, 1999)<br /><br />I am ashamed to admit that for many years, based on some of her very early writings, I have mindlessly lumped Denise Levertov in with the Beats, specifically a number of the Beats whom I've never been able to stomach (Diane Wakoski being chief among them, with Robert Creeley and that Kelly fellow who used to publish a book every two weeks or so on Black Sparrow running a close second). It took me reading Richard Jackson's fantastic The Dismantling of Time in Contemporary Poetry a year and a half ago, in which Levertov is one of the six poets he discusses in depth, for me to consider changing that idea; by association, he puts her on the same level as such giants as Robert Penn Warren, John Hollander, and the finest living poet working in America today, Charles Simic, among others. My mind shifts gears gradually, sometimes very gradually, and I am just now getting round to giving the late Ms. Levertov another try. I'm quite glad I did, and wish I'd read The Dismantling of Time in Contemporary Poetry when it first came out some twelve years ago.<br /><br />This Great Unknowing is, not surprisingly, a book overshadowed with the idea of death. Not an uncommon theme for a writer who's approaching the age of seventy-five and knows she probably isn't long for this world. The work herein is also possessed of a great maturity (something many seventy-five-year-old poets never acquire), a fine ear for tonality, and a decided calming of the radical spirit, though it has not gone away entirely. And when the radical spirit comes out, as with most poets, the work does suffer; Levertov, like almost all of her contemporaries, was never big on the art of subtlety. She has, however, over the years taken an increasing interest in letting the story tell itself, so once in a while the pokes at society do manage to find themselves enmeshed in a poem, rather than a political screed. Which puts her well ahead of most of the pack in that regard.<br /><br />Her work speaks with a quiet authority here, a need for sharing rather than for imparting, and that makes all the difference;<br /><br />\\"...In the crook<br /><br />of an old and tattered snag<br /><br />something gleams amid the stillness,<br /><br />drawing the gaze: some bit of heartwood<br /><br />so long exposed, weather and time<br /><br />have polished it, as centuries<br /><br />of awed lips, touching<br /><br />a hand of stone, rub it<br /><br />to somber gleaming.\\"<br /><br />(--\\"A Cryptic Sign\\")<br /><br />or<br /><br />\\"...(Meanwhile,<br /><br />the April sun, cold though it is,<br /><br />has opened the small daisies,<br /><br />so many and so humble they get underfoot--<br /><br />and don't care.

Levertov is a fine poet, and this seems an excellent starting point. I know I'll be reading more of her late work, hoping it's this good. ****ahead of most of the pack in that regard. <br /> <br />Her work speaks with a quiet authority here, a need for sharing rather than for imparting, and that makes all the difference; <br /> <br />\\"...In the crook <br />of an old and tattered snag <br />something gleams amid the stillness, <br />drawing the gaze: some bit of heartwood <br />so long exposed, weather and time <br />have polished it, as centuries <br />of awed lips, touching <br />a hand of stone, rub it <br />to somber gleaming.\\" <br />(--\\"A Cryptic Sign\\") <br /> <br />or <br /> <br />\\"...(Meanwhile, <br />the April sun, cold though it is, <br />has opened the small daisies, <br />so many and so humble they get underfoot-- <br />and don't care.

If it's still horrible after fifty pages, throw it against the wall, let it slide behind the couch to feed the dustbunnies (cf. last week's review of Museum), and start something else. I used to be the kind of person who would never let a book go until I'd strangled on every last word, so starting to use the fifty-page rule for truly bad novels seven or eight years ago was profoundly liberating. And, really, no matter how bad a book has been, and I've come across some stinkers (cf. last week's review of Museum), I've always held to that rule. If I give a book zero stars, with a few exceptions that truly transcend badness that I actually did finish (cf. review from a while ago of the worst book ever written, Sue Doro's Heart, Home, and Hard Hats), you can rest assured I've choked down fifty pages of it. Until now.<br /><br />Lionel Shriver's writing style (or her main character; the difference, for the purposes of this discussion, is nil) in We Need to Talk About Kevin is so self-obsessed, self-pitying, whining, sickening, and all-around loathsome I could not, under any circumstances, make myself continue after page twenty-four. Were it not a library book, I'd have burned it rather than feed the dustbunnies this possibly lethal dreck. Now, granted, having only made it to page twenty-four, I will admit that it's entirely possible the book does get better. Two things, however, tell me this is not the case. The first is that, while sometimes books bog down in setup before they get to the plot, then take off (the most famous recent example being Neal Stephenson's wonderful Snow Crash), when the problem with a book is the author's actual writing style, I have yet to come across a case where the book gets better. The second is that other reviews of the book, at least those not written by either people who gush over it (and I have little doubt that those capable of ignoring an author's writing style in favor of the plot would get a lot out of this; I just don't understand how a reader can ignore writing style) or those who give every book a five-star review voice much the same complaint. And these are people who forced themselves all the way through, for the most part. Some choice snippets from others include \\"...Eva is the kind of person who... invites being taken down a peg or two...,\\" \\"I just could not like the protagonist... at all,\\" and a subject line reading \\"well written, but has loathsome protagonist.\\" Indeed. Not normally a dustbunny-filling problem, except that this is an epistolary novel. The protagonist's voice is the only one you hear. Three hundred plus long, whining, self-pitying, self-obsessed, annoying pages. Do you have a friend who does nothing but whine and complain about how hard life is? Imagine getting a three-hundred-page typed single-spaced letter from said friend. Would you read it, or skim the first few pages to get the gist, then toss the rest into the trash? Now imagine the letter came from a stranger. Same question.<br /><br />I suggest you apply the same treatment to We Need to Talk About Kevin.

[Note: six hundred words cut from review to satisfy Amazon length requirements.]<br /><br />Roger Hailey, Museum  (iUniverse.com, 2004)<br /><br />I have read, to date, one hundred sixty-nine books in 2004. Not too shabby. Actually, I should say I have read one hundred sixty and fed nine to the dustbunnies.<br /><br />When you think about the amount of unbearably bad crap being written out there, it's rather amazing that someone can get through a hundred sixty-nine books in one year and only find nine that are so unbearably bad the reader can't keep reading. As well, it may speak to the iron-stomached nature of the reader; I did, after all, actually make it to the last page of Left Behind.<br /><br />In its defense, Museum is not the worst book I have ever read. (That honor goes to Sue Doro's collection of so-called poetry Heart, Home, and Hard Hats.) I do believe, however, it may be the worst novel I have ever read. The first fifteen pages were so mind-crushingly bad that I put off getting through the last thirty-five until today, then gulped them down at lunch like a Big Mac meal left in a hot car for two weeks when you're stone broke; you know you need to do it, but you can't before steeling yourself for a long, tedious bout of food poisoning and projectile vomiting to follow.<br /><br />I'd offer you a storyline, but I really couldn't find one in here. It's as if Hailey (son of the notoriously bad writer Arthur Hailey, whose potboiler Airport was singlehandedly responsible, when turned into a movie, for the whole subgenre of seventies big-disaster flicks) decided to try taking the film adaptation of Stephen King's wonderful story \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" and cross it with the equally trite and boring late-eighties Tom Selleck vehicle An Innocent Man, and turn the whole mess into the first novel in a proposed series. The Black Knight himself is a prison inmate doing five years for possession with intent to distribute (and while Hailey's obvious stance that marijuana should be legalized is admirable, its delivery in this book is so transparent and so strained that it makes Kurt Vonnegut's antiwar posture seem subtle and charming by comparison) who, in his own words, helps out the new fish and protects them from the sharks. Despite the meaning there being quite obvious, Hailey takes pages upon pages to explain it to you. In fact, I don't think the man ever met a subtext he wasn't compelled to clarify, over and over again. If he has, it's not in this novel.<br /><br />So much for the declarative bits. How's the dialogue? After all, a truly crappy novel can be redeemed ever so slightly if you get Quentin Tarantino to write the dialogue for it. Well, that might have helped, but Hailey didn't. The dialogue is even worse. Much has been made of the authenticity of the dialogue in The Leatherstocking Tales; just imagine The Leatherstocking Tales being transformed to South Florida in the twenty-first century. The subject, said new fish from the above paragraph, is a dot-com business owner (note: the site he is supposed to own does exist, carries Museum, and is based in Miami; one wonders how autobiographical this book is) with scads of money, and attempts to be dignified throughout, so when he bursts out into sudden bouts of cursing, that's obviously meant to convey that he's hit his boiling point. It's about as authentic as a backwoods injun speaking the eighteenth-century King's English. The only thing it conveys is humor, and not gentle humor, either.<br /><br />Okay, so everything I've said here (well, except for that dustbunny bit) could be said about most porn novels, right? So you have to be thinking \\"there's sex in this book!\\" And you're correct, there is most certainly sex in this book. And it comes (no pun intended, natch) right around page fifty, and thus was a natural place to motivate the reader to keep going. I had really thought Hailey a canny little so-and-so there for about three sentences. But mycod and his son haddock, I've read porn novels with better sex scenes. (I refer you to a fine little novel called Mitzi and Fern, but only if you have an iron stomach. Some of the kinkiness therein is of a nature that nauseates even me. But most of the sex scenes are great. Or, if you need literary pretensions and don't mind blatant misogyny, Pan Pantziarka's House of Pain. Unforgivably brutal, morally reprehensible in every way, and so well-written you'll read it in one sitting. Then, of course, there is Bataille's Story of the Eye, which no less an authority on porn than Andrea Dworkin called \\"the only piece of pornography worth reading.\\" But I digress.) You're pretty much guaranteed one of the worst sex scenes in history-- and a rather scary glimpse into the mind of someone who objectifies women to an unhealthy extent-- when a vagina is referred to as \\"her center.\\"<br /><br />So, you've got bad explication, worse dialogue, and sex that's so truly awful you'll feel the need to take a shower afterwards, even if you watch Dark Brothers films on a regular basis. (No, Greg Dark's Britney Spears video doesn't count.) There is not a single redeeming quality about this novel, including the author's trumpeted heritage. Now, this is something I should have realized when I saw the publisher; I have yet to come across an iUniverse.com book that is in any way worthwhile. They have, however, hit a new low with Museum.

Bill Heller, Harness Overlays: Beating the Favorite (Bonus Books, 1993)<br /><br />I wanted to like this book. I really did. I own two other Heller books (Overlay, Overlay and Turf Overlays), and they're both at least worthwhile, if not the rock-solid sourcebooks one gets from Brohamer or Quirin. But back ten or so years ago, I read Tom Ainslie's book on harness racing. Ainslie is the undisputed king of Thoroughbred writers, the man who brought Thoroughbred handicapping into the modern age; he is the foundation sire of every handicapper since 1968, in one way or another, directly or indirectly. And, simply put, his harness book was crap. Why I expected Bill Heller to do any better, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Much of the problem with Harness Overlays lies in its vagueness. There are long stretches of information that are interesting (in at least one chapter, \\"interesting\\" is kind of a stretch), but their usefulness at the time of publication, much less eleven years later, is questionable at best. This is okay, relatively, when you've got a six-hundred-page tome and you want to throw in some interesting, not really all that relevant but it'll give the reader a break material. When your book is a quarter that length, you're going to end up with a reader who feels cheated. (By the way, the six hundred page tome I was thinking of when I wrote that is Olmsted's Compleat Handicapper. $65 when I bought it eight years ago, paid for itself on my first bet using one of its principles, and has been worth many times that much over the years. A must-have for any handicapper.)<br /><br />What the vagueness masks is... very little, really. I take copious notes on handicapping books, usually so I can translate them into code for quick system testing. A slim book with much common-knowledge information or an older book that's had much repetition since and thus has become common knowledge, like Ainslie's Complete Guide to Thoroughbred Racing, will give me about four pages of notes; a book with some math in it and a few ideas I haven't seen before, e.g. Carroll's Handicapping Speed, will give me six or seven; a book heavy in advanced math concepts will give me twenty to thirty (e.g. Brohamer's Modern Pace Handicapping, still the best handicapping book I've ever read). How many pages did I get out of Harness Overlays? Less than one. As a handicapping manual, I can't recommend it in the least.<br /><br />Where I can give it decent marks is in that vagueness I mentioned above. Two chapters are jockeys' responses to questionnaires about their driving strategies, and the right respondents (four from New York, four from Chicago) are all award-winning drivers. It's great to get into the minds of the best guys out on the track, and those two chapters alone are worth the price of admission. If you're looking for good, solid handicapping material on the trotters and pacers, stick to a guy who specializes in them (Jerry Connors, who wrote the Handicapping Beyond the Basics books, is probably your best bet; there's a dearth of good harness handicapping info out there). **a book with some math in it and a few ideas I haven't seen before, e.g. Carroll's Handicapping Speed, will give me six or seven; a book heavy in advanced math concepts will give me twenty to thirty (e.g. Brohamer's Modern Pace Handicapping, still the best handicapping book I've ever read).

Then I realized I'd actually gotten a book about the same subject from the same press edited by the same person that costs a whole lot less. Hmph. Ah, well. I'll review it anyway.<br /><br />The Maltese Falcon is one of those books that everyone really should read, whether they've seen the movie or not. It was not only the perfect distillation of the hardboiled detective novel, but has had, arguably, more influence on mystery fiction in the seventy-odd years following its release than any other novel known to man. It is, in a word, important. And it differs from the movie in various interesting ways that Sam Spade fans would do well to notice.<br /><br />For those who'd rather not, or for those who would like a deeper understanding of the beloved novel, Richard Layman's Literary Masterpieces vol. 3: The Maltese Falcon is an excellent reference. The first section (roughly two-thirds of the book) deals with the plot, the characters, all the usual stuff college kids will read this for in order to get their term papers done. It does, however, go into more detail than many books of this type, drawing parallels and giving insights that Cliffs Notes writers wouldn't even recognize as existing.<br /><br />The last third of the book is devoted to a selection of critical works dealing with Hammett and the Maltese Falcon. It is difficult going but, like most literary criticism, will reward the novel's reader with much more profound insight after it has been read. The articles are as narrow as a dissection of the famous Flitcraft story and as broad as a look at the poetics of detective fiction.<br /><br />Well worth your time, if you're a Maltese Falcon fan. *** ½	2004-08-03

Edo van Belkom, Blood Road (Pinnacle, 2004)<br /><br />Edo van Belkom's Scream Queen is the epitome of the empty calorie novel; you can read it in one gulp, it's momentarily satisfying, and an hour later, you've forgotten it existed and are hungry for something else. His newest offering, Blood Road, is a bit more nutritious, but still qualifies as beachwear.<br /><br />There's a serial killer preying on the highways of Canada. He just dumped his fifth body in a farmyard outside Parry Sound, a small village in Toronto. Coincidentally, a waitress in Parry Sound has had it with her alcoholic, abusive boyfriend (because, after all, all abusers are alcoholics-- cf. The Butterfly Effect) and wants to get out of town. So despite the murders, she heads for the highway and sticks out her thumb.<br /><br />You can see the collision course a mile away.<br /><br />That's the problem with emotional-shortcut writing (e.g., \\"all abusers are alcoholics, and all alcoholics are abusers\\"); it tends to lead to predictability. When you're used to using emotional shortcuts to get your point across, when you have to actually work with foreshadowing, it comes off as clumsy and amateur. That Amanda and the serial killer are going to meet is one example (the nature of the serial killer, which is obvious from reading the back jacket, but not revealed until about a hundred pages into the book, is another-- but there is an amusing twist to it); the book abounds with others.<br /><br />In other words, van Belkom still has some (okay, a whole lot of) clich&eacute; and predictability problems. But one major improvement over Scream Queen is that his characters are less two-dimensional. The minor players are paper-thin, but the majors have gone from cardboard to masonite.<br /><br />It's simple, it's readable, it's relatively silly. It'll take more than an afternoon to get through this one, but you'll still be left with a sweet aftertaste and a rumble in the belly. It'll take about two hours this time. But it's getting better. ***his time. But it's getting better. ***	2004-08-03

K. Rowling-- is that folks really seem caught off-guard by black humor. Thus, they didn't really catch the humor here, and so a common thread of \\"they get better as they go along\\" runs through the extant reviews. I'm taking then with a grain of salt, but if it's true, I'm looking forward to reading the rest of these.<br /><br />Most folks who have not been knee-high to a grasshopper in a few years will probably be able to gulp this puppy down in a quiet afternoon. And hey, your kids are clamoring for this, so you should probably see what all the fuss is about, right? You'll be glad you did. Lemony Snicket is a sick, twisted individual with the blackest sense of humor since H. P. Lovecraft or thereabouts, having his characters deadpan ironic one-liners while the world is falling down around their ears, choosing seemingly random words to define (including one about two-thirds of the way through the book so utterly brilliantly carried off that I had to pick my jaw up off the floor at Snicket's cleverness), and constantly warning the reader that, well, the events herein are going to depress the living death out of him. All in all, it's a wonderful piece of work. It deals with the Baudelaire children, whose parents have died in a mysterious fire a page or two before the book opens (it begins with them being notified of the death of their parents). They are taken in by an uncle on the other side of town who is quite a bit more than he seems, and all of the \\"more\\" is dedicated to separating the children from the sizable fortune the eldest holds in trust. All standard stuff, to be sure, but like the best mystery novelists, Snicket will keep you guessing until the final few pages who's a part of the plot and who isn't.<br /><br />The Bad Beginning is, in fact, a fine beginning. *** ½nd who isn't. <br /> <br />The Bad Beginning is, in fact, a fine beginning. *** 	2004-08-02

Not thick as in physical weight, but thick as in the poems are crammed onto the page one after another, without section breaks. It's like reading Alfred, Lord Tennyson in free verse.<br /><br />Once you get past that, the poems themselves are what one would expect from the writing of Lyn Lifshin-- short stabs out of a slice of life, sometimes scurrilous, sometimes tugging at the heart, sometimes simple observation. There's more of the image side of Lifshin's work here, which is a wonderful thing and lends the book an air of consistency. As usual, when Lifshin is on her game, she can put two images together, connect with a few words, and open up whole new worlds in the reader's mind; here, she's on more often than not.<br /><br />A better presentation for such a book would have been nice, but what you get is worth reading, if you can handle the lack of whitespace. ****	2004-08-02

He knew he was nearing death; he writes about it as often as he wrote about the deaths of other things in his poetry. Of course, his is not the only death to mention in these pages; car accidents, a falling neighbor, etc.<br /><br />Other than death, Buk's diary talks a lot about horseplaying. Great for me. Perhaps not so great for others.<br /><br />Bukowski was always a better poet than he was a prose stylist, but The Captain Is Out to Lunch... is likely the most readable piece of Buk's prose I have ever come across. Probably because there was nothing to writing it; instead of coming up with characters, plot, theme, etc., they're sitting there at the track or in the neighborhood waiting for you.<br /><br />Worthwhile.

A comprehensive step-by-step guide to running a local election campaign, and the information looks, from a logical standpoint, to be good and solid. The one piece of outright untrue information in the book can be classified as an oversight (Grey, who lives in Ohio and \\"follows local politics pretty closely,\\" as he says, contends he's never seen a candidate using yellow and black yard signs win an election. He's somehow missed Dennis Kucinich, erstwhile mayor of Cleveland and longtime House Rep to the tenth district, who's been using the yellow and black since Methuselah was a pup). I was already to give this a sterling review. Then Grey messed it up big time in the book's very last section. And the worst part is, it wasn't the point he was making that messed it up.<br /><br />Some glancing references he uses to draw a comparison show that Grey is shockingly ignorant of the mechanisms of free-market economics, so much so that it draws the rest of the logical-seeming book into question; how much does this guy really know about what he's talking about? Inadvertently, this major blunder does give prospective candidates a very valuable lesson: before you open your mouth, make sure you know what you're talking about.

Scott Nicholson, The Red Church (Pinnacle, 2003)<br /><br />The Red Church is not your average horror novel; we'll get that out of the way at the beginning. Yeah, there's the monster (\\"with wings and claws and livers for eyes,\\" maybe the best half-sentence description of a monster since Stephen King unleashed Pet Sematary on the world twenty years previous). There's the dysfunctional family who can't pull together to save their lives (literally). There's the bumbling backwoods cop and his sexy partner. Well, sexy if you like buff women in uniform (and don't we all?). All the standard stuff.<br /><br />But then there's the Church of the title, and that's when things start gettin' weird.<br /><br />Archer McFall is a descendant of Wendell McFall, who built the Red Church two hundred years previous and was hanged by his parishoners, who suspected he had truck wit' de debbil. His ghost, according to local legend (I should mention that \\"local\\" is rural North Carolina), still haunts the place. Archer went out to California two decades previous with a bevy of local beauties to form a new church, the Temple of the Two Suns (or Sons; the spellings are interchangeable throughout the novel, though whether that's intentional or the product of Pinnacle's notoriously lax editing is unknown). Only one of the seven girls who left with him, Linda, ever returned. She married a Baptist, settled down, had kids. But now Archer's back, and Linda, like the rest of the descendants of the people who hanged Wendell all those years ago, is drawn to the Red Church. Members of Archer's fledgling parish start dying. Sheriff (whose younger brother died in the Red Church's belfry not long before Archer took off for Cali) has to investigate, right?<br /><br />That's where it starts getting into Frank Peretti territory. The Temple of the Two Suns and the local, more traditional Baptist sect are polar opposites to one another, Jesus pitted against God's Other Son, as Archer believes himself to be. As you can probably surmise, this book could have been really, really bad. Nicholson never gives in to the temptation of the altar-call, though, and whether the book is truly intended as Christian allegory or not, the peace-and-light message is kept within the action, integrated into the characters rather than Peretti-style (\\"let's stop the action and ask the folks if they've been saved, shall we?\\"). He also never quite takes the edge off the book's Christian leanings, either; the scene where the child remembers the pastor's repeated savings of his soul tread very close to sounding like the kid's covering up child molestation, without ever tipping its hand. The whole thing has a wonderfully creepy quality to it whenever the religion question pops up.<br /><br />Where things fall apart is, unfortunately, at the end. The book's climax has something of a deus-ex-machina feel to it, and is generally confusing all the way around. This probably stems from its being told from the POV of one of the characters; no doubt actually being in the scene would be confusing as all get-out, but did Nicholson have to confuse us with it, as well? To his credit, when cleaning up after everything, he does explain one or two things, and he doesn't pull too many punches. But the confusion of the climax and its rather too easy method of resolution do leave enough of an aftertaste that we had to knock a point off. Still, Nicholson's debut novel does hint at better things to come. *** ½o be. As you can probably surmise, this book could have been really, really bad.

To his credit, when cleaning up after everything, he does explain one or two things, and he doesn't pull too many punches. But the confusion of the climax and its rather too easy method of resolution do leave enough of an aftertaste that we had to knock a point off. Still, Nicholson's debut novel does hint at better things to come. *** 	2004-08-02

Colleen Doran, A Distant Soil III: The Aria (Image, 2001)<br /><br />A Distant Soil gets better as it gets older. The focus which was notably absent from the first book has gradually appeared, and the characters are getting more complex as time goes on. If you managed to forgive the first volume its errors of judgment, continuing on with the story of Jason and Liana is warranted.<br /><br />In this episode, Jason, who's been brainwashed by the resistance, is about to kill Seren, the avatar, as we open-- except that Seren is also Rieken, the head of the resistance, and... oh, why bother? It's like trying to describe the plot of a soap opera. (In fact, it IS describing the plot of a soap opera.) Read the first two, you'll get up to speed. This one's a decent continuation of what came before. At this rate, Book Four, when it finally comes out, will be the best graphic novel of the year. ***	2004-08-02

John Hollander, Harp Lake (Knopf, 1988)<br /><br />Would someone, for the love of pete, please explain to me why, when we have such wonderful formalists running around now as John Hollander, students are still having unbearable pap like Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson crammed down their throats? \<br /><br />Harp Lake, Hollander's twelfth listed book of poetry here (but he's released more than that; I reviewed one not included in the listing on the dust jacket, Town and Country Matters, a few months back), continues to assert Hollander's easy dominance over the rest of today's scraggly, sparsely-populated formalist world. The man seemingly throws out perfectly shaped little pieces of formal poetry the way Jack Kerouac dropped haiku into casual conversation here and there.<br /><br />\\"Like a plumber's tools dropped into a box full of glass eyes,<br /><br />Unretractable, the panes of fractured window, jagged,<br /><br />Clear, looking down into black water and scarred cobblestones,<br /><br />Looking out into where we are now...\\"<br /><br />(\\"All Our Poems of Death Are Juvenilia\\")<br /><br />Not to say the master doesn't slip now and then. There's one particular poem in this collection (\\"By the Sound\\") that falls so painfully flat it actually hurts to read. My guess is, however, it's a mediocre poem that looks all the more threadbare in relation to those sumptuous things around it; if you popped it into a formalist webzine, for example, it would probably shine out over everything else there like the North Star.<br /><br />English teachers, take note: forget those fools who couldn't tell an elision from a stomach ulcer. This is what formal poetry should be. Read it. Learn it. And for the love of a future generation of poets, please, please teach it. *** ½	2004-08-02

John Hollander, The Quest of the Gole (Atheneum, 1966)<br /><br />I'm really quite at a loss to describe The Quest of the Gole. It purports to be the epic tale of three brothers who must raise a curse on their late father's kingdom. But it also purports to be the (fictional, one assumes after a bit of research) story of a literary scholar trying to piece the tale together from various literary fragments; think of it as an ancient House of Leaves. And if it does end up being nonfiction, then it's a decent piece of scholarship, albeit in the docudrama kind of way.<br /><br />As a piece of fiction, though, it's a whole new ballgame. Mr. Hollander's Opus (forgive the pun) is a stunning creation, both mock-scholarly and readable, and including such a wide range of various epic styles of poetry that it really does read like scholarship containing fragments from at least ten or twelve different poets who were writing between the first modern poems (around the time of Beowulf and \\"Summer is Icumen in\\") and the Renaissance. Technically, it is a masterpiece of the first water, and for that reason alone, it deserves a place in the canon.<br /><br />But that is not all there is to the Quest of the Gole. There's also two cracking good storylines (the story of the Quest itself, and the researcher's flights of fancy in the uncovering of bits and pieces, which sits between the lines), more readable pages than you're likely to find in any of Hollander's other books (the man is a fine poet, but ease of reading has never been high on his list of priorities), some wonderful line drawings that make one think perhaps Roald Dahl was influenced by them a few years later when looking for someone to illustrate his first few childrens' books, and an all-around sense of luxuriousness rare from a simply-packaged hardback.<br /><br />A very, very fine piece of work. A shoo-in for my ten-best list this year. **** ½	2004-07-26

Jordan Smith, The Household of Continuance (Copper Beech Press, 1992)<br /><br />New work from Jordan Smith is always a pleasure, perhaps because we get so little of it (four books since his first was published in 1982). The Household of Continuance, his third offering, gives us formal treatments of various subjects ranging from fixing the porch to wandering around France. As with his previous collection, Lucky Seven, there are no places here where Smith sets foot in more than a pothole. One section, in particular, makes this a must-read for poets and those who would aspire to the title, because it defines the essence of poetry so very well:<br /><br />\\"Before I left next day,<br /><br />They gave me Ritsos' Parentheses,<br /><br />Untranslated. Maria said,<br /><br />'You know the letters. Try to sound<br /><br />The words. The sound's the matter.<br /><br />Those balks, constrictions, slides, and bounds<br /><br />Are like scratches in mortar<br /><br />Left by the trowel, the signature<br /><br />Cut in common dross.\\"<br /><br />(\\"Matala\\")<br /><br />That, ladies and gentlemen, is what it's all about.

Hayden Carruth, Tell Me Again How the White Heron Rises Across the Nacreous River at Twilight Towards the Distant Islands (New Directions, 1990)<br /><br />I was of the opinion for many years that Hayden Carruth was America's finest living poet. These days, he still ranks, but I often find him more frustrating than anything. He's always straddling the line between real poetry and that vague prose-broken-up-into-lines that is only poetry when maybe a tenth of a percent of writers dabble in it.<br /><br />The first section of Tell Me Again is full of failed experiments in attempts at vagueness. Value-words, as opposed to images, abound. Not to say there aren't a few successes, but the majority of them are very much prose broken up into lines.<br /><br />Then comes the second section, and all that goes away. One long poem on the death of his mother, Carruth retreats to where all good poets find their best work; the image. It would, for most people, be impossible to write a poem on such an event (especially one as long as this) without straying into the land of judgment and value, and to be sure, Carruth does on a number of occasions. But here, it works, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Maybe it's because the poem is so rooted in memories (which are, of course, naked image). \\"Mother\\" is another of those poems written that make Carruth sound as if he could do no wrong (\\"Ray,\\" written soon after this, is another; it can be found in Collected Shorter Poems, 1946-1991, and is must reading for any Carruth fan who's never had the pleasure). But rather than there really being a high pint of his career (if he had one, the late eighties and early nineties would be it), this seems another example of Carruth's ability to let fly with a real monster every once in a while, an ability that has stayed with him throughout his career, from the earliest books to the most recent.<br /><br />Hayden Carruth is without doubt a fine author. Tell Me Again is a good book, certainly better than 99% of the books of poetry out there. But what makes is worth seeking out and buying is \\"Mother,\\" the long poem that comprises the book's second section. A definite must-read. *** ½certainly better than 99% of the books of poetry out there.

Charles Bukowski, Sifting Through the Madness for the Word, the Line, the Way (Ecco, 2003)<br /><br />Yet another collection of posthumously-published work from the ten thousand pages Buk left after his death, Sifting... is an inconsistent piece of work at best, like most of Buk's later collections of poetry. Every once in a while you get a great snatch of writing like the one that became the title of the collection, but it's mostly just the same old Buk, chopping up witty observations into line that look like poetry. That said, Buk was better than most at the chopping itself; he had an innate sense of what was really important in a piece, however vague it might be, and accenting it with the size and shape of the poem itself, making his prose-chopped-up-into-lines more readable than the vast majority of same.<br /><br />The best thing about Sifting... is that it contains a lot more of the gems among the dross than many of Buk's later collections. You'll find yourself nodding and smiling every two or three pages here; not as much as in his best stuff (Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame remains the height of Bukowski's poetic achievement), but a lot more than in some of the recent books.<br /><br />Worth it for Bukowski fans.

Holt's second (that I've been able to track down, anyway) novel, published three years after the groundbreaking When We Dead Awaken, was released to just as crashing a silence as was his debut novel, and faded just as quickly into obscurity. Which is quite a shame, because John R. Holt here, again, delivers a ripping yarn that's definitely far and above the average eighties horror novel (don't let the publication date fool you, John Holt is from the eighties-horror school of fiction).<br /><br />Beth Tremaine's mother was killed, while she watched, by a convocation devoted to a supernatural entity called the Griffin. Just what the Griffin is is debatable; Satan's minion on Earth, Satan himself, Lucifer who never became Satan, take your pick. While still a child, she was taken in by an aunt and uncle, and after they died, she became the ward of another uncle, Nicholas, a Catholic priest who has devoted his life to being God's judgment upon the Children of the Griffin, including hunting down and exterminating every member of the convocation that killed Beth's mother. Beth, now older, is a young professional living in New York City with the brightest of futures. She's only got one problem: her boss is a member of the Children of the Griffin, the head of a different convocation. And he wants Beth to head it up. Worse yet, her childhood boyfriend is also a member.<br /><br />The Convocation is a thicker, denser book than we When We Dead Awaken, and it makes for much slower reading. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. Holt takes more leisure to develop a strong cast of characters (and the cast here is much wider than it was in the previous novel), so when things get moving, you've got a strong idea of who everyone is and how things are going to go. There's nothing terribly unpredictable about all this, but it's great fun watching it unfold.<br /><br />Beth, Nicky, and the whole lot are begging to be turned into a movie, albeit an NC-17 one (The Convocation is not for the kiddies, folks; sex and violence abound in roughly equal quantities). A competent director and effects crew could make this one of the best horror films in years. But don't take my word for it; spend the time to hunt down a copy of this wonderful, obscure book after you've finally tracked down and devoured a copy of When We Dead Awaken.

Lyn Lifshin, Blue Dust, New Mexico (Basilisk, 1982)<br /><br />Blue Dust, New Mexico was one of the books that heralded the beginning of the mature period of Lifshin's work, where the focus went almost completely onto image and message started fading into the background. As such, as you might guess, it's better than her earlier work, but not quite as good as some of the stuff that came later. The ninety-two untitled pieces in here contain a good deal of work of great power, if that power is often used with a sledgehammer where a nail file might have sufficed:<br /><br />\\"Stars in the sky are grains<br /><br />of corn. Some dead<br /><br />climb up there<br /><br />so wear red eagle feathers<br /><br />a wreath of life<br /><br />against the spirits of the dead<br /><br />who come back<br /><br />to steal souls\\"<br /><br />(\\"68\\")<br /><br />There's still insistence on bringing the message in, though at times she breaks through the will and is able to let the images tell the story themselves.<br /><br />\\"poison in his<br /><br />leg they<br /><br />lay him in<br /><br />the crotch of<br /><br />a smoke tree<br /><br />wrap the wound<br /><br />in grass<br /><br />his woman puts<br /><br />corn kernels<br /><br />on his ankles<br /><br />blue feathers<br /><br />gives him roots<br /><br />to suck for<br /><br />the pain...\\"<br /><br />(\\"58\\")<br /><br />(Not the best examples I could find, but Amazon would likely not let the quotes through for the examples I'm thinking of due to subject matter.)<br /><br />Good, solid work from an author who has since become on of America's premier poets.

Scott Isaacs with Todd Leopold, Hormonal Balance (Bull, 2002)<br /><br />Scott Isaacs' diet book is not the kind of thing people pick up, flick through, and try. Which is a shame, really. Hormonal Balance doesn't just hand you promises of \\"lose this much weight in this much time\\" and cover it with a thin scree of what looks like science. In fact, the science behind the diet covers the first three hundred pages of the book. Thick reading for the diet book crowd indeed.<br /><br />Another difference between Isaacs' book and most of the others is that Isaacs, when talking about the various hormones, what they do, and what problems deficiencies or excesses may cause, is not afraid to let the reader know when he's heading out into uncharted or controversial waters. For example, many diet books tell you to get away from aspartame, but don't bother to tell you why. They don't tell you this because much of the research on which they're basing that advice has been debunked, or was never scientific in the first place. Isaacs, on the other hand, is more than willing to say when something he's talking about hasn't been tested on humans, or is still in the hypothetical stages. This leads to more of a sense of the ability to trust the man; always good when looking to someone for health advice.<br /><br />The book's difficult going, but not too much of a bear. Hormonal Balance is written not to be read by other endocrinologists, but by John Q. Public, and Isaacs never forgets that the average joe knows nothing, or less, about what he's on about. The end result is a readable book about a subject many doctors are still in the dark about.<br /><br />As for the diet itself, it's far more of a common-sense thing than most of the popular diets of the past thirty years; balanced food, lots of fruit and vegetables, egg whites or egg substitute, as much diet soda as you want (finally, someone willing to concede that not all soda is packed with sugar and calories!), etc. The kind of thing you'd probably be doing, if you didn't have that all-consuming obsession with chocolate, ice cream, that sort of thing. You know.<br /><br />Solid stuff. If you're sick of diet books, pick this up. You probably won't need another one. *** ½thing you'd probably be doing, if you didn't have that all-consuming obsession with chocolate, ice cream, that sort of thing.

Stanley Kiesel, The Pearl Is a Hardened Sinner (Scibner's, 1968)<br /><br />If there is any justice at all on this mudball, Stanley Kiesel will forever be remembered for his two young adult novels, The War Between the Pitiful Teachers and the Splendid Kids and Skinny Malinky Leads the War for Kidness, both of which are divinely inspired pieces of political incorrectness that would never be published in today's climate, but are no less brilliant than that. Kiesel pretty much dropped off the face of the earth after Skinny Malinky Leads the War for Kidness, popping up with a poem here or there at very infrequent intervals. But Kiesel did not leave the world of children's literature for poetry, he returned to his roots.<br /><br />I expected Kiesel's first book, a poetry collection, to have the same out-of-control slapstick feel to it as does his young adult novels. I couldn't have been more wrong. While Kiesel's message is the same as it is in the YA novels (everything's wrong, and it has to be fixed), here he looks at it from the point of view of a teacher observing his kids. The majority of the poems here, and all the best ones, are titled with the name of a child. It would, likely, be presumptuous of us to assume these are actual children whom Kiesel had during the fourteen years between his becoming a kindergarten teacher and the publication of this book, but the evidence for same, in Kiesel's incredible detail, is strong:<br /><br />\\"Sexless, glassy, a tuneless little<br /><br />Sample for the Kodak (\\"say cheese\\"),<br /><br />Retiring more and more into her<br /><br />Skin eruptions. Today, sent to me<br /><br />In a peacock dress, she will not<br /><br />Paint but remains crouched in<br /><br />A corner, crushed, like a pack animal,<br /><br />Beneath a mother's ribbon.\\"<br /><br />(\\"doris\\")<br /><br />It's the detail as much as it is what we think of today as the political incorrectness that makes these anecdotes such joys to read. Imagine a book of any sort being published today, thirty-five years after this came out, that would even hint at the sexuality (or lack thereof) of a kindergartner. Yet Kiesel gets away with it. No doubt some fools who believe in both poetry and political correctness will parrot that nonsense about \\"a victim of the times in which he was living,\\" but let's face it; people were more honest then.<br /><br />Kiesel does slip now and again out of the realm of image and into the realm of vagueness, mostly when he allows the message to take over the medium (this usually occurs in the long pieces not tied to a particular student), and as is to be expected, the poetry suffers as a result. That the message is a strong and important one is no consolation; it would have been better placed in an essay. However, the majority of this collection is made up of the short, biting poems that provide great pleasure to the reader, and it's definitely worth looking out for. Fans, especially, of the Skinny Malinky books will want to be on the lookout for this. And if you've never read the Skinny Malinky books, well, what are you waiting for? *** ½fter this came out, that would even hint at the sexuality (or lack thereof) of a kindergartner.

Terry Goodkind, Naked Empire (Tor, 2003)<br /><br />Goodkind returns with the eighth book in the Sword of Truth series, and not to put to fine a point on it, the series is headed downhill. Not that Goodkind's writing ability is waning; this one shares all the same characteristics of the others (deadly slow start, but by the final hundred pages, you will want to forgo food and sleep to finish it). But the subject matter itself is starting to wear thin.<br /><br />That could well be because while the first books let the story deliver the message, this one wants to hit you over the head with it. And no matter how admirable a message may be, when you stop the action for the hero to deliver long explications of the book's message to others or himself, things are looking pretty bleak. That happens a lot in this novel, and combined with Goodkind's recent propensity (broken only in The Pillars of Creation, which introduced a whole different storyline; more of that, please, Mr. Goodkind) to spend at least 150 pages of every Sword of Truth novel explaining events that came before (closer to 250 in this one, but at least it's scattered throughout the first five hundred pages), you can see why I might say the series is on its way downhill.<br /><br />That said, the readability factor played a big part in my rating. The whole thing is not as readable as the last hundred pages, but then few books are.

Reading it after finally acquiring a copy, I can see why the latter happened; I can only put the former down to someone's idiocy at the publishing house. The Breeze Horror should have been a blockbuster.<br />Sandy and her two-year-old boy are headed to the babysitter's one morning when it begins to rain. Nothing odd about that, right? Except this isn't normal rain; it's causing New York City to call for an evacuation. Sandy flees to her parents' summer home on Breeze Island to wait out the storm. After it passes, those who got sick from the rain are quarantined on the beach, but they're not getting sicker... they're getting better. And they're not happy.<br />Combine one part Animal Farm, one part Civil War historical novel, and one part Lucio Fulci film (The Breeze Horror has often been cited as the progenitor of the splatterpunk novel), and you have an idea of The Breeze Horror. Reading it fifteen years after its original release, a lot of it's going to seem oddly familiar to you. That's because you've seen it all in other places since. The Breeze Horror's influence can be felt in a thousand places, both in underground and mainstream horror books and films (both 28 Days Later... and the recent Dawn of the Dead remake lift scenes from the book almost verbatim, for example), but unlike some influential novels, that doesn't decrease The Breeze Horror's power in the least. It doesn't just come from being proto-splatterpunk (and despite the lengths to which Jacob, Lee, Devereaux, etc. have gone in the intervening time, The Breeze Horror still rates uncomfortably high on the squick factor), but from Caponegro's deft touch with the \\"some are more equal than others\\" power dynamic (thus the Animal Farm reference above). The plot is far more layered than that of your average horror novel, and it shows in how well the books still holds up this long after its release.<br />Well worth tracking down, and a book that cries out for another printing.

Philip K. Howard, The Collapse of the Common Good (Ballantine, 2001)<br />Howard's first book, The Death of Common Sense, should be required reading in high schools and law schools across the nation. Instead, it's supported by a select few and most of the country has never heard of it, despite our best efforts. So Howard releases another book, and I pick it up.<br />The Collapse of the Common Good takes much the same refrain as The Death of Common Sense, but turns its focus from governmental process to the fallacy of individual rights. What is important here is not what Howard says (which is, naturally, common sense), but in how he says it. His arguments are persuasive and worded so that the average joe can understand what Howard is on about. As with The Death of Common Sense, this is a book that should be required reading.<br />I do have one problem with the book, and that is the way that the endnotes are handled. Endnotes (as opposed to footnotes) are annoying enough, and publishers should realize that the endnote is archaic (now that students have access to computers, footnotes are easily achieved by even college freshmen; the use of endnotes by professional book publishers looks even more amateur), but The Collapse of the Common Good takes this annoyance to a whole new level by not including endnote numbers in the text; the exhaustive section of endnotes has them referred to only by page number. Perhaps I should have said \\"exhausting\\" endnote section. The complete unprofessionalism of the way what should have been footnotes are handled loses the book a full point.<br />Other than that, though, another must-read from Howard. I think I'm going to start giving them as christmas gifts, and keep giving them until people get the message. ****	2004-07-12

Allen, Gilani, et al., Beginning C# Databases (Wrox, 2002)<br />The shortest, and best, comment I can make about this book is that it is the first computer book I have ever taken out of the library, finished, and gone looking for a copy of to own. Yes, it's that good. Beginning C# Databases is that rarest of birds, a book that simultaneously assumes you know nothing and doesn't talk down to you despite that. (One wonders if the authors are normally childrens' book writers.) It sticks to its subject, goes into enough depth to give you the basics, and is so well-presented that it begs use as a reference book after you've finished it. My only problem with it is the use of the \\"beyond the scope of this book\\" excuse (editorspeak for \\"we have another book coming out on this subject on whicvh you go off on a tangent, so you need to cut these hundred pages so our profits are not affected\\"), but the authors may not have had any control over it. Excellent, otherwise. ****	2004-07-12

Charles Simic and Mark Strand, eds., Another Republic (Ecco Press, 1976)<br />Simic and Strand, long before being Pulitzer winner and Poet Laureate of the United States respectively, put together this fine anthology of European and South American poets, doing some of the translation work themselves and drawing most of the big names in poetic translation to work with them. The result is a fine, fine piece of work that, despite is present state of obscurity, deserves a great deal of attention.<br />As with most anthologies one is likely to find, the actual quality of the work therein is variable. Put beside such legendary greats as Czeslaw Milosz are lesser lights like Francis Ponge, whose stuff oftentimes reads more like stuff Pierre Reverdy left on the floor. But some of those lesser lights are very worth reading (Simic's quest to bring the work of Vasko Popa to the American people continues to this day, deservedly). The translations also vary in quality, but far more slightly; the lesser ones have a jarring word here, a transition that needs re-read there. The quality ranges from stellar to slightly-less-than-stellar.<br />Not all of the seventeen wordsmiths here (most are poets, but a few pieces are excerpts from novels, e.g. the section from Julio Cortazar) are folks whose work I will go well out of my way to find in the near future, but, again as always with anthologies, one can find a number of pearls amongst the swine. In this case, the number of pears is more than high enough to warrant seeking out this now-obscure book. *** ½	2004-07-07

John Harrison, The Pastel City (Doubleday, 1971)<br />That The Pastel City, now long out of print, has been considered a classic by so many for so long may be, in fact, the book's greatest failing. As I've perused reviews of it, the one thing I notice in the negative reviews is disappointment; they didn't get the be-all and end-all of fantasy they thought they were going to. Ay, but here's the rub; a book can be a classic for more than one reason.<br />The Pastel City is, from the plot standpoint, your typical epic fantasy. If you've read Moorcock, Leiber, etc., you have a basic idea of what's going to go on here. Love, death, betrayal, lots of nonhuman baddies, lots of human baddies, a brooding hero-type and his overly sanguine friend, maybe a crazy dwarf or two, and lots of stuff blowing up. This is nothing out of the ordinary, and to be expected from epic fantasy. Those who read it looking for a classic of plot, I assume, are the ones most disappointed by the book.<br />What elevates it from its peers is its sense of style. This is a fantasy as written by a true lexiphile, Elric through the lens of John Dryden, or Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser as written by Chaucer. As with most true prose stylists (Cormac McCarthy comes to mind), Harrison's subtle blend of archaic \\"it's not a fantasy novel unless you do this\\" diction, contemporary British phrasing, and little stylistic tricks that pull the whole in an entirely new direction takes a little getting used to at first. But once you've got the rhythm of it down, you can get pulled along for the ride with consummate ease.<br />So let me make this clear: The Pastel City is a good book. A fine book, and one worth reading. The typical fantasy fan should probably not expect too much. The fantasy fan who is more attuned to the details of writing will get the most out of it. Word lovers, fantasy fans or not, are going to get a kick out of this. *** ½	2004-07-07

China Mieville, The Scar (Ballantine, 2002)<br />Comparing any fantasy novel to Mieville's mighty Perdido Street Station invites a bad review. But it can't be helped, in the case of The Scar. After all, it's the sequel to Perdido Street Station. It's not surprising that it doesn't measure up; what is surprising is how close it comes to doing so.<br />Not long after the events of Perdido Street Station, Grimnebulin's sometime-girlfriend, Bellis Coldwine, flees New Crobuzon when she feels the militia closing in. Boarding the Terpsichoria, she heads off for the colonies on the other side of the world, stopping at Salkrikaltor Cray on the way for some negotiations. Not long after they leave Cray, however, they are ambushed by pirates from a nation who are completely unconcerned with New Crobuzon's might, and taken prisoner. Things go, to put it mildly, downhill from there.<br />It seemed to me throughout that much of Mieville's impetus for writing The Scar was to explore and flesh out some of the places that were just mentioned in Perdido Street Station. All well and good, as much of what was praised about the former novel was Mieville's ability to build a world with an awe-inspiring amount of descriptive realism. So it's no surprise that the same happens here, as Mieville takes us thousands of miles north and west of New Crobuzon, jumping around the map and filling in pieces of it we didn't get to see before. Mieville's descriptive talents are as strong as ever.<br />The plot's got a good deal going for it, as well. The pirates are not your normal brand of pirate, and Bellis spends much of her time trying to figure out what's really going on as a possible means of somehow winning her freedom from her captors. She, and her various co-conspirators, are just as expertly drawn as the batch in Perdido Street Station.<br />Where the book sometimes flags is pace. Perdido Street Station is compelling reading, the kind of book for which foregoing food and sleep often seems like a good idea. Not so in parts of The Scar. Only parts, mind you, but there are passages here and there where the pace flags. That Mieville previously achieved a perfectly-paced novel in the midst of the vast amounts of thick description therein is the only reason for criticism here; with most authors, we'd be amazed it moves as swiftly as it does.<br />A worthy, if (very slightly) inferior, successor to Perdido Street Station. **** ½a good idea.

Giuliano Briganti, William Bailey (Rizzoli, 1991)<br />If you're familiar with William Bailey's work, you don't need me to describe it for you. I was never all that much of a fan, considering his work somewhat repetitive, but when I read that poet John Hollander had done an essay for Rizzoli's book, I figured I'd give it a whirl. What is it with poets writing about art, anyway? (Hollander, in addition to his own stuff, extensively quotes both John Ashbery-who has released a whole large book of his writing on art, actually-and Mark Strand extensively in this essay.)<br />Seeing Bailey's work through Hollander's eyes doesn't make it much less repetitive, but it certainly does something for the boredom factor. The forty-five pages Hollander spends educating the reader are geared, seemingly, for folks like me, who weren't too fond of Hollander and need some educatin' on why his stuff is worth looking at again (and again and again). The bulk of the essay looks at various techniques Bailey used, then taking two pieces from various parts of his career and comparing and contrasting them as regards that particular technique. (I never even NOTICED the shadows in Bailey's work, for example.)<br />Briganti's introduction doesn't really add much; Briganti wrote it at the same time he was staging a major Bailey exhibition, and he seems to have been somewhat preoccupied with that. But, overall, the reading portion is worth it, and as I said before, if you know Bailey, you don't need me to tell you whether you're going to like the paintings in the rest of the book. *** ½	2004-07-07

Tom Piccirilli, The Night Class (ShadowLands Press, 2001)<br />Tom Piccirilli, who has been working in relative obscurity since at least 1990 (Dark Father, a Bram Stoker nominee for Best First Novel, disappeared off the shelves relatively soon after and to my knowledge has never been reprinted), started getting attention again towards the end of the last decade. He pivked up two Stoker nominations in 1999, another in 2000, and then went over the top, winning the Stoker for Best Novel in 2002 with The Night Class. Which, I surmised, made it a fine place to start reading his stuff. I couldn't have been more right.<br />He first few pages of The Night Class showed up as chapter-a-day mailings about six months ago, and I wasn't too impressed. Re-reading them as a portion of the whole book, they still have the air of \\"we're starting off way too slow for a book that's barely two hundred fifty pages, and that's with the illustrations!\\", but in the general scheme of things, that's not necessarily bad. The book never really increases in pace, but the plot here (and the underlying mystery) are far less central points in the novel than is the building of the main character, Caleb Prentiss. Caleb, a senior at an unnamed university somewhere (though I don't think it's ever actually mentioned, I got the distinct feeling it's in a rural area just outside the suburbs of Chicago; don't ask me why), returns from a very bad Christmas break to discover that a girl named Sylvia Campbell, who was staying in his room while taking a class during that time, was murdered there. He becomes fascinated with finding out who she is after discovering her name and address were faked for the transcripts. In doing so, he also tries to work out the old demons of watching his sister kill herself when he was still a kid.<br />There's a lot going on here, including various subplots with his girlfriend, his best friend and HIS grilfriend, Fruggy Fred (a late-night radio DJ and the book's token mystic), a mysterious girl from his Ethics class who's obviously attracted to him, and another from the same class he's attracted to who doesn't care that he exists, etc. In other words, your basic stew of college life, except that there's a murder involved.<br />Perhaps that's what's best about it; Piccirilli does a fantastic job of using the murder, and the underlying metaphors of it (all of which lead to a rather predictable ending, truth be told), as a great parallel to the normal, everyday chaos that is life at the collegiate level. (Obviously, either Piccirilli or someone very close to him didn't enjoy college nearly as much as I did, but then they probably didn't spend those four years drunk to the point of oblivion, either.) Because of this, the various plot elements fading into the background didn't bother me in the least, and neither did their overly-quick resolutions in the final few pages (and the loose ends left untied; the ending of The Night Class is as simultaneously frustrating and satisfying as the end of Jack Martin's Videodrome). I was too busy being impressed by Piccirilli's quiet authority, his refusal to bow to the usual horror conventions and willingness to spit in a few faces in that regard, and more than anything his ability to keep the first section of the book, which bounces around in time like a superball in a rubber room, coherent. The reviews already posted on Amazon make me think that perhaps fans of more conventional horror novels will like this a lot better than I think they will. I can guarantee those who like more eclectic, existential horror (Robbe-Grillet or Dalton Trumbo, for example) will definitely get a charge out of The Night Class. Gets a point off for really sloppy editing (way above an acceptable number of typos, especially towards the end). ****mysterious girl from his Ethics class who's obviously attracted to him, and another from the same class he's attracted to who doesn't care that he exists, etc. In other words, your basic stew of college life, except that there's a murder involved.<br />Perhaps that's what's best about it; Piccirilli does a fantastic job of using the murder, and the underlying metaphors of it (all of which lead to a rather predictable ending, truth be told), as a great parallel to the normal, everyday chaos that is life at the collegiate level.

Grant, 2004)<br />It's quite ironic that, less than a year after announcing his impending retirement, Mr. King has graced us with one of the best pieces of writing he's put out in years (excepting \\"Blind Willie,\\" one of the strongest stories of his career). After a string of books ranging from the mediocre (From a Buick 8, Wolves of the Calla) to the out-and-out bad (Dreamcatcher), during which, one can assume, King decided to hang up his hat, we get Song of Susannah.<br />The sixth book in the Dark Tower series starts just after the end of Wolves of the Calla (so much so that the last sentence in Wolves of the Calla and the first sentence in Song of Susannah could have been part of the same chapter in the same book), and takes place over the next... couple of days? Time's getting weirder in the spaces between Mid-World and Earth. Roland's decline into age-related illness is speeding up, making the quest for the Tower more urgent. Callahan is now part of the crew. So's Mia, albeit in a different capacity. (One wonders, idly, why Roland didn't take Rosa with him, if he took Callahan.) And, in his own odd way, Stephen King himself, which became obvious about fifty pages from the end of Wolves of the Calla.<br />That last bit sounds cheesy, doesn't it? And it's hard to tell whether it is or not, really, until the final few pages of Song of Susannah. But to his credit, King paints himself as quite the dysfunctional deity, which was by turns amusing and horrifying (given the autobiographical quality of the scenes, which are mostly in-more-detail pieces of the self-abusive parts of hie life he detailed in On Writing). My final thought on it was that it probably could have been done better, but certainly could have been done worse (it blew Jonathan Safran Foer's overhyped and barely readable Everything Is Illuminated out of the water).<br />So the question is, why's Song of Susannah so much better than the rest of his recent books? It's not necessarily because he's writing in a different style (he had the outline in place when he wrote Wolves of the Calla, too), or because he's changed anything about the way he portrays characters and events. In fact, the only real change I can discern in Song of Susannah is that it's... shorter. Yep. King, who has been working without an editor who does more than token work since the complete and uncut version of The Stand sold eighty-seven trillion copies (and rightly; the editor who worked on the original version of the novel hopefully is picking cigarette butts out of a gutter now), takes a special moment to go out of his way to thank the person who's edited the last few Dark Tower books. Whoever she is, she's gotten it into gear and really started whipping King's writing into shape. Song of Susannah is better-paced, more tense, a lot more visual without losing that special King ability to draw characters and scenes in the space of a few lines, and, well, just overall better. He also adds in a new (to him, anyway) dimension here, with both Roland and Eddie sticking around Earth long enough for them to really smack into the wall of culture shock (usually, they've been making quick trips up till now for one specific thing, while this time they keep getting derailed in almost Luis Bunuel fashion), and King handles it with a gentle wit that's been missing from his novels for years.<br />The abbreviated scope of this novel, combined with the brilliance of \\"Blind Willie\\" from a couple of years ago, gives me some small hope that instead of retiring, King will focus on what got him noticed in the first place, the punch-to-the-gut short stories that showed King both being effective and working with an economy of words he's completely neglected for twenty years or thereabouts. But one way or the other, this left me salivating for the seventh Dark Tower book, and what might or might not come after. ****It's not necessarily because he's writing in a different style (he had the outline in place when he wrote Wolves of the Calla, too), or because he's changed anything about the way he portrays characters and events.

Richard Jackson, Part of the Story (Grove, 1983)<br />After reading Jackson's The Dismantling of Time in Contemporary Poetry, I decided I'd go on the lookout for his own books of poems. What it was about Dismantling that made me think Jackson's work would be cold and clinical, I have no idea; whatever it was, I was quite wrong. Jackson is a nature poet a la Hayden Carruth, and to date the only one I've read who can hold a candle to the old man and not dull in comparison.<br />The bulk of Jackson's book is comprised of simple pieces about the world around us and how it relates to us, done with excellent images and a fine sense of sound:<br />Child, in the hills north of here<br />the wind whispers the story of these things.<br />The hawk drops like a stone from the cliff.<br />The hunter's fire blinks and disappears.<br />Even now our owl rips<br />the seams of darkness, and is gone to chart<br />his way by starflowers to those hills.<br />(\\"In a Season of Damaged Nights\\")<br />The book does stumble on a couple of poems towards the end about Jackson's wife leaving him, but even then, for the most part they're rooted in image and only wander off into vague value-judgment territory for a few lines here and there. Thankfully, he gets back on track quickly, and gives us more like the above. A fine piece of work from a sadly neglected author. *** ½	2004-07-07

Dawson, Broodmales (Spring, 1989)<br />Yet another piece, which we seem to be finding on a fairly regular basis this days, of accessible, readable social criticism. Who'd'a thunk it? Hall's forty-odd-page introduction to Dawson's paper, written in the nineteen-twenties, does little but revise and extend his remarks, putting them in a more modern context. But since Hall also makes the stuff a bit more readable (mostly by updating Dawson's still Victorian prose style), that's not a bad thing at all.<br />Hall and Dawson are looking at the custom of couvade, where the mother and father roles are reversed upon (and sometimes before) the birth of a child; the mother immediately goes back to work, while the father takes to bed, nurses the child (one assumes with a bottle or \\"a finger dipped in milk and honey,\\" as one would have it, until Dawson addresses in passing a condition that makes men lactate; one of my real contentions with the book is that I wish he'd spent more time addressing this), suffers dietary privation and restrictions, etc. While Dawson's work is mostly a survey (the bibliography is almost as long as the paper itself), he does spend an entire chapter, the paper's longest, on the significance of couvade (coming to the rather strongly-worded conclusion that civilized societies are, where couvade is concerned, ignoramuses, the word with which he ends the paper, all in capitals and followed by an exclamation point; one really gets a sense of the man's frustration).<br />The subject matter is interesting, but the reason I rated this one so highly is Hall's, and more surprisingly Dawson's, readability. Despite writing for the philosopher-and-anthropologist crowd, it's obvious that both went to some pains to make sure that the word would be readable and digestible by the great unwashed (i.e., you and me), and it's always an excellent thing when such a book is presented in such a way.<br />Fascinating.

Charles Simic, Classic Ballroom Dances (Braziller, 1980)<br />With Classic Ballroom Dances, Simic's eighth book of poetry, he hit his best stride. Better than Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk, better than Charon's Cosmology, better even than his Pulitzer Prize-winning The World Doesn't End, Classic Ballroom Dances may, in fact, be the finest single book of poetry released in the twentieth century in the English language. It certainly stands on a short shelf with The World Doesn't End, Carruth's Collected Shorter Poems, Lowell's Lord Weary's Castle, the Collected Poems of Aime Cesaire, etc.<br />Surrealism is not an easy thing to come by in English. One may think it so, judging by all the surrealist wannabes that have been scampering around for the past half-century or so, but true surrealism requires both a deep understanding of the French poetry upon which it is based (this is where most surrealist wannabes fall short) and an aptitude for combining the form and function of surrealist poetry with English, integrating the linguistic wordplay of English with the French diction. (This is where a lesser number of surrealist wannabes fall short, but note the two often overlap in truly untalented individuals.) The handful of American surrealists who do it right-Eshleman, Stroffolino, Simic, a few others-have an understanding of this so ingrained it's almost second nature. That's why Eshleman can write The Gull Wall, or Simic can write Classic Ballroom Dances, and have them come out sounding just as fresh and witty as the best translations from the French (Benedikt's, Hamburger's, et al). Simic's \\"Ditty\\" may be the perfect English surrealist poem:<br />\\"...live as a bride of no one<br />the sister of algebra<br />could you love and remember<br />and remember only to forget<br />could you live as a dog without a master...\\"<br />(\\"Ditty\\")<br />Simic's charms are, of course, not limited to being the illegitimate child of some secretive tryst between Guillaume Apollinaire and Paul Eluard, however. He is equally a child of the more traditional imagist school, and is capable of painting sparse pictures of undeniable beauty:<br />\\"...In a clearing,<br />They sized me up and then took their distance.<br />Quiet folk, bent, emaciated,<br />For such is the season. Without clues,<br />With hands raised, I stood like a mare<br />In a blacksmith's shop, Smoke<br />Of a late December sunlight...\\"<br />(\\"December Trees\\")<br />It is quite impossible for me to actually say how good Classic Ballroom Dances is; it has redefined the measuring stick. With it, Simic stamped himself not only one of the finest poets working in the latter half of the twentieth century, but put himself to the head of the class.

Tamar Myers, Custard's Last Stand (Signet, 2002)<br />It's nice to know Ms. Myers listens to her reviews. There's a line buried in this book that sums up every review of every other Magdalena Yoder novel: \\"It came out as a whine, but my whining is one of my more endearing qualities, don't you think?\\"<br />Thankfully, Magdalena whines a lot less in this novel (though the repeated-word thing does show up here with a few other terms), and that certainly makes the eleventh novel in the Pennsylvania Dutch (with recipes!) series all the more readable. (Note: the first was published in 1995. That's eleven novels in seven years... and all the while she's also been putting out the Den of Antiquity mysteries, of which the ninth was released in 2002. That's twenty novels in eight years. Mull that over.)<br />This time, Magdalena is confronted with one Colonel George Custard, who plans to build a five-star hotel in Hernia, Pennsylvania, that threatens to put Magdalena out of business. All is well and good, and the townsfolk look forward to a nice big brawl, until Custard turns up dead, with a bullet hole in his head and a few cracked ribs. Magdalena, of course, is on the case.<br />Myers' comedic timing has improved gradually over the years, and there are some unexpected whings in here that actually get the reader to the point of laughing out loud. As with most series fiction, the characters are already drawn, and there are a good number of in-jokes, but Magdalena and company are well-enough portrayed that after about fifty pages, you'll get the in-jokes as if you've been with the series all along.<br />A worthy addition to the series. Now if only Magdalena will stop whining. *** ½	2004-06-28

Charles Simic, Jackstraws (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1999)<br />I've written so many glowing words about Charles Simic in the past year that anything more would really be superfluous (cf. reviews of The World Doesn't End, Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk, Classic Ballroom Dances, Charon's Cosmology, etc. etc.). All I can really say about Jackstraws is \\"another worthy entry in the corpus of Mr. Simic, which is already stacked full of quality material.\\" Every new book from Charles Simic is an unalloyed pleasure to read, full of little unexpected pleasures and twists of phrase that cannot help but delight the reader. If you're not familiar with the work of Mr. Simic, I cannot but urge you to become so at your earliest opportunity; the man should be a living legend. As it is, he's just another poet trying to eke out a living, and that's a crime. ****	2004-06-28

John Ashbery, The Tennis Court Oath (Wesleyan, 1962)<br />Reading Ashbery's The Tennis Court Oath probably doesn't rank high on the list of many people's favorite things to do. But reading it while you've immersed yourself in a glut of Charles Simic is an especially bad idea. Simic is the quintessential surrealist writing in English today; Ashbery is sort of a weird, fuzzy cross between surrealism, dada, and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E whose work is, by turns, incomprehensibly unreadable and quite good.<br />I opened the book to a random page and start quoting from the top left...<br />\\"You often asked me after hours<br />The glass pinnacle, its upkeep and collapse<br />Knowing that if we were in a barn<br />Straw panels would... Confound it<br />Te arboretum is bursting with jasmine and lilac<br />And all I can smell here is newsprint...\\"<br />(\\"The New Realism\\")<br />Anyone who wants to take a stab at explaining that, by all means, go ahead. I cannot help but compare this stuff (as I did in a recent Jackson Mac Low review) to the work of John M. Bennett, which is completely nonsensical but SOUNDS like it shouldn't be. Reading John M. Bennett is like understanding how to read and pronounce a completely foreign language without understanding a single word; even when you have no idea what's going on, if you read it out loud, you can still do so smoothly and put inflections in all the right places to make it sound great. With this, the reader is reduced to stumbling through, trying to grasp some semblance of meaning in order to make it scan. (And we wonder why people ask \\"what does it mean?\\" when confronted with poetry. lord save us.)<br />But when Ashbery is on, he is quite on, and his work takes on a spectre of imagism; not enough to make the book worth buying, mind you, but enough to make it worth borrowing from the library. The more lucid sections of \\"Europe,\\" for example, where Ashbery dispenses with the easy, wannabe dadaism and gets down to his subject (Beryl Markham), give the reader an idea of why Ashbery, not too long before this, was selected by the Yale Series of Younger Poets. But, as with many poetry collections, you wade through some swine to get to the pearls. In this case, they're often in the same poems. ** ½r an idea of why Ashbery, not too long before this, was selected by the Yale Series of Younger Poets.

William Mundell, Hill Journey (Stephen Greene Press, 1970)<br />William Mundell, for many years the assistant editor of America's longest continuously running literary magazine, Poet Lore, here presents a volume of his own work. Comparisons to Hayden Carruth are not only invited, but almost demanded, by Mundell's hard-boot isolationism in the wilds of New England, and I have to say, when putting Mundell up against Carruth, Mundell is going to lose. Every time.<br />The book isn't bad, really. It's readable, most of it. But it lacks the power of Carruth's best stuff. Mostly because Mundell doesn't seem to have the inherent knowledge of what images will be automatically infused with some meaning or other by the reader. Pretty pictures are very nice, but there's not enough here into which a reader can really sink his teeth. Also, Carruth is a bit more adept with his formalism than is Mundell (though at times Mundell's work sounds as natural without having to jump through some of the linguistic hoops Carruth has been reduced to in a few unintentionally hysterical moments).<br />Not terrible, but certainly not of the level one would expect from someone with as haughty a literary pedigree as this. **	2004-06-21

Matthew Stokoe, Cows (Creation Books, 1997)<br />I'm not normally one to preface a review, or even mention in a review, when a book is not appropriate for certain audiences. (I hope to have duped a few of the weak-stomached into reading, say, Peter Sotos or Pan Pantziarka, because they deserve being read). But I'm going to start this one by saying, quite bluntly, Cows is not for everyone. In fact, Cows may not be for anyone. It is scatological, offensive, disgusting, filled to the brim with sex, violence, and sexual violence, and is probably capable of inciting nausea in those who are perfectly capable of sitting through atrocity footage and watch driving school videos for fun.<br />Cows is also visionary, brilliant, amazingly complex, a must on my ten best reads of the year list, and the second full-length piece of fiction I have finished in less than twenty-four hours this year. It's not only so nasty you can't look away, but it is supremely, blindingly great.<br />Matthew Stokoe's debut novel can best be summarized as follows. Take a healthy dollop of Horatio Alger (tempered with a dash of Alger Hiss), mix in a good dose of China Mieville's King Rat, a shot of Robert Bloch, add a couple of jiggers of Peter Sotos, ten drams of Camus, two shakes of David Mamet, bung in a couple of PETA ads of the most offensive variety, and then dump the whole mess into a shaker lined with Stewart Home. Shake, chill, and serve over ice cubes laced with LSD, rat poison, and Hideshi Hino films. One taste and you have scraped the tip of the iceberg that is Cows.<br />Steven, the protagonist, is not a happy person. His paraplegic dog, named Dog, was crippled years back by his mother, known affectionately throughout as the Hagbeast. He's twenty-five years old, and the only time he's left the flat is to run up to the roof and stare out over the city (presumably London) and imagine what life is like for normal people. After the roof got old, he started watching television obsessively, coming to believe that American sitcom families from the fifties led normal lives, and guaging happiness by those standards. As the novel opens, Steven is on his way to his first day of work, ever, at a slaughterhouse. He has a new upstairs neighbor named Lucy, who just moved in and after whom he lusts, a foreman named Cripps who takes maybe a bit too much of a fatherly interest in Steven, and something watching him from the ventilation system in the slaughterhouse.<br />As if that's not enough, Lucy is convinced that all the poisons in human beings (mucous, excrement, etc.) are to be found in large black lumps mixed in with the organs, and ceaselessly dissects things trying to find them; Steven is convinced the Hagbeast is trying to kill him by feeding him undercooked pork; the thing in the vents is getting more insistent; Cripps wants to teach Steven the ins and outs of cow-killing. Life, to say the least, is a mess for Steven, until everything falls into place at once and he begins to understand who he really is.<br />On the surface, Cows is an exceptionally offensive novel. It doesn't take too much analysis, though, to realize that the offense here is aimed with a deadly precision, and Stokoe weighed every word carefully in order to smack the reader into wakefulness throughout. Once you've understood that, unearthing the subtleties underneath becomes that much easier. Steven is a fantastically-drawn character whose emotions are never less than real (though as Guernsey tells him, there's nothing at all normal about Steven; that we can identify with him at all is a work of literary mastery). The rest of the characters are all caricatures of some sort (one is tempted to map them onto the seven deadly sins in a piece of textual analysis), but despite this are are very well presented and, with the exception of the Hagbeast (who is drawn as completely evil) empathetic; Cripps may be a power-hungry perverted moron, but there's enough of the father figure in him for us tosee him, briefly, as Steven must after first meeting him, for example. The situations and the characters are all throughly blown out of proportion, but the grittiness with which Stokoe sets his scenes makes his dystopian vision as real to the reader as the backdrops of Ridley Scott's marvelous film Balderunner.<br />None of this is truly astounding; many of the same strengths can be found in much of Creation's output (these same strengths, for example, are what make Pantziarka's House of Pain so much more readable than Jeremy Reed or the erotic novels of Anne Rice, for example). Where Stokoe truly transcends is in the tenderness with which he treats Steven's odd love triangle, and the subtle power struggle between Steven and Guernsey through the latter half of the novel. Ultimately, whatever the message one takes away from the book (the late Kathy Acker, for excample, brandished it as a banner for the vegan movement), at its core are those relationships.<br />You will either love Cows or hate it. You will emerge from it disgusted, mystified, or both. But you will not read Cows and finish it unchanged.

Lansdale, Zeppelins West (Subterranean Press, 2001)<br />The word very quickly became aware of, and enamored with, Joe R. Lansdale's particular subgenre of \\"take famous personages and put them into very strange situations\\" almost overnight thanks to Don Coscarelli's film version of Lansdale's story \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\" a couple of years ago. Well, folks, let me tell you, \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\" was only the tip of the iceberg. Zeppelins West plumbs the depths, and what marvelous depths they be.<br />Okay, imagine the following. Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show is going to Japan (via zeppelin, naturally) to perform. Among the cast are Wild Bill Hickok, Annie Oakley, Sitting Bull, and Bill biographer Ned Buntline. All well and good, except that Bill is a head in a jar of pig urine. His body is being kept alive by scientists, and it is Bill's greatest dream to one day be reunited with his body. During their adventures, thanks to a series of odd missteps, they meet up with Captain Nemo, Frankenstein's Monster, the Tin Man (from the Wizard of Oz), and Dracula, and it all takes place on the Island of Dr. Moreau. Weird enough for you yet? If not, or even if it is, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. (The book's most interesting feature: the notable lack of the standard \\"all persons are fictional\\" disclaimer. I'm waiting for the lawsuits.)<br />The book, like most of Lansdale's recent work, slips back and forth between the hysterically funny and the oddly touching, but unlike most of his recent work, there's no real mystery to be found here, aside from the surface question of how everyone's going to get off the island when Moreau (known here as Dr. Momo) doesn't want them to leave. The mystery's not the thing, though. Lansdale is too busy delighting in the complete and utter demystification (and remystification) of various legendary and mythological personages of our acquaintance, and gleefully drawing us along for the ride. The result is less disjointed than one might expect; this is probably because there are no chapter breaks or the like. The whole thing is told in one sweeping motion (rather like Doris' Lessing's Canopus in Argos books, but this isn't nearly as deep or meaningful).<br />Fantastic beach reading.

Mark Cramer, Scared Money (1994, City Miner Books)<br />Scared Money professes to be a novel. That may well be true, but if so it's a novel in the same way The Celestine Prophecy is a novel, except that Cramer's book actually has something worthwhile to teach the aspiring risk-taker. Not surprisingly, Cramer's book centers on the risks inherent in playing the horses, but touches on risk in many other aspects of life as well (and the parables he spins as mini-morals to his horseracing stories are quite easily taken the other way). In other words, this seemingly vertical-market book is actually the most accessible piece of Cramer's horse-slanted writing; There's all kinds of things to be gleaned from here, and not just about horses.<br />Matt, the protagonist, starts off as a casual horseplayer. He doesn't really change throughout the series of episodes that make up the book, but these episodes are designed to highlight one aspect of risk-taking each; change is probably not to be expected. Around Matt are an odd assortment of minor characters; horseplayers, jazz musicians, a nagging ex-wife. All are roped into these mini-morality plays in some form or another. All of the tales are effective, and get their points across without beating the reader over the head, but the end result isn't something that holds together as a coherent novel. A collection of parables, maybe (the Gospel of Cramer?), but a novel it isn't.<br />Still, it's well worth reading not only for the horseplayer, but those who desire to take other risks in life as well. ***	2004-06-21

Jackson Mac Low, 42 Merzgedichte In Memoriam Kurt Schwitters (Station Hill Press, 1994)<br />Guess I started with the wrong book from Jackson Mac Low. 42 Merzgedichte in Memoriam Kurt Schwitters is basically unreadable; it's certainly not poetry. The first piece is a collage of various quotes by and about Schwitters from various places, and the forty-one following are successive degenerations of same, to the point where, in the final few, Mac Low (using a computer to generate the pieces) forgoes even language, coming up with various strings of letters that have no meaning whatsoever.<br />Sound is the most important component in poetry, but it has to be sound that means something, or at least is phrased as if it could mean something (viz. The work of John M. Bennett, who should by rights be America's foremost L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet; still, the establishment remains overlay enamored of Mac Low, Bernstein, et al. despite their output having not resembled poetry in some years). What we have here is an unreadable stew.<br />The most interesting thing in the book is that one of the pieces is set to music, and the last fifty or so pages here is an overview of how the piece should be performed. This is good stuff, and may be worth at least the time of borrowing it from the library and reading that last section; here, Mac Low is doing something interesting (and the piece set to music is one that is, for the most part, intelligible). The rest, though, is easily ignored. * ½	2004-06-21

(Note: On the Horizon is an earlier edition of The Pond God and Other Stories.)<br />Samuel Jay Keyser, On the Horizon: A Book of Creation (Arlington Street Church, 1997)<br />First off: I have to approach this as a collection of short fiction rather than a collection of poetry. If I tried to think of this incredibly unpoetic writing as poetry, it would immediately be given zero stars and consigned to the nearest bonfire. This is prose, pure and simple.<br />Once we're past that barrier, there are some odd, intriguing things about this collection of work. For example, why on earth would a church not only release, but have the author read during the weekly service, pieces of a polytheistic nature? (No, I don't have an answer to the question. If I did, it wouldn't be intriguing, would it?)<br />One of the questions, unfortunately, points to the book's fatal flaw. That being \\"why did the pastor of said church not ask Keyser to make these things sound more like parables than Aesop's fables?\\" Keyser's writing is witty, ingenious in places. There's a lot to like in most of these short, pithy tales. Until, that is, you get to the last sentence. There are two pieces in the book whose last sentences don't start \\"And that is why...\\" or \\"And that is how....\\" Those two pieces, not coincidentally, are the strongest two here. (A third has the same ending, but with an unexpected twist: it fits in with the story rather than being a \\"the moral of the story is...\\" cap, and that makes it a delightful change from the weary moralistic repetition.) The worst part is that most of the time the moral of the story is easily understood from the story itself, but Keyser feels the need to take out his dead fish on almost every page and hit the reader over the head with it. There is no soul-searching to be done here, no textual analysis of even the most basic sort; Keyser will not only hit you over the head with his dead fish, but he will also spoon-feed it to you as if it were a jar of Gerber Week-Old Dead Mackerel.<br />I would love to see a second collection, or a revision of this one, from Keyser, with the prose set as prose instead of chopped up to look like poetry (and if the man thinks this stuff actually IS poetry, instead of using the form to make the collection look bigger, he is in need of some serious re-education) and the \\"moral of the story\\" sentence excised from each. Such a book would probably garner a star and a half, maybe two stars, more than this one did. But its flaws are enough to slightly outweigh its strong points; it does, however, have a good number of both. **eek-Old Dead Mackerel.<br />I would love to see a second collection, or a revision of this one, from Keyser, with the prose set as prose instead of chopped up to look like poetry (and if the man thinks this stuff actually IS poetry, instead of using the form to make the collection look bigger, he is in need of some serious re-education) and the \\"moral of the story\\" sentence excised from each.

Jacqui Lofthouse, Bluethroat Morning (Bloomsbury, 2001)<br />Jacqui Lofthouse's second novel has faded into obscurity at an amazing rate (Amazon will still let you add it to your cart, but when it comes to actually shipping the thing...). This is truly a travesty of justice, for Bluethroat Morning is the best literary mystery I've read in a very long time.<br />Harry Bliss' wife, Alison, committed suicide six years ago by the rather odd method of stripping, walking into the ocean, and drowning. It takes a lot to drown yourself while not weighted down. (Try it sometime.) His life since has been almost cloistered, nothing but work and sleep. Until, that is, he meets his best friend's daughter, a nineteen-year-old who happens to bear a striking resemblance to Harry's grandfather's second wife, about whom Alison's second novel was going to be about before she killed herself in the middle of writing it. Helen, the daughter, is vicariously attracted to Harry through being one of Alison's legion of fans; it's almost inevitable the two of them begin a torrid affair. This is the lynchpin that drives Harry to the understanding that he must find out what happened in the two weeks before Alison's death, while she was on working holiday at the resort town of Glaven, in order to get on with his own life.<br />Bluethroat Morning is plotted with such an intricacy that the reader will start seeing symbolism in every word (how much of it is red herring I will leave to you to discover) and start reading ominous gestures into every action taken by every character, major or minor. The subplots and various threads of the mystery are skillfully woven, with nothing left unresolved at any point and every character eventually finding a use, even the red herrings. All this combines with Lofthouse's easy economy with words and direct approach to the subject matter to create a book both complex and readable, not an easy thing to find. Hovers a little on the \\"tell\\" side of \\"show, don't tell\\" now and again, but that's the book's only flaw (and it is a minor one; never more than a few toes over the line). Absolutely astonishing, and highly recommended. A candidate for the year's ten best reads list. ****and again, but that's the book's only flaw (and it is a minor one; never more than a few toes over the line).

Or, better yet, the Japanese film Ringu. Or both. (You should watch both. See Ringu first.) Or you haven't. It doesn't matter. You must read Ring.<br />The story is relatively similar, but both Nakata and Verbinski took very large liberties with the original text (for example, both made Asakawa's character female-- which allowed the world to get weak-kneed at seeing Nanako Matsushima and Naomi Watts gracing screens again, but was otherwise seemingly gratuitous), including some major messing with the backstory. So if you've seen the films, the book will be familiar, but will still end up being a whole new experience.<br />Asakawa is a reporter. He was disgraced a couple of years ago during a sudden, unexplained outburst of popularity of stories about the occult in Japan (though you don't find out exactly how early on). One night, on the way home, he catches a cab, and he and the driver strike up a conversation about an event that happened a month previously to the cabdriver: a kid on a motorbike died of sudden heart failure. The death is eerily similar to that of Asakawa's niece on the same night. And from that coincidence, Asakawa starts to research the connection between the two deaths, which turns out to be far more than he bargained for.<br />What made for a creepily effective thriller on screen actually reads more like a hardboiled detective thriller (those familiar with the premise will note the obvious similarity to certain crime films of the past, notably D. O. A.). Suzuki keeps the horrors even farther offscreen than did Nakata (and the difference in the \\"revelation\\" at the end will surely startle those who are expecting the same kind of special-effects extravaganza Nakata used as a payoff), focusing on the mystery and the bond between Asakawa and his best friend, Ryuji, who gets involved in the investigation with him.<br />The book's flaws are minor, and conducive to mystery writing. Asakawa's edtor is a dead ringer for Tony Vincenzo (the editor in \\"Kolchak: The Night Stalker\\"), and a few of the other minor characters are about as shallow. Still, there are less obvious \\"kill me\\" characters running around, and the minor characters aren't really given enough screen time to make it an issue.<br />Compelling, well-written, expertly translated, and full of twists, even for those who have seen the movie. Highly recommended, and a shoo-in for this year's ten-best list. **** ½edtor is a dead ringer for Tony Vincenzo (the editor in \\"Kolchak: The Night Stalker\\"), and a few of the other minor characters are about as shallow.

Gerard Houarner, Road to Hell (Leisure, 1999)<br />I struggled through the first fifty pages of Road to Hell, then considered tossing it to the dustbunnies. But then I read a number of reviews that said \\"it gets better.\\" So I struggled with it while not reading other things for another four months. It may get better, but I finally came to the conclusion that I wasn't willing to put in the time to get there. I quit at about page 130.<br />Road to Hell is a confused mess, to put it bluntly. It looks as if an editor took certain sections of the book, tossed the pages into the air, and started swinging with a meat cleaver. Sometimes the book will stay in the same moment for twenty pages, at other times it goes through weeks in the space of a page, with no delimiters of any kind to tell you time has gone forward. Suddenly, you're in a different setting, wondering \\"how on earth did I get here?\\" The characters are flat and uninspired (casualties of \\"tell, don't show\\" syndrome). The action is confusing most of the time, and when it isn't it feels as if it were written by someone who was scientifically observing, rather than actually feeling it. Simply put, I couldn't find a single redeeming quality about the book that made me want to read any farther. And with so many books sitting and waiting for me to get to them, I decided it wasn't worth the trouble. (zero)	2004-06-17

Lucius Shepard, AZTECHS (Subterranean Press, 2003)<br />For the whole of his career, Lucius Shepard has been one of America's most criminally underrated authors. He managed to write some of the twentieth century's best science fiction, fantasy, horror, and war fiction without, really, much of anyone noticing. Thus, most of his old stuff is out of print regularly, and his new stuff is being put out by companies that take novellas and release them for exorbitant amounts of money in hardcover collectors' editions. For example, AZTECHS.<br />AZTECHS is another entry in the subgenre Shepard seems to write to most natively, sci-fi-war. This one's much lighter on the war and heavier on the science fiction. In a future version of the border between America and Mexico, a company called AZTECHS has mysteriously appeared out of nowhere, supplying the world with cheap technology. There are certain factions who are not thrilled with such a thing, and would like to see AZTECHS disappear so they can go back to controlling society. The protagonist, a small-time drug dealer and roustabout who is for all intents and purposes the kept man of a reality TV show host, hires a cadre of genetically altered bodyguards for an AZTECHS rep who's going to talk to one of the leaders of the factions who aren't happy with AZTECHS' dominance. The talks do not go well, to put it mildly, and things get weirder from there; within the space of a few pages, neither the protagonist (nor his girlfriend and camerman, whom AZTECHS have allowed to film the talks) nor the reader is at all sure of whose side anyone's on.<br />Those who are already aware of the incredible prowess Lucius Shepard has with words can rest easy that despite the book's rather embarrassing title, this is very good stuff. Shepard newbies will likely be put off by the price tag (and rightly so, for a book that sits right on the line between novella and novel), and those who aren't big science fiction readers might be better off going for one of his more down-to-earth pieces (Life During Wartime, his second novel, is a great jump-off point), or better yet some of his short fiction (The Jaguar Hunter and Beast of the Heartland are both highly recommended, but better yet find a couple of his seemingly as-yet-uncollected stories, \\"Delta Sly Honey\\" and \\"The All-Consuming\\"; the former was in an anthology called In the Field of Fire which is well worth reading, and the latter appeared in a late-eighties issue of Playboy).

Lansdale, Bumper Crop (Golden Gryphon Press, 2004)<br />For the majority of its all-too-short time on this mudball, I was a devoted reader of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone magazine. I was lucky enough to stumble upon the first issue by chance on a newsstand, and after that I subscribed until the bitter end. Many of the authors I still revere today I first found in the pages of TZ, including Joyce Carol Oates (\\"The Rose Wall,\\" reprinted in her collection Raven's Wing, was the strongest story in that first issue) and Dan Simmons (whose first published story, \\"The River Styx Runs Upstream,\\" was the winner of TZ's first fiction contest). But through all those years, I didn't remember seeing Joe Lansdale's name a single time. So when I checked the pub credits page and saw TZ's name by a number of stories, I got to wondering. Then I read the preface, and Lansdale says these stories stick with you. I got to wondering more. Then I read \\"The Dump,\\"and the second I saw the name Otto, I bowed to Lansdale's superior firepower. Note, \\"The Dump\\" is a story I haven't read in over twenty years, and within the first few words, I remembered it. \\"Memorable\\" is an understatement.<br />Bumper Crop, the second (following High Cotton) volume in Lansdale's personally-selected \\"Best-Of\\" collections of his short fiction, is, in short, a whole lot of fun. The stories here, most of which are exceptionally short, run through the early part of his career like a vein of adamantite in a mountain of pure silver. It's all great stuff, but this is just that little bit more rare, more coveted, and harder. \\"Chompers,\\" \\"The Fat Man,\\" and, well, just about everything here will leave its mark on you. Two stories will be recognizable to those who have read The Nightrunners (Lansdale, during the seven years between the book's completion and its purchase, took pieces out of it and revised them into stories a number of times). One of them, \\"God of the Razor,\\" is one of the strongest pieces here, and very highly recommended.<br />If the book has a weak point, it is \\"Master of Misery,\\" the last story. It sounds too much like... something. But I can't for the life of me remember what. But, jeez, don't let that stop you. This is great stuff. ****very highly recommended.<br />If the book has a weak point, it is \\"Master of Misery,\\" the last story. It sounds too much like... something.

Parker, and William Strode, A Year at the Races (Morrow, 1990)<br />Spenser author Robert Parker and his wife Joan met horse trainer Cot Campbell through some friends, and Campbell invited them to see the sights. They took along Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer William Strode and someone from the publicity office. This book documents what they experienced.<br />From a racing standpoint, Parker couldn't have had this opportunity at a better time; the year Parker spent with them spanned the yearling and two-year-old season of the best horse Campbell ever trained, Summer Squall. Yet the statement with which Parker opens the book, \\"I know nothing about racing,\\" rings loud and deep here, and reverberates throughout. At the end of the year, Parker still knows nothing about racing, and it shows. The most interesting thing about the text is how much Parker describing Joan sounds like Spenser describing Susan. But I should have expected that.<br />The value of this book lies in the fact that the Parkers brought William Strode along for the ride. Strode's photography here is dazzling, often amusing or thought-provoking, never boring. Strode does know something about racing, and about racing culture, and his many wonderful pictures here are testament to that.<br />So in other words, buy it for the pictures. ***	2004-06-07

Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, Left Behind (Tyndale, 1995)<br />So I figured after nine years, it was time for me to get around to reading the first book in the bestselling Christian fiction series in history, Left Behind. I had always avoided it, not because of the subject matter, but by and large books that break records tend to be writ large by those with the wit, talent, and grammatical skill of overly enthusiastic six-year-olds. Dame Barbara Cartland, Danielle Steel, Tom Clancy, John Grisham, Sandra Brown, you get the idea. Why should Christian fiction be any different?, I wondered. But despite all that, I dove into it.<br />Expecting the worst may not have been enough. To call the book naïve would be, perhaps, too kind. It uses the conventions of satire without being in any way satiric, treats its readership like total idiots, has all the spelling and grammar mistakes one could possibly want from a mass-produced piece of claptrap, and various other things, all of which I will attempt to make sound as tactful as possible below. But the bottom line, for those who would rather stop reading now, is this: plot's not bad, but execution is some of the worst I have seen outside self-publishing. Ever.<br />Without getting into the theological aspects of the book, it is impossible to write a comprehensive review of Left Behind without at least glossing over some of the more interesting (and less Biblical) assertions made by the authors, the most notable being the Rapturing (for lack of a better term) of everyone under the age of puberty. Hmmmmm. Including the ones in juvenile detention for murder? Okay, we'll drop the point. After all, our society is based (wrongly) on the idea that people can't make up their minds until they reach the magic age of eighteen. At least LaHaye and Jenkins dropped the magic age to twelve, for which they must get grudging respect.<br />But little niggling theological concerns are perhaps less galling than LaHaye and Jenkins' complete and utter inability to ascribe a mote of intelligence to any of their characters, and by inference any of their audience. Not being a Christian and a regular attendee at church, I can't say for certain what the average joe learns about the end times. But even without regular church attendance for the last number of years, I remember enough of the Revelation of St. John from Bible study back in the day to have seen all the major twists coming at least a hundred pages before they actually do. And yet his characters, including the wife and daughter of a fundamentalist, are completely oblivious. Writing a book like this as a mystery/thriller, it seems, was not the way to go. Or if it were, perhaps adding a couple of extras who might have looked like they, too, could be the Antichrist might have helped with the suspense angle. (They do attempt a move exactly like this, but way too late and way too ineffectively.)<br />I spent at least a hundred fifty pages of this book wondering, \\"where's the satire?\\" It was, of course, absent; LaHaye and Jenkins are deadly serious about approaching this series as novels mirroring the born-again Christian take on the end times. And yet despite their seriousness, they embrace the conventions of satire with open arms. Their businesses are thinly-disguised actual corporations with names that, in other circumstances, might be considered clever digs at those companies; their characters' names are ludicrous without being prophetic, a favorite mechanism of Dickens and Pynchon; the characters are often overwrought (and, really, it takes a good deal of mastery of the dime novel to make characters overact ON PAPER!); the aforementioned predictability in the mystery; you name it. It's all got the surface makings of great satire. Which makes me wonder how cool it would actually be if, after the series is finished, LaHaye and Jenkins called a press conference and yelled \\"April fools!\\" But I don't see that happening, and neither do you.<br />Fully addressing the spelling and grammatical horrors in this book would take a book-length review, so we'll just note their existence, sneer at them, and move on to the stilted dialogue, the characters (who are cardboard cutouts of the thinnest stripe) and their inability to relate to one another (aside from, one assumes, snickering at the silliness of each others' names in the background), the constant use of clich&eacute;, the stopping of the plot every once in a while to throw in some gratuitous moralization (but this being right-wing Christian fiction, I expected a three-hundred-page altar call; I was not disappointed), and all the other little pieces of amateurism that add up to this book being of such horrible architecture that its popularity is really worth weeping over for the lover of the English language. It is obvious, here more than anywhere, that people are more than willing to overlook fatal flaws in the language as long as they can understand the book's message. St. McLuhan has lost the battle once and for all, and sixty-two million copies of the Left Behind novels speak with the public's booming voice: the message is the medium.<br />It's enough to make a body want to give up reading. * ½ing the spelling and grammatical horrors in this book would take a book-length review, so we'll just note their existence, sneer at them, and move on to the stilted dialogue, the characters (who are cardboard cutouts of the thinnest stripe) and their inability to relate to one another (aside from, one assumes, snickering at the silliness of each others' names in the background), the constant use of cliché, the stopping of the plot every once in a while to throw in some gratuitous moralization (but this being right-wing Christian fiction, I expected a three-hundred-page altar call; I was not disappointed), and all the other little pieces of amateurism that add up to this book being of such horrible architecture that its popularity is really worth weeping over for the lover of the English language.

Hayden Carruth, For You (New Directions, 1970)<br />For You compiles five long poems from previous in Carruth's career (including \\"North Winter,\\" reviewed here a few weeks previous), spanning 1958 to 1967. To call some of them long poems is something of a stretch, especially \\"Contra Mortem,\\" an episodic piece consisting of a number of smaller pieces. Long poems are exceptionally difficult to pull off, and aside from a few potholes along the way, the work in For You holds together surprisingly well (and stands the test of time thirty-five years after publication, for the most part).<br />Writing more superlatives about Carruth would be overkill. This is good stuff, though it slips a bit now and again (the opening piece, \\"Asylum,\\" is early work and looks the part, and my criticisms of \\"North Winter\\" have already been aired). The Carruth neophyte may be better served starting with Brothers, I Loved You All or Collected Shorter, but the established fan will find much to like here. *** ½	2004-06-07

Hayden Carruth, Asphalt Georgics (New Directions, 1985)<br />Asphalt Georgics stands well out from the Carruth corpus in that the whole book, every poem therein (of which there are thirteen), is written in iambic, either quadrameter or pentameter. Thematically, it makes sense, as much of what is here is a jaundiced look at the excessive civilizing of Vermont, something which Carruth has been despairing of almost as long as he's been writing. Never has he done so as eloquently as he does here, though there is some inconsistency in the quality of the work (however minor that inconsistency may be, as is usually the case with Carruth) and the repeated rhythm tends to make the pieces run together. More a book for browsing than for dedicated reading, but another fine one. *** ½	2004-06-07

Adrianne Byrd, Comfort of a Man (Arabesque, 2003)<br />I'm not a big reader of romances. (In fact, this will be only my fourth romance review since I started documenting such things in 1999.) Adrianne Byrd is a regular on a forum I used to frequent, so when she announced the publication of this one, I figured I should check it out. But feel free to take all that follows with a grain of salt; for all I know, this is identical to other romances in the same vein. All I know is, it ain't like any romance I've read before. Or much of anything else I've read before, for that matter.<br />Comfort of a Man, despite being burdened with something of a cumbersome title, is one heck of a good ride. It's smart, funny, incisive, well-paced. Oh, yeah, and sexy. Sexy as all get-out. The story revolves around Brooklyn Douglas, a real-estate broker from Atlanta, and Isaiah Washington, a sales and marketing rep from Austin. They meet during a trip to New York (Isaiah's for business, Brooklyn's for pleasure) and, through the various machinations of Brooklyn's friends and an optimistic bartender, end up having a one-night stand. (The process of getting from meeting to bed could have been lifted from a Bunuel film. Byrd knows how to keep the tension high by throwing in all sorts of ludicrous, but realistic, delays.) Due to (imagine big roll of thunder here) a series of coincidences, the two find themselves thrown together again the next summer, and from there, well, you know the drill. If it doesn't have a lot of getting together, pushing away, and ultimately a happy ending, it ain't a romance, is it?<br />Where Byrd differs from the Steels, Cartlands, Blakes, et al. Of the world is in two very important places: her characters and her realism. The characters to be found in Comfort of a Man are not your usual cardboard cutouts, but real, multidimensional characters that a reader can identify with, instead of the paper constructs one has to stretch to even empathize with. Also, while the coincidences require suspension of disbelief (oh, my, do they ever), the situations Brooklyn and Isaiah find themselves in once the coincidences are past are realistic. Uncomfortably so, at times, for someone who's been there, done that, and bought the (ripped!) shirt.<br />The book's flaws are few, and the majority of them can probably be attributed to an editorial staff who weren't quite diligent enough. A few cliches here and there, some typos and grammatical flaws. Nothing, though, that really stops the book's flow. A few of the minor characters border on the cardboard (especially Brooklyn's son, Jaleel), but they only get a few pages of screen time. (In horror novels, they'd be the folks walking around with \\"KILL ME\\" signs.)<br />I really never thought I would so unapologetically recommend... a romance novel. But there it is. *** ½oincidences require suspension of disbelief (oh, my, do they ever), the situations Brooklyn and Isaiah find themselves in once the coincidences are past are realistic.

Charles Simic, The Book of Gods and Devils (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1990)<br />Another fine piece of work from Mr. Simic, but this one seems the smallest of cuts below his best efforts (The World Doesn't End, Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk, et al). Hard to explain why this is; I want to say it's more in the confessional mode than most of his work, but if this is the case, it's by an infinitesimal amount and would not otherwise be worth noting. Problem is, I can't put my finger on anything else.<br />Still, when Simic is in the zone, his writing eclipses most others who have worked in the medium in the twentieth century. Take, for example, pieces from the brilliant \\"The Great War\\":<br />\\"...You never saw anything as beautiful<br />As those clay regiments; I used to lie on the floor<br />For hours, staring them in the eyes.<br />I remember them staring back at me in wonder.<br />How strange they must have felt<br />Standing stiffly at attention<br />Before a large, incomprehending creature<br />With a moustache made of milk....\\"<br />Definitely another worthwhile contribution to the canon, but there are better places for the neophyte to begin. ****	2004-06-07

Bishop, The Etched City (Prime, 2003)<br />Aussie author Bishop turns in her first novel, and what a first novel it is. The language in The Etched City demands to be savored, lingered over. It is beautiful to the point of astonishment. This is, basically, the fastest way to get a top review from me.<br />The problem being that when held up against such masterpieces of perfect prose as Walker's The Secret Service, Mieville's Perdido Street Station (to which The Etched City is oft-compared), or McCarthy's Blood Meridian, The Etched City suffers in one respect: pace. The first half of the book, give or take, is told at a leisurely pace, to be kind. (It took me over three months to make it to the last half of the book.) Bishop takes her protagonists, the gunslinger Gwynn (who bears a striking resemblance to a more cynical, lighter-hearted Elric of Melnibone) and the doctor Raule, through a few episodes in another land before getting to the city at the heart of the book, Ashamoil. Once in Ashamoil, Bishop takes her time setting up character, setting, and theme before actually getting down to plot. A few subplots are begun, a few episodes spun out (and The Etched City is very much an episodic novel, contributing somewhat to its overall sense of languor), but the biggest ball doesn't get rolling until almost two hundred pages in. If you love language, though, it is doubtful you will care; the book can be put down and picked up at various times allowing the reader to go on to more pressing matters and return at leisure.<br />Perhaps the oddest thing about the novel is that Raule, with whom the book begins, ends up being such a minor character in the general scheme of things. Once they get to Ashamoil, Gwynn quickly becomes the focus of the story, which cuts back to Raule now and again to ensure we remember she exists. Gwynn's main quests are involved in working for a tyrannical slaver, Elm, and trying to find (and considering what to do with) the artist of an etching Gwynn stumbles upon in the night market, an etching that contains him. When not hunting down sex or violence, he's usually involved in theological debate over dinner with a fallen priest, whose name we never know but who grows to be one of the book's most endearing characters.<br />Bishop's ability to draw characters, especially minor characters, puts her into the realm of such authors as McCarthy and Stephen King, much of whose reputations are based upon their ability to create memorable characters. Bishop can certainly be added to this list. The reader will be hard-pressed to forget most of Gwynn's band of cronies, especially Sharp Jasper and Elbows. Lovely folks the both of them. Really.<br />All in all, a good first novel that would have benefitted from better pacing at the beginning. Recommended for lovers of language and strong characters. *** ½Gwynn stumbles upon in the night market, an etching that contains him.

Hayden Carruth, Brothers, I Loved You All (Faculty Press, 1978)<br />Why must it be such a truism that the best books of any relatively prolific poet must be published by small, out-of-the-way presses with no distribution? Bukowski's Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window, for example, or Lifshin's A New Film in Love with the Dead. Simic's Nine Poems, Cronshey's Afternoon in the Museum of Late Things. The whole catalog of Liz Willis. It's all brilliant and all impossibly hard to find.<br />Add Carruth's \\"wow\\"-inducing Brothers, I Loved You All, published by Faculty Press, to the list. Now almost impossible to find (though most of it can be found in Collected Shorter and Collected Longer, published in the early nineties by Copper Canyon and must-haves for any poetry fan), Brothers is one of the rarest birds to be found in all of poetry.<br />Poetry has long been considered a dying art form, and there are valid arguments to be made to that effect. Song has taken the province that poetry trod before it, and in all honesty does much of it better. But the solid image is still, for the most part, the exclusive province of poetry, save for a few surrealist novels and a handful of consistently amazing songwriters. The niche for poetry, since the time of Eliot and Williams, has been the image. (Would that more would-be poets understood this and stopped penning second-rate song lyrics. But I digress.) The poet who persists in formal poetry, or poetry that strays outside the bounds of image, is wading in a pool of hip-deep slime from which ninety-nine percent of poets fail to emerge at all. (Your current author is very much included in this, when he chooses to venture into such dangerous waters.) Of those who do, they may manage a few short pieces that manage to both take the narrative quality of earlier works and add to it the polish necessary to captivate today's reader of poetry, unutterably jaded after years of having schoolroom elephant dung shoved down their throats. A handful of poets are consistently fantastic at this. But very, very few after World War II would ever have even considered trying to do it with the long poem. Hayden Carruth has tried a number of times, usually with less than stellar results compared to his finest short work; in \\"Vermont,\\" the centerpiece of Brothers, he has succeeded in such a way that, had he never written a single other word in his career that will be remembered, he has etched himself in the canon of American writers.<br />\\"Vermont\\" is an astounding piece of work that traverses history, politics, quirky personalities, the gradual paving of the state, and everything in between, the whole mess. Carruth switches voices as effortlessly as Rich Little roasting Mel Blanc, with subtle changes in diction to bring the whole thing off. Part formal, part free, \\"Vermont\\" is, quite simply, must reading for poets, aspiring poets, and poetry fans.<br />\\"...Why, hell, I knew a man<br />living in Coos Junction who wouldn't take<br />a twenty-dollar bill; he couldn't stand<br />to carry Andrew Jackson in his back pocket.<br />'Gimme two tens,' he said.

Adam Lukeman, Fangoria's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen (Three Rivers Press, 2003)<br />The main criticism of this book is that, well, the target audience for this book is going to have seen a lot of these movies. Like every other reviewer I've read on this topic, I've seen the majority of them as well. But it's still refreshing to see some of these movies ending up on SOMEONE'S 101-best list, as they're entirely underrated (Wendigo, for example, or Day of the Dead) or suffered from little or no American distribution (Cronos, A Chinese Ghost Story, etc.).<br />Rather than a definitive compendium, look upon this book as a checklist of all those movies you saw once, liked, and forgot to re-rent, or the ones you forgot about. And if you want to keep true to the title, give your copy to one of your non-horror-loving friends with a list of where to start. (Start someone out with some of the movies in here and they'll never watch another horror flick again...) And then go write up your own list of the 101 best horror films no one has seen. We need more of them. *** ½	2004-05-24

Then came Jealousy. It would seem that a suspected love affair between a man's wife and their neighbor would be the perfect subject for an author who obsessively details scenes, going back over them to change small details and keep the reader off his feet, wouldn't it?<br />Sadly, in practice, it didn't work that way at all. We are given a nameless narrator, his wife A..., and the neighbor, Franck, and the unnamed narrator's obsessive going over of a few particular incidents (the implication is that one of them is presently happening, while the others are things he's going over in his head). There are also a lot of extraneous details about banana trees that were ridiculed in the French press upon the book's first publication.<br />What made The Erasers and Voyeur different from Jealousy is that they had plots, if odd, meandering ones that didn't really go anywhere. Jealousy is a hundred forty-page set piece, in which nothing happens and to which there is no resolution. Readers of Robbe-Grillet's previous works will not be surprised at the latter, but the former might come as something of a shock. As a short story, or perhaps a novella, Jealousy could have been a chilling, creepily effective little piece on the mind degenerating over obsession; as it stands, it's rather, well, boring. **	2004-05-24

Taffy Cannon, Open Season on Lawyers (Perseverance Press, 2002)<br />Taffy Cannon's sixth novel suffers from one of the silliest names ever given to a book. Don't, however, judge said book by its cover, no matter what is written there; Open Season on Lawyers, despite having some flaws, is a fast-paced, witty romp through the life and detection of a serial killer whom most of us would very much like to be.<br />As the title tells you, someone's killing lawyers. Their deaths are staged in wonderfully ironic ways (a victim based on the infamous Stella lawsuit is boiled alive in a hot tub; a lawyer who successfully defended a fast food chain against claims of food poisoning dies of botulism, etc.). After the first few, the cops realize they have a serial killer on their hands. Enter tough, plucky (aren't they all?) heroine Joanna Davis and her partner Al Jacobs, trying to track down the killer the press have dubbed The Atterminator.<br />One thing about Cannon's writing that definitely sticks out is her dry, almost British, wit. The chuckles to be found in these pages have their mirror in the deserts of California. Slapstick this ain't, but a finely-honed sense of irony that never sounds forced. Because of that, it's possible to overlook some of the more predictable parts of the book (the final conflict, for example, can be seen from at least fifty pages away). As well, there is a good deal of technical artistry on the part of the killer; Ms. Cannon has done her research, and done it well. It would seem to behoove the astute reviewer not to ask exactly how well, but there you go.<br />Balanced against these strong points are the odd clich&eacute; now and again, an almost painful sense of stereotyping, and a few niggling habits (one cop, named Quincy Reese, nicknamed Q, is never referred to as Q, or as Reese, but always as Q Reese, for example).  Certainly not enough to keep you from picking this up, if you're a mystery fan; Cannon's novels may be just the thing for this year's beach reads, if you haven't discovered her yet. ** ½s beach reads, if you haven't discovered her yet. ** ½	2004-05-24

He also has a more cynical attitude towards the subject than Glink, but then looking at the books' titles alone should convey that well enough.<br />A good adjunct, but not sure it would be as good a stand-alone tome; Eldred misses a few beats in telling you the options you have while he's too busy shutting the door on the options you should avoid.

They aren't, not all of them, but a fair number are good enough to put this book in, say, the top twenty, sharing the rarefied air of Charles Simic's The World Doesn't End, Robert Lowell's Lord Weary's Castle, Hayden Carruth's Collected Shorter Poems, and other such lights.<br />First and Last Words, a book that can loosely be called the beginning of Chappell's modern period, is where the poet turned slightly from the hardcore imagist work he'd been doing previously and looked toward a more abstract notion of poetry. He did so, however, without falling prey to the vagueness (or, lord help us, the idea that poems should be \\"message-based\\") that turns so many potential poets into unreadable hacks. Nowehere is this better illustrated than in \\"An Old Mountain Woman Reading the Book of Job.\\"<br />\\"...She moves her lips to read but does not speak.<br />What is there to answer these terrible words,<br />To these sharp final words that engrave the fate<br />Of a hammered old man?...\\"<br />Beautifully rendered images combine with musings of characters, animals, even the elements at times.

Ryu Murakami, Coin Locker Babies (Kodansha, 1995)<br />For thirty years, Japan has waited for someone to step up and fill the rather sizable shoes left by Yukio Mishima when he committed suicide after a failed attempt at a coup d'etat. It seems that Ryu Murakami has finally stepped up for the job.<br />Mishima's work was singular in that it combined the beauty and spareness of haiku with random, seemingly meaningless (until one looked below the surface) acts of despair and violence. Murakami treaded these waters in such previous works as Sixty-Nine and Audition while adding his own touches to the mix; in Coin Locker Babies, Murakami has fully assimilated the spirit of Mishima while simultaneously strengthening his own voice into something that is both complete and stunning.<br />Coin Locker Babies is the story of two brothers. Well, almost brothers. Both abandoned by heir mothers in bus station coin lockers as infants, the two are discovered and sent to the same orphanage, where they become inseparable. Adopted by the same couple, they grow up together on a southern island, but eventually return to the city to find their mothers. Along the way, one grows up to become a decadent pop star; the other, a disciplined pole vaulter. Yet the differences between the two are always overshadowed by their similarities as they progress through their lives.<br />Kiku and Hashi are destined to become two of literature's classic antiheroes. Angry, confused, incapable of understanding how their circumstances have molded them, the two stumble through life facing misfortune after misfortune, still somehow managing to come out in front of everyone else. They juggle their conflicting emotions with aplomb, being completely irratinoal much of the time yet without ever doing anything even remotely out of character. Murakami's deftness with the depths of his characters is easily on a par with that of Stephen King of John Irving (in fact, oftentimes when reading Murakami one is reminded of the scene in Garp where the child is looking out the psychiatrists' window and counting off the number of disabled people he sees on the street below), but his ability to take a seemingly unrelated stream of events and whip them into a coherent plot within a few pages far surpasses either of them. His writing is gorgeous, if somewhat less spare than Mishima's, and infused with a constant stream of gallows humor broken only temporarily by the wordless, wailing pain that underlies every page.<br />The various blurbs on the back of Coin Locker Babies (half from writers, half from filmmakers) praise Murakami as a Renaissance man for the new age, half cyberpunk and half manga, a mirror in which all of society can be seen. Murakami is all of these things and more (though one wonders, idly, if the reviewers have ever been exposed to Hideshi Hino); he stands, at present, as Japan's most brilliant writer whose works have been translated into English. (Now if only someone would translate Audition.) Coin Locker Babies may not be a perfect novel; it lacks that same indefinable something that keeps Kathe Koja's newest from achieving perfection. But it's close enough that it still rates five stars. *****the scene in Garp where the child is looking out the psychiatrists' window and counting off the number of disabled people he sees on the street below), but his ability to take a seemingly unrelated stream of events and whip them into a coherent plot within a few pages far surpasses either of them.

Grushenka Pavlovsk, Grushenka: Three Times a Woman (Brandon House, 1966)<br />What an awful little book this is. And how rare it is to actually find any information on it. So pretty much everything in this review pertaining to the background of the novel is speculation (and mostly secondhand speculation from, erm, Brandon House scholars--yes, they do exist--at that. My apologies if any of this is horribly off the mark).<br />Grushenka purports to be the autobiography of a Russian peasant girl with a taste for S&amp;M written at the turn of the century. And to the book's credit, Grushenka's rise to wealth and power does have the distinct odor of Horatio Alger about it, albeit with an underlying scent of leather. However, research has pointed to the book's actually being published for the first time in 1933 in New York in a private edition, a work of utter fiction (my, how surprising) written by B-movie mogul Val Lewton, producer of such classic films as the 1942 version of Cat People and the following year's I Walked with a Zombie. (Lewton did do some scriptwriting work under the name Carlos Keith, adapting Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Body Snatcher\\" and penning the Boris Karloff film Bedlam.)<br />And honestly, if the book really wasn't written by Lewton, it's worth a one-word review: crap. It's probably only worth one word anyway, but it's interesting to take the trail of a book written by a not-yet-famous individual, watch it go out of print during his fame, and see it not reprinted until over a decade after his death (the Brandon House edition was released in 1966, and to my knowledge has not seen a second printing since). I won't go so far as to say Jeremy Reed has written better erotica than this, but it certainly has nothing to compare to some of the more ribald works of, say, the mediocre William Kotzwinkle.<br />Gets * ½ simply because it's not as mind-numbingly boring as Rice's Sleeping Beauty novels or Reed's Sade's Sister trilogy.	2004-05-20

Fred Chappell, Source (Louisiana State U., 1985)<br />Fred Chappell has developed, over the course of his career, an amazing (even for a poet) ability to see, and to record what he sees in such a way that it is both poetic and understandable. In Source, Chappell's seventh book of poems, he may have reached the height of his ability to do so during the early period of his career. The poems here are for the most part short, imagist evocations of pictures the speaker can see; nothing more, nothing less, leaving the reader to come up with any deeper meaning (assuming one is necessary, which often it isn't). In other words, much of what is in Source is the very essence of poetry. For example,<br />An ancient wound troubles the river<br />Where the horses drink their reed-spiked shadows.<br />The perfumed barge drifts by, bearing<br />a final viceroy to oblivion....<br />(\\"Source\\")<br />Good, solid, easy-to-picture image, and the reader is left to determine whether he's watching a funeral procession, a garbage scow, or an invented metaphor for the death of the Old South (or any of a number of other possible interpretations). This is exactly what poetry is supposed to do, what it should be; would that more poets, or those who consider themselves poets, would read Chappell and understand that this is the kind of thing they should strive for. ****	2004-05-20

Sure, a good deal of it will be more useful to those who haven't been through the process before (the section on different types of mortgages, and different breeds of mortgage brokers, is likely to be especially helpful), but since buying a new home isn't something one does on a weekly, or even a yearly, basis most of the time, there's stuff in here that might make for it being a good refresher course when it comes time to sell. (As well, it may remind the sellers of the state of mind of the homebuyer and invoke a little sympathy.)

Kathe Koja, The Blue Mirror (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 2004)<br /><br />It should be obvious by now that any time a new Kathe Koja book comes out, I'll be reviewing it within a few weeks. The Blue Mirror is Koja's eighth novel, and her third for young adults. The YA novels are markedly different from her adult work; they are much shorter and more focused on a sole protagonist than her adult work (and, needless to say, there's less sex). The protagonist here is Maggy, a sixteen-year-old girl with an alcoholic mother, a cat she dotes on, a blatant indifference toward school, and a lot of artistic talent. She spends her afternoons in a window booth at the Blue Mirror cafe, drawing street scenes and drinking coffee. Until, that is, she meets a band of homeless kids led by mysterious, handsome Cole. Cole is the boy your mother always warned you about, and needless to say, things change quickly for Maggy.<br /><br />This is, perhaps, the YA novel that comes closest to one of Koja's adult novels; you can see the rawness through the paint scrapes (Maggy's mother being present and alcoholic, for example, rather than the referred-to-but-rarely-seen shades of parents in her earlier YA novels). Cole is very much the incubus, even if he doesn't sprout wings. As usual, Koja draws her characters with stunning believability, and nothing they do, no matter how irrational, ever seems out of character. The book's only real problem is that it's missing that certain undefinable something that makes Koja's best novels (Skin, Strange Angels, Straydog) into absolutely perfect works of fiction. But even without that whatever-it-is, he Blue Mirror is another ultimately worthy addition to the shelf of Koja novels you should all have been building next to the bed. Better than Buddha Boy, on a par with The Cipher. A must-read. **** 1/2	2004-05-17

Fred Chappell, The World Between the Eyes (Louisiana State U. Press, 1971)<br />Fred Chappell is a poet who talks like a regular guy, or what a regular guy would talk like if he had a vast dictionary in his head and a pitch-perfect grasp of the English language. It should be no surprise that Lovecraft is one of Chappell's heroes, for Chappell has the same precision of language and revelry in the beauty of the word that Lovecraft did. Most poets who feel this way, though, won't admit it on paper; Chappell even turned it into a whole novel (the blissfully awful 1968 release Dagon, in which Cthulhu and pals come to backwoods North Carolina. I kid you not).<br />The shadow of Howard Phillips and his slimy offspring are still to be found here, in Chappell's first \\"serious\\" work; the poem \\"Weird Tales\\" is, as one could reasonably surmise, a love letter to Lovecraft. Alongside the pieces of quiet, atmospheric horror and the attendant amusements can be found a number of meditations on baseball, the obligatory kid poems, a few witticisms, and cleverly-constructed formal pieces. To call this a \\"first book,\\" with all the attendant damning with faint praise that connotes, would be somewhat facetious. It's not that the work here is not strong (for it is), but that Chappell's stuff gets better as he gets older. His eye has sharpened, but it was certainly capable back in the day.<br />Excellent stuff. *** ½	2004-05-17

John Darnton, Mindcatcher (Onyx, 2002)<br />Darnton's latest novel has all sorts of nifty stuff going for it, not least a punchy, adrenaline-rousing plot. Tyler, a thirteen-year-old boy, has been injured in a rock climbing accident. Two scientists, brain surgeon Leopoldo Saramaggio and artificial intelligence guru Warren Cleaver, see Tyler as the gateway to performing a revolutionary new experiment that could further the medical field by orders of magnitude. At the other end of the spectrum are Tyler's father Scott and Kate Willett, one of Saramaggio's team, who find themselves confused by the ethical ramifications of what the two doctors are up to. Add to this a mutual animosity underlying the necessity of collaboration between Saramaggio and Cleaver, and you have all the makings for a decent medical thriller.<br />And decent it is, if overly wrapped in clich&eacute; and a little predictable at times. Darnton draws his characters well and invests them with real emotion, when they're not spouting phrases that were old when Shakespeare was writing soap operas. The pace rarely leaves breakneck level, and usually gets back up to speed within a few pages. The book goes quickly, especially once the operation begins about ninety pages in. It's good brain candy, gripping but eminently forgettable. An excellent beach read, as we head for another summer. *** ½	2004-05-17

This is good, solid haunted house horror that will keep you up late at night turning pages.<br />The mark of an author who knows what he's doing is the ability to draw you in without you knowing exactly where you got drawn in. King does it well, when he doesn't grab you with the first sentence. Carson McCullers was a master at it. Bailey is the heir apparent. I'm not sure where it happened, but somewhere between pages 25 and 65, I found myself wanting to not eat, not sleep, and not do much of anything else until I had finished this book.

Four respond: a journalist who spent the first tree years of his life there, a discredited medium, a veteran with a shady past, and a young doctor on the verge of losing her career. The five lock themselves (with the aid of a convenient blizzard) in Dreamland, and the fun begins.<br />Put together the words \\"Chicago\\" and \\"projects\\" and the first thing likely to come to any horror or true crime fan's mind is Cabrini Green. Bailey pulls a nice sleight-of-hand, recognizable only to those of who who've seen it before, to differentiate the two, but there are still obvious comparisons. (Some of the events leading to the ghostly activity have shades of real-life crimes committed at Cabrini Green, as well; readers of the works of Peter Sotos will recognize a few of the things Ramsey Lomax points out as he guides his compatriots on their first tour of Dreamland.) There are a few minor loose threads involved with this angle of things (an aerial photo of Dreamland is referred to as looking like Stonehenge, which Bailey draws attention to, and then it's never mentioned again, for example), but nothing that can't be explained away as a red herring.<br />Where Bailey's writing suffers, and let me rush to say I use the term \\"suffers\\" when benchmarking this stuff against classic haunted house literature that makes everyone and their mother's 100-best lists, is that his characterization is developed a bit on the, well, leisurely side. In other words, by the end of the book, you have three-dimensional characters, but in some cases you have to wait till the end of the book to get there. I understand this is a device for hooking the reader, but (a) it's overused and trite, and (b) Bailey's already got more hooks than the slaughterhouse in the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As passe as it may be, this is one place where Bailey could take a few new tricks from the old dog himself, Stephen King (who was, is, and always will be a master of characterization in a few concise lines).<br />That aside, I cannot say enough good things about Dale Bailey.

One almost wonders if Mr. Crouch hasn't cooked up a little semi-autobiographical tale here. But that aside...<br />Desert Places, Blake Crouch's debut novel, shows us an author with a great grasp of character, pacing, and plot, and perhaps not enough of an editing team. The novel roars to a start when successful thriller novelist Andrew Thomas gets an anonymous piece of mail telling him a body's buried on his property, his blood is on the victim, his fingerprints are on the murder weapon, and he has twenty-four hours to verify all this and call the real killer. This done, said real killer leads him into a rather ingenious trap, from which Mr. Thomas must escape in the most interesting of ways.<br />And so far, so good. We've covered about half the novel. There's also another really strong section at the end. But, just like Saving Private Ryan, you get stuck with this middle portion that drags. It's the shortest part of the novel, but it's also the most interminable. To Crouch's credit, he does wait for long, tedious setup until after the reader is already hooked, but it's still there, and could probably have been compressed into fewer pages than it actually took.<br />That said, the stronger parts of this novel are well worth reading, and they go by extremely quickly. That it dips in quality halfway through can be gotten past, if you're expecting it. Definitely one to check out, and an author to keep an eye on. *** ½	2004-05-10

Martin Scott, Thraxas and the Sorcerors (Orbit, 2001)<br />What a fantastic idea. Take a hardboiled detective, put him in a swords-and-sorcery setting, and see what happens. Unfortunately, a fantastic idea doesn't always work out, and this particular fantastic idea seems to have hit more than its share of potholes. In fact, not a single fantasy hardboiled detective that's crossed my desk to date has stood the test of time (or even the test of fifty pages).<br />The most recent of them is Thraxas, the title character in Martin Scott's series of comic novels. Thraxas and the Sorcerors is the fifth novel in the series, but I don't think I lost anything major by not starting with the first book. Actually, I think I saved myself four books of clich&eacute;, execrable editing, plot holes, and various and sundry other devices that make this, perhaps, the least interesting and exciting book I've read since I had the misfortune to inflict myself with the pain of Iris Johansen.<br />Someday, someone will manage to write a great hardboiled fantasy story. And I will happily subject myself to the swine to find the pearl (as I know it will be). Now it's time to move on; I have to keep looking. (zero)	2004-05-10

Brite, Wormwood (Dell, 1994)<br />This relatively early collection of stories (her first collection, and third published work, previously known as Swamp Foetus), collects stories written between 1986 and 1992. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the book is watching the progression between the earlier and the later stories; you can tell before getting to the end (each is dated) which are which, after an example or two of each.<br />This isn't to say the earlier stories are bad, they're just raw. And raw is not a bad thing. In fact, it can be quite charming, especially when one encounters another two Steve and Ghost stories (\\"Angels\\" and \\"How to Get Ahead in New York\\"), which also happen to be two of the longest in the book. It's rather odd to have watched an author create her own shared world and remain its sole inhabitant.<br />Steve and Ghost aside, there's a lot of fun stuff here for the discriminating fan of viscerally atmospheric (if that makes sense) horror. Brite's tales are not for the squeamish, but she never treads into the realms of Robert Deveraux (or, for that matter, her own novel Exquisite Corpse). Even the zombie story, which is a genre that basically invites excess gore (especially since Peter Jackson's wonderful film Dead Alive), has more of a quiet, dignified air about it (albeit one with some language that may make some neophytes squirm a bit in a different way).<br />Very good stuff. It's easy to say in hindsight this is the beginning work of a very gifted author, so imagine I'm saying it in 1994 and have amazing powers of presentiment. *** ½	2004-05-10

Charlee Jacob, Dread in the Beast (Necro Publications, 1999)<br />Necro have made a very large name for themselves in a very short span of time. It's pretty easy to see why from this lovely piece of work. As is often the case with high-quality small press releases, the bigs could take lessons from Necro in how to attractively, durably put together a book. (Would have been nice had the photo of Jacob on the rear flyleaf, rumored to be a topless photo, had been somewhat sharper, but only the most depraved of us are likely to quibble about that. And I'm not depraved. Really. Honest.)<br />But the attractiveness of the book itself is absolutely nothing when compared to what happens when you open the cover. While Jacob has made quite a name for herself with her first two novels, both of which are really, really ugly, her most effective work here is far quieter, working with the creep factor rather than the gross factor. Not, mind you, that the gross factor is absent. Readers picking up a book of Charlee Jacob's and expecting to find something akin to the collected works of Charles L. Grant are still going to be in for a rather rude awakening. Charlee Jacob is an extremely disturbed woman, and I mean that in the best of ways. Stories like \\"Fire\\" are going to turn the stomach of even the most cast-iron-gulleted reader, and will amuse and horrify as they do so. Established Jacob fans can rest easy that they're going to get their fair share of blood and guts.<br />But she quiets down every once in a while, and lets the pieces of her repertoire hinted at in her novels come to the fore. She has a very existential streak about her, and touched on it in some parts of Haunter, but it really comes out in the book's title story (not coincidentally also set abroad for much of its length, this time in Cairo). She has a deft touch for the gloomy, goth-esque macabre, as well, revealed in pieces like \\"Scalpel Mouth.\\"<br />Many facets of Charlee Jacob here, every one of them delightfully grotesque. Definitely a collection worth finding (though it may be difficult, as only 352 copies were ever printed). ***1/2y grotesque.

Robert Silverberg (ed.), Legends, vol. 2 (Tor, 1998)<br />This is water in the desert for fans of fantasy series whose books have a tendency to have a long time between releases. Anne McCaffrey (Pern), George R. R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire), and Terry Goodkind (Sword of Truth) all contribute short novels to this volume in the Legends series, and all are well worth your time.<br />Goodkind's story, \\"Debt of Bones,\\" leads off the trilogy, and deals with a time when Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander was much younger than he is in the Sword of Truth novels. Here, he's pitted against Panis Rahl, and must decide whether to put himself, and the fate of the Midlands, in danger in order to fulfill a debt of bones to the daughter of a deceased sorceress. One has come to expect strong storytelling and easy turning of pages from Goodkind, and he does not disappoint here. Martin's story, \\"The Hedge Knight,\\" follows. Again taking place some time before the events in the Song of Ice and Fire books, \\"he Hedge Knight\\" follows the squire of a newly deceased mercenary, who has a desire to make his name in a tournament against some of the biggest names in the business (including a number of Targaryens, who at the time of this story have not yet been banished; in fact, they play a major part in the story, which should be a pleasant surprise to many Ice and Fire fans). Martin's work on this series is always a pleasure, and once again, the is no disappointment to be found here, though one wonders about the loose end to be found.<br />The biggest surprise of the bunch, to me, was McCaffrey's \\"Runner of Pern.\\" I've always shied away from the Pern books, for no real reason. This story is a welcome change of pace from the two that precede it; rather than battles, jousting, and the rest, this is a quiet romantic coming-of-age tale that hits just the right spot, like a lemon ice after a boeuf bourguignon. It's convinced me to go back and try the Pern novels, as McCaffrey's style is simple and engaging. Like the others, she keeps the pages turning.<br />Definitely a worthwhile piece of work. I shouldn't have to sell those who are already enmeshed in the various series covered here, but others will find it a perfect sampling to see if the three titans covered here are to their tastes.

Ka-Tzetnik 135633, House of Dolls (Simon and Schuster, 1955)<br />Ka-Tzetnik 135633, Nazi-assigned pen name of an Auschwitz survivor (oddly, there seems to be some controversy as to who Ka-Tzetnik 135633 was; some say it was Yehiel De-Nir, others Karol Cetynski), here gives an account of life in a Nazi prison camp, but in the most roundabout of ways. This seemingly autobiographical novel (viz. Shvitti: A Vision, where he speaks of his own sister in Daniella's role) deals mostly with the stories of Harry and Daniella, a brother and sister living in the Jewish quarters of an unnamed town on the border of Germany and Poland. Roughly the first half of the book is a simple depiction of trying to get along day to day in the Jewish quarters, told mostly from Daniella's viewpoint. To be blunt, it's slow as molasses. The book picks up (and becomes the highly-recommended-by-the-underground book it is) when Daniella, not long after Harry, is taken to a concentration camp and ends up working in the House of Dolls, a camp brothel. Harry, in the next camp over, has been made the camp medic for no reason anyone can discern. There is little plot to the latter half of the novel; instead, Ka-Tzetnik 135633 infuses the whole mess with a painful sense of irony. Imagine an O.Henry story that runs 250 pages and has a far, far darker cast to it than anything O.Henry ever wrote.<br />There is much to be gained from reading this book beyond the prurient; don't get me wrong. However, I'm guessing that its audience is going to be an exceptionally narrow one; those who both revel in (or are horrified by, but cannot turn their eyes from) degradation (Daniella, I should mention, is fourteen when the novel takes place; this is the dark and ugly flip side of Duras' wonderful novel The Lover) and are willing to put up with the diction that one had thought went extinct with the death of Henry James. Still, it is the literary equivalent of, say, Shoah, the excellent and painful nine and a half hour film that still stands as the be-all and end-all of concentration camp documentaries. It is brutal and unflinching, for all its slowness, and deserves a wider audience than that which it has already captured. ** ½ilm that still stands as the be-all and end-all of concentration camp documentaries.

John Pelan (ed.), The Darker Side: Generations of Horror (Roc, 2002)<br />Pelan's second collection of \\"the new breed\\" of horror writers connects on most levels where the original failed. There's still a smattering of bad mixed in, but this time, most of the results are good.<br />I should get the bad out of the way first. I haven't yet tired of calling Edo van Belkom this generation's Saul Wernick, and he gives me another opportunity with the anthology's opening story. The usual van Belkom; simple, unscary, likely to be as obscure in twenty years as Saul Wernick is now. David Niall Wilson and Shikhar Dixit both come extremely close to having written great pieces of fiction (I'd be hard-pressed to call either a horror tale, but both have an appealing gothic quality to them), but fall somewhat short in the delivery. In both cases, continuity is the problem. Both authors paint a very lovely picture, but fail to connect enough dots to let us know what the picture is.<br />But enough of that. So many of these authors deserve such praise. Pelan rectifies the overlooking he did in the original anthology, including such names as Poppy Z. Brite, Cait Kiernan (whose story here is one of the most understated and effective she's written), Mehitobel Wilson, Charlee Jacob, Brian Keene, and the wonderful Jess Salmonson (who's been writing longer than most of these authors have been alive, thus lending some credence to the title this time), all of whom turn in good, and some great, stuff. (Charlee Jacob, in particular, rocks the house. As usual.) Returning are two of the finest authors from the original, Lucy Taylor and Brian Hodge. Taylor's story is luscious, erotic, and painful (nothing new from Taylor, but pulled off excellently here). Hodge's story, like the previous anthology's \\"Skinwriters,\\" though, is the story for which you want to buy this book, and the story for which you will treasure it.<br />Hodge's story is told in a memoir style, and you will spend the vast majority of the time wondering what this story is doing in a horror anthology. (As Hodge's novels have turned to mystery, it's not an unreasonable thing to wonder.) At the end of the story, he pulls it off, but it's so deadpan and understated you're STILL left with the idea that this is a memoir, perhaps penned by Dennis Lehane or Dash Hammett or one of the other tough-guy mystery writers. It's concise, wonderful, and probably the best stuff I've seen from Hodge since Deathgrip, well over a decade ago.<br />Better than its predecessor The Dark Side.

I finally got my hands on a copy and gave it a try, and for all I know, those who call it such are correct. I couldn't tell. Hoban buys completely into the idea of creating a dialect that is only vaguely resembling English, and worse, he has his narrator use it for the whole novel. I'm sure there are those out there who became quickly fluent in it and could read this at the same speed they read any other novel, but I am incapable of such things. Every page took me at least ten minutes to get through. The end result is that the book is frustrating, incoherent, and ultimately unreadable.

Jim McManus, Positively Fifth Street: Murderers, Cheetahs, and Binion's World Series of Poker (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 2003)<br />Jim McManus made the final table at the World Series of Poker.<br />That alone should make any poker player want to pick this book up and read it immediately. It gets better when you realize that McManus went in as the rankest of rank amateurs, the guy whose previous poker career revolved around the $3-$6 Hold 'em game at the local VFW. Yes, folks, Jim McManus is living proof that anyone CAN do it. And, as This American Life host Ira Glass says on the back cover, the poker writing to be found here really is some of the best sports writing you are likely to ever see; McManus' descriptions are easily the equal of Laura Hillenbrand's race descriptions in Seabiscuit (and this is high praise indeed). Its when McManus gets off the subject of poker that things tend to go downhill.<br />Unfortunately, this happens often. McManus was in Vegas for the purpose of covering the Murphy/Tabish trial (Murphy and Tabish were accused of murdering Ted Binion, wayward son of the owner of the casino where the World Series of Poker is held*), and much of the book details McManus' attempts to get at the meat of the psyches of Binion, Murphy, and Tabish, in order to write the article. Despite the tenuous connections McManus makes between murder and poker towards the end of the book, these are two separate pieces, and should have been treated as such.<br />Worth reading for the cards.

Klein, Mrs. Rahlo's Closet and Other Mad Tales (iPublish, 2001)<br />Well, it was rather inevitable, wasn't it? It took H. P. Lovecraft almost sixty years to spawn a worthwhile descendant in Thomas Ligotti; Ligotti, on the other hand, took less than ten until the first writer of worth to wear the influence on his sleeve came along. That writer is R. E. Klein.<br />Don't get me wrong; a lot of other authors have been influenced by Ligotti, but none this obviously. Where other authors balance the Ligotti influence with various other things (Kiernan's gothic twist, for example), Klein seems to balance Ligotti against Lovecraft, and focuses on those parts of Ligotti that are most obvious when translated into an author's own voice. Klein also brings back in the science fiction vibe of Lovecraft's that has seem to have been bred out of most other horror writers, and it's refreshing. This isn't bad B-grade alien horror flicks (though one can imagine a number of these stories being turned into bad B-grade alien horror flicks), but manages to keep the tone and content above the drowning level, just as Lovecraft did and Ligotti does.<br />Klein is more, for lack of a better term, earthy than either of his predecessors, however. Lovecraft's diction (and Ligotti's distillations of Lovecraft's diction) are very much of a piece with nineteenth-century literature; one can imagine all of their heroes enunciating, with cultured Oxford accents. Not so Klein, whose protagonists are just as easily imagined with the flat Beantown delivery one should get from folks in that part of the country.<br />Put simply, this is fun stuff. The title story is straight out of Lovecraft's fake book. Other stories include tales of a private investigator who solves crimes that have not yet been committed, what happens when the artifact of a celestial war lands on the doorstep of your average Joe, and various other amusing little tidbits.<br />Fun stuff. Definitely worth a look-see. *** ½	2004-04-23

John Hollander, A Crackling of Thorns (Yale, 1958)<br />The Yale Series of Younger Poets is, by and large, a very good thing. Seems like every book of theirs I've come across has been chock full of poety goodness, and this, the first book from John Hollander, is no exception. Introduced by W. H. Auden (who criticizes Hollander for some of his word choices, but otherwise seems to think he's the bees' knees), A Crackling of Thorns was one of the last salvos in a battle poetry has been losing over the past century-the formal verse. And Hollander excels at formal verse, though the times he lapses into blank verse are some of the collection's most powerful moments.<br />Hollander remains one of the few poets, along with such luminaries as Marilyn Hacker and Dana Gioia, who excel in the art of formal poetry. A Crackling of Thorns was Hollander at his grandiose finest, when life was still a Greek tragedy and all of us set decorators. If you enjoy Hollander's later work (or have been put off by his sporadic coarseness), this is definitely one to check out; if you're unaware of his work, or if you're a teacher looking for a good, solid collection with which to introduce more complex formal work to a class, this is a fantastic place to get to know the work of John Hollander.  *** ½	2004-04-23

Crunk, Living in the Resurrection (Yale, 1995)<br />It has been a century since the Yale Series of Younger Poets published its first book. They have been of inconsistent quality over the years, but they do tend to release more books that shine than they do books that thud. Living in the Resurrection, the 1994 selection introduced by the mighty James Dickey, is definitely one of the former.<br />Crunk, born and raised in backwoods Kentucky in a highly Baptist family, draws (as most poets do) on his childhood for much of what he writes, though the poems never take on that \\"confessional\\" feel one gets from the Beats, for example; instead, Crunk invests his work with a quiet power, a willingness to say his piece and let the images that form in our heads do all the real talking. In other words, Crunk has a real understanding of what poetry is, rather than taking it and attempting to use it as a tool to do whatever it is he wants to do.<br />\\"The river is a wound in the earth.<br />The river is the clay-red blood of love<br />pulling its silence through us....<br />And the soul is a small glass boat setting out.\\"<br />(\\"Baptism\\")<br />Perhaps the most intriguing part of the book is its middle section, comprised of pieces of what is now termed \\"flash fiction,\\" that proves Crunk can more than ably take his poetic voice and transfer it to the fictive form, keeping the work just as image-oriented and compelling:<br />\\"My mother said later that, to the shovel operators, we must have looked like some delegation from out of town that couldn't find the picnic.

(Astounding, 1938)<br />A story which inspired a generation, and twice changed the face of filmmaking, reprinted in its original form after far too long a time. Who Goes There?\\" was, of course, the basis for the 1951 film The Thing from Another World, remade more true to form by John Carpenter as simply The Thing in 1982. Both were, arguably, the best work of each director involved, as Campbell's story is arguably his finest moment.<br />Those who saw the first film and not the second are likely not to recognize much of anything about the story at all. An observation post in Antarctica finds the remnants of a spacecraft, and in attempting to get it out of the ice destroy it accidentally. They also find something with the spaceship, but separate from it: an alien lifeform. They get this out of the ice, bring it, back, and thaw it out for the biologist to study. Bad idea, because as it turns out, the thing is capable of assimilating the forms of creatures it eats. Including humans.<br />To be brutally honest, Carpenter's revision and expansion of the story jacks the paranoia level up far higher than the original material, and the somewhat predictable ending is a bit too gung-ho. Also, in Campbell's attempts to keep most of that whole eating bit offscreen, he goes over the brink of subtlety into confusion in more than one place, though the problems are relatively quickly rectified. The story itself is well worth reading simply for its archival value as the progenitor of two excellent films, but it will grab ahold and keep you interested even if you already know what's going to happen. *** ½	2004-04-13

Joe Frank, The Queen of Puerto Rico and Other Stories (Morrow, 1993)<br />That this book appeared and disappeared as quickly as it did is testament to how much faith America has lost in radio. Frank, the undisputed king of noir radio drama, released this collection of transcriptions, elaborations, asides, segues, and other obvious evasions of traditional short story writing, to shall we say a crashing silence. Which is unfortunate.<br />While the stories do lose something when not delivered in Frank's trademark deadpan style, the very oddity of them should still be appealing for those who haven't been introduced to Frank's radio work. The basis for much of what Frank does is to take a regular situation we're all involved in regularly, then draw it to the most absurd conclusion possible. You end up with things like \\"Fat Man,\\" about a college student who forgets to pay for a brownie one day, then decides he's going to start a collection of stolen Howard Johnson's brownies, or the O. Henryesque \\"Green Cadillac,\\" about a man standing on a city streetcorner waiting to meet a guy who owes him money and the various people who accost him.<br />Where the stories fall short, most times, are when the same attempts to interweave completely disparate stories bleed over from radio (where they lend the work an odd, attention-keeping power) into the text. Here, they just seem confusing for the most part (the notable exception being the title story, perhaps the best in the collection, where everything coalesces into a lovely absurd slice of life story). But it is a minor problem at best, and should in no way keep both hardcore Frankophiles and folks who have never heard Frank before from seeking out a copy of this collection. While you're at it, pick up copies (KCRW sells them) of the CDs of \\"Rent a Family\\" and \\"The Dictator,\\" two novel-length radio dramas that showcase Frank at his best. **** ½	2004-04-13

John Pelan (ed.), Darkside: Horror for the next Millennium (Roc, 1996)<br />First off: there are a slew of really awful reviews for this book out there. Most of them seem to have some of their criticisms in the right place (the subtitle is utterly meaningless being the most common that actually has a shred of validity). The rest of them seem to require a quick history of horror. Recent horror, especially, but that known as \\"splatterpunk\\" is nothing new. The complainers might do well to go back and read some of the more visceral work from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries before talking about how wonderful it is that old horror is still on the shelf instead of this dreck.<br />There are two schools of horror now. This is most obvious in the Japanese film industry, but they both seem alive and well in the American horror story, too. There is the atmospheric, spooky horror (aka JNH in the Japanese film industry), and then there is the extreme horror (aka the Guinea Pig movement, in honor of the series of extreme horror films of that name). Extreme horror rose to prominence in America in the eighties on the wings of authors like Ed Lee, Ray Garton, and Candace Caponegro; it has been the strongest direction in which horror has gone since, especially with the publication of the seminal, brilliant anthology Splatterpunks.<br />Darkside should, rightly, have been Splatterpunks III. Only a few of the stories would have seemed out of place, and the complainers would have known to steer clear.(Oh, horrors. Your fourteen-year-old got his hands on a copy and you took it away from him. If HE doesn't have a problem with the subject matter and YOU do, have you ever stopped to consider it's not your child's psyche that is the problem here?) The truly memorable stories here would get their due; especially chilling are Lauren Fitzgerald's \\"Wasting,\\" Edward Lee's now-infamous tale 'The Stick Woman,\\" and Sue Storm's \\"Having Eyes, See Ye Not?\\" (especially amusing as I write this, as some bonehead inspired by a recent film tried to do exactly the same thing a few days ago). The JNH-style stories, in standing out as different from the rest, would get even more due than they have (the book's opener, Robert J. Levy's \\"Skinwriters,\\" is crafted with a precision that beings to mind Richard Christian Matheson's immortal story \\"Red\\", and Brian McNaughton's \\"ystery orm\\"is far more a Thomas Ligotti story than Ligotti's own contribution here). I'd still have to wonder what two of the book's last three stories are on about (Ligotti's \\"The Nightmare Network,\\" which is still unfathomable upon second reading, and t. Winter-Damon and Randy Chandler's boring, overly-messaged \\"...And Thou Hast Given Them Blood to Drink,\\" a piece cut from their novel Duet for the Devil).<br />Flashes of real genius here are rare, as they are in most anthologies; Levy is definitely a writer to watch, as are McNaughton and Adam-Troy Castro, among others. Some of the heavy hitters bring out decent material, as well. Along with Lee, Wayne Allen Sallee definitely delivers the goods (a very short monologue from the point of view of Timothy McVeigh), and Jack Ketchum and Lucy Taylor deliver good, solid work, if nothing groundbreaking. Some of the other stories fall flat (surprisingly, Caitlin R. Kiernan's is one of them; rare is the Kiernan story that is not perfect), and some of the young writers notorious in their absence here may take some of the luster away (notably, Poppy Z. Brite was still a neophyte when this came out).<br />Final call: some good, some bad. You always have to wade through the swine, but the pearls are worth it; \\"Skinwriters\\" alone is worth the cost of admission here, everything else is icing on the cake. ***is, as some bonehead inspired by a recent film tried to do exactly the same thing a few days ago).

Kathe Koja, Kink (Henry Holt, 1996)<br />Kathe Koja's fifth novel, and her last (to date) book for adults, came and went in the blink of an eye. Published by a relatively obscure publisher (Henry Holt normally does textbooks and obscure \\"literary\\" fiction) rather than her native Dell, given next to no publicity, and allowed to languish, Kink fell into obscurity within a few months of its publication date. I first ran across word Koja had published a fifth novel two months after its release; when I tried to order a copy, Borders was unable to get it. It had already gone out of print. It has never, to my knowledge, been released in paperback.<br />To call this an abomination, a crime against nature, would perhaps be understating the case. Koja is one of a handful of writers who regularly compete for the title of America's finest living person of letters. Kink, coming after the two perfect novels Skin and Strange Angels, could only be a letdown, right? If it went out of print THAT fast?<br />Of course not, fool.<br />Kink is, as any fan of Koja's is probably happy to hear, a work of brilliance just as blinding and extreme as Strange Angels (or Straydog, the book that came afterwards, with six long years between the two). It is not, like her previous novels, horror. Unlike the others, it doesn't even pretend to be. Kink is human drama, pure and simple. The mysterious, ethereal characters who have peppered her work from the beginning of here career are here exposed as pathetic, degenerates for the sake of degeneracy, living in their own little worlds carved out of the fabric of reality, existing only to hover around Koja's main characters like moths drawn to a bug zapper.<br />In this case, the main characters are three: Jess and Sophie, the young couple in love, meet Lena, the alluring loner. Through a string of events that seem random to Jess, who narrates, Lena ends up moving in, and well, the inevitable occurs.<br />Three-way relationships, be they [adult relations] or platonic, are the most fragile of delicacies. The ability to manipulate the balance of power within one to one's own ends, whatever they may be, are endless. Ultimately, that's what Kink is about; the rest of the world (including the novel's readership) is clearly capable of seeing this from the get-go, while Jess is too thick-headed to get it. (The comments of many of the book's reviewers make me think that, while they get that Jess is too thickheaded to see what's going on, don't buy how easy it is to manipulate others in such a situation. Trust me. The realism here goes well above and beyond that to be found in Skin or Strange Angels.) Jess' inability to see what's going on around him is relatively understandable, as he's blinded by both his love for Sophie and his passion for Lena; he does make some hall-of-fame-worthy stupid moves at various times, which to be fair have to be rationalized away. Eventually, the book does move out of the world of the [physical relations] dynamic and back into the world of the pathetic losers I talked about at the start, a world Jess is now very familiar with, and the book sets up a mystery about one of Lena's old flames (with a sucker punch at the end that caps the book off perfectly) that continues the interest far beyond anything reasonable.<br />Kink is a novel about obsession. I get the feeling that the more of an obsessive personality you are as a reader, the more you'll get out of it. I can say with almost certainty that if you've been in a three-way relationship that went horribly, fatal-car-accident-scale wrong and stayed that way for a period of time, you're going to end up revering this book.  Koja fans who have been hunting it down since its release will also not be disappointed. The rest of the world, well, recent research has led me to believe they just won't get it.<br />Kink is not as good as Strange Angels, but in the same way Skin is not as good as Strange Angels; the three of them (along with Straydog, but itbeing part of the \\"new phase\\" of Koja's work I probably shouldn't count it) form a triumvirate that could stand as a how-to guide for writers of fiction who want to deal in well-drawn characters, dark plots, and existential decay. Strange Angels, as I have often said, is one of the three or four best novels in the English language; \\"not as good\\" means Skin and Kink fall somewhere in the top, say, twenty-five. Whatever possessed Henry Holt to publish this I have no idea, but I just went back over my last five years of reading, and whatever it is, I hope it stays at Holt. It is by far the finest novel they ever produced that came across my desk. *****being part of the \\"new phase\\" of Koja's work I probably shouldn't count it) form a triumvirate that could stand as a how-to guide for writers of fiction who want to deal in well-drawn characters, dark plots, and existential decay.

Eric Gunnerson, A Programmer's Introduction to C#, 2/e (Apress, 2001)<br />The title of the book pretty much tells you all you need to know, though it might better have been termed \\"A Programmer Who Knows How to Read Microsoft Documentation's Introduction\\" etc. Gunnerson is (of course) more complete in his overview than the Microsoft documentation team usually are, but the book does assume more knowledge than even most intermediate programmers already have. Specifically, while one can assume, say knowledge of the basic way string classes work, the book treats some of the more esoteric new features of .NET with the same glossing, leading to some confusing passages.<br />This is definitely a worthwhile reference book, as an adjunct to your more in-depth reading, but isn't a good starting point. ***	2004-04-13

Carruth tells us in the introduction that when he stumbled upon it he recognized some old favorites, and thus the birth of this collection.<br />As seen in The Bird/Poem Book, Carruth is a far better writer than he is a selector of poetry. When he is good, he is very very good, and many of the poems here reflect Carruth doing what he does best. Some of them, on the other hand, are quite simply bombs. Too much politics, not enough poetry, the epidemic that has swept the world since Robert Service and likely before.

John Whitaker, Handicapping Trainers: In Search of the Longshot Winner (Liberty, 1990)<br />The problem, sometimes, with reading old handicapping books is that the information has since been revised and updated by someone else in the interim. In this case, trainer handicapping has had much light shed on it in the past fifteen years. At the time of this book's publication, though, it was definitely a worthwhile read, something new and interesting. (And even now, much of the strongest work to be found on trainer handicapping is restricted, having never been published except in obscure articles in even more obscure magazines. So there should still be a market for this book.)<br />The basics here will be familiar with anyone who's handicapped more than a couple of races since the last time the Daily Racing Form changed its format; Whitaker talks about keeping trainer stats. (For the record, the ones kept by the Daily Racing Form are always suspect and never to be trusted.) It seems obvious now, but no one was doing it back then. Whitaker gives an easy, if time-consuming, approach for doing this that allows for very quick lookup of any given trainer whose record you may happen to need quickly.<br />All in all good stuff, but for most it will be outdated. Worth having in your handicapping bookshelf as a collector's item, though.***	2004-04-13

Simultaneously irreverent and spiritual, the bulk of the poems in this book center around themes of higher powers and how odd they are when looked at from our perspective. Simic's usual surreal wit is in play throughout, and almost every poem has an unexpected pleasure waiting for the reader at the end. (I'd jotted down quotes to put here, but it was raining yesterday and the paper got smudged.

John Hollander, The Head of the Bed (David R. Godine, 1974)<br />The Head of the Bed comes with a quick critical study afterwards written by Harold Bloom, and is a much better book for it. Hollander's pre-Raphaelite poetic cycle is quite readable on its own, but without Bloom, it's going to be nothing but a bunch of pretty descriptions, unless you happen to be up on some slightly obscure mythology and some modern commentary upon it. (It's also the first time I've ever seen the word shehkinah used in a piece of non-religious prose. An unexpected little pleasure.)<br /><br />Bloom's surprisingly readable afterword aside, the poem itself is quite a nice little piece. Fifteen fifteen-line pieces, numbered rather than titled, in essence a single nightmare and Hollander's pontifications on its inspirations. The word \\"pre-Raphaelite\\" above is not used lightly; the description here comes thick, fast, and rococo. Which is, when you think about it, a rather impressive thing to do in only two hundred twenty-five total lines (consider the lengths of the epics by William Morris or Dante Gabriel Rossetti and you'll see where I'm coming from). The whole comes off as something of an anti-pastoral, pretty and ominous at the same time.<br />There are likely better places to start with the notoriously difficult Hollander, but this one reads extremely well regardless. **** (*** ½ if you get it without the Bloom commentary)	2004-03-31

Li-Young Lee, Book of My Nights (BOA Editions, 2001)<br />Every time I find myself ready to crown a single person the foremost voice in American poetry (the candidate at present being Charles Simic), a book comes along by some other author I've forgotten who relegates the candidate to a shortlist. He undermining principle today is Li-Young Lee's Book of My Nights. I'd read The City in Which I Love You some years ago, thought it wonderful, and then promptly forgotten about Lee, who is of that school of poets who releases a book every seven or eight years. This is his most recent, and it is fantastic.<br />The subgenre of poetry best classified as \\"zen koan poems\\" has been greatly denigrated in Western literature, thanks in no small part to a bunch of bad amateurs in the fifties and sixties whose work persists in the public memory to this day. (I'm sure I don't need to name names. It's that impenetrable merde you came across in various literary magazines and the like that made you think \\"what on earth is this person on about?\\") The zen koan makes you think, not dismiss. Li-Young Lee seems to have taken the unenviable task upon himself to return the poetic version of the zen koan to the literary heights which it by rights should hold, and in The Book of My Nights, he takes great steps toward that goal.<br />Centering, as one would surmise from the title, around such topics as dreams and insomnia, Book of My Nights showcases Lee's considerable prowess with putting together strings of words aimed at making the reader contemplate some question that has no definitive answer; either it is unanswerable or every person will have his own different answer to the question.<br />\\"When he returns to the tale,<br />the page is dark,<br />and the leaves at the window have been traveling<br />beside his silent reading<br />as long as he can remember.<br />Where is his father?<br />When will his mother be home?<br />How is he going to explain<br />the moon taken hostage, the sea<br />risen to fill up all the mirrors?\\"<br />(from \\"Degrees of Blue\\")<br />Lee's book-length poetic output may be small (Book of My Nights is his third book of poems), but it is wonderful for all that.

Back then, there were your great writers, there were your A-list writers (who were good, but rarely approached greatness, and never with any regularity), and then, as A Christmas Story wryly tells us, there were \\"the nameless rabble of victims,\\" those all-but-anonymous genre writers whose work is now lost to the wind. (That the same can be said of many of the greats in no way makes the two in any way similar.) For every John Holt, Edward Levy, or Michael Paine writing in the eighties, you had ten Ken Eulos, Saul Wernicks, and William Hills.<br />These days, the ratio seems to have been turned on its head. You can find great horror writers under every rock. Poppy Z. Brite, Caitlin R. Kiernan, Charlee Jacob, Carlton Mellick III, and their ilk have raised the bar for literary horror far past any place I could have hoped it would go when I first discovered that avatar of literate horror, Clive Barker. Nowadays, you have to search pretty far for the genre writer, the guy whose books are going to sell a few hundred thousand copies and then fade into obscurity.<br />Scream Queen falls solidly into the realm of genre fiction destined for obscurity. But like the best work of Eulo, Wernick, Hill et al., while it sticks around, those few hundred thousand readers who take van Belkom up on his offer to ride through this funhouse are going to have one hell of a trip.<br />Scream Queen gives us such an obvious premise it's amazing no one's actually pulled it off yet: two brothers who direct low-budget horror films stage a reality TV show, Scream Queen, the winner of which gets the lead part in the brothers' new movie. All the winner has to do is spend the night in a hunted house (rigged with tricks, natch, to scare the contestants), then have the public vote on her as the best of the contestants. Simple, right? (And brilliant. Expect it to happen in real life in the next couple of years. That's a reality series even I would watch.) The only problem is that the haunted house the producers and their team have tricked out really IS a haunted house, and the ghosts therein are not very happy to receive guests.<br />The action starts early and continues pretty much nonstop (there are some slow points for setup, but the writing is such that even they go by quickly). This is a slim novel, by modern horror standards, three hundred pages even. They fly. The reader is likely to find himself jarred at least once per page by stupid typos (and the obviously far overpaid editor never met a homonym he didn't misuse), but after a while you gloss those over and just get on with it. Nothing here is likely to make you say \\"boy, that was unexpected!\\" or think van Belkom has a line on the next great idea to move the whole genre forward.<br />If this were a movie, it'd be turn-your-brain-off entertainment.

Thomas Ligotti, My Work Is Not Yet Done (Mythos Books, 2002)<br />Thomas Ligotti stamped himself as a force to be reckoned with in horror fiction from the release of his very first collection, Songs of a Dead Dreamer, almost fifteen years ago as I write this. He has remained, unfortunately, obscure ever since, despite putting out some of the highest-quality horror to be found anywhere in recent years. Now, along comes My Work Is Not Yet Done, and it's released by the smallest of presses, virtually ensuring it will not find the audience it deserves and catapult Ligotti to the top of the bestseller lists, where he has belonged all this time.<br />My Work Is Not Yet Done is a short novel (the title piece) and two previously collected stories. Of the three, \\"My Work Is Not Yet Done\\" is the collection's best piece. While Ligotti has always been a writer of unimpeachable quality, the critics who likened his early work \\"derivative of Lovecraft\\" were not all that far off the mark. \\"My Work Is Not Yet Done\\" is a whole new Ligotti; it's as if his own voice suddenly broke through and he left behind the shed skin of Lovecraft. And Ligotti's own voice is just as compelling, if not even more so. His protagonist in this story has a lot to say, and says it well. Traces of the ridiculously erudite still remain, but the guy sounds more like someone sitting next to you in a restaurant than someone delivering a lecture to PhD candidates.<br />The other two stories in the book are minor works, but still indicative of the brilliance of Ligotti. \\"I Have a Special Plan for This World\\" puts a completely alien spin on the urban landscape, giving us just enough details to get queasy without actually giving us the goods a la the splatterpunks and their spinoffs. \\"The Nightmare Network,\\" the collection's weakest piece, takes an impressionist dada look at the world of the corporate merger. It seems as if Ligotti were going for the same \\"give them just enough\\" vibe from the previous story, but fell short by a few yards. Still, what's there is capable of evoking a vague sense of dread, rather than simply falling flat on its face, as so many unsuccessful horror stories do.<br />Absolutely wonderful.

Instantly, hundreds of messages popped up all over the net asking where this book could be found, its price on bookfinder (and the rare ebay copy) skyrocketed. Amazon's zShops quickly sold out of copies. It's presently as sought after as Sierra Leone diamonds.<br />There's a copy at the Cleveland Public Library, folks. I'm done with it. And I hope that movie is a whole lot better than the book.<br />While I will give Roszak a few points for having a readable passage here and there (Sharkey describing the construction of his cameras to the narrator early in the book has an odd, slow hypnotic quality to it), and I was willing to give him more than the benefit of the doubt that I was just young and impatient when I tried Bugs, I found this book to have the same overwhelming problem as Bugs; it's painfully, glacially, unreadably slow. It's boring. Before reading Flicker, I'd have laughed if you'd told me you found a book whose author managed to make a threesome boring. But, well, here it is.<br />I can find absolutely nothing to recommend in Flicker, and again offer up a small prayer that Aronofsky can take this source material and make it into something watchable.

Michael Laimo, Atmosphere (Leisure, 2002)<br />The first hundred fifty or so pages of Michael Laimo's debut novel are your typical kidnapping-murder-mystery with a twist, nothing we haven't seen before, with somewhat subpar writing thrown into the mix. There were a few times I'd have been flirting with just not finishing it at all, were not the pace so quick. But it hits critical mass, and suddenly becomes one of the finest premises in a thriller in recent years. Almost enough to forgive the subpar writing.<br />Frank Ballaro is a New York City homicide detective a couple of years from retirement. On his way home early one morning after twelve hours of paperwork on a recently-finished case, he gets out of his car and steps into a puddle of blood. Investigating, he finds a horribly mutilated teen, who runs past him in terror straight into the path of a taxi. As they wait for help to arrive, the kid whispers one word to Ballaro: \\"Atmosphere.\\" Ballaro and his longtime friend Hector Rodriguez are quickly drawn into one of the oddest cases of kidnapping and murder anyone's ever seen.<br />The first half of the book is unabashedly setup, and can be a little difficult to get through. Laimo makes it as easy as possible by keeping the pace rapid. Once things take their right turn at suspension-of-disbelief, there's nothing you haven't seen before in a number of TV shows and movies, but Laimo cribs together so many disparate ideas and works them into a narrative whole that it's hard not to just sit back and wonder what sort of twisted mind came up with such a wide-ranging bunch of ideas to throw into this melting pot.<br />There are a few extreme bits, but for the most part Laimo is more from the Charles L. Grant school of horror than the Robert Devereaux school; not much in here is going to make the reader of modern horror (especially that from Leisure Books) cringe much. This is more straight thriller than horror novel, and should appeal to fans of the genre who are willing to let belief fly out the window.<br />Aside from some deadwood (cliches, badly-written sentences, oddly out of place words, that sort of thing), Laimo's first novel is a stand up sit down bang up ride, well worth the price of admission. *** ½to let belief fly out the window.<br />Aside from some deadwood (cliches, badly-written sentences, oddly out of place words, that sort of thing), Laimo's first novel is a stand up sit down bang up ride, well worth the price of admission. *** ½	2004-03-29

Kiernan, In the Garden of Poisonous Flowers (Subterranean, 2002)<br />This novella may be slight, but that's not the only reason it was a one-day read for me. Kiernan, perhaps the premier stylist in gothic literature (she eschews the term \\"horror,\\" and in truth her work does often seem to head more into the dark fantasy realm) today, is quite simply a fine writer on top of it all.<br />In the Garden of Poisonous Flowers is a prequel to Kiernan's novel Threshold, introducing the albino Dancy Flammarion, who does such things as talk to angels and stuffed bears (who talk back, of course) and kill monsters. Fate, destiny, or whatever you'd like to call it has Dancy hooking up with a carload of very strange folks on their way to Savannah to take in a meeting with a rather odd group of Southern belles who give a whole new meaning to the term \\"ladies' auxiliary.\\" A strange boy with a bottle fits into the tale, as well (but readers are advised that how it is, exactly, he fits will not be revealed under later in Dancy's career).<br />I get the feeling Kiernan is one of those writers you either love or hate. Her stories are, for the most part, style over substance; there's meat on the bones, but it tends to be somewhat lean and smell slightly of mange. Like the majority of modern horror writers who work in multiple-volume tales (thank you, Stephen King, for this annoying trend), when you find yourself finishing this tale, you'll probably end up with more questions than you had when you started. (Answer a few, and end up with a whole lot more, by reading Threshold. Then we'll talk.) So in other words, what you have with In the Garden of Poisonous Flowers (and, in my experience, the majority of Kiernan's tales) is a slice of what amounts to a very weird and otherworldly life. It's taking the hyperrealism of, say, Joyce Carol Oates' early work and dropping it wholesale onto a dark alternate universe. I can understand how it would jar. What makes Kiernan worth your time, though, is the beauty of the language, how the words come together to paint the pictures in your head. That's what this book is all about, in the end.<br />It didn't do as much for me as did Candles for Elizabeth or her contribution to Wrong Things, but it's still a pretty fine piece of work. ***me, though, is the beauty of the language, how the words come together to paint the pictures in your head.

Charlee Jacob, Haunter (Leisure, 2003)<br />For years I have been searching for the book that would compete with Robert Devereaux's debut novel, Deadweight, out on the bleeding edge of Most Extreme Horror Novel. No one has been willing to tread the same path of degradation, misery, and despair. What anguish must it cause a writer (because, as we all know, to convey emotions effectively the writer must feel them twice as strongly) to write a novel of such unremitting, relentless brutality?<br />Well, I finally found it.  Charlee Jacob has written such a viscerally disturbing book in Haunter that even I had to put it down a few times simply because what was going on was so disgusting. And that, folks, takes some nasty material to achieve.<br />Haunter is a sequel of sorts to Jacob's first novel, This Symbiotic Fascination. Where that novel dealt with the depredations of baby brother Arcan Tyler, in Haunter Jacob focuses on the two big brothers, Vietnam vets Harry and Elliot Tyler. Elliot, after the war, joined a ragtag band of mercenaries led by the brutally perverse Saab Gestetner; Harry, after a quick trip home (related in This Symbiotic Fascination), simply vanished into the jungle, never to be seen again. Or so everyone thinks.<br />There's a new drug on the Cambodian streets called Soma. One dose will do you. After you take it, you spend a while in screaming hysterics, seeing the very bowels of hell. But after that, you become a being of radiant happiness, one whose contentment literally shines. And you stay that way for the rest of your natural life. The only problem is, it's really annoying the rest of Cambodia's drug lords. So, armed with only a supplier's name, the biggest of them hires Gestetner and his mercs to find the source of the Soma and either appropriate it or stamp it out. They find, however, a lot more than just a drug operation...<br />A plot (however thin) and really nasty-sounding events are not, however, enough to make a book a good novel. What really causes Haunter to rise above the masses is Jacob's use of the Cambodian landscape and the Hindu mythology in which it is steeped to address (and inventively answer) all those existential questions literature is \\"supposed\\" to address. You know, why are we here, what are we doing, etc. Between that and Jacob's willingness to spend time building her characters (in order, mostly, just to make you feel that little bit worse when the inevitable other shoe drops), this book comes out a winner. Better than This Symbiotic Fascination, but if you want to get more of a grip on Harry Tyler, you'll want to read that one first anyway. ****really causes Haunter to rise above the masses is Jacob's use of the Cambodian landscape and the Hindu mythology in which it is steeped to address (and inventively answer) all those existential questions literature is \\"supposed\\" to address.

Susan Corrigan (ed.), Typical Girls: New Stories by Smart Women (St. Martin's, 1997)<br />Here we have all the hard evidence we need that no matter how smart people may be, that doesn't mean they can write good stories.<br />I picked this one up because it contained a story by Poppy Z. Brite. (It's \\"Saved,\\" her collaboration with Christa Faust, which you can also find in the infinitely superior collection Are You Loathsome Tonight?.) That one is, of course, excellent. A few of the others in here are also worth your time. The rest of them are either harping on the same subjects you expect or simply quite badly written. In other words, every story here is loaded with potential, and most of them don't realize it. The collection's better authors are too stuck in their one-trick pony mode to turn out a decent story, the bad authors have fantastic ideas and don't have the wherewithal to realize them. (One almost thinks this should have been a book of collaborations a la Brite and Faust; when retread ideas meet bad writing, though,  as in the case of Amy Lame's story, one wonders why it wasn't left on the cutting room floor.)<br />Pick it up for the Brite story if you're unfamiliar with her stuff and want to see if she's the kind of author you enjoy.

Robin Hardy and Anthony Sheffer, The Wicker Man (Crown, 1978)<br />The emergence of a rabid cult following for the film version of The Wicker Man prompted the publication of the novel on which it was based. And a good thing, too. As fine as the film is, the book has its own special charm.<br />If you've been living in a cave the past thirty years, the plot of The Wicker Man goes as follows: Neil Howie, a Scots police Sergeant and fine upstanding Christian fellow, receives an anonymous letter saying that a girl has gone missing on Summerisle, a small island only barely under Scot protection, thirty-eight miles west of the last of the Outer Hebrides. Howie goes out to investigate, and finds that, while all the inhabitants of the island are seemingly quite forthcoming with what they know (save the none of them acknowledge the missing girl so much as exists), Howie is torn between his desire to see the case through and his offense at the various heathen goings-on on the decidedly non-Christian island.<br />The movie does an absolutely lovely job in detailing the various conflicting emotions of Neil Howie throughout, and in this it lies faithfully close to the book. Where the book does the movie one better is in the expanded opening (even the opening to the 104-minute version of the film, rarely seen, leaves quite a bit unanswered about the whole mess) and allowing us to get inside Howie's head for a few of the harder-to-understand decisions he makes over the course of his time on Summerisle. The downside of it all is that the same strengths one can get from a book opens up its weaknesses, and while The Wicker Man does handle sudden emotional changes with a more deft hand than most novels of its ilk, there are still some embarrassingly jarring ones (from offense to affability in an instant  simply isn't convincing, no matter how you dress it up it still looks like an ogre). Still, it's obvious Hardy spent a lot of time thinking and plotting this one out before coming up with a final draft, and what finally got released is a pleasure. This is not at all easy to find these days, but whether you've seen the film or not, this is definitely one to pick up. **** ½with a final draft, and what finally got released is a pleasure.

Ryu Murakami, 69 (Kodansha, 1987)<br /><br />Murakami (no relation to Wind-Up Bird author Haruki Murakami, by the way) is (or bloody well should be) best known in the west for writing the novel upon which Takashi Miike's most astounding film, Audition, is based. (It has recently been translated into English. Miike fans, rejoice.) He first came to the attention of the horror underground, though, with a book called Coin Locker Babies, which, as it turns out, is very difficult to find these days. In fact, I put in a request for it at the library and instead ended up with this odd, fun, rather beguiling little novel instead. (Coin Locker Babies is still, it seems, missing in action. I put in another request for it. We'll see what happens.)<br /><br />Obviously autobiographical in nature (set in the town where Murakami was born, with a protagonist the same age he was at the time, etc.), but one wonders if any writer this side of Fannie Flagg is capable of writing himself with such a jaundiced eye. Ken Yazaki is seventeen in 1969, utterly bored with school (and horrified at the idea of going on to med school, which he has been studying for), grabbing every attempt he can to latch himself into the American-inspired underground culture, and the most unreliable narrator this side of the guy sitting next to you at the lunch counter telling you about the five-foot bass that got away. In order to facilitate getting laid, he and his best friend, Iwase, decide they want to put on an avant-garde festival (Americans old enough to remember the sixties, think \\"happening\\" here); music, film, drama, art, poetry, you name it. To this end, Ken ropes in a serious, diplomatic chap named Adama, and the three of them set out to start making music, film, drama, etc. Along the way, they get caught up in the protest of the Vietnam War, leading to an idea to blockade the school.<br /><br />Most of the time, you just end up shaking your head and wondering what is going through this kid's mind. But as the novel progresses (and this could be used as a textbook for the writing 101 tenet that in order for a book to work, the lead character must change in some way), we get more insight into what's going on in Ken's head. Whether that's because he's discovering it himself or just more willing to reveal his thoughts is left to the reader to decide. As we get more insight into Ken, the book becomes better, so the first few chapters may drag some. Stick with it, this is fun stuff. The plot is just scatterbrained enough to work (and to his credit, once Murakami gets Ken onto one track, he does tend to hold it to its logical conclusion), the characters are engaging, and the book ends up being a lot of fun.

Ann Louise Gittleman, The Fat Flush Plan (McGraw-Hill, 2002)<br />We were doing so well there for a while. Yeah, the book gets a little heavy on the new-age diction (things \\"resonate to\\" ideas way too many times in this book), and the constant talking about the necessity for eating organic food (with a helpful recipe in the back for soaking your foods in bleach-water if you can't buy organic) was a bit unnerving, but everything else seemed to be on pretty solid ground. But then came the word that has become the yardstick for measuring the scientific objectivity of every nutritionist on the planet: aspartame. And Ann Louise Gittleman, as so many have before her, utterly fails the test.<br />In short, the so-called \\"dangers\\" of aspartame have been so overblown by the press and a few wild-eyed (and very large-mouthed) activists that it has now been blamed for everything from MSG-like headaches to Multiple Sclerosis. (Odd that the MS Foundation's denial that the claim holds any sort of truth whatsoever got nowhere near as much press coverage.) What reports and studies is your nutritionist reading? Easy way to find out: ask them about aspartame. If they start getting fluttery around the eyelids, switch your nutritionist, quick.<br />Gittleman here attempts to softpedal the anti-aspartame mania the first couple of times it appears by focusing on sweeteners approved for the plan or saying that her bias against the stuff is caused by its water-retaining properties. But keep reading. Once you get to the last fifty pages or so, you'll stumble upon a turn of phrase here, a word there, that strongly implies Gittleman has it in for aspartame for a lot more than that. Which draws the whole scientific basis of the book into question. (There are a few other shady bits, but the aspartame question is the easiest to determine, so I'll stick with it.)<br />Ultimately, another diet book with a few good, logical ideas that can be found in a number of other places, some really awful overdramatization, and a lot of questionable stuff between the two poles. **rdramatization, and a lot of questionable stuff between the two poles. **	2004-03-17

Charles Simic, Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk (Braziller, 1974)<br />It seems quite silly, in a time where poetry is such a neglected art, to say that an author \\"burst on the scene\\" pretty much at any time. But Return to a Place... was Simic's literary bursting, after a few chapbooks on small presses. This was the nation at large's first look at the man who, sixteen years later, would be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (for The World Doesn't End); even this far back in his career, it's easy to see why.<br />Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk is, as its title would suggest, a fountain of surrealist beauty. Simic, however, has more control with his work than most of the surrealists/dadas were able to achieve, lending his material a leaner, sparer power than one normally finds in surrealist work:<br />\\"Green Buddhas<br />on the fruit stand.<br />We eat the smile<br />and spit out the teeth.\\"<br />(\\"Watermelons\\")<br />All the slanted imagery, but with enough meaning close to the surface to be understandable.

Nan Mooney, My Racing Heart (Harper, 2002)<br />Nan Mooney loves horses. Specifically, Thoroughbreds, the ones who hit the track, dust it up with six to twelve of their closest friends, and make humans gape in awe at the process. This odd amalgam of personal-memoir-cum-treatise-on-track-life is not an unfamiliar breed to the horse fan; the measuring stick against which all such books are brought is Bill Barich's stunning Laughing in the Hills. I'm sure one day, another book that good in that genre will arrive. While My Racing Heart has its good points, to be simple about it, this ain't it.<br />Where Barich succeeds as so many others (Michael Klein, Mooney, Liz Mitchell, and many others) fail is in his ability to take two different things that have inherently different paces and make them merge together into one book whose readability is consistent across chapters on differing subjects (in Barich's case, handicapping the races at Golden Gate while dealing with his mother's cancer). He meshes the two in such a way that, despite being parallel narratives happening a country apart from one another, the whole thing flows. Seamless, like an egg, as Stephen King once said. In Mooney's case the two main threads are a basic nuts-and-bolts look at the Thoroughbred industry from someone with enough clout to get inside the lines but not enough cynicism to keep pumping out the same old platitudes and a memoir about her grandmother, who introduced her to horse racing at an age tender enough that I suspect her parents weren't very happy. Either of these two things on their own would have stood as a book in itself; the slow, meandering passages about her grandmother and how the two of them interacted and the snappy, sometimes sarcastic looks at track life. It is when the two are entwined with one another that things break down to the extent they do, with the reader finding himself transported with no warning from the high of making friends with a Kentucky Derby contender to a lazy meditation on what life must have been like in the early twenties in Alaska.<br />Not to say it isn't worth reading; that's not it at all.

Hayden Carruth, The Bloomingdale Papers (University of Georgia, 1975)<br />Excerpts from this work are the centerpiece of Carruth's Collected Shorter Poems 1946-1991, and rightly so; they are amazing pieces of work with a chilling sense of utter despair. Ever since first reading them thirteen years ago, I have been hunting for a copy of the full text. I finally found it.<br />The Bloomingdale Papers is a writing-as-therapy (assigned to him by the doctors) depiction of two months of Carruth's stay in a mental facility, after a nervous breakdown aided and abetted by incipient alcoholism. (This is back when the word alcoholism still had its original definition.) He was unresponsive to regular treatment, so the doctors, noting that he was a writer, told him to write things, so that they could get more of a handle on where his head was. (Carruth notes sardonically in the apologia preceding the poems that they didn't help one bit.) Rereading the manuscript prior to publication over twenty years later, Carruth despised it, in the main. He very rightly points out the effects that mental treatments (both shock therapy and drugs) have on the creative mind, and depicts the effort taken into getting each word on paper while in such a state. Unfortunately, in much of the collection that didn't make it into Collected Shorter, it shows. A good portion of this book is best described as workmanlike, almost devoid of emotion, with stultifying rhyme without any attempt at enjambment whatsoever; it's mindful of high school teen angst poetry, though Carruth has a far better eye for detail than most poets (and it is in evidence throughout this collection, which, had it been published at the time, would have been his first book).<br />Those pieces that work, however, are pure magic. The best portions of The Bloomingdale Papers are looks into the genesis of, arguably, the finest American poet of the twentieth century. They are worth the price of admission on their own (and with this book out of print so long that price is likely to be rather hefty). The argument against spending thirteen years of your life seeking it out is that much of the best stuff was taken for Collected Shorter, which should still be readily available. *** ½ut of print so long that price is likely to be rather hefty).

At times loving and ominous, sweet and sassy, laugh-out-loud funny and painfully depressed, The Colossus of New York is much like New York itself. There are eight million stories in the naked city, Whitehead wryly quotes, and one would think from reading this that every one of them is feeling a completely different emotion from any of the others at any given moment, and that it's all a constantly swirling chaotic mass. Amen.<br />Perhaps the most interesting thing about the book is how Whitehead manages to take this odd, impressionist look at New York and map it onto you, the reader. You're liable to find at least one or two snatches of sentence per page you can identify with, even if you've never set foot within an hundred miles of the place. Thus, even if you care nothing about New York, it's probable he's going to keep you interested in its goings-on. A beautiful thing, that. But the draw of the book, and its continuing majesty throughout, is Whitehead's ability with language. His diction takes us from the language poetry of Charles Olson to the Nuyorican-style street rap that passes for poetry among slammers, but with Whitehead the language never loses its poetic drive. All of it, even the ugliness, is beautiful.<br />And above all, The Colossus of New York is a love song, the kind that one would write to one's spouse after seventy years of marriage if one could find a way to include all one's spouse's faults and still make it beautiful. This is a powerful little book, and highly deserving of the widest possible audience. A shoo-in for the top ten list this year. **** ½autiful.<br />And above all, The Colossus of New York is a love song, the kind that one would write to one's spouse after seventy years of marriage if one could find a way to include all one's spouse's faults and still make it beautiful.

Charles Simic, Nine Poems (Exact Change Press, 1989)<br />Despite the great disparity in the look of any given book by Exact Change, you can usually tell it's an Exact Change book. Few other micropresses are as consistent in the quality of their output, both from the standpoint of the work inside and the construction outside, as is Exact Change. Nine Poems is no exception, published as a huge orange chapbook, one poem to a page. And this is good Simic, right here; the nine poems involved are all reflections on childhood done in the inimitable Simic style that mixes traces of surrealism, dada, sentimentalism, wry humor, and various other things in small quantities to produce the gems that flow regularly from Mr. Simic's pen.<br />Long out of print now, I am sure.

Brite, Plastic Jesus (Subterranean Press, 2000)<br />I tried not to be negatively influenced when reading Plastic Jesus by the fact that it is, essentially, a piece of fan fiction about one of the most ridiculously hyped, and the single most overrated, band in music history. Unfortunately, I don't think I succeeded.<br />Plastic Jesus is the story of the two founding members of a sixties rock sensation called the Kydds. (Oh, let's drop it. It's John and Paul. I mean, even the illustrations are... you know.) The book jacket gives away the whole thing, but I'll just sketch here; the story opens with one of them being shot dead in New York in 1980. (Guess which?) It then goes back and traces the genesis of the band to that point, while attempting to explain why he got shot. The fictional part of it is that, pursuant to Brite's usual obsessions, he's shot because of homophobia, because the two of them are gay.<br />Well, little surprise there. And when I can divorce myself from the subject matter, it's workable, if workmanlike, Brite; quick, easy reading, pages turning at a decent pace. The characters are believable (though one tends to suspect that's because they're based on real people here, rather than any native authorial skill), the plot plausible. The theme less so, but then, this is a work of fantasy, so we'll allow a little leeway. On this level, at least.<br />And this is where it breaks down. The line between professional work and fan fiction is usually more a chasm than a line, but sometimes it gets blurry. Plastic Jesus is very much one of those times. While it's quite obviously the work of Poppy Z. Brite (and thus as polished and professional as anything she puts out), it still treads uncomfortably close to the slash line too many times.(Again, I cause myself to wonder if I'd have had this problem were it, say, X-Files fan fiction or John Lee Hooker fan fiction or... you get the idea.)<br />The bottom line is it's readable. Whether you will find its subject matter to your taste is likely a matter of personal choice. I can't stand the Beatles, never could, and that negatively affected my ability to read this. Your mileage, as they say, may vary. ***s subject matter to your taste is likely a matter of personal choice.

Stephen Davis, C# Weekend Crash Course (Hungry Minds Press, 2002)<br />A while back on one of the mailing lists to which I am subscribed, a chap popped up asking about books that cover programming console applications (you know, those things that when you run them, pop up in a command line box instead of running within Windows) in depth. My first reaction was \\"who on earth would want such a thing?\\" I still don't really know the answer to that, but if he's reading this, I recommend this book highly to him. Davis' whole book is devoted to console apps and DLLs.<br />And therein lies its major fault. In a programming world where, let's face it, the GUI has won the day (be it Windows, Xwindows, BeOS, Apple, what have you), a book that doesn't even mention the existence of programming graphical forms is painfully outdated, no matter how recently it was released. (The other C# book I'm reading right now was published the year previously, before Microsoft had even finished the C# visual form designer, and still manages to devote a chapter to Windows forms in C#!) The omission is unforgivable in a book on program design in the twenty-first century, even more so when the books covers Microsoft's .NET technology.<br />As for the program design itself, there's a decent amount to be learned here if you're trying to pick up C# after knowing another programming language. (As a longtime C++ programmer, I have no idea how total newbies will react; proceed at your own risk.) A few of the sections try to cram far too much into one thirty-minute session, especially towards the end (the Collections session is almost unreadable without a concordance of some sort; thankfully, I happened to be at the same portion of A Programmer's Guide to C# at the time, and it helped me figure things out without too much pain).<br />Probably worthwhile as an adjunct, but I can't see it being a primary reference guide for any serious programmer. ** ½	2004-03-08

Charles Simic, The World Doesn't End: Prose Poems (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1990)<br />Charles Simic won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for The World Doesn't End, and it is blessedly easy to see why. This collection (which, despite its subtitle, is mostly prose poems, with a few \\"regular\\" poems thrown in for good measure) could easily be a primer for the aspiring poet on exactly how to write a prose poem. (Would that more who attempt it had read this!) In the days when prose poetry has fallen so far from the poetic tree that a new subgenre, \\"flash fiction,\\" had to be invented for the mass of the unpoetic claptrap, Simic gives us a book full of wonderful tall tales, flights of fancy, and utterly poetic language, all without ever once straying from the idea that what he is writing in these small pieces is, in fact, poetry.<br />\\"The dog went to dancing school. The dog's owner sniffed vials of Viennese air. One day the two heard the new Master of the Universe pass their door with a heavy step. After that, the man exchanged clothes with his dog. It was a dog on two legs, wearing a tuxedo, that they led to the edge of the common grave. As for the man, blind and deaf as he came to be, he still wags his tail at the approach of a stranger.\\" --untitled (p. 40)<br />The World Doesn't End caused me to re-evaluate my ideas on what poetry is. Perhaps it is not, as Eliot would have it, language elevated; perhaps, instead, it is language as it should be. The standard as opposed to the elevation, the diction we should be striving for in our daily lives.<br />The finest book of poetry to cross my desk since Reznikoff's classic By the Waters of Manhattan half a decade ago. Must reading for poetry fans, and engaging stuff in prose form for those who don't do poetry. Just think of it as the best flash fiction ever written. In any case, whatever you have to do to convince yourself to do so, read this book. *****	2004-03-08

John Hollander, Town and Country Matters: Erotica and Satirica (David R. Godine, 1972)<br />John Hollander, long one of the foremost modern metrical poets, also has a wicked (and rather juvenile) sense of humor. That can best be seen in Town and Country Matters, a book put out in a small (5,000) edition by Godine in 1972. It collects a number of pieces of Hollander's erotic work, including his celebrated translations of Catullus, and one long piece of satire called \\"New York\\" (originally published in Harper's back when Harper's published long poems). Attractively printed in an oversized hardback, with erotic illustrations by Hollander's wife Anne, Hollander's book is exactly the kind of thing you'd want on display on your coffee table when your more hip guests show up.<br />The stuff inside is pretty fine, too. For metrical poetry, it reads like free verse in many places. The best rhymed poem is the one you can't tell is rhymed until you're halfway through.(He manages to make this work even in the Catullus translations.)<br />The one slipping point is \\"New York,\\" which seems almost as if it were an attempt at an epic a la Tennyson or Browning. And from that perspective, it succeeds rather well; Hollander uses the lyric scope of the rhymed poem in a narrative style, telling the story (complete with soliloquies) of two friends who bump into one another while one is moving back to New York after fifteen years in exile and the other is leaving the city for good. The problem with it (as with much of Tennyson) is that the specific scenes go on too long; rhymed poetry often seems to rob the writer of any sense of timing at all, something in which Hollander shows in the shorter pieces he he is quite gifted, normally.<br />All in all, though, a fun little piece of work. Deadly hard to find these days thanks to the scarceness of the printing, but much joy is to be found within its pages.*** ½	2004-03-08

Mark Haddon, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (Doubleday, 2002)<br />It is quite likely that no one who reads The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is going to forget Christopher Boone soon after they put the novel down. Christopher Boone, an autistic (so the blurb from Oliver Sacks on the back tells us; all Christopher lets on is that he goes to a special school with \\"stupid kids\\") teenager, goes across the street one morning to find the neighbor's dog, Wellington, has been killed with a garden fork. He immediately becomes the prime suspect in the murder, as he's caught with body in hand, and figures it is in his best interests to find out who the real killer is. Finding this out uncovers a number of other mysteries, gives us remarkable insight into math and physics, and lets us get to know one of the more engaging narrators in recent fiction.<br />What makes Curious Incident work as well as it does is Christopher. \\"Quirky\\" is an understatement, but then that's to be expected when one is dealing with the mentally challenged. He is incessantly logical at times (the only student from his school to ever sit the maths A-level, as he plans to throughout the book), but incapable of mapping that logic onto many other areas of his life. He gets obsessed with some things and forgets others for hours on end; draws conclusions on certain parts of the investigation at a whim while digs into layer after layer of others.<br />In general, with the exception of the screaming and moaning fits, he's rather a lot like the rest of us. Add in a cracking mystery, and you've got a fun novel. Don't let its being picked by the Today Show for their book club fool you, this one will please reading snobs and the great unwashed alike. ****	2004-03-08

Charles Simic, White (New Rivers Press, 1972)<br />I have quite quickly become convinced that Charles Simic's books belong on the same short shelf that holds Carruth, Sadoff, Robert Lowell, and a few other American poets. Seems like everything I pick up by the guy is wonderful. This early piece (a collection? A long poem? Can't tell) continues the trend.<br />It's either a collection of short, untitled pieces (which the acknowledgments section would seem to indicate) or a longer work called \\"White\\" with a postscript. Either way, it's classic Simic and well worth the trouble it will take to hunt down. It's more classically surreal than his later works, but with the same tone of understated wit, the same veneration of the odd ins-and-outs of quirky beauty, the same engaging, and distinct, diction.<br />If you're not yet familiar with the work of Charles Simic, the only reason not to start with this one is that it will take you way too long to find, probably. If you're already an established fan, or stumble across a copy in your local library, by all means give it a read. ****	2004-03-01

Matthew Barney, Cremaster 3 (The Guggenheim Museum, 2003)<br />Matthew Barney's oft-celebrated and yet little-seen Cremaster series of films was finally completed with the release of Cremaster 3 in 2002. As a celebration, the Guggenheim mounted a showing of stills from the five films in early 2003. This is the book printed as a companion to the showing. As should be expected from both Barney and the Guggenheim, it's a sumptuous release.<br />The vast majority of the book is nothing but photographs, though a few pieces of text flit in and out. The movies have an almost dadaesque sense of both being rooted in a place and being dislocated; the book, too, bears that same mark. You know, for example, you're looking at a closeup of a Chrysler hood ornament. But why? And what's that in the reflection, so very distorted? What's Barney's fascination with the Chrysler Building, anyway? Why is Aimee Mullins even more gorgeous when made up to look like a leopard?<br />Of course, none of these questions actually get answered. But the films, and this book, are about visual experience anyway, unless you want to spend hundreds of hours dissecting the intricate layers of symbolism with which every second of the films are invested. In which case, go to it, and let us know what you find; for most folks, I think the simple beauty of the images will be enough. Either way, it's certainly worth a look. ****	2004-03-01

Corridor is a book that is full of good poems, but the language here reflects an artist more set in his ways, for lack of a better way if putting it; there's less of the striking off into dangerous territory, less to make the reader work, less that will stop the reader and make him go back over the last few lines.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is still good stuff. But if you can, go back a few years and pick up Aaron's first book, Second Sight, instead. Read this one afterwards. ***	2004-03-01

Dan Brown, The DaVinci Code (Dubleday, 2003)<br />Dennis Lehane, Shutter Island (Morrow, 2003)<br />William M. Valtos, The Authenticator (Hampton Roads, 2000)<br />Rarely, when I read, do three books come together so very well for one review. But such is the case here with The DaVinci Code, The Authenticator, and Shutter Island.<br />Imagine, if you will, a kind of number line of style, with the very best writers at the rightmost extreme and the very worst at the left. On the right are those authors who pay great attention to detail, and while they may miss a continuity trick or two, they always have it together. Their prose is readable, though it may be difficult, but it is always impeccable from a grammatical standpoint. (We'll allow a number of spelling errors for editorial mishaps.) Their characters are always well-drawn, the plot when it exists is interesting, the theme never takes over the storyline and slaps you in the face. William Faulkner and Wendy Walker reside on the right end of the line. So does Kathe Koja. Margaret Laurence roved around, but fell close to it all the time, and hit it with The Diviners. Charles Reznikoff OWNED the right side of the line.<br />On the left you have sloppy writing, loose ends, lectures in the middles of books, rampant grammatical errors and conscious misspellings (and, usually, a vehement defense of them), plots that disappear and reappear, glacial pacing, and all the rest of the things that make books unreadable mounds of tripe. So as not to step on any toes I'll let you fill in your own list here; I'm sure any reader has happened upon enough of these writers to fill at least a branch library.<br />Now imagine it has a moving axis. Above the line are those authors who, simply, do their research. Below it are those who either don't research at all or do just enough research to give truth to the phrase \\"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\\" Every author can be plotted on the resulting two-dimensional graph.<br />Dennis Lehane sits somewhere in the right center. There's nothing necessarily factual about anything he writes in Shutter Island, save a seamless fifties-era feel and the geographic locations of certain islands off the coast of Massachusetts. Everything else springs fully-formed from the man's demented mind. And it is a true tribute to any author, I think, to be able to say 'this book was predictable, but I kept reading anyway.\\" Yea, I had the plot twist figured out in the first hundred pages. But Dennis Lehane is such a wonderfully readable author that I couldn't have cared less whether I knew what was happening or not. (Warning, any fan of horror will probably get the ending as soon as, or sooner than, I did.) Lehane flirted with his plot twist, in fact it's rather odd that a person who normally writes mystery novels was so blatant with the clues to what was happening; the characters might as well have come out and said it a few times. Which leads me, of course, to the belief that it was all a conscious act. He was letting the reader in on the big joke, too. It's a beautiful thought.<br />U. S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are on their way to the mental facility at Shutter Island in order to solve the classic locked-room mystery. A patient, Rachel Solando, has gone missing through a locked door and four manned checkpoints without a trace. Confounding the problem is Teddy's constant idea that folks aren't being completely forthcoming when he questions them.<br />This is, quite simply, great noir. And in the tradition of great noir, you know there's going to be a denouement; no one, as it were, gets out of here alive. (No, that's not a spoiler, it's a figure of speech.) And if you've read any horror novels influenced by noir writers like Chandler and Thompson, you know just where this is going. Perhaps it's that safety that allows the reader to keep going, just as romance readers expect the guy to get the girl in the end. The main part of it, though, is Dennis Lehane's wonderful writing style, pure and simple. The man could keep the pages of the phone book turning.<br />...(continued in the review of The Authenticator)s wonderful writing style, pure and simple.

(Continued from the Authenticator review)<br />Where does The DaVinci code fall into all this? In the middle, sort of. Dan Brown falls right into the conjunction of the axes; his writing is readable, though not engaging or compelling enough to make me stay up late reading it (as did Lehane's); his research is decent, if not thorough. Normally, the latter wouldn't be a problem, but in this case Brown seems to have overlooked a few pieces of scholarship that undermine his whole novel (for example, about the nature and location of the holy grail, neither of which has been much of a secret for seven hundred years; it's just that no one thought to look in Ethiopia).<br />Still, if you can overlook the factual problems and take it as a straight novel, it's good enough for government work. Robert Langdon (the hero of Angels and Demons) returns, this time summoned in the middle of the night to the Louvre, whose director has been murdered. Thanks to cryptologist Sophie Neveau, Langdon learns he's the prime suspect of the French police, and if they're going to find the real killer, they need to get out of there fast. The resulting chase, taking place over the next twelve hours, give or take, ropes in secret societies, cloudy family trees, assassin monks, the Catholic church, and, of course, the supposed grail mystery.<br />Here, unlike the previous two books [ed. note: in this review, not Brown's two previous books], we have an unpredictable mystery; Brown throws us more than enough curveballs to keep us entertained (though the final whodunit does end up being a little predictable, thanks to Brown's dearth of red-herring characters). And yet, still, Brown's writing style isn't nearly as engaging as Lehane's. It's good, but it's not keep-you-up-at-night good. You will, of course, read it to find out what all the flap is about.

(Continued from the Shutter Island review)<br />...Contrast this to William M. Valtos' second novel, The Authenticator. Valtos falls to the left on the horizontal line, somewhat above on the vertical. He's done his research, but he doesn't show it very well. Each short chapter of this book feels more like a newspaper article, and each one has a summation of what's come before at the end. Valtos doesn't want to leave us anything to puzzle out on its own, and that is the book's main weakness.<br />Our premise here is that Theo Nikonos, a near-death experience investigator, and Laura Duquesne, a near-death experiencer, find themselves in very hot water. Nikonos knows of Duquesne's case, but as the story opens, he's having a very hard time getting in to see her. When he finally does, he gets in a quick interview before a couple of burly hospital guards throw him out with extreme prejudice. During the interview, she's appealed for help, saying they're keeping her in the hospital against her will. He can't resist a beautiful woman, and so the two of them are very quickly on the run, with Laura trying to find her supposedly dead husband and Theo in love with Laura.<br />While there is one major twist in this novel that comes out of the blue, the rest of it is just as predictable as is Shutter Island. The parallel is reinforced by the frame technique of having someone present this as memoirs (Dr. Charles Sheehan from the medical facility in Shutter Island, Nikonos in The Authenticator), with a letter to the reader as a preface. Examining the two letters will give the reader a number of clues as to why it is Lehane simply writes a better book than does Valtos; Lehane's language is more engaging. He's interested in hooking the reader and keeping him hooked. Valtos, on the other hand, knows a lot about a lot, and wants to make sure the reader knows it; there's no room for interpretation amidst the mini-lectures and spelling out of every salient point. The Authenticator does pick up in its last hundred pages, and is a readable book, but you'd be far better off with Shutter Island.<br />...(Continued in the Da Vinci Code review)ick up in its last hundred pages, and is a readable book, but you'd be far better off with Shutter Island.<br />...(Continued in the Da Vinci Code review)	2004-03-01

Joyce Carol Oates, Women Whose Lives Are Food, Men Whose Lives Are Money (Louisiana State U Press, 1978)<br />Joyce Carol Oates, well known for her novels (Monster, Blonde, We Were the Mulvaneys, etc.) and essays (On Boxing, The Edge of Impossibility, etc.), is also a noted poet whose work appears with regularity in some of North America's finest journals of poetry. Women Whose Lives Are Food... was her fifth collection.<br />It's not much of a stretch to say that Oates is drawn to darkness; the one thread that runs consistently throughout her work is an impending sense of doom. The reader is always waiting for the drop of the other shoe. As with the longer works, so with the poetry. And from that standpoint, Women Whose Lives Are Food... delivers on all counts. The book's sole problem, and it is unfortunately a large one, is that Oates at times abandons the tale-telling that is her strength and ventures off into the usually-unforgivable and always-second class world of the message poem. The simple fact is that politics and poetry don't mix, no matter how many people try it; good political poetry is the very rare exception, not the rule. The end result is a readable, but inconsistent, book; when Oates is firing on all cylinders, her stuff is as fine as one would expect from one of America's foremost authors.<br />\\"All night the flesh of trees cracks<br />and in the morning the eye can gauge no distance,<br />the ear is deafened in white.<br />A world of glass!--many-winged glare of ice.\\"<br />(\\"Ice Age\\")<br />While such moments are comparatively few, there's more of them here than one would expect from the random book of poetry, and they're frequent enough to make the book worth searching out, especially for the author's fans. ***	2004-02-18

Things seem just a tad odd in Mumblesby...<br />As usual, Colin Watson gives a decent mystery with a jaundiced eye towards the upstairs-downstairs aspect of drawing room comedy. There are a few unpredictable turns, and the pace is good enough to keep the pages turning.<br />This is my fourth Flaxborough novel, and it finally occurred to me while reading this one what the failing of Watson's novels is; his characters are eminently forgettable. They're drawn well-enough not to be caricatures, but after finishing one Watson novel, there's nothing about Purbright, his sidekick Love, antique dealer/spinster Miss Teatime, et al. to keep them in mind until I pick up the next Flaxborough novel that comes across my path (which doesn't happen often, as they've been out of print for some time). Still, if you're looking for a fast, easy read and a cozy mystery, Watson can be just the ticket. ***	2004-02-18

Joyce Carol Oates, The Time Traveler (Dutton, 1990)<br />As I've said, the defining feature of a work by Joyce Carol Oates (if there is a single defining feature) is its darkness, its relentless feeling of ominousness. Imagine my surprise, then, to come across the second section of The Time Traveler, which consists partially of ekphrastic poetry (poetry inspired by paintings or other works of art in a different medium) and partially of nature poems. It shook my foundations, not only because it's such a different style for Oates to be working in, but because the quality of the work is so high; one almost wonders, if this stuff is so good, what a piece of chick lit, or other unrelenting fluff, by Oates would read like.<br />The other three sections of the book are what one would expect from Oates, and subject to all the same picks and pans from my review of Women Whose Lives Are Food... (except that she stays away from the political more here; more gems, less naked political whining), but this second section is a whole other ballgame, and well worth the price of admission on its own. When Oates does the nature poetry thing, her work deserves comparison to that great yardstick of twentieth-century American nature poetry, Hayden Carruth, and it stands up well.<br />\\"Morning?--opaque<br />and dream-muddled.<br />And outside our windows<br />the snow is madly churned<br />as if by heraldic beasts--<br />not seven or eight starving deer,<br />all does.\\"<br />(\\"New Jersey White-Tailed Deer\\")<br />Absolutely lovely. It's stuff like this that makes reading poetry a pleasure. Would that there were more of it in the world. ****	2004-02-18

George Saunders, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip (Villard, 2000)<br />Saunders (Pastoralia) and illustrator Lane Smith (The Stinky Cheese Man, James and the Giant Peach) team up to deliver this cautionary tale about helping your neighbors out of a jam. And while the story wears its moral far too plain on its face, the story itself, and the wonderfully twisted illustrations that accompany it, make it worth a read.<br />Capable and her father live in the very small town of Frip. It's so small, in fact, it only has three houses. Frip's whole economy is based on goat's milk. Which is all well and good, except for these odd little amphibians called gappers, who love goats, and shriek with joy when they see a goat. The shrieking makes the goats nervous, and causes them to stop giving milk. So life in Frip is a constant battle of keeping the gappers away from the goats.<br />Things get nasty when the gappers realize that Capable's house is the closest to the sea, and so they should all lavish their affections on Capable's herd. Which makes her neighbors very happy, since their goats are no longer plagued. They refuse to help her with her gappers, and thus the conflict at the center of the book is born.<br />This is exceptionally fun stuff. Perhaps having the Lane Smith illustrations put me more in mind of the late Roald Dahl than I otherwise would have been, but there is certainly a Dahl-esque feeling to Saunders' writing. Dahl was usually better at concealing his morals within the context of his stories (overly-moralizing oompah-loompahs excepted, of course), and so I have a hard time ranking Saunders with the best of Dahl's work. But it is a fine thing, and quite worth your time. ***	2004-02-17

Reed Arvin, The Last Goodbye (Harper, 2004)<br />Before you read the rest of this review, do yourself a favor. Go to Amazon (if you're not reading it there) and put this book on pre-order. Then come back and finish.<br />Done? Okay.<br />The Last Goodbye is Reed Arvin's second novel, so I can't call it the most stunning debut I've read in the last two years (and I've read a bunch of them). And, to be fair, it does have a few minor faults here and there. But it's still better than most any thriller you've read in the last twelve months.<br />The story of Jack Hammond is so full of plot twists and turns that even explaining the first twenty pages would cause spoileritis (in other words, don't read any reviews but this one, or you'll lose the effect of the end of chapter one). Suffice to say that Jack Hammond is a lawyer whose buddy ends up dead. He wants to find out why. \\"Why\\" involves an internationally famous opera singer, a clinical trial of a new hepatitis-C drug, one of the most powerful lawyers in Atlanta, the main drug runner in Atlanta's biggest section of projects, computer hackers, and a whole cast of various freaks, outcasts, degenerates, and other generally fun human beings.<br />What kept going through my mind as I was reading this was that this was the return of the hard-boiled detective novel. Let's face it, the hard-boiled detective has gotten kind of, well, cuddly over the last thirty years. And as wonderful as Spenser is, we have to blame him for this. I mean, the guy cooks shrimp scampi in his spare time, when he's not getting beaten by thugs. Jack Hammond is no Spenser. He has more in common with Mike Hammer (and while that may not sound like a compliment, it is). The shysters talk fast, the dames are beautiful, the mugs get beat, the bullets fly, the mystery is solved only to find two more mysteries beneath. But layered over all that is the one thing it's impossible to write a book about Atlanta in the twenty-first century without addressing: race. So in actuality, The Last Goodbye is what might have happened if the new, improved hardboiled detective had taken a left at Robert Parker instead of a right.<br />The conclusion is obvious. And while two novels into a career is not a time to stand up and proclaim Reed Arvin as the next Robert Parker, or even the next Spillane, he's got the goods, he's got the mindset, he's got the potential. Read this book. ****.

Jim Harrison, The Shape of the Journey: New and Collected Poems (Copper Canyon, 1998)<br />Jim Harrison is a good poet. He's been below the radar for many, many years, writing poems about nature and drinking and general irascibility that few people have actually read. Which is a shame, because when he's really on his game, his work is comparable to that of the best nature poets working today (Hayden Carruth being the obvious parallel here). And more often than not, he is on his game in this book.<br />Its major flaw is not the quality of the work therein, but the quantity. Even Bukowski, the most readable poet on the planet in the twentieth century, knew that stopping at about three hundred fifty pages of work was a good idea. Harrison's doughty tome weighs in at over four hundred fifty, and his stuff is not nearly as readable as Bukowski's. Nor is it as short. Even Carruth, whose Collected Shorter Poems 1946-1991 (also released by Copper Canyon) is one of the few books that is the exception to this rule (over seven hundred pages, and every one a gem), took all the long poems and placed them in a separate, smaller volume. Harrison, on the other hand, mixes with glee. You get a ten-line ghazal on one page, then a thirty-page longpoem following. The effect is somewhat jarring at times.<br />It's worth reading, but be prepared to linger over it for months, perhaps years. There's too much going on here to just take it out of the library. ***	2004-02-17

Stephen King, Wolves of the Calla (Grant, 2003)<br />I have been of the tacit understanding, over the past two decades, that when Stephen King uncorked the typewriter for the first Dark Tower story, he had an idea of where he was going to go with the series. Granted, as we all know, this runs counter to everything King has ever said in interviews about how he writes, but this is an epic series, one he had no idea how long it would be when he started. You don't go into something like that without planning.<br />Well, okay, maybe you do if you're Stephen King. Wolves of the Calla was definitely not in the cards when he wrote the first story. There's too much in here that smacks of obvious attempts to tie in things that have come in between (and hints of tying in other stuff, as well).<br />Wolves of the Calla continues the adventures of Roland and co., slipping back and forth between Mid-World and our world at three different times. Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy are on the border between Mid-World and Out-World, about to cross over, when they're approached by a priest from the small town of Calla Bryn Sturgis. The Calla has a problem; every twenty-three years or so, it's raided by masked riders called Wolves, who take one child from every pair of twins between the ages of three and fourteen. (Giving birth to twins is the norm in Calla Bryn Sturgis.) The priest asks Roland and friends to help with the problem of the wolves, and thus a novel is born. Along with this come subplots involving pieces of the other books (Black Thirteen from Wizard and Glass, the vacant lot in New York containing the rose from The Drawing of the Three, etc.). King is beginning the long process of tying it all together. There are even hints of the Low Men in Yellow Coats, the brimstone-filled alternate world from Black House, and various other ties to the other books that touch on the series. (The \\"other works by\\" page at the beginning finally gives us the comprehensive list of which books are Tower-related and which aren't.)<br />I had read all the reviews and knew all the spoilers beforehand, and honestly I walked into this expecting a major disappointment. What I had forgotten is the sheer delight in reading Stephen King's prose, which is as strong as always. When he's talking about nothing, which is often, or going off on a tangent, which is even more often, the prose itself is so simply readable that getting through the book's seven-hundred-plus pages is a pleasure. He never fails to tie in the more odd elements of life in Mid-World to something we earthbound humans can understand, giving us a much clearer picture of what's going on than we might have had otherwise.<br />And yes, the ending is a pain. No surprise there, if you've read any spoilers about the novel. But there's enough there to keep going, especially if you've got twenty years invested in the Tower already, as most people reading this review already do. We'll keep following the Path of the Beam wherever it leads us till the bitter end.

Robin Hobb, Assassin's Quest (Bantam, 1997)<br />Homicide: Life on the Street was for many years the best show on televison, hands down. Brilliant acting, brilliant direction, compelling plots that spanned episodes (one of which went the whole series, from the very first to the very last episode) without ever degenerating into the world of soap opera. It was almost inevitable, really, that Homicide would jump the shark, and it did so by cutting a major plotline short; after Pembleton (Andre Braugher, one of film and television's brightest-shining lights) had a stroke at the end of one season, they opened the next season with his struggle to get back into the world after being released form this hospital. For one episode. After that, he was back to his old self with a few extra quirks, which seemed almost as if the scriptwriters had tossed them in as afterthoughts to make sure everyone remembered Pembleton had a stroke.<br />Assassin's Queststarts off by jumping the shark in the same way. Fitz, left at the end of Assassin's Quest the same way Pembleton was left at the end of season four of Homicide, spends the first few pages doing exactly the same thing. While he spends longer getting back into the ways of the world than Pembleton did, ultimately the thread is dropped (again, except for a few afterthought-like pieces). I got wary right about then. Five hundred pages later, Hobb started tying up all the series' loose ends, and everything got tied up far too neatly, almost to the point of deus ex machina. Another piont against the book.<br />The intervening five hundred pages, though, are prime Hobb, and while the book's two flaws above are major ones, they shouldn't necessarily keep you from having a fine time with this, especially if you've read the first two in the series. Fitz finally gets around to setting out after his two main objectives, the assassination of Regal and the finding of Verity, getting into various minor adventures along the way. All of which is quite fun and reminiscent of the first two books. What seems to be missing from book three is the intrigue. Granted, it's hard to have court intrigue when you're tramping through the woods, but it was part of what made the first two novels so pleasurable, and it feels like an empty space crying out for something else to fill it here.<br />It's good, but it pales in comparison to the first two in the series. ***uite fun and reminiscent of the first two books.

Charles Simic, The Voice at 3:00 A.M. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 2003)<br />Simic's latest collection is something of a shortcut, a \\"new and selected poems\\" that has all the cache of a band releasing \\"greatest hits, volume 3\\" with one new track to entice the fans to buy it. If you've already got the bulk of the books Simic released between 1986 (Unending Blues) and 1999 (Jackstraws), the question is whether you want to shell out the cash for the small section of new poems. My advice, wait for the paperback.<br />For those who have not yet been introduced to the wonder that is Charles Simic, however, this is a great way to get an overview of his recent work. Probably best read in tandem with Selected Early Poems (or his best early volume, Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk) for the full treatment. Either way, though, Simic is one of the finest American writers extant, and getting to know him will not only enrich your life, but give you something cool to talk about at boring society parties. Highly recommended. ****	2004-02-03

I have no idea what inspired me to put it there, but having now finally read the thing, the question has gone from \\"why did I do this?\\" to \\"what on earth was I thinking?\\"<br />The story revolves (very slowly) around nine different characters whose lives interconnect. And while the characters themselves are interesting, Mitchell's portrayal of them doesn't do them justice. I'm not sure how one takes a member of a cult (based obviously on Falun Gong) on the verge of collapse and makes him boring, but it happens here. By the time you've meandered through forty uninteresting pages on the fourth or fifth of these characters, you'll have stopped caring in the least about how these connections are going to get more tenuous.

Jim Squires, Horse of a Different Color (Perseus, 2002)<br />Horse of a Different Color is an autobiographical account of Jim Squires getting into the horse breeding business and, three years after he started, breeding 2001 Kentucky Derby winner Monarchos. Whether that was a stroke of luck or breeding genius remains to be seen, but following Monarchos through the eyes of his breeder is engaging enough to make a decent book.<br />Where it falls short is in Squires' writing style. First, note the word \\"autobiographical\\" in that first paragraph. Squires insisting on using the third person would have been an amusing trick for a chapter or two, but he persists throughout the novel. It gets old after a few pages. Also, there's something vaguely disquieting about his attitude towards women here; it almost seems too deferential to be real (and thus, a cover for something else). This could certainly be a literary device; the book's subtitle does mention that there are an excess of dominant females within these pages. Still, some of the descriptions in here made me read twice.<br />When he focuses on the horse, though, everything works just fine. Even the annoyance of the insistent third person narrative fades into the background. Monarchos was one hell of a horse, and Squires' book captures that well enough. Not as well as Hillenbrand captured Seabiscuit or Farley captured Man o' War, but enough for the Derby-and-Breeders' Cup horse fan to relive some good memories.<br />Recommended, though it won't make the top twenty-five list this year. ***	2004-02-03

Alberto Fuguet, The Movies of My Life (Harper, 2003)<br />A trick does not a book make, no matter how interesting it is. And the trick ehre is interesting; Fuguet takes the structure of a noted director (can't remember who, because my brain is swiss cheese; Elia Kazan?)'s autobiography and turns it into the story of a family trying to make it. The beginning works very well, being a series of emails between the narrator and someone he met on a plane about why he's decided to simply abandon his career and sit in a Los Angeles hotel room writing this, and the structure is intriguing, but beauty is only skin-deep. Once you scratch beneath the surface, you find another Oprah's Book Club candidate ripe for the plucking, a dysfunctional family with no qualities to make it stand out from the rest of the dysfunctional family pack so popular in today's publishing world.<br />If you like dysfunctional family novels, this will probably be right up your alley. The rest of you can safely avoid it. (zero)	2004-02-03

Charles Simic, ed., The Horse Has Six Legs: An Anthology of Serbian Poetry (Graywolf, 1992)<br />This is one of the better anthologies of verse I've come across in quite a while. Simic, a native Serbian himself, has an obvious love for his subject and, one would assume, a greater knowledge of history and cultural context than a translator going in fresh with this material. As any translator worth his salt will tell you, these qualities are the difference between a translation with falls flat and one which breathes; word choice is everything.<br />The \\"name\\" here (to Western audiences, anyway) is Milorad Pavic, whose novel The Dictionary of the Khazars was a literary sensation in the late eighties, translated into many languages and finding the bestseller lists of a number of western countries. But once you've been drawn by the name, linger over the rest of the work here. The whole collection shines with a sophisticated grasp of the surrealist ethic which much of modern American poetry is lacking; many of the poets here, such as Vasco Popa and Ivan Lalic, would stand at the same level of achievement as Eshleman, Willis, or Stroffolino on the short shelf of sacred books, where modern surrealism is concerned.<br />If there is a quibble to be had with the book, it's that it's simply too short. Simic does explain this in his foreword (he only included the translations he's most satisfied with as a poet as well as a translator). Thus, we have to be happy with what we have and hope he releases a volume 2 some time in the future. *** ½	2004-02-03

Alisa Surkis and Monica Nolan, The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories (Kensington, 2003)<br />Okay, so lesbians and horses, and a cover straight off a fifties dime novel. How can you possibly go wrong? Let me count the ways, you wretched thing.<br />I can't, and probably don't want to, count the number of said dime novels I've read, nor the time I've wasted on them. Some achieve a kind of unintentional, campy humor, and the blurb on the back promises that this is the angle Surkis and Nolan took with The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories. Really, I had high hopes. But instead of humor brought on by the lunkheaded and unthinking actions of the protagonists, what emerged from this book was relentless, unending political diatribe. Somehow I knew when I got to the words \\"oppressed by the Patriarchy\\" I wasn't going to be going anywhere with this. When two Depression-era teens get into debates about the various faults of marxism and capitalism, it got worse. Stories will occasionally stop for a quick direct-to-reader chat about the evils of (fill in the blank, all the usual suspects are here).<br />So I guess it makes sense for me, since I would seem to be a member of the Patriarchy thanks to possession of outdoor plumbing, to oppress this book. But, I hold no position of power, so unfortunately for the authors (since, after all, oppression is the quickest route to the bestseller lists these days), the worst I can do is give it an awful review, one which it quite richly deserves. Like the pseudo-fiction of other writers who care about nothing but making a point, the material herein is okay if you feel like reading endless political dialectic.

John Shirley, Wetbones (Leisure, 1993)<br />There are certain books that, if you mention their names, will cause the eyes of horror fans in your immediate area to rise in amazement. \\"You were actually aboe to FIND a copy of that?\\" The three I've had in my sights for about two years now are Ketchum's Girl Next Door, Caponegro's The Breeze Horror, and Shirley's Wetbones. The last of the three was the first I was able to track down.<br />A fun little book it is, but I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. Wetbones is comprised of three (branching off occasionally into four) intertwining stories that all center around an isolated desert mansion called the Doublekey Ranch. Along the way, you get all sorts of fun stuff about mind control, various techniques for efficiently disposing of your victims, the Akishra (not going to try and describe them, read to believe), and various other interesting topics.<br />The various reviews I've read lead me to believe that the reason Wetbones is so sought after an item is that it's considered to have pushed the bleeding edge of splatterpunk. One wonders if the authors of said reviews were ever exposed to the early work of Robert Deveraux, whose novel Deadwight (released a year before this) has only recently found company in the corner of the envelope thanks to the emergence of Charlee Jacob. (Not to spoil the fun, but the scene I'm guessing is considered the bleeding edge, pardon the pun, is lifted almost verbatim from Iain Banks' chilling novel The Wasp Factory, released at roughly the same time as Wetbones.)<br />Now again, let me say that while it may sound like I'm trashing the novel, I'm not. It IS a good read, paced well, with well-drawn characters and enough of a plot to keep the reader interested in what's going to come next. I don't think, however, that when the academics get off their high horses and create a horror canon, that Wetbones is going to be one of the top nominees for a slot. *** ½	2004-01-29

(No word on whether he was a previous occupant of my room, though that would probably explain some of the many unexplainable things that happened within its walls.) I found this out a little less than a decade ago from Clegg himself, and ever since then I've had the \\"you know, I really should pick up one of this guy's books\\" thing turned up a notch up under the constantly-boiling saucepan that is my TBR stack. But somehow I never got round to it till just now.<br />Here's your apology, Doug. I really did mean to get my hands on The Halloween Man and You Come When I Call You. But don't worry, now that I've actually read one, I will be attempting to pick them up posthaste (in the ragtag way I do such things, which often involves used bookstores and library book sales).<br />The Inifinite starts out, well, slow. Glacial. Seeming as if it's going to be just another incarnationof The Haunting, which has had so many pale imitators over the years. But get yourself past the prologue and you realize that was just the chain pulling the car up the first hill, and you're sitting at the top. You sit there for a sickeningly long time letting the anticipation buld as Clegg takes his sweet time filling us in on the characters. In fact, he spends over half the book this way. But anyone who's seen the film Lord of Illusions, and the disturbing flashbacks Scott Bakula suffers therein, should be well aware that filling in background material can be loads of fun by itself.<br />Then you actually get to the house. And yes, the story does start sounding a bit like The Haunting (or Matheson's The Haunting of Hell House, perhaps a closer parallel) retold for a modern, more blood-soaked audience. And while it's impossible to say what it is about the book that makes it better than its contemporaries without giving away a major plot point, trust me. It's something not done nearly enough in novels, and almost never in movies, but when it is it's an autmatic step towards classic status.<br />Am I saying that in seventy years Doug Clegg will be as read and revered as Lovecraft is now?

Henri Cole, Middle Earth (FSG, 2003)<br />First off, let's get this out of the way: this book has no ties whatever to Tolkein.<br />That said, it was the first proof I've ever had of an urban legend I've been hunting down for years. Skim through the Poet's Market sometims and look at the descriptions of the things magazine editors don't want. Most of them come down to one basic description said in a thousand ways: \\"pointless academic tripe.\\" A few have, in the past, named names, but the names most often named I never thought of as all that pointless, some of them downright enjoyable. (But then, I'm an imagist, and from my POV the image is its own point in any decent poem.) Most of the \\"tell, don't show\\" poems, which are the very definition of pointless, don't fit the academic part of the puzzle.<br />Then I discovered the work of Henri Cole, and for the first time, I understood what all those editors are on about.<br />Archibald MacLeish once wrote that \\"a poem should not mean, but be.\\" Cole, on the other hand, wants desperately to invest every word with meaning (instead of letting the words invest themselves with meaning, as any good poem does), and while in some existentialist sense they do achieve being, there is no life behind them.<br />The main problem here is that it seems Henri Cole has never met an image he liked. He's too busy floundering around in the world of vagueness to give the reader anything to latch onto, resulting in tortured lines like \\"Heart, unquiet thing/I don't want to hate any more. I want love/to trample through my arms again.\\" (\\"My Tea Ceremony\\") It's not like we haven't read the same thing from a hundred thousand high-school-age teen-angst poets. Or the painful thud of perhaps the collection's worst line, \\"Tears represent how much my mother loves me\\" (\\"Self-Portrait in a Gold Kimono\\"). It would barely fly in a James Joyce novel; there is nothing at all poetic about it. * ½	2004-01-29

Acharya S, The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold (Adventures Unlimited, 1999)<br />Okay, I tried.<br />I've crossed swords with the author before on some of the very issues that show a blind spot in this book (the section on Evemerism is especially weak, for example; more on that below), but in many cases, her response ended up being \\"read my book,\\" which then hadn't been released yet. Okay, so I got around to reading the book, or at least trying to read the book.<br />The Christ Conspiracy may well be on the most important subject to be written about in the last two thousand years. And what is here is well-researched, even if the source material isn't always of top quality. But the presentation is absolutely horrible. The book is just on the wrong side of unreadable; it seems almost as if it were written for the purpose of being presented as a textbook (the authors of which often seems if they're being deliberately obtuse). Interesting, this, because Acharya has a style about her that reaches for readability in today's culture; her diction is appealing to gen-X and younger readers, she's witty, a formidable opponent in debate, and simply quite likable. None of which actually comes out in her writing here; what we get is a four-hundred-page rant (well, okay, I only make it through two hundred fifty pages, but saw no reason to believe it would be any different to the end) that's dry as dust. It makes Bjorn Lomborg (The Skeptical Environmentalist) look like Stephen King.<br />What is most glaring, however, are the places where questions are raised that Acharya either refuses to answer or never thought of answering. I know the latter is not the case for at least one of these questions; she hammers away at evemerist interpretations of Christ by setting up a straw man, saying that anyone to whom evemerism attaches itself must have at least some of the characteristics that get exaggerated, as in the case of Paul Bunyan. Such is not the case. Reader's of Chinua Achebe's novel A Man of the People will easily see through this sleight-of-hand. For a real-life example, try Johnny Appleseed...or, perhaps, Jesus Christ. Such inconsistencies in question-answering are common throughout the book.<br />Worse yet, a number of her sources have either been discredited to the point where even the atheists don't consider them worthwhile anymore or are of questionable character in the first place.<br />None of the above is to say the topic itself, whether Jesus Christ truly existed or not, is not worth researching. The opposite, in fact; Christianity is an obvious amalgamation of earlier religions, and Jesus Christ may well have been a mythical figure, something the Gnostics have been claiming for almost two millennia without anyone really listening to them. But such an important topic needs far more solid legs in serious debate than will be found in this book. You can do far better.<br />First book fed to my starving dustbunnies in 2004.

Simon Clark, Blood Crazy (Leisure, 1995)<br />How this book gets characterized as a young adult novel is completely beyond me. Hey, folks: just because a novel's protagonist is under twenty-one years of age does not make a novel aimed at the young adult market.<br />Nick Aten (\\"rhymes with Satan\\") goes to bed one night convinced that all is right with the world. He wakes up the next morning and finds out how terribly wrong he is; something has caused all of the world's adults to go crazy and start killing their children. Those who have no children just go after everyone under a certain age (undetermined at the beginning of the book). Needless to say, the children are not altogether happy with this. Nick escapes and heads out of town, banding together with various other survivors against millions of people whose whole goal is their destruction.<br />In other words, it's your basic post-apocalyptic novel. And from that perspective, it's a good enough read. It's hard to review this objectively, since I had it marketed to me as a young adult novel; it reads like an adult novel, and so I'm concerned my ideas about it are going to cross one line or the other, since the two are often entirely different animals. Thankfully, it's a decent book as both, though a little on the adult side for being a YA read.<br />Simon Clark has a good sense of the dramatic, and the book is paced and plotted well. Granted, postapocalyptic lit is fast becoming its own subgenre, and it's not too hard to plot these days (a reading of The Stand, a reading of Swan Song, and a screening of The Omega Man, and you're pretty much set; elements of all three show up here, of course). His characters are for the most part solid and well-built, with a few cardboard-esque exceptions. The main reason, I'm guessing, this was thought to be a YA novel is the Nick Aten's narrative voice, which is naïve; too much so at times. (One wonders why that's still considered a YA trait, given the popularity of the romance genre.)<br />Readable, fast-paced, and worthwhile for horror fans. *** ½genre.)<br />Readable, fast-paced, and worthwhile for horror fans. *** ½	2004-01-21

Kiernan, Wrong Things (Subterranean Press, 2001)<br />The title of this small collection seems rather redundant, really. Readers of the books of either of these authors should know well by now that nothing, in the world of either, is ever right, per se.<br />Wrong Things collects three long stories; one each from the two ladies, and a third that is a collaboration between them. The collaboration was originally supposed to be in Kiernan's From Weird and Distant Shores; at a guess, no one who reads the afterword in that book will be able to resist traking this down and reading \\"The Rest of the Wrong Thing.\\" It's worth it. The story is set in Brite's fictional town of Missing Mile, taking two tangential characters and a tangential event and making them the focus of a creepy story about, as Kiernan puts it, \\"urban archaeology.\\" Lovely stuff.<br />But the real gem here is Kiernan's solo story, \\"Onion.\\" It's impossible to describe \\"Onion\\" without making it sound purely idiotic, but it comes off anything but. You'll just have to trust me on this one; \\"Onion\\" did more for raising a sense of dread in me than any story I've read since, probably, my first experience with the story \\"Slime\\" still trying to track the author of that one down) back in 1980.<br />You want to read this.

Jim Crace, Being Dead (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 1999)<br />Jim Crace's novel Being Dead is, for lack of a better term, an anti-murder mystery. Specifically, it is the antithesis of Heinrich Boll's novel The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum. Instead of getting a book where the murderer is known from the first sentence and working out the \\"why\\"s of the murder, we get a book where the murder is nothing more than a mechanism to reflect both on the past lives of the murdered couple and the mechanisms of death by the seaside.<br />I said about halfway through reading this novel that I didn't know whether finding out who the killer is would make me like the novel more or dislike it; having finished the book days ago, I'm still not sure. The book ended up feeling as if there were a number of loose ends (many of which had to do with the dead couple's daughter), but this could be put down to the author mistakenly giving a little too much screen time at the end to what should have been minor details.<br />In any case, quite a fine little read, quick and easy. *** ½	2004-01-21

Ira Sadoff, A Northern Calendar (David R. Godine, 1982)<br />Ira Sadoff is one of the finest and most underrated poets working in America today. Every book of his that crosses my desk reinforces this position. This thin collection (and one wonders what David R. Godine was thinking, charging $8.95 for a 32-page chapbook all the way back in 1982!) is as fine as anything that has come from Sadoff's pen before or since, at least of the work of his that I've read (some of his books are frustratingly hard to come by these days).<br />Sadoff's gentle, storytelling style, insistence on imagery rather than simple value judgment, and ability to get right to the point show what a poet who is academically-infused enough to nod at the canon in every poem and yet accessible enough for the common reader to understand what he's on about can do. And Sadoff is one of at most a handful of poets working in America today who can do so. Of those, he is arguably the best (Hayden Carruth also competes for the title with every release):<br />\\"Can you miss a place you've never been?<br />I remember waking once, the sharp chill<br />of Stockholm singing from my sleep, harbors<br />crowded with so many ships the water seemed<br />precarious, superfluous. I was waving goodbye<br />to my mother and thought only of my setting<br />at the table. My meal. How I wanted it saved.\\"<br />(\\"On First Sighting a Man\\")<br />Sadoff deserves far more recognition than he's gotten. As with all of the other books of his that I've read, this will both make a fine starting point for the novice and a pleasurable read for the existing fan. Excellent. ****	2004-01-21

Joseph Finder, Paranoia (St. Martin's, 2004)<br />Joseph Finder (High Crimes, recently made into a movie)'s fifth novel is something different. Something new. From the looks of things, Finder wanted to take aspects of literature-and I'm not talking your basic modern 20th century \\"literary\\" novel here, I'm talking lit-rat-chaw-and apply it to the technothriller. Certainly as risky as anything his protagonist, Adam Cassidy, comes up with during the novel. And how does he succeed? Very well, thank you, for the most part.<br />Finder does for the technothriller what Hammett did for the mystery novel, though he's still something of a neophyte in places. Paranoia is a shining example of the idea that literate subtlety will always beat straight genre writing, no matter what the genre.<br />Adam Cassidy is your basic punk. He spends his free time drinking and doing drugs, and his work hours trying to find ways to do as little as possible. He feels more comfortable hanging out with the loading dock crew than he does in his cubicle at Wyatt Industries, being a low-level marketing goon. Because of that, when the loading dock foreman gets ready to retire, Cassidy decides to screw his company and give the guy the best possible send-off, so he pulls a couple of the appropriate numbers and gets the affair catered. Problem is, he's not quite aware of the scope of the catering, and when the bill hits the desk, Cassidy's head is about to roll. Nick Wyatt, the almost cartoonishly evil chairman of the company, gives Cassidy a choice-either go to jail for embezzlement or go to work for their main competitor, Trion Systems, and get the dirt on a top-secret Trion project. Needless to say, Cassidy chooses the latter, or we wouldn't have a novel.<br />Paranoia grabs you from the beginning and refuses to let go. As with any competent thriller, techno or otherwise, the plot and the pacing are strong, but that's not where the true strength of Finder's book lies. He uses subtle tricks to give insight into the characters, couches his moral lessons in dialogue (they do scrape close to the surface at times, but nothing hits you in the face with a dead haddock), and generally turns the whole thing into the kind of technothriller that Frederick Exley or Barry Hannah might have written, had they the inclination.<br />I was struck at first with the idea that the book's use of profanity was gratuitous, but once I figured out what Finder was doing, I took a second look and realized he was working with the precision of a jeweler. Every time you think the prose seems a little off kilter, profane or not, take another look. There's more under the surface than there seems to be. What this results in is characters drawn more strongly here than in almost any modern fiction; if Stephen King is the undisputed master of drawing characters in a few lines, Finder has quickly become the main understudy.<br />So why am I not hailing this the most brilliant novel to come down the pike since Kathe Koja last released something? Because I'm still not sure about the ending. I got to the bottom of page 423, turned it over, fully expecting there to be a few more sentences, and... blank space. I practically growled at the book. (I simultaneously can't wait to see and dread what Hollywood is going to do to the end of this when it gets filmed. And for the record, no one but Brian Dennehy can possibly play Nick Wyatt.) Given everything I've said above, I get the feeling I missed something along the way in that last chapter, but there's a part of me that thinks Finder tried the classic ambiguous ending, another literary risk, and it just didn't go as smoothly as the other highbrow tricks that make this novel so incredible. As it stands, the novel doesn't have loose ends, it's got an Oriental rug that comes unraveled all at once. Expect to spend a good deal of time mulling over the ending. You probably won't get anywhere, but you'll do it anyway.<br />As with all good thrillers, Finder packs a whole lot of twists, turns, red herrings, blue herrings, mysterious gurus, father figures, and a whole plethora of wonderful minor characters (Antwoine deserves his own book, to be sure) into these pages. Don't let the ending stop you.

Ian Brady, The Gates of Janus (Feral House, 2001)<br />Feral House has a history of presenting some of the best nonfiction the planet has to offer, all of it under the table (except Nightmare of Ecstasy, the Edward D. Wood Jr. bio Tim Burton used as the basis for his film Ed Wood). This is criminal. Feral House releases nonfiction for people who don't like nonfiction; the autobiography of a person who spent over half his juvenile life in prison, a reprint of a medieval text called Tortures and Torments of the Christian Martyrs, biographies of Anton LaVey, and the two most necessary anthologies of critical writing on the planet, Apocalypse Culture and Apocalypse Culture II, among others. Everyone, no matter who you are, is bound to find something to like in the Feral House nonfiction backlist.<br />Take, for example, our current specimen. A book on profiling serial killers. The first, to my knowledge, written by an actual serial killer to tackle this topic. Not just any old serial killer, mind you, but half the team known as the Moors Murderers. It's not as good as if Feral House editor Adam Parfrey had channeled Jack the Ripper, but it's close enough for government work. And Brady does himself a pretty fine job of book-writing.<br />It becomes immediately obvious that Ian Brady is not your average criminal. Thirty years in the joint, with access to a library, has obviously done very good things to his mind. He is well-read, critical, and plainly-spoken (of the three nonfiction books that have crossed my path this month, Brady is the author head and shoulders in first place in all three categories). With regards to the readability factor, The Gates of Janus is an undeniable winner.<br />Colin Wilson's introduction (one wonders why Brady, who has more than a few derogatory words for Wilson's own profiling attempts, asked him to write the introduction; perhaps Parfrey did, instead) smacks ever so faintly of sour grapes, but it does provide a surprisingly objective view of the book to follow, and can be taken at face value; the real meat of this book is the second part, in which Brady applies his ideas of serial killer profiling to a number of actual serial killers, including two who were never caught. (One wonders, idly, whether his chapter on the Torso killer, aka the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run, is what has inspired renewed interest in the Torso case.) The first part Wilson refers to rather more derogatorily. I can't speak to it with an objective viewpoint, because I empathize far too much with Brady's words in the first section, as trite as some of them may be. The sociopath will find a great deal to enjoy in the first section; others may find that Wilson's estimation (which amounts to \\"self-aggrandizing silliness\\") is right on the money.<br />The Gates of Janus may be best read in tandem with (or just after) Bolitho's much earlier Murder for Profit, since the two have a good deal in common. Both Bolitho and Brady were groundbreakers in their books, both focus extensively on case studies while injecting a good deal of person insight into the cases, both are exceptionally easy to read and understand. One wishes Brady had focused on one of the same cases Bolitho did to see if eighty years of police work in the interim had made profiling any better. (One wonders, amused, what Brady would have done with the case of Fritz Haarmann!)<br />A few words on the afterword written by one of today's finest authors, Peter Sotos. It almost seems to poor boy is settling down, mellowing out. (Maybe all that talk about stomach cancer in his own books wasn't just blowing smoke.) It starts off sounding like a toned-down Sotos, but does eventually wend its way around to the subject of Brady and his book, which surprised me somewhat. And he does regain his old fire at the end, drawing the connections necessary to label the book as child pornography under Sotos' own definition of the term (the leaps in logic used to do this are worth the price of the book on their own), but it becomes, perhaps, obvious why Sotos has been under the radar for so long. Perhaps he's becoming a kinder, gentler misanthrope? Not that, mind you, the afterword is bad; it's as brilliant as anything else the man has done. But it's more focused, for want of a better term.<br />There is nothing I can say about this book, in summary, other than \\"read it.\\" If you have problems with the first section, persevere; the case studies are more than worth it. *** ½he book on their own), but it becomes, perhaps, obvious why Sotos has been under the radar for so long.

Hallelujah!	Bjorn Lomborg, The Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press, 2001)<br />I have watched the unfolding controversy over The Skeptical Environmentalist with a cynical amusement not at the combatants, but at myself, for still having some shred of belief that reason, logic, and critical analysis has any place in modern reviews, especially those submitted by readers to amazon.com. You would think that by now I'd know better. More fool you (and me, the biggest fool of all.)<br />It is blisteringly obvious that the overwhelming majority of critics (and, one is tempted to say, those heaping the book with such lavish praise) have never actually read the thing. Or, if they have, their reviews of the book are geared toward its political agenda rather than its readability, the competence of the proofreaders, that sort of thing. Oh, well, to each his own. I will warn you that, when reading other reviews of this book, proceed with great caution. Withhold judgment until you've read it yourself. Many of the extant reviews exist to further the agendae of the reviewers, rather than cast an unbiased (however jaded) eye over this book.<br />The main reason for my surmising that most of them haven't read it is because they make pointed, often gleeful, attacks on things that Lomborg specifically addresses in the book. The treehuggers have a penchant for saying the message of The Skeptical Environmentalist is \\"nothing's wrong,\\" a point which Lomborg specifically addresses many times, far more than he should have to, in this book. (Note to others writing controversial books: it doesn't matter how often and how plainly you state something, the deluded will see the opposite. Not your fault.) Instead, Lomborg's driving purpose in this book is to examine the environmental concerns on which the global economy currently spends many billions of dollars per year to see if there are ways we could better spend that money.<br />That he comes up with a resounding \\"yes\\" is not surprising. That his advice has not only not been listened to, but attacked from all sides, is equally unsurprising. Why? Because we have heard the myths Lomborg attempts to put to rest so many times that we take them as truths. What Lomborg calls The Litany has been inculcated into us as surely as has the idea held by some that man has never gone to the moon, or that the Earth is flat. Just because you hear something a million times, and just because you surround yourself with people who also believe it, that doesn't mean it's true.<br />One assumes Lomborg set himself up for the ridicule he has received; you don't tackle topics such as deforestation, global warming, Rachel Carson and the legacy of drooling idiots she has left in her wake, and other such imbecilities without the imbeciles who foster the myths wanting to castrate you. But someone had to do it. Whetehr it would have met with less skepticism coming form Jan Harold Brunvand is anyone's guess. But it came from Lomborg's, and thus, we must look at what we've got.<br />There is no denying that what is here is valuable information. Even if there is a glimmer of truth in the massive Scientific American criticism (to which Lomborg has already responded, so I will save my words), if the many environmental movements whose horse manure we're subjected to daily use massive amounts of hyperbole to try and get their points across, why shouldn't the other side use a little now and again? (Not that I believe this is in any way the case.) Those who don't believe there's been hyperbole on the part of the environmental movement seem to have very short memories, another point Lomborg brings up in almost every chapter. The doomsayers have held a monopoly on our ears for too long; it's about time someone tried to set us straight.<br />And thus we come to the problem with the book itself. It's what my college literary criticism professor would have called a \\"typically German\\" work of criticism; well over twenty-five hundred endnotes are packed into the three hundred fifty pages here (and a small mini-rant, if I may; the increasing use of endnotes rather than footnotes is highly annoying. Please cease and desist immediately, and put the notes back where they belong, on the pages where the references are found). One cannot argue that Lomborg hasn't done his homework, though many have. There are huge blocks of text that are nothing more than facts, figures, and interpretation. Which, as you may surmise, makes for a book that is at time more boring than it is controversial. Readability here may not be at a minimum; you'll get more pleasure out of this than you will trying to choke down the dreck that, say, Tom Clancy or Danielle Steel releases on a regular basis. But not much. It suffers from the general malady of the belief that what is important must be dry as dust.<br />There are also a number of questions Lomborg left unanswered, many assumptions he took at face value; did he do so because getting too far into them would have resulted in the book being endless, or because there are certain parts of the litany he believes? It's certainly okay to not question some things, but the professional skeptic will tell you why. Such things do leave questions in the mind of the reader, chinks in the armor that such a controversial book cannot afford.<br />I cannot recommend it highly enough as a way to balance out the loads of excrement we get fed on a daily basis by people who should know better. But I can't recommend it as an unputdownable bestseller. It's hard work, getting through this thing. But it's worth it. *** ½re packed into the three hundred fifty pages here (and a small mini-rant, if I may; the increasing use of endnotes rather than footnotes is highly annoying.

It suffers from the general malady of the belief that what is important must be dry as dust. <br />There are also a number of questions Lomborg left unanswered, many assumptions he took at face value; did he do so because getting too far into them would have resulted in the book being endless, or because there are certain parts of the litany he believes? It's certainly okay to not question some things, but the professional skeptic will tell you why. Such things do leave questions in the mind of the reader, chinks in the armor that such a controversial book cannot afford.<br />I cannot recommend it highly enough as a way to balance out the loads of excrement we get fed on a daily basis by people who should know better. But I can't recommend it as an unputdownable bestseller. It's hard work, getting through this thing. But it's worth it. *** ½	2004-01-14

Don McKay, Apparatus (McLelland and Stewart, 1997)<br />I hesitate to call Don McKay a Canadian version of Hayden Carruth. For one thing, McKay hasn't been nearly as prolific. For another, Carruth has a much meaner streak of curmudgeonliness running through him that is positively delicious. Yet when I read Don McKay's wonderful poems, Carruth's name is the one I keep coming back to as the closest poetic equivalent to McKay's work. They both share a love of nature and the chops to communicate it; they both integrate modern sensibility into their poems with what seems minimal effort (and this is a very difficult thing for the nature poet to do); both release books that are guaranteed to charm your socks off. McKay, however, is a more (for lack of a more appropriate term) gentle poet.<br />Apparatus is Governor General award winner McKay's eighth book, and it is a beautiful thing. Two of its sections, especially, deserve mention: \\"Materiel,\\" a long meditation on Cain after he has killed Abel, and \\"Three Eclogues,\\" three decent-sized poems written in, well, the style one would expect given the title.<br />Apparatus was also a finalist for the Governor General's award (McKay's third nomination), but lost out to an equally deserving book (Dionne Brand's Land to Light On, also published by M&amp;S). If you haven't yet discovered Don McKay, it will be worth your while to seek him out. If he can get a pave-the-earth person like me to stop and read nature poetry, imagine how good it will be for those who already love the stuff. ****	2004-01-14

Jilliane Hoffman, Retribution (Putnam, 2004)<br />It's not often that a single book causes me to put aside everything else I'm reading to concentrate on it. I got my copy of Retribution in the mail, and started paging through it about half an hour later. Thirty-six hours later, with little food and sleep in the interim, I'd finished it, having put aside the other books in the queue to concentrate solely on Jilliane Hoffman's debut novel.<br />Some books are best summed up with the same \\"what if?\\" question the author likely asked when forming the idea for the book, and this is one of them: what if an ADA found herself prosecuting a defendant whom she had a vested interest in seeing go to the chair? Such is the premise of Retribution. C. J. Townsend, an Assistant District Attorney in Miami, was raped and tortured in 1988, while still in law school in New York, by an assailant she knows only as The Clown. He left her for dead; she survived, and a nervous breakdown and twelve years of therapy later, she's relocated to south Florida, changed her name, and managed to erase her past. Then a man is pulled over for a routine traffic stop, and in the trunk of his car is found the tenth victim of the serial killer known as Cupid. Many of the details of the case are all too well-known to Townsend, for they remind her of her own violation so many years before. Then, in court, she sees a distinctive scar her rapist had, and knows she's prosecuting her own assailant... but that can't sway her niggling doubts about whether he really is Cupid.<br />Hoffman, an ex-Florida ADA herself (begging the autobiographical question, of course), delivers the goods in her debut novel. She gives us a well-drawn and engaging cast of characters, a fabulous plot, and almost perfect pacing. The novel rarely slows, and when it does, it picks back up again promptly. While it lacks the onion-like layers of mystery of, say, Erin Hart's recent debut Haunted Ground, Hoffman zeroes in on the simpler mystery she supplies us here and relies on the ethical subtexts for layering; when the prosecutor knows the defendant in such a way, does the case become prosecution or persecution? And how will keeping all the necessary secrets affect Townsend's life, and the lives of those around her, especially in a case where everyone knows the media will be digging so far into it that someone's bound to turn something up?<br />It's probably not the greatest of form to describe a book with a January release date as great summer reading, but that's exactly what Retribution is. It's got the feel of a literary Law and Order episode (even more so that L&amp;O staff writer Giles Blunt's novels); we see both the police and the prosecution side of the case, there's all the courtroom drama one could ask for, all the twists and turns to keep the suspense in gear until the final pages. (The ending does go a bit over the top. But it's such a fine rollercoaster ride we'll forgive Ms. Hoffman the stock serial killer climax.) Oh, and one other great thing about those twists and turns-just when you think you've figured out the end of the novel, Hoffman springs what you just figured out on you in the next few pages. The revelations of various bits of information throughout are as well-constructed as they are in a Hideo Nakata film, leaving the reader wondering what's coming around the next turn.<br />A fine debut.

Joyce Carol Oates, Big Mouth and Ugly Girl (Harper, 2002)<br />Okay, I admit it. I'm a sucker for books like this. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl into pickle. Boy gets girl out of pickle. Boy gets pickle into girl. They all live happily ever after.<br />Now turn that formula on its head.<br />Big Mouth is Matt Donaghy, class clown. Popular guy, suddenly arrested one afternoon as a suspect in a bomb scare. Ugly Girl is Ursula Riggs, captain of the basketball team, anything but popular, a witness to the events surrounding Matt being a suspect. As with many high school kids, Ursula and Matt know each other by sight, but have never really talked. Still, Ursula feels compelled to go to Matt's defense, immediately sparking rumors that the two of them are an item. Which is ludicrous, right? Despite Ursula's growing feelings for Matt, that seem to be reciprocated when she can pull her head out of her posterior long enough to notice.<br />In other words, your basic coming of age novel. Which is all well and good but, well, this is Joyce Carol Oates we're talking about. And this is the first Oates novel I've read that's missing the common Oates (and Rosamond Smith, too) thread-the overwhelming sense of dread and despair that culminates in the horror of human tragedy. The house burning in Beasts. The child molestation in Cybele. The son killing his father in A Garden of Earthly Delights. Teddy Kennedy plunging off the Chappaquiddick bridge in Black Water. Oates novels end with a massive display of human-tragedy fireworks, don't they? Well, they all have up till now. Oates fans will be expecting the other shoe to drop, and will likely be sorely disappointed.<br />Not to say the ending that's here is bad, it's just, well, somewhat predictable.<br />What is classic Oates in this novel are the characters and their development. Oates is a master at subtleties of character, and Ursula Riggs is one of the most real high school students to come along in a novel in a very long time. She alone is worth the price of admission, all the other good stuff is just icing on the cake. ***y long time.

I (1998, Image Entertainment)<br />I should preface this by saying that Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil is the first graphic novel I've read since The Watchmen, some thirteen years ago, and so I may be missing some of the subtleties involved. If so, mea culpa.<br />I've just finished the first volumes of the A Distant Soil trilogy (at least, it's a trilogy as of this writing), and I've been trying to decide whether I want to continue on with the other two books in the series. Still haven't decided one way or the other. Doran seems to be trying (as Neil Gaiman says in his introduction to the book) to cram just a little too much into the space provided.<br />The story centers on a brother and sister who have grown up in a mental institution-cum-research facility. Both have psychic powers, but are unaware of the extent of those powers, as are their keepers. The two of them, after a crisis situation, escape and are separated. They find themselves aiding two different (and possibly conflicting; it's impossible to tell) branches of an alien resistance force, along with an odd assortment of characters both alien and human, including Galahad (yes, THAT Galahad).<br />There is, without doubt, a lot going on here. And once you've got a handle on things, you can probably keep track of it all, but it takes much longer to get a handle on things than it should. Again, Gaiman's introduction rings true here; Doran's work got better as she got older. If you're willing to get through the earlier parts in order to get to the later stuff, you'll find much to enjoy here.<br />The problem, though, is that some of the failings persist until the end of the novel. Cuts in location and time aren't indicated in any way, and the segues remain jarring throughout. The atmosphere is minimal; a good thing in some cases when telling a story, but generally not so good when one is working in the graphic realm. (One of the things that made The Watchmen so excellent was Moore's constant use of atmospheric detail, which is lacking here.)<br />Hard to really say. I liked it, but I still haven't figured out whether I'm going on to volume II. ** ½as Moore's constant use of atmospheric detail, which is lacking here.)<br />Hard to really say.

James Quinn, Figure Handicapping (Morrow, 1992)<br />It's inevitable in the career of any prolific writer that you're bound to tail off once in a while. (Look at Stephen King.) This is just as true of nonfiction authors as it is of fiction authors, and Jim Quinn's nadir is Figure Handicapping. Not to say it's a bad book, but if you've read a lot of Quinn in the past, you'll want to get this one from the library instead.<br />Quinn comes right out at the outset and tells you you've seen most of this before. The only thing new in the book is his chapter on figure handicapping on the turf (which, I should probably not mention, is covered in far fewer words in Michael Pizzolla's wonderful book Handicapping Magic; far more bang for your buck there). In other words, you're better off with Quinn's other books (especially Class of the Field, High-Tech Handicapping in the Information Age, and The Handicapper's Condition Book) and Pizzolla's Handicapping Magic. But if you want it all in one place and haven't read it before, you can get the basic ideas from here. ** ½	2004-01-06

Tim Lebbon, The Nature of Balance (Leisure Books, 2001)<br />It's interesting that horror has made a comeback in the American bookselling business these days, the same way it did in the eighties. (And the same way it will again twenty years from now.) Often, cycles of something being popular and unpopular are blamed on a fickle public. Those of us in the business of media manipulation through the creation of art know better. Without going into the details, let's just say that the more popular something guess, the more the quality is likely to decline. The business itself brings about the downfall of the genre, whatever that genre may be. (Look at the long, painful death of industrial music in the mid-nineties.)<br />It's pretty easy to see that the new horror revival will soon be headed that way, as well. The stalwarts who weather the last death of horror as popular art form are still around, of course. King, Koontz, Ed Lee, etc. will never go anywhere while they live. And, as always, the newer crop of horror writers contains some brilliant writers who are destined to topple and replace the stalwarts (Kiernan, Brite, etc.), some who have been around for years and just never got the recognition they deserved (Koja, Laymon, et al.), and, well, the rest.<br />To call Tim Lebbon one of the rest is not to imply that Lebbon's work lacks quality. It doesn't. The Nature of Balance is a good, solidly-written novel that keeps the pages turning and is likely to appeal to any horror fan (it may be a bit laid back for fans of extreme horror novelists like Laymon and Lee). But it's not more than that. When you pick up something by Cait Kiernan or Kathe Koja (when Koja's writing horror, anyway), you're not only getting horror, you're getting your socks knocked off. They transcend simple horror novels and become something else. The Nature of Balance never achieves that transcendence.<br />Anyone remember Rick Hautala? Ken Eulo? John R. Holt? William Valtos? Doug Hawk? Leslie Whitten? I could keep going for a very long time here, and at a guess, you'll get maybe ten percent of the names unless you were an obsessive horror fan like  was an obsessive horror fan back during its last popular heyday. If it hit the Atlantic Books shelves in the horror section, I was there waiting with $3.99. (Depressing, isn't it?) And all of the above authors were writers of good, solid horror novels (okay, we'll make an exception for Whitten). I can (and have) go back and pick up John Holt's When We Dead Awaken or Edward Levy's The Beast Within and come up with a fantastic read. It's not a new Kathe Koja novel, but it's a great way to kill a few hours on a rainy day. And, ultimately, that's what The Nature of Balance is; good for what it is, but at a guess, not destined for immortality. ***n?

Louise Welsh, The Cutting Room (Canongate, 2002)<br />This is one of those books where the reader who isn't an insider is going to enjoy it, but the person who knows is going to get far more out of it. Another in the seemingly endless list of British mystery authors turning out stunning debut novels is Louise Welsh, who introduces us to homosexual auctioneer Rilke (no first name, at least not that I caught), whose auction house is offered a job clearing out the estate of a dead man, with one caveat: the person offering the job (the man's sister) wants the contents of the attic destroyed. He must agree not to sell them, not to keep the, but to burn them. Rilke discovers, in the attic, among other things, a series of pictures that look as if they are of the torture and murder of a woman almost half a century ago, and he sets out to track down the identity of the woman in the pictures, stirring up a hornets' nest on both sides of the law while doing so.<br />The mystery itself is a good thing, but you can read any superlatives I have to say about it in my reviews of the debut novels by Mark Billingham, China Mieville, Erin Hart, or a score of others I've penned over the past year. Welsh goes one further, adding slices of Rilke's sexual exploits into the mystery that are so realistic I wondered off and on throughout the novel whether \\"Louise Welsh\\" is actually a pseudonym for a gay man, and the picture on the back jacket is the wife of the guy Stephen King used for Richard Bachmann's back cover picture. The emotional tugging of loneliness while resisting the cruising spots just down the road, the nervous ecstasy of hurried sex in a public place, even the odd, paradoxical thrill of the roundup, all are handled with such stark realism, and the flavors herein are so germane to the cruising culture, that if Louise Welsh really is Louise Welsh (and not Louis), she possesses an amazing talent for assimilating character depth that portends a fantastic career ahead.<br />You want to read this one, but it might turn your stomach.

Tamar Myers, The Hand That Rocks the Ladle (Signet, 2000)<br />I'll get this out of the way first and foremost: I like the Den of Antiquity novels better than I like the Pennsylvania Dutch novels. But it's hard to turn down any book that has recipes as a part of its plotline, isn't it?<br />Myers brings back indefatigable Mennonite heroine Magdalena Yoder, owner of the Penn Dutch Inn and the most unreliable narrator outside the autobiographies of some of those she reports have stayed at her inn. In this episode of her escapades, her cook, Freni, has a daughter who's pregnant with triplets, a husband who's feeling sympathy pains, and a cadre of evil doctors straight out of a Robin Cook medical thriller. When Freni's daughter gives birth to twins, everyone is quick to blame it on her old doctor, who has something of a fondness for the bottle, and probably miscounted the heartbeats. Right? But Freni knows different, and she ropes Magdalena into finding baby number three, despite Amanda having an innful of very odd guests, no cook, and a mysterious stranger she is convinced is Michael Jackson.<br />The main problem I have with the Penn Dutch mysteries is that the narrative tone just gets under my skin for some reason. The Den of Antiquity books are narrated pretty much like any other novel, but Myers has infested Magdalena Yoder with a voice that stops just this side of annoying; imagine Frances MacDormand's character in Fargo, but with a rural Pennsylvania accent, and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at. It's n full steam here, and undercuts the otherwise fun book (and wonderful recipes for things like Toad Stroganoff. I kid you not). The other problem with it is that one of the main clues to what's going on comes in the first couple of chapters, and might as well have \\"I'M A CLUE\\" stamped on it in big red letters, so when you get to the big twist ending, you've seen it coming for the last two hundred pages. Those problems aside, the book is well-plotted and well-paced, and the nutzoid quality of the characters makes it as interesting a read as any of the other Penn Dutch books; still, if you're a Myers newbie, you might want to head for the Den of Antiquity mysteries first. ** ½well-paced, and the nutzoid quality of the characters makes it as interesting a read as any of the other Penn Dutch books; still, if you're a Myers newbie, you might want to head for the Den of Antiquity mysteries first. ** ½	2004-01-06

Tim Burton, The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories (Morrow, 1997)<br />Someone needs to explain this to me and fast, `cause I don't get it: how is it that bad poetry (and yes, folks, this is truly bad) and art that looks like a second-rate Edward Gorey ripoff (Burton is not the illustrator that he is the sculptor and animator) can be so insanely funny? I am completely at a loss for why I liked this anywhere near as much as I did.<br />Let's face it, if you squint right while watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, it's obvious even in Burton's finest work that the specter of Edward Gorey looms large over Burton's material; it has never been more obvious than it is here. Many of his characters even seem to have the same basic brushstrokes Gorey used in his illustrations. Which is not to say they're bad; they just look like Edward Gorey work. Not even as blurred as Bacon's famous study of Pope Pius.<br />And the verse? Absolute doggerel. Even conceding the idea that Burton is using Gerard Manley Hopkins-esque sprung rhythm (which he's not, because sprung rhythm does, at least, HAVE a rhythm), the implementation is so amateurish that it's impossible despite the rhymes to call this anything resembling poetry.<br />but good living Christ on a crutch, is this book funny. Morbid, twisted, insane, gut-churning (despite the pretty cartoons, folks, this is not one to buy for the kiddies; flip through the title story for a good example of why), and full of laughs. One almost gets the idea Burton was going for a place as the anti-Dr. Seuss. Little vignettes about characters who fade in and out like Dish Network reception in a typhoon, popping up unexpectedly here and there and doing exactly what you were hoping they wouldn't.<br />If you are at all a fan of Tim Burton, this is a must-read. If you're not, you're probably going to notice the faults and not find what lies beneath them. ***	2004-01-06

Brian Michael Bendis and Marc Andreyko, Torso (Image Entertainment, 1997)<br />Sometimes it seems like every city wants to claim a serial killer. Look at the number of municipalities who seem almost proud that Jeffrey Dahmer spent a portion of his upbringing in them; Akron, Ohio, just down the road from me, is one of them. A little closer to home and a little farther away in time, though, Cleveland was the home (and may still be...) of one of the most notorious serial killers active in the first half of the twentieth century: the Torso killer.<br />Bendis and Andreyko brought the Torso Killer, and Elliott Ness' hunt for him, to stark, ugly life in the series of comic books that has since been collected in this graphic novel. All those faults I found in Doran's A Distant Soil are absent here; Bendis and Andreyko know exactly what they're doing with keeping the reader up to speed with what's going on with each character, know exactly how much they can fit into any given page without overwhelming the reader's sensibilities, and did meticulous research on the case (living in Cleveland, it's kind of hard to get away from the details; the Torso Killer is one of our local public television station's favorite subjects). Only a piece of the ending has been shifted from the way the actual case went, presumably for dramatic effect.<br />But the book does not just stop at the Torso Killer, delving into the private lives of some of the folks who worked on the case, as well. The result is a cast of well-drawn characters, a good (and faithful, for the most part, to the truth) story, intriguing artwork, a fine script, and a bang-up mystery.

Hayden Carruth, ed., The Bird/Poem Book (McCalls, 1970)<br />First and foremost, please note the ed. after the name Hayden Carruth. Why? Because it stands for \\"editor.\\" Online booksellers (and libraries) who list a book as being by, instead of edited by, a particular author set people up for disappointment, especially if it's a book that's been out of print for decades and the person has been tracking it down for years.<br />The Bird/Poem Book suffers from the same major problem as most anthologies of its type; there simply aren't enough quality poems written on any very specific topic to come up with a top-quality anthology of that sort. And this one was very specific; poems about birds, but that don't pretend to be about anything BUT birds. (In other words, no Gerard Manley Hopkins' wonderful \\"Windhover\\" here, which would have increased the quality of the collection tremendously.) And, really, the only poem that lives up to the quality one would hope for from an anthology that is so small (one assumes they kept it to slightly over fifty pages because they couldn't find enough of quality) is Carruth's own piece. Note that being up to the quality hoped for from an anthology of this sort is not the same as being up to Carruth's usual quality (this is decidedly inferior to many of the pieces in Asphalt Georgics, Collected Shorter Poems, etc). The rest of the collection ranges from the good and famous (Whitman) to the overrated, awful, and famous (Emily Dickinson, with yet another poem that can be sung to the tune of \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\"). Included are a number of now-obscure poets of various quality; some of them it seems a crime to have let fade into oblivion, but that could well be the company they're keeping here; for all we know, they sucked.<br />I'm sure that my disappointment in finding this not to be a Carruth book, as advertised in multiple places, affected my rating.

Kiernan's From Weird and Distant Shores; the subject matter may not be what the more plot-centric fans were hoping for, but the style is unmistakable, and wonderful.

During the eighties, he was considered one of the rising stars, going so far as to get some of his stories in the then-groundbreaking Night Visions anthology (and \\"Doing Colfax\\" will never be erased from my memory). Then the horror market died. Lee, unlike many of his brethren, continued to publish in small specialty presses. Those books are now worth a small fortune. And he still continues to publish; his newest novel, as of this writing, is City Infernal. And a typical Edward Lee gut-churner it is.<br />Cassie and Lissa are identical twins who are enamored of the early nineties goth scene in DC. Lissa catches her boyfriend kissing Cassie, at which point she kills both him and herself. Their mother is long gone, so Cassie and her father are left on their own. A couple of years later, the two of them move out to the country. The house they move to just happens to be a gateway to hell, inhabited by three of hell's outcasts, Xeke, Via, and Hush. Through them, Cassie may finally get a chance to do what she's wanted to since the incident: apologize to her sister.<br />Okay, so extreme horror is no longer the shock that it was when Lee published \\"Doing Colfax,\\" the characters have only a shade more depth than cardboard cutouts, and the whole thing is really kind of predictable (though he does throw in a few twists, some explicit and some implied, at the end that will catch the reader off-guard). So why, then, is Ed Lee's stuff such a fun read?<br />Good question, and one to which I really don't have an answer. City Infernal is more Ghouls than it is The Bighead; you're not going to find anything groundbreaking, and in the harsh light of day this will likely end up being considered one of Lee's minor novels rather than a piece of the classic Lee canon. But still, it's a ball. He creates the Mehistopolis, the major city in hell, as lovingly as China Mieville creates Perdido Street Station's New Crobuzon, and has just as much fun describing it. The Mephistopolis is what Dickens could have done with his place descriptions in A Tale of Two Cities if he hadn't been so stultifyingly verbose.<br />I will warn you, a good number of horror fans will probably be bored off their butts with this book.

Dick Mitchell, Commonsense Betting (Morrow, 1995)<br />When one picks up a handicapping book by Dick Mitchell, one can be assured one is getting good stuff. Mitchell, a college statistics professor, knows his math. Granted, his style of relation may be annoying at times (after the fiftieth sentence starting with the word \\"please,\\" perhaps one will pick up on the not-so-slightly condescending tone), but if you can get past it, the information to be found here is great stuff. (And really, Mitchell's not as bad as some other handicapping writers.)<br />If you've read a number of handicapping books, especially Mitchell's other works (and Winning Thoroughbred Strategies is one of the best handicapping books on the market, and should be read by every horseplayer, casual and serious), much of what's here is going to be another look at the tips and techniques we've seen before, but through the lens of money management as applied to various types of bets (exactas, pick threes, etc.); stuff the average player could probably figure out given an unlimited amount of time, computer power, and the knowledge of the right questions to ask. But why expend the energy? Get back to handicapping and let Papa Dick do the work for you.<br />The book's real gem, though, is the last chapter. (And this will probably be a controversial paragraph with horseplayers, who are wondering why the thing was even in the book in the first place.) Mitchell abandons handicapping, racing, the whole bit altogether, and gives the punter a lesson in money management 101 for the time you spend outside the racetrack. As with his work on handicapping, Mitchell documents everything he says nicely and leaves a long, glowing trail of other reading for the handicapper to pursue; the only difference here is that Mitchell is praising the likes of Bill Donoghue rather than the likes of Jim Quinn. One you've figured out that the last chapter ain't about horses, please, don't skip it. In fact, even if you couldn't care less about horses, beg, borrow, or steal a copy of this book and read the last chapter (unless you're already familiar with outside-the-racing-world money management books by authors like Donoghue and Peter Lynch); it's stuff we could all use, and most of us don't. ****ess about horses, beg, borrow, or steal a copy of this book and read the last chapter (unless you're already familiar with outside-the-racing-world money management books by authors like Donoghue and Peter Lynch); it's stuff we could all use, and most of us don't. ****	2003-12-22

Leif Enger, Peace Like a River (Grove, 2001)<br />Oh, what has happened to Grove Press? The folks that made their name publishing scandalous novels by James Joyce, Henry Miller, William S. Burroughs, and the like publishing what may be the least controversial novel of the last ten years? It hurts my heart, folks, it really does. Please, Grove, stick to what you know.<br />It wouldn't be so bad if there were more about this piece of smarmy claptrap to like. I haven't decided whether this is a good thing or a bad thing yet (I'm grudgingly leaning towards the former). Enger's writing style allows for long lapses in anything actually happening. Just when I'm ready to throw the book against the wall, however, he perks right back up again and things start going well for a few pages, then it's back into the depths of... well, the void. That's about the only way I can put it.<br />Reuben Land is an asthmatic eleven-year-old (or, at least, he is in the novel; one of the more amusing things I'm finding about most reviews is that they seem to have skipped over the fact that he WAS an asthmatic eleven-year-old at the time of the novel, but he's telling the story as an adult, which makes the comparisons to To Kill a Mockingbird, Huck Finn, etc. specious at best) with a father who can perform miracles, a sister who's a writing prodigy, and a brother who's your basic teenager in the small-town American Midwest in 1962. After Reuben's father stops two town thugs from raping a girl, they seek revenge on the family. The teenager's reaction to this is what sets up the rest of the novel; it's probably not a spoiler any more, but I won't say anything just in case.<br />The plotline with Davy (the teenager) is by far the most interesting thing about the novel. When Enger is writing this, his prose rises off the page and compels the reader to keep going. Unfortunately, it's a minor point in the general scheme of things; Enger seems far more interested in writing an episode of Seventh Heaven where the family's father is actually Jesus. Except Seventh Heaven, for all its many many faults, has more wit, more compassion, and less preaching than does Peace Like a River.<br />I was willing to give this mess two stars, mostly because Enger can write well when he tries, and a couple of his characters are perfectly drawn, but then I got to the ending. Of all the endings I would have projected for this novel, Enger took the most predictable, most syrupy-sweet, most clich&eacute;d ending he possibly could, then tried to pass it off and something epic and grandiose. Even if the rest of the book had been perfect, the ending is such a miserable failure that I'd recommend skipping the whole novel, unless you seek out smarminess and predictability.<br />The purpose of a great novel is to challenge the reader, make the reader think, open the reader's eyes and make the reader look at things from a new perspective. All in all, I can't say I've come across another book this year that fails so miserably in all those capacities as does Peace Like a River. * ½en where the family's father is actually Jesus.

Brian Hodge, Wild Horses (Morrow, 1999)<br />Brian Hodge spent the early half of the nineties being one of the most weirdly original writers of horror fiction of our time. (Impossible to travel through, say Nightlife without saying \\"where does he GET this stuff?\\" at least once. Trust me.) So when this-a mainstream (gasp) novel that, from the description, sounds equally reminiscent of John Ridley's Stray Dogs and Doug Winter's Run-hit the shelves, I was a bit leery of it. I have watched other horror authors attempt this transformation and fail miserably. (Exceptions are to be made for such authors as Kathe Koja and Lucius Shepard, who were writing literature to begin with.)<br />Hodge does the job, and he does it well. His main character is day-care worker Allison Willoughby, who finds out her boyfriend, Boyd, is cheating on her. After a confrontation with Boyd and the ex-showgirl lover, Allison gets ready to move out. Before she does, she cleans out Boyd's laptop. What Allison doesn't know is that one of the things she erased was a file with the information necessary to get seven hundred thousand dollars stored in an offshore account which Boyd and the lover have been skimming from the casino in which Boyd is a dealer. Allison's headed back to her childhood home to settle some old ghosts, blissfully unaware that both Boyd and his new girlfriend, and the lover and her sadistic husband, are after her.<br />As far as the wonderful world of the crime/suspense thriller goes, if you're looking for a quick way to turn your brain off, get a few good one-liners, and have yourself a merry old time, you need look no further than Wild Horses. Fast-paced, straightforward, sharp, and funny, there is a good deal here to be enjoyed. A few folks who are unfamiliar with Hodge's earlier work in the horror genre might find themselves wincing a time or two at some of his more loving descriptions of damage caused by various characters, but overall you shouldn't have a problem with it. (Just keep reading. He'll stop after a paragraph or so. Honest.)<br />My only real problem with the book is that every once in a while a two-dimensional character pops up whose sole purpose in the novel is to advance the plot. But they are few, and while they're not far between they disappear pretty quickly once you're into the second half. (Again, keep reading. He'll stop after a chapter or so.) It's certainly not enough to keep you from picking it up if you're looking for a good, action-packed thriller. Fans of Winter and Ridley will definitely want to give this one a look. *** ½ust keep reading. He'll stop after a paragraph or so.

Alfred Bester, The Stars My Destination (Vintage, 1956)<br />Considered by many (or so the book jacket tells us) the single finest science fiction novel ever written, The Stars My Destination (also known as Tiger! Tiger! in some parts of the world) is certainly a hefty train ride with a lot of fine sightseeing along the way. The best? I don't know, I'm not much of a science fiction fan. But it worked for me.<br />The Stars My Destination is the story of Gulliver Foyle, mechanic's mate third class on a ship called the Nomad when we come into the story. Or he was one, because the ship is a wreck, Foyle is the only survivor, and he's rapidly running out of air tanks. He sees a vessel going by him, and risks his life to get to the airless bridge and fire off the safety flares; the ship, called the Vorga, ignores him and goes on its merry way. He vows to stay alive long enough to revenge himself upon the Vorga and its crew, and thus we have ourselves a story.<br />Gully Foyle is, not to put too fine a point on it, an archetype. (If only more like him existed.) The brilliance of The Stars My Destination is that Bester is able to couch Foyle's archetypal qualities in a great story, showing once again that if you let the art speak, the message you have underlying the art will show through just fine. (Overemphasizing the message has turned innumerable potential works of art into innumerable realized crap.) He bounces around from episode to episode on his quest for revenge, acting, reacting, trying to figure out what to do next, and above all being a three-dimensional character, which far too many archetypes in literature are not. He is surrounded by a cast of other three-dimensional characters. And while some of the situations may look all too familiar to readers of cyberpunk (especially the large multinational corporations), don't let that put you off; Bester may have been the single biggest influence on cyberpunk, but he could outwrite the rings of Saturn around most of its practitioners. The multinational corporations in The Stars My Destination are not just big, faceless symbols of evil; the main B.M.C. not only has a name, it also has a face, and its face is one of the novel's main characters. And he's not just some two-dimensional pansy here to advance a knee-jerk anti-establishment position. Thank the lord.<br />In other words, a whole lot of writers today (if one counts amateurs, I would not hesitate to change that to \\"most writers today\\") have a lot to learn about writing from Mr. Bester's fine little novel, not only on constructing characters, but on how to let the art speak the message instead of letting the message crap on the art. (One wishes more artists, especially poets and songwriters, had spent the last half-century learning these lessons.)<br />Unfortunately, they may also learn that the unbearably stupid typographical tricks Bester resorts to about fifty pages before the end of the novel are okay, too. One wonders what on earth possessed the man to suddenly go from being an intelligent creator of a brilliant novel to being a literate five-year-old with a box of crayons, a few blank walls, and too much time on his hands. But that section of the book only lasts a few pages.

Charlee Jacob, This Symbiotic Fascination (Leisure Books, 1997)<br />Whatever else This Symbiotic Fascination is (and it is many things), one word I see applied to it many times that it really isn't is \\"original.\\" Fans of extreme horror (the term \\"splatterpunk\\" is far too overused and far too inaccurate; this is more Guinea Pig than Neuromancer) who have been reading Bob Deveraux's stuff for the past decade will be well-enough acquainted with Jacob's style to have recognized this. Fans of extreme horror who have not yet read Bob Devereaux's classic Deadweight need to get their heads out of the necks of their victims long enough to read the best extreme horror novel on the planet.<br />What This Symbiotic Fascination is, however, is a whole lot of fun. Tawne, a largely-built and relatively unattractive girl (by her own admission), finds herself drawn into the mystery of the local serial killer when one of her few friends pops off with the guy one day after work; a guy who is, to say the least, stunningly ugly. Add to this plotline that another of her co-workers is a serial rapist possessed by animal demons, and, well, you've got yourself a whole brew of nastiness jut waiting to be chugged.<br />The one thing that didn't really ring true (in the \\"logic-inside-the-suspension-of-disbelief\\" way that these things do) is Tawne's pure, complete loneliness, her ability to find even a single human being who finds her attractive. Especially given the qualities Jacob invests her with. A six-foot-two, large-built redhead who lifts crates for a living? Try a personal ad, watch the responses come rocketing in.<br />Other than that, though, I can't stress how much good, clean, gore-spouting fun this book is. Most everyone who has something coming gets it, in spades, along with a few people who don't deserve it but get it anyway. (I will leave it to you, dear reader, to decide who's who.) Jacob's blood-gouting bile-spraying intestine-hurling(-for-distance) descriptions never stray into the juvenile, as these things sometimes do. The characters are well-presented (aside from the niggle above), the pace is cranked, the anger is righteous, and the blood never stops flowing.

Clayton Eshleman, Hades in Manganese (Black Sparrow, 1981)<br />Clayton Eshleman probably knows more detail about more stuff than any poet since Ezra Pound. Which is, no doubt, a good thing, but those who pursue meanings in their poetry are going to run themselves into a very brick, very hard wall when coming upon this mid-era collection of Eshleman's work.<br />According to its introduction (and how often to books of poetry have introductions? That should tip you off right there), the book is, ostensibly, about cave paintings in France. Modern readers of Eshleman's will be in no way surprised by this, as the cave paintings have long been an obsession of Eshleman's. But to say this is a book of poems about cave paintings is only to scratch the surface; Eshleman is deep into the realm of shamanism here, along with feminism, his usual surrealism, various symbologies, ancient history, animism, and a whole host of other topics I could spend a whole thousand-word review going over. Those who read a poem and at the end first ask \\"but what does it MEAN?\\" had better have a library handy at the ending of each poem, because they'll have a lot of looking up to do.<br />Those of us who ask the proper questions, however, will get a lot more out of this book in a much shorter period of time.

Kiernan, From Weird and Distant Shores (Subterranean Press, 2002)<br />I can't really say anything about Cait Kiernan's delicious storytelling that I haven't already said before. If you haven't yet discovered the gothically beautiful, barren world that is the mind of Caitlin R. Kiernan, all I can do is wish that, soon, you will. Kiernan's short stories are the literary equivalent of Edward Gorey's drawings; witty, somewhat Victorian in their scope, but with an ineffable sadness behind them that changes from piece to piece, beckoning the reader ever farther down the road to perdition.<br />That said, I ended up not rating From Weird and Distant Shores as high as Candles for Elizabeth. This is (for the most part) a collection of \\"shared-world\\" stories Kiernan wrote during her fledgling years for various anthologies. And while everything she says in the introduction about the attraction of writing shared-world stories is true, all the pitfalls of doing so loom before even the finest writers. Investing your breath of life into someone else's creation doesn't always work; it ends up either being their creation looking right, but moving with an odd, amateur-puppeteer-style jerkiness, or looking like your creation and making the original author say \\"what the hell is THIS?\\" Which obviously happened to Kiernan more than once, judging by the acid words she has for certain copyeditors in the afterwords of some of these tales. (Needless to say, of the shared-world stories here, those, presented in their original drafts in this collection, are usually the best.)<br />There are exceptions, of course. There are three very early tales from an abandoned short-story cycle towards the end of the book, and while science fiction is not nearly as much my bag as is dark fantasy, what was in them begs for more fleshing out. Hopefully, more readers of the book than I will be thinking very hard at Kiernan \\"when do we get more of `Between the Flatirons and the Deep Green Sea'?\\" Also, some of the shared-world collections were far less restrictive than others, and the book's most haunting tale (\\"Two Worlds, and In Between\\"-a much better title than the original, because it gives nothing away) comes from one of them.<br />Highly recommended, especially if you can't find the now-out-of-print Candles for Elizabeth. ****o, some of the shared-world collections were far less restrictive than others, and the book's most haunting tale (\\"Two Worlds, and In Between\\"-a much better title than the original, because it gives nothing away) comes from one of them.<br />Highly recommended, especially if you can't find the now-out-of-print Candles for Elizabeth. ****	2003-12-22

Theodore Sturgeon, Some of Your Blood (Carroll and Graf, 1961)<br />In the world of what we shall call \\"psychological fiction,\\" for lack of a better term (to wit: that fiction that deals with a person being psychoanalyzed, psychologized, and/or psychiatrized), Theodore Sturgeon's short novel Some of Your Blood occupies a very odd position. It s recognized by the Horror Writers' Association as one of the Top 40 horror novels of all time (despite it being more of a novella) despite not really being a horror novel. Yet it is largely unknown to the larger mass of horror fans (look at the number of reviews written at Amazon. A backlist tile from Stephen King may have five to seven hundred customer reviews (The Stand seems to be the king, with seven hundred fifty-five); Some of Your Blood has six. What's up with that?<br />Maybe it's all about the presentation. Some of Your Blood is about a guy who hits a superios officer during his army days, and gets sent to a psychiatric facility for observation. On the surface, he seems to be perfectly all right; his doctor's CO wants him out, they need the bed. His doctor, on the other hand, senses something deeply wrong with the prisoner's autobiography.<br />The autobiography takes up the first seventy pages (short the beginning frame setting everything up) of the novella, and it alone is an amazing piece of writing, with a gentle wit about it and a naïve, but subtle, eagerness to please. Once we are out of the autobiography, and into the doctor's notes and correspondence with his superior officer, things get even more interesting. The prisoner is not all he seems...<br />This is a stunning little tale, neatly wrapped, waiting for the masses to discover it. Please, do so at your earliest opportunity. **** ½	2003-12-22

Homes, Music for Torching (Morrow, 1999)<br />To play devil's advocate, it would be hard for any author to reproduce the sheer unadulterated evil that reverberates through A. M. Homes' wonderful novel The End of Alice. I shouldn't expect it of anyone. Yet my second trip into the delightfully twisted world of Ms. Homes came with just such expectations. She subverted them by giving birth to something so completely unlike The End of Alice that halfway through this, I'd tossed the comparisons to the wind and was just having fun hanging on for the ride.<br />Paul and Elaine are your typical, everyday American middle-class suburban couple. Or so we think. Then, on impulse, they set fire to their house as part of a new beginning to their lives. From there, we get to meet the rest of the neighborhood and see their reactions to the supposed tragedy. The result is a savagely funny skewering of American suburban life that's too disgusting not to be accurate.<br />Perhaps the best way to describe this novel is \\"Peyton Place on crack.\\" Everyone's sleeping with everyone else, the Stepford wives' porcelain skin is cracking under the stress, everyone's using entirely too many drugs, Paul's incompetence at work is richly rewarded, you get the idea. Everything is going along rollickingly, and we're laughing along, guilty and embarrassed that we find this stuff funny, and all in all it looked like your typical three-star novel; readable, predictable, but good enough to recommend. Then comes the last few pages, where Homes throws a curveball that fits in with the story in every way possible, but turns the tragicomedy on its head. The sucker punch is so skillful that it raises estimation for the entire book.<br />Sick, twisted, and not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach, but those who found themselves in love with The End of Alice or The Safety of Objects (where Paul and Elaine first show up; that story is referred to here a number of times) are going to find much to adore in Music for Torching. ****dore in Music for Torching. ****	2003-12-11

Kathe Koja, Buddha Boy (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 2003)<br />I got to the point about eight years ago where I finally gave in to the temptation to predict an author. After the back-to-back triumphs that were Skin and Strange Angels, I figured that from here on out, anything Kathe Koja would release would be brilliant, and every book she released would find its way onto my top ten for whatever year in which I read it.<br />Then she started writing kidlit. I approached Straydog with some trepidation, but it not only made last year's best-of list, it topped it. So I had no such qualms hunting down her second piece of young adult fiction, Buddha Boy. Needless to say, I wasn't surprised, at least not by the quality.<br />Justin is an Everyman in an Everyman's high school; if you went to high school in America, you'll probably recognize all the archetypes to be found here. The school gets a new student, Jinsen. To call Jinsen, an aspiring Zen monk, different would be the understatement of the year. And we all know what happens to different kids in high school.<br />Justin, however, assigned to a class project with Jinsen, discovers that Jinsen is one of the finest artists Justin has ever come across, and thus grudgingly befriends the kid the others at school call Buddha Boy. From all this springs this small, delicate tale.<br />Koja's writing is, as usual, short and to the point. Even the slowest reader will probably get through Buddha Boy in no more than a couple of days. Most people will be able to find someone here to identify with (though many won't like what they see in the book's looking-glass), and the story is compelling enough to draw the reader through, perhaps in a single gulp. Nothing surprising there.<br />What is surprising, perhaps, is the language she chooses.

Lyn Lifshin, Before It's Light: New Poems (Black Sparrow, 1999)<br />Lyn Lifshin is one of those poets who just keeps getting better as she gets older. She spent years, it always seemed to me, trying to be a sort of imagist Bukowski; she outgrew that a ways back and rounded into her own style. Her work since has gained a rare and delicate power, and with every passing book, it gets more all-encompassing.<br />There are few words to say about Lifshin that have not already been said; I'll just let the images speak for themselves.<br />Now cliff swallows<br />  nest in the mud<br />  where the Sinaqua<br />  lived<br />  until water ran out<br />High in these white cliffs<br />  weaving yucca and cotton<br />  How many nights did they<br />  listen for cougar<br />as they pressed the wet<br />  rust clay<br />  into bowls<br />  that they walked<br />200 miles to trade in Phoenix<br />  before it was time to leave<br />(\\"Arizona Ruins\\")<br />Pure, simple image, with all the power vested inside, and no annoying blocks of message to dilute the power of the words. Lifshin reiterates her worth of being placed alongside Hayden Carruth, Ira Sadoff, and the rest of the modern poets who will someday make up the canon. An easy entry on this year's best-of list. **** ½	2003-12-11

Tamar Myers, Baroque and Desperate (Avon, 1999)<br />I've been an ambivalent fan of Tamar Myers for a while now. I'm never quite sure what I'm going to get with one of her books. I've finished Baroque and Desperate, the fourth Den of Antiquity mystery, and it's done nothing to change my perceptions either way.<br />The book opens with fearless detective and antique shop owner Abigail Timberlake getting back into town after a vacation to find that the Den of Antiquity has been robbed. Well, robbed may not be the word for it; the shop is as clean as a whistle. Everything, including the cash register, the wastebaskets, and even the shelving is gone. Just as she's starting to wonder what's going to happen in her life, a guy sitting next to her on the plane home shows up at the store with a proposition. His grandmother, a very rich, very eccentric woman, has hidden an antique worth at least a hundred thousand dollars somewhere on her estate. He needs a professional eye to help him. Desperate for a quick buck to save the business, she agrees. (Don't worry, folks, the intrepid sidekick, not to mention Dmitri the cat, come along for the ride.)<br />If you've read a Tamar Myers mystery before, you know what to expect. The wit is fresh, the puns are awful, the mystery is fun (albeit capped, always, with the annoying \\"ah, and here's how I did it!\\" section). She does go a bit overboard here with her descriptions of C.J.'s insanity (there must be at least four dozen variations on \\"one king short of a full deck\\" here, and it gets annoying after a while), but everything else seems to be clicking on all cylinders.<br />So Baroque and Desperate ends up getting the same lukewarm recommend as most of Tamar Myers' catalogue. I keep waiting for the book that will push me one way or the other; looks like I'm going to continue waiting. ***	2003-12-11

Charles Bukowski, The Night Torn Mad with Footsteps (Black Sparrow, 2001)<br />Can a person be great and yet not too good at the same time?<br />I ask myself that pretty much every time I open another book of Charles Bukowski's poetry. Something in me quails, because I know in the roughly 300 pages before me (this one clocks in at just around 350), I'm going to see every rule of decent poetry writing broken. Usually multiple times on a page. \\"Show don't tell\\" goes completely out the window. Line breaks? Absolutely hideous. Avoid confessional poetry? Bukowski wallows in it. By all rights, I should be right there with the rest of the critics talking about how much the man's work sucks, how it's simply not poetry. A few examples should serve to be sufficient:<br />\\"I am such an unpopular human/being.\\" (the first line of \\"It's Just Me\\")<br />\\"the house of horrors/the house of a thousand beatings/the house of brutality and unhappiness.\\" (\\"A Drink to That\\")<br />The word \\"brutality\\" has no place in a poem. Ever. Any writing teacher I ever had, and the vast majority of critics, would look at any poems containing the word \\"brutality,\\" slash a red line through it, and say \\"show, don't tell!\\"<br />And yet the simple fact of the matter is that Charles Bukowski has outsold every other American poet who penned a single line during the twentieth century. Ran rings around most of them; the sales of one Bukowski book probably dwarf the sales of the complete output of every Pulitzer prize winner, taken on their own. Something draws people to his books by the thousands.<br />Unfortunately, I doubt that it has anything to do with the truly brilliant flashes of image that shine through once every twenty pages or so, the places where the later work of Bukowski sounds like the older work of Bukowski (Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame, written between 1955 and 1970, is one of the finest books of poetry written in the last century). They are few, but some of them are so heart-stopping they make wading through the rest of it a joy:<br />\\"sometimes dogs/in the alley/play the violin better/then the privileged peacocks/who swim in butter./I speak now of young/dogs in/old rooms of peeling wallpaper and/the bathroom down the hall-always with/somebody in there.\\" (\\"The Fish with Yellow Eyes and Green Fins Leaps into the Volcano\\")<br />I think it has more to do with the idea that a volume of Bukowski's poetry (and his novels, too) reads like a dime store self-help book. \\"Here, look at how bad my life is. Identify with a few things and use the rest to reflect on your own life and say, `hey, it's not that bad.'\\" Even the severest critic, when alone, probably finds a few of those image-less strophes to identify with and smile at. \\"the dark is empty;/most of our heroes have been/wrong.\\" (\\"I Can't See Anything\\") No, it isn't poetry. But it's something. And it's something in the works of a self-confessed prudish misanthrope that reaches out to others.<br />I don't pretend to know what it is (Bukowski does, though-\\"'it's easy,' I said, `all I do is/lie as truthfully as possible.'\\" -\\"Good Pay\\"). And I force myself to admit that while they're getting what they're getting out of it, at least they're getting snatches of greatness in amongst the rubble. ***ey make wading through the rest of it a joy:<br />\\"sometimes dogs/in the alley/play the violin better/then the privileged peacocks/who swim in butter./I speak now of young/dogs in/old rooms of peeling wallpaper and/the bathroom down the hall-always with/somebody in there.\\" (\\"The Fish with Yellow Eyes and Green Fins Leaps into the Volcano\\")<br />I think it has more to do with the idea that a volume of Bukowski's poetry (and his novels, too) reads like a dime store self-help book. \\"Here, look at how bad my life is.

Robin Hobb, Royal Assassin (Bantam, 1996)<br />There should be a law against ending books like this, especially when they're the second part of a trilogy. Imagine what it must have been like for the poor souls who read this on the day of release, and then had to wait another year to find out what happened next.<br />Royal Assassin continues the story of Fitz, son of an abdicated prince, assassin for the king, user of magic both human and bestial. It also continues the building of the world of the Six Duchies, and adds a new component; while most of the diplomacy (outside the small world of Fitz, that is) in the world of the first novel in this trilogy took place with what amounts to a sledgehammer, the second novel brings in political intrigue on a much more delicate level. The king's two younger sons, Verity and Regal, sit ready to leap at one another's throats, as the four coastal duchies (who support Verity) and the two inland duchies (who support Regal) sit poised on the brink of conflict. It doesn't help matters much that the Mountain kingdom, which sits on the other side of the inland duchies, just married its daughter and queen-to-be off to Verity. Things look pretty bad for the inlanders, right? Well, if they were, we wouldn't have a novel.<br />Royal Assassin continues on at the same pace as did Assassin's Apprentice; it may be a huge-looking effort (my trade paperback version is 580 pages, and almost as thick as the trade paperback edition of that doorstop known as Harlot's Ghost), but believe me, now that you've gotten yourself into the story, the slowness with which it begins (as did Assassin's Apprentice) is easily forgivable, and you'll be sitting and reading long after you'd promised yourself you'd stop.<br />I warn you now: stop before you get to page five hundred, and wait until you've secured a copy of Assassin's Quest before reading the end of this novel. The twists and turns will leave you growling in frustration if you have to wait to dive into the last book in the trilogy. It's almost as memorable, and frustrating, an ending as we got from George R. R. Martin's A Storm of Swords (and two years later we're still waiting for the fourth book in THAT series, a form of slow torture that is crueler and more unusual than anything the U. S. Justice System has ever come up with).<br />And with that, I'll go back to chewing my fingernails and waiting for the library to get the third volume back in (since I can't find it in any of the bookstores near me). ****the last book in the trilogy.

Andrew Hudgins, After the Lost War: A Narrative (Houghton Mifflin, 1988)<br />I read Hudgins' collection The Never-Ending a few months back, and after I had finished praising it, a friend of mine told me that I had to read After the Lost War as soon as possible. Well, I just finished it.<br />Houghton Mifflin bought centuries off the time they will spend in purgatory for all those dry-as-dust textbooks with this collection. Hudgins based this series of poems loosely on the life of Civil War veteran, novelist, and flautist Sidney Lanier, but really, the subject matter could have been anything from primordial ooze to particle physics. The greatness of the work here is in the construction of the poetry itself. The entire book is in blank verse, but a sort of sprung blank verse (through not as loose as the sprung rhythms of Gerard Manley Hopkins) that rhymes every once in a while. Nonrhyming poetry that rhymes every once in a while is one of the great no-nos of poetry; it speaks to a lack of attention paid to the details of craft. Before free verse became so popular, it was also not advisable to write in, say, iambic tetrameter and then suddenly throw in a line of iambic pentameter. Hudgins does both of these things, seemingly at will, and even the most astute reader will likely skim right by them without even noticing there's been a rhyme, or a break in the rhythm.<br />Hudgins, in these poems, is so completely attuned to the beauty of the language he's using and the natural flow of the words that the anomalies within them take on, at best, minimal significance. Hudgins manages to do a number of things that, these days, seem nearly impossible: breaks the rules of both free-verse and metric poetry, complete an epic-length series (144 pages) of related poems and keep them readable, and manage the whole way not to drop a single syllable, not include a single throwaway word. I only have a thousand words for this review, and a thousand words is not nearly enough to describe the beautiful intricacies of the construction here, the many parallels that run through the book and the way the lengths of the poems expand and contract depending on what's going on in Hudgins' life; someone, someday soon, will use this book to write a critical thesis. It will be very long.<br />Upon the release of After the Lost War, one reviewer in the Denver Post called it \\"one of the best narrative poems to appear in this country in more than thirty years.\\" Indeed. Easily one of the finest books, in any genre, I have read this year. **** ½the beautiful intricacies of the construction here, the many parallels that run through the book and the way the lengths of the poems expand and contract depending on what's going on in Hudgins' life; someone, someday soon, will use this book to write a critical thesis.

The first chapter really does pack a wallop. I just with the rest of the book could have carried out the promise.<br />It doesn't, unfortunately. After the first chapter comes long, drawn-out setup that is in no way justified by the payoff. Robert Parker does the same thing, but he does it in about a third of the number of pages per novel used by Johansen. The woman could use a few lessons in tight prose and how it heightens tension in a novel. But this one's a lost cause; by the time her protagonist finally gets around to reconstructing the face on the skull, will the reader still care? Not this one. (zero)	2003-12-01

Karl Barth, The Word of God and the Word of Man (Peter Smith, 1928)<br />It is true that the translation of a work of literature is often as much of an art as the work of literature itself. Having now read three long translations of Karl Barth from three different translators, I can speculate that the above statement is, perhaps, more true of nonfiction being translated from German to English than it is anywhere else. Douglas Horton's translation of Barth stands head and shoulders over the other two authors whose translations I've attempted, and the man deserves to be commended for a job well done before I get into the meat of the book.<br />The Word of God and the Word of Man is a collection of eight addresses Barth gave to Reformed conventions during the first half of the period between the two world wars. At this point, Barth was still the young country preacher he spent his life professing to be, and his youth should be taken into account when comparing the writings in this book with some of his other works. Barth is a bit more, shall we say, pointed here than he is in later works. Not that that's a bad thing, by any means.<br />Perhaps it is the case that Barth's exhortations to his fellow ministers are different and more positive than those he used to congregants. But as a non-Christian reading Barth, the thing that kept coming back to me is that if more churches (and Reform or not, most Protestant denominations these seem to pay at least lip service to Barth's works) actually practiced what Barth preached, I might still be a member of one. Barth's vision of the place of the preacher as bridge between the kingdom of Man and the kingdom of God spends little time, if any, on the \\"thou shalt not\\"s and most of his time on the questions with which every aspiring Christian, preacher or no, struggles (or should struggle) on a daily basis; why are we here? How can we understand the wholly Other that is God? How can we communicate what little understanding we can garner to others, and what makes us qualified to do so? Things like that. There is fire here, and it can be seen even eighty years later with the words on a page, but there is a decided lack of the smell of brimstone. Barth's fire is that of enthusiasm to share, not to command, and that makes all the difference.<br />Karl Barth is widely considered to be one of the greatest theological thinkers of the twentieth century; reading books like The Word of God and the Word of Man, it's quite easy to see why. ****r to others, and what makes us qualified to do so?

Cosgrove, Ira Wordworthy (DreamMaker, 1988)<br />Reading Ira Wordworthy at the same time I was reading Artemis Fowl gave me an interesting juxtaposition of kidlit. Cosgrove wrote for a much younger audience than did Colfer, but Cosgrove managed to avoid talking down to his audience. And that makes all the difference.<br />Based on the true story of an illiterate Arkansas shopkeeper, Ira Wordworthy is transformed into the tale of a crotchety old badger (and who can resist a book with a badger as the main character, I ask you?) who runs a town store and cannot abide kids sitting on the front porch reading books. (Would that we had such problems today!) One of the kids discovers that Ira is illiterate and sets about to correct the problem.<br />It's a lovely little parable, and a testament to the idea that you can just get on and tell your story, and the reader will get your point. Eoin Colfer, and many other writers of books for both children and adults, would do well to pay heed to the work of Stephen Cosgrove...	2003-12-01

Eoin Colfer, Artemis Fowl (Hyperion, 2001)<br />It seems inevitable in this post-Harry Potter kidlit landscape that someone would have had to come up with an anti-Harry, a creature as slimy and loathsome as that little Potter brat is good and pure. Eoin Colfer made a valiant attempt in Artemis Fowl. And while he steps in a major pothole along the way, in the general scheme of things he did a pretty good job.<br />Artemis Fowl is not your typical twelve-year-old. He is guarded by a mountain of a man wherever he goes (think Professor Toru Tanaka in a dark suit and shades), his father is missing and presumed dead, his mother is off her gourd, and-oh, yes-he's a brilliant criminal mastermind who aims to restore the wealth his family lost on the same trip where his father went missing. How does he aim to do this? By stealing fairies' gold. No, I kid you not. Fairies are real, and Fowl wants what they've got.<br />It's a great setup, and it's carried off relatively well. There are a few places where the pace bogs down, but for the most part it rolls along smoothly as Artemis gathers his information, goes about kidnapping a fairy, and hatches a plan within a plan within a plan that keeps her rescuers (and the readers) on their toes wondering what all he's on about. This is certainly readable enough, though there are points one gets to where putting the book down and going off to do things like eat or sleep seems manageable. (Compare to, say, Kathe Koja's kidlit, which will plague your dreams if you try to sleep before you finish the book.)<br />Where Colfer goes painfully wrong, as where most authors go painfully wrong when writing kidlit, is to break the first rule taught in every book ever written on kidlit and every course ever taught on kidlit. The rule goes, with some variations, \\"don't talk down to your audience.\\" The problem doesn't exist just in kidlit, of course, and hundreds of thousands of useless books, both fiction and nonfiction, are published every year that assume the public is made up of blithering idiots. As true as this may be, it's also still true that one catches more flies with honey than with vinegar. If you're putting an environmentally conscious subtext in your book, showing an image of diseased dolphins is more than enough (and, in fact, the very brief description given is quite stomach-turning on its own, and would have been greatly effective had he ended the sermon there); when you've stated your case in images, there's no need to then go off on a mini-tangent that amounts to \\"if I leave it like that, you won't get it, so I'm going to explain that last bit for you to make sure you understand what I'm on about.\\" It's insulting to the reader's intelligence, it distracts from the value of the book, and it destroys the pace, even if it's only one sentence of explanation. It's redundant. Colfer doesn't just wade in this muck pit once (which might have been forgivable), but he does it at various times throughout the novel. One gets the feeling at times this is what an adventure novel would sound like had it been written by Amiri Baraka or Joan Baez.<br />If you can stomach being preached to in the middle of an adventure novel, by all means, pick it up. If you bristle every time an author pauses to explain something to you, you're probably better off avoiding it...assume the public is made up of blithering idiots.

Robin Hobb, Assassin's Apprentice (Bantam, 1995)<br />Once you get past the (to be expected with books these days) complete incongruity between the cover art and the book's descriptions of its characters, this is one fine debut novel. I spent way too much time flipping between passages in the book and the cover trying to figure out what planet the artist was on when he took those words and turned them into that cover. But that's just me.<br />Fitz, at the age of (approximately) six, is brought by the person he thinks is his father to the castle at Buckkeep and left there. We are soon apprised that, in fact, Prince Chivalry is Fitz' father, not that chap who dropped him off on the stairs (and this is about as much as we get of Fitz' live previous to his coming to the castle). Fitz is taken in by Burrich, the stablemaster, but soon enough makes himself known to the king. The king decides the boy needs to be made productive, and has him trained in the art of diplomacy from a distance-assassination.<br />Like all good fantasy novels (especially those that come in trilogies), the book is not only about Fitz, of course. It's also about building a believable world in the Six Duchies and the Outislands, and describing it enough that the reader can get a sense of daily life there and a grasp of its geography without going into too much detail and bogging down the story. It is in this that the majority of failed fantasy novels fail. Hobb takes to it like a fish to water (or a Fitz to assassination, as it were), giving us what sometimes seems like an Upstairs, Downstairs set in an alternate world. Fitz' parentage allows him to move between the worlds of royalty and poverty pretty much at will. A tough task for any writer, but Hobb carries it off with aplomb.<br />A fantastic beginning to the trilogy. ****	2003-12-01

Simic, a hardcore imagist, is wonderfully precise in his use of concrete detail, which he then pulls completely out of the realm of reality by juxtaposing things which have no business being next to one another. Walking the Black Cat, a finalist for the National Book Award, is often considered one of Simic's finest works, and justly. There is much here to be enjoyed, mulled over, surprised at, and delighted with, and very little that dips below the level of brilliant.

Mark Billingham, Sleepyhead (Avon, 2001)<br />What is it about British mystery authors cranking out excellent first novels? Nicci French, Mo Hayder, and Minette Walters have all waltzed down the pike in the last decade and taken the world by storm. Now you can add Mark Billingham to the list.<br />Billingham's first novel, Sleepyhead, is about a truly twisted individual, even more twisted than Hayder's birdman-this one's dead bodies are failed experiments. What he's really after, he gets in Alison Willetts, a girl who is mysteriously left at a hospital suffering from what is known as locked-in syndrome, a type of stroke that leaves the victim fully conscious, but paralyzed and unable to communicate. The police find an ever-growing string of bodies as the killer attempts to duplicate his handiwork.<br />Very well-paced for a book of its length, and very readable. Billingham knows where to put all the twists and turns. The characters are a little more wooden than one would expect, and a bit more predictable, but then mystery readers have been spoiled recently. (Odd, because Billingham has one of his characters remark early on that he doesn't fir the policeman-on-television stereotype; perhaps we're just used to that these days?) Still, this is a fast, fun read with some excellent twists. *** ½	2003-12-01

But they are neither as frequent as they are in Gaiman's American Gods, nor are they couched in as gripping a prose style. The plot is, to be sure, capable of pulling the reader along; Aziraphale, an angel, and Crowley, a demon, are trying to figure out exactly where the Antichrist has got off to so they can start the apocalypse. Except neither (they've become friends over time) is exactly sure they want the apocalypse to start, because they've grown rather fond of Earth.<br />It's hard to actually pinpoint any problems with Good Omens, except that perhaps it tries too hard every now and again. It just didn't grab hold and refuse to let go in the same way American Gods (or the hitchhiker's Guide) did.  ***	2003-11-17

Various, Six Poets (Vagabond Press, 1979)<br />Perhaps I should just give up trying to figure out what poetry is, because it's obvious either I have no idea or the rest of the world has no idea. If I allow myself to believe the former, I end up with the strong desire to simultaneously retch, burn everything I've ever written, and huddle in the corner in a quivering ball. If I believe the latter, I often end up with the same response, because I have roughly a 95% chance, whenever picking up a book of poetry, of finding the usual unreadable crap that really has nothing to do with poetry.<br />Six Poets has an unfortunate mixture of not-poetry and stuff that ranges from the half-decent to the downright good. Whether you're willing to wade through the swine to get to the pearls is pretty much up to you (but I'll tell you, so you can save time, that all the book's pearls come in Ann Menebroker and Lyn Lifshin's sections). On the other hand, if you're fond of reading political prose broken up into lines to make it look artistic that passes itself off as poetry, you'll find no end of stuff to love here.<br />I originally bought this because it was illustrated by the late Charles Bukowski (and that no doubt added a great deal to its value when I recently sold it). The illustratins are, in many places, the best thing here-and to call Buk's drawings \\"naïve\\" is doing them a service. **	2003-11-17

William Bolitho, Murder for Profit (Time, 1926)<br />South African expatriate William Bolitho (a pen name for a chap named Charles Ryall) wrote Murder for Profit in the mid-twenties, looking at the antics of five at-the-time notorious murderers (most of whom, save Werewolf of Hanover Fritz Haarmann, have now pretty much faded into obscurity). He was a journalist, a regular contributor to the Manchester Guardian and New York World at the time, and fleshed out some of his articles to compile the book. Were it just a look at cases of murder, it would probably have faded into well-deserved obscurity now (like Bolitho's previous book, Studies in Murder, has). But Murder for Profit is something different, and something that should be recognized-to my knowledge, it is the first book ever written which consciously attempts to profile the serial killer. As profiling of serial killers is held in high regard these days, it would seem to me that however inaccurate and colored Bolitho's conclusions, that he put people on the road should be enough to immortalize his name in the annals of crime literature forever.<br />Bolitho looks at the Burke and Hare murders (would-be grave robbers who decided murder was easier than digging), J. B. Troppmann (who killed for no other reason, Bolitho would have us believe, than that he found a victim from the same town he grew up in), G. J. Smith (the Brides in the Bath Murderer), Desire Landru (The Ladykiller), and Fritz Haarmann (the Werewolf of Hanover). The cases are presented in varying formats, which can get annoying at times (Landru's murders, for example, receive not an inch of the book), but does keep the interest better than a case-study template covering five serial killers would. Bolitho focuses more on the upbringings and lives of the murderers before they committed their crimes, for the most part, in an attempt to determine what forces shape the serial killer. Some of what he finds would fit today's profile (enmity towards their fathers, for example), while some would be laughed at (all were dealers in secondhand goods, in various ways).<br />But whether a book is important is, in the general scheme of things, not going to impress the casual reader all that much; the question to be asked is how's it read? And Murder for Profit reads very well for a book from the pre-television (read: back when people still had attention spans greater than those of a gerbil on crack) days. Bolitho hooks the interest, spends a good, but not inordinate, amount of time on each case, and saves his own conclusions for the section where he talks extensively about the serial killer profile. (Oddly, this is not at the end-it is at the beginning of the section on Haarmann.)<br />One wonders what Bolitho would write today, had he not died an untimely death, about our own serial killers. Lord knows he'd do a better job than most who write about them at present. This is a fascinating read, well worth taking the time to track down. *** ½thers, for example), while some would be laughed at (all were dealers in secondhand goods, in various ways).<br />But whether a book is important is, in the general scheme of things, not going to impress the casual reader all that much; the question to be asked is how's it read?

Lawrence Durrell, Justine (Cardinal, 1957)<br />Well, my two-month struggle with the first hundred fifty pages of the first novel of the Alexandria Quartet has left me with one resolution: I will never read the other three (or, probably, any other Durrell).<br />Don't get me wrong. Durrell writes beautiful prose. The descriptions of Alexandria are lush, detailed, and really give the reader a feel for the city. You can almost feel the heat baking out of the clay as night goes on.<br />The problem is, aside from Alexandria itself, there's not a single character in the novel worth caring about, not a plotline worth following (for that matter, what little plot there is in the novel appears and disappears at random like a faraway TV signal on an old Zenith black-and-white). There's nothing to do but marvel at the beauty of Alexandria. Which, I guess, is fine for folks who take week-long vacations to a particular tourist spot, and then go stare at that landmark for eight hours a day as it steadfastly refuses to do anything but sit there. Perhaps it's a mark of my lack of attention span, bad breeding, or what have you, but I like there to be at least minimal action in a novel. If I wanted a book where absolutely nothing happens, I'd read Stephen Jay Gould. (zero)	2003-11-06

China Mieville, King Rat (Tor, 1998)<br />It amazes me, after having read King Rat, that China Mieville didn't start getting widespread recognition until after his third novel, Perdido Street Station. King Rat heralded the coming of a great new writer, and most of the planet ignored it. Their loss.<br />Saul Garamond comes home one night after a camping trip and immediately goes to bed. He is awakened the next morning by the police, who suspect him of killing his father, who took a plunge out their sixth-story apartment window sometime during Saul's absence. He's held in prison overnight, but during his stay there, a fellow who calls himself King Rat slips into Saul's cell and breaks him out. For Saul is the key to the defeat of King Rat's oldest and most powerful enemy...<br />Set amid the Jungle craze that hit London in the mid-nineties, and spending a good deal of time in the sewers underneath London, King Rat achieves what Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere came so close to but missed by a hair-taking modern London and making it into a completely new place, filled with wonder and magic. Seeing it from a different point of view (but unlike Gaiman, Mieville gives us a point of view that actually exists inside the fantasy world-the point of view of the homeless). A number of previous reviewers have commented that it helps when reading the novel to know a good deal about Cockney rhyming slang and Jungle music. I know diddly about either, other than that they exist, and still found the novel easy enough to follow (while some of the slang terms I couldn't figure out for the life of me, the context of their use made the meanings obvious).<br />Like Perdido Street Station, King Rat shows Mieville as more than a capable writer, but one possessed of greatness. He weaves the threads of the novel together perfectly, creating a design that, while obvious, still throw in the odd twist here and there. You've read them before, yet somehow they're still unexpected. After a while, the fantasy aspects of the novel recede into the background, and you're reading an adventure novel (albeit a very weird one); only the best fantasy can do that.<br />If there is a problem with the book, it's that it's a little too quickly paced. The kind of pacing that works well in horror films-you drop a clue, then within two minutes you show what the clue points to (Hideo Nakata is a master at this)-doesn't translate quite so well to novel form, and there are sections that feel a bit rushed. Of course, this could be an editing problem. Editors are not happy with giving large, expansive canvases to first-time novelists. The seven hundred fifty pages of Perdido Street Station were perfect for Mieville to stretch his wings; the three hundred of King Rat seem a bit cramped. There was more to this tale, I'd warrant, that needlessly hit the cutting room floor.<br />Still, as fine a novel as any I've read this year, save Perdido Street Station. Mieville may well be the finest new author to come along since Wendy Walker. Get in on the ground floor. **** ½asy aspects of the novel recede into the background, and you're reading an adventure novel (albeit a very weird one); only the best fantasy can do that.<br />If there is a problem with the book, it's that it's a little too quickly paced.

Joel-Peter Witkin, The Bone House (Twin Palms, 2000)<br />Witkin is best known outside the world of avant-garde art for being one of those whose work was scrutinized during the whole \\"art or pedophilia?\\" craze that followed the hullabaloo surrounding Robert Mapplethorpe getting an NEA grant (not that those two things are related, except in the diseased minds of those who decided that all \\"deviance\\" is necessarily related.) Which is too bad, because Witkin creates photographs of a singularly disturbing atmosphere, a combination of beauty and brutality perhaps last imagined by Bosch and Bruegel hundreds of years ago.<br />Witkin is (and he admits this readily in his introduction to this collection) thoroughly obsessed with death, mutilation, violence, the erotic, and how they all intertwine. His photographs, which he calls portraits, do not capture the portrait per se but what Witkin sees as the true soul, the symbol of the person or people involved; the photographic equivalent of Bacon's famous study of Velasquez' Pope Innocent X. His photos are not for the faint of heart, but it seems to me that even the most squeamish will find a rare attractive power in Witkin's work. I strongly suggest, however, that the more squeamish not read the end essay (which starts with a description of how Witkin composed and photographed the photo \\"Feast of Fools,\\" a description which may cause even less sensitive stomachs to roll).<br />These photographs are disturbing, repulsive, above all beautiful; one thinks, though, it would take a truly diseased mind to find anything of the pedophilic in the photographs presented here. With all the many layers to be studied in these compositions, it seems like the work of a revisionist historian, or someone with the Jesse Helms \\"I don't know how to define pornography, but I know it when I see it\\" mentality, to overlay something onto them that simplifies and erroneously categorizes them. We see what's there through our own filters; photography, especially of this sort, is interpreted by what we bring to the table ourselves.

Petri Harbouri, Our Lady of the Serpents (Bloomsbury, 1999)<br />Sometimes you just get unlucky in your reading choices. Right on the heels of Habe's execrable Off Limits, I picked up Harbouri's slightly less execrable, but no less boring, Our Lady of the Serpents. Plot: rich woman on a remote Greek island hires a British expatriate to work in her garden. There is some mystery surrounding the death of her husband and whether she takes her succession of gardeners as lovers, firing them when she's worn them out. You will eventually realize that you couldn't care less whether said rich woman killed her husband, nor whether she and the newest in her string of gardeners will end up bumpin' uglies. My most pressing thought during the final few pages of my attempt at this novel was how quickly I could feed it to the dustbunnies. Unfortunately, thanks to much of my recent reading, they are far better fed than they have been in years. Hopefully I'll manage to find something decent next time out. (zero)	2003-10-30

Cummings, The Enormous Room (Liveright, 1921)<br />Cummings became famous for his poetry, but before that he wrote a now obscure novel-cum-memoir about his temporary imprisonment during World War I, The Enormous Room. Modeled loosely after Bunyan's magnum opus, Pilgrim's Progress, Cummings gives us the arrest and detention (for he is never sent to prison, only detained awaiting the word of the Commission on whether he is to be imprisoned or freed) of a friend of his and himself. The friend is charged with treason after writing letters home critical of the French government; Cummings is charged with nothing but being his friend.<br />The book touches all the expected bases; the horrors of war, problems with authority, etc., etc. Nothing here you haven't seen before. What causes it to stand out is Cummings' treatment of the whole thing. Cummings takes an horrific experience and makes it a whimsical way to pass the time, only allowing enough of the horror to show through so that the reader can understand the irony of Cummings' presentation here.<br />The book is well-written, though a bit jarring in places; it is written rather like you would hear the story from someone sitting next to you at the club smoking a cigar, although all too overeager at times. Cummings' enthusiasm for his subject, though, is a refreshing change from the usual war novel. This is not a book that is easy to digest, but is worth the effort. *** ½	2003-10-30

Barry Hannah, Captain Maximus (Penguin, 1985)<br />Barry Hannah is America's most sadly neglected literary author since John Fante, and that's a shame. Hannah's place in literary history should be carved in rock, if for no other reason than having written one of the world's few absolutely perfect novels in The Tennis Handsome; had he retired after that, he should have been able to retire secure in the fact that his literary legacy would stand as long as humanity does. But he kept writing, and every once in a while he'd turn out another wonderful and overlooked gem. The short story collection Captain Maximus is without doubt one of them.<br />Hannah hands us a small (too small, for my tastes, but you can't have everything; it runs ninety-two pages in trade paperback) collection of stories, many of which had only appeared in limited runs or places one normally doesn't find short stories (for example, the newspaper) before appearing here. Spanning the first half of the eighties, the collection shows once again why Barry Hannah should be hoisted on the shoulders of the literary establishment to tapdance on the heads of vacuous New York Times bestseller list residents; his characters are savage, unrepentant, funny, mixed-up, and above all fiercely intelligent and with a finely-honed sense of the ironies of their existences. Most of the stories here are only a few pages long, but still manage to pack a wallop. As a side note, this is unmistakably work of that genre known as \\"southern fiction;\\" had a genetic engineer taken the best parts of the creative genes of Flannery O'Connor and mated them with the same from Faulkner, they might have gotten Barry Hannah (or, at least, the oddly fraternal twins of Hannah and Ferrol Sams). So let your taste for whatever it is that makes \\"southern fiction\\" southern be your guide, but one way or the other, give Hannah a try. If you want a small dose first, by all means, start here.<br />(Side note: it is amusing that 90% of the bibliographies of Hannah I found on the web list Captain Maximus as a novel.

Katcha Goodwon, The Complete Thinking Man's Guide to Handicapping and Training (Westcliff Publications, 1982)<br />The title of this book is somewhat bold, and for that matter somewhat inaccurate. The handicapping half of Mr. Goodwon's book is pretty much a rehash of much that had been written over the twenty years previous in the handicapping world; one can find traces of many other racing authors in there (for some reason, the work of Bob McKnight especially came to mind as I was reading this.)<br />The value in this book, for the handicapper who wishes a more complete knowledge of the game, is in the training section. Most racing fans, at most levels, don't get much insight into how the training game is played, and this book provides some of it in the same way Joseph Davidson's All Horse Races Are Fixed gives us a look at the vets' side of things. Unfortunately, Complete Thinking Man... suffers from the same shortcomings in this regard as does Davidson's book; the pseudonymous owner/trainer who wrote this seems to have an especially jaundiced eye towards at least some of his compatriots (but then, I guess that's to be expected from a writer; the satisfied ones don't speak up much).<br />Still, taken with a grain of salt, it's a fun little read. Don't expect to enrich your handicapping knowledge in any practical way, if you've read more than three or four handicapping books that have come out since the sixties, but you can get a quick overview of some of the things that go on in the morning most fans don't have a clue about. ***	2003-10-30

Fine, 1996)<br />William Peter Blatty, the guy who made being a priest and a novelist cool years  before Andrew Greeley, released two of the outright finest novels of the  seventies, The Exorcist and Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane, both of which were  made into equally excellent movies. Demons Five, Exorcists Nothing is, according to the jacket, loosely based on Blatty's travails in getting those  two films (and a third, What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?, a light sixties  comedy probably best forgotten) made. What it actually is is a painful showcase of how far the mighty can fall.<br />DFEN is like being in a therapy session with a crashing bore who thinks that the best way to get your attention is to name-drop, and who is so self-absorbed that he believes talking about himself is all anyone will care about. And I could say that it's a mark of Blatty's writing ability that his narrator is so loathsome. But when the character is too loathsome for the reader to continue reading the book, has the writer accomplished anything? Not by my measuring stick. I'm sure there were some witty jabs at Hollywood here, but they passed me by, I find Americans' obsession with the inner workings of Hollywood about as confusing as I find the British obsession with the Royal Family, and about as useful.

Rita Murphy, Night Flying (Delacorte, 2000)<br />Night Flying is one of those young adult books I happened to pick up by accident because it was in the wrong section at the Case book sale. Glad I did, because this is a fun little book. Murphy never talks down to her audience, refreshing in a YA novel, and better yet, adult readers won't gag on the sentiment. Murphy has a message, but she is as good as any novelist writing for adults (and better than most) at making it palatable.<br />Georgia Hansen is on the eve of her sixteenth birthday. To say her life has been something less than conventional would be an understatement. She lives in a house with only women, none of whom work (all are living off the inheritance of her great-grandfather, an inventor who died with enough to ensure that Georgia's granddaughters will never have to work, either) and all of whom can fly. They do so only under the auspices of very strict rules; each female member of the family adds a rule as time goes on. You can imagine what it's like after a few generations. All, with the exception of wayward Aunt Carmen (who lives across the country), are under the thumb of Georgia's grandmother, a stern and humorless individual whose main goal seems to be making life miserable for her offspring and their offspring.<br />Things start to get messy when Carmen comes back for Georgia's birthday celebration. Georgia immediately forms a love/hate relationship with her, yearning after Carmen's freedom while wondering how someone could so easily slip the bonds of family obligation. (It's not so simple as all that, of course, which Georgia finds out eventually, but so the relationship begins).<br />At its core, this is a pretty simple coming-of-age tale, albeit with magical-realistic elements. Murphy, as with the best of the magical realist authors, never allows the trappings to get in the way of her story, especially her character development. Everyone, major characters and minor, is well developed and has a place in the little sonata that is this novel; not a note falls out of place. The allegory is somewhat obvious (the ability to fly is gained, but suppressed until the sixteenth birthday), and the action in the climax somewhat predictable, but Murphy addresses the subject form a perspective that is not often seen; she's a young adults' author writing from the perspective of a young adult who has a brain of her own, rather than showing a young adult whose beliefs and opinions are just those of a \\"more mature\\" (read: adult) mindset. This, more than anything, lends the book its magical realism; the idea that<br />sometimes the kids really are correct.<br />A fine read. ****a place in the little sonata that is this novel; not a note falls out of place.

Edwin Muir, Scottish Journey (Mainstream Publishing, 1935)<br />Edwin Muir is a pretty good writer, when he sticks to travelogues and abstract philosophy. He doesn't do so in Scottish Journey, though one would think so from the first hundred pages. Scottish Journey is meant as (and was commissioned as) a travelogue, and for the most part, Muir sticks to the template. He writes well of the Scots countryside, and passably of Edinburgh, slipping in bits of philosophy here and there, as is to be expected in any good travelogue. As well, Muir is an extremely quotable writer; his words are clear and precise, and draw excellent pictures in the reader's mind.<br />Muir was, however, an ardent Socialist of the closed-minded sort, as much as he professes otherwise. This affects the book in his long chapter on Glasgow, which he starts with a screed against Industrialism (he always capitalizes the word, I might as well, too) and capitalism. Humorously, he attempts to say that Industrialism, in and of itself, isn't all that bad. He does so in a paragraph that spans almost two and a half pages. The first and last few sentences are of the opinion that Industrialism isn't all that bad. It's the middle hundred or so sentences that shoot the argument in the foot, as he catalogs a list of the horrors he sees in Glasgow. One wonders how it's possible to write all these things and frame them with \\"it's not bad.\\" It would be kind of like a pagan writing the same of the Inquisition, from the evils that Muir ascribes to Industrialism.<br />What's worse, he can't see the forest for the trees. In one breath, he talks about ho a capitalist system can't take population contraction into account; in the next, he's talking about unemployment. And he sees no correlation between the two, or at least none he's willing to admit. At one point, perhaps the book's nadir, he says, while discussing the rise of the Scottish Nationalist party, \\"....If such devotion and fidelity are not to be admired, then all our ideas of morality are mistaken.\\" Leaving it as it is, he infers that no such thing could possibly be true. Yet not five pages later, at the beginning of his chapter on the Highlands, he has little good to say about the morality of a people who are so embarrassed by the twin hills known as the Paps of Jura, one of Scotland's biggest tourist draws at the time, that he couldn't find a postcard that showed them clearly anywhere in the town. One is tempted to see the inconsistencies as a (sub?)conscious undercutting of Muir's own arguments, but nothing else in the book points to it; the man's to solid and straightforward a writer to resort to such tricks.<br />Overall, though, it's worth checking out for the travel writing and the easy read. Just take his political outlook with a grain of salt. ** ½ll our ideas of morality are mistaken.\\" Leaving it as it is, he infers that no such thing could possibly be true.

We'll give Mr. Moore the benefit of the doubt and assume he, and his many rave reviewers are naïve to the present connotations of the term.<br />The Land of Empty Houses is set in post-plague Middle America sometime in the twenty-first century. Daniel, an AWOL Ranger, and Robert, a ZOG-employed assassin, hunt one another over the landscape. Daniel learns from an insane acquaintance that a pretty-eyed woman named Deborah is looking for him. She finds him soon enough, and asks him to guide her to the various tribes that haunt the wasteland now known as the Interior. She is a missionary, a healer, an evangelist, and basically the last Christian west of the Mississippi. Their journey, and how it affects Daniel, is the meat of the novel.<br />As I've come to expect from Christian fiction, the message greatly overwhelms the medium far too many times. Which is something of a shame, because Moore spins himself a fine adventure yarn when he gets going. The book is an easy read, the characters are well-drawn (though Daniel, for all his not being willing to either search his own soul or ask questions about Deborah's mission, seems a little too lucid for his own character), and the pacing is letter perfect. Once you reconcile the idea with the setting-and really, the healer bringing her gifts to the great unwashed is a pretty common fantasy figure-the book has the potential to become an above-average futuristic fantasy. It should be obvious to the well-rounded reader of Christian fiction that it's possible to write a good fantasy novel and still get one's evangelical point across (C.S. Lewis' trilogy that begins with Out of the Silent Planet is an obvious example). Moore, like the vast majority of writers both amateur and professional, is unconvinced of this. He is determined that subtlety is lost on the masses, and in order to get his point across, he must wrap it around a week-old fish stew and hit us in the face with it. Repeatedly.<br />Despite the excess of evangelism (which despite the above does confine itself to a few pages at a time here and there), the book is, quite simply, a fun read. I wish I could say it makes you think, but it would prefer to do your thinking for you. If you're looking for good Christian allegory that's exceptionally presented, you're better off with Lewis, Mauriac, or even Tolkein; if you want to turn your brain off and relax a while, and can allow the evangelism to roll off your back, Moore's just the ticket for a good adventure tale. ** ½ntasy novel and still get one's evangelical point across (C.S.

Michael Moorcock, Wizardry and Wild Romance (Gollancz, 1987)<br />Michel Moorcock would be, it seems, the obvious choice to produce a critical work on epic fantasy. After all, he's written more of it than jut about any living author, or he had at the time this book was commissioned, ten years before its release, after the publication of his article \\"Epic Pooh\\" in 1977. (\\"Epic Pooh,\\" revised, appears as chapter five here, and is one of the true gems of this book.) Still an excellent choice, as most of the similarly prolific writers who have emerged in the shadow of Moorcock lack the wit and originality he displays in novel after novel.<br />Interestingly, this is one of his main criticisms of the fantasy genre overall, not just in the moderns but going back to the earliest days of epic fantasy. The book, which is far more a survey than a critical analysis, strikes a Paul DeMan-esque note in its willingness (perhaps too much willingness) to turn many of fantasy's sacred cows into shish kebab. What is refreshing about Moorcock is that, unlike most critics, he is always willing to suggest a good number of alternatives for each piece of overwrought, mindless fluff the public is willing to take to heart. (Moorcock seems to have a special circle in Hell reserved for the Inklings, the chief fantasists of which were J. R. R. Tolkein and C. S. Lewis, both of whom Moorcock roundly despises; he spends more column inches disparaging Narnia and Middle Earth than all the other writers he castigates combined.)<br />One wonders, idly, why a survey draws as much money as it does these days. I could probably pay a month's rent auctioning off my copy of this, a first edition/first printing. Odd, since the volume barely gets a few lines into page one hundred fifty before it reaches its conclusion. But mine is not to reason why. It's not worth the incredible sums it fetches from booksellers these days, but as a jumping-off point for readers of fantasy who are looking for ways to branch out into wider genre-specific reading, it's a pretty darned fine piece of work.<br />Most of Moorcock's jaundiced views on epic fantasy could apply to all types of literature, which is at the same time both the book's main strength and its weakness. One expects, when reading a survey, to see the ways that the subject's lineage relates to what has come before and what has come after (see Eliade's wonderful Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy for perhaps the finest extant example of how to write a survey on a particular subject), but Moorcock seems to have the underlying belief that writing in a particular genre should have the same strengths and weaknesses as writing in any other, or in writing that is genreless or transcends its genre. To some extent this is true; the best fantasy writers, like the best writers of most genres, do transcend what the hacks are doing and make their work into literature. Where Moorcock goes slightly wrong, though, is in not delineating the transcendent from the more satisfying genre tales. He gives equal weight to, for example, Terry Pratchett (whose work, while parodic, is still very much genre fiction) and Ursula K. LeGuin (who is the very definition of an author who transcends any genre in which she chooses to apply herself). Perhaps he is expecting the reader to be able to discern which is which. Not an unreasonable expectation, if you assume your audience is as widely read in the genre as you are. I doubt many fantasy readers, or for that matter many academics, are as widely-read in their chosen fields as Moorcock, who tosses out the names and critical overviews of fantasy works going back to the pre-Romantic period that have been out of print for a few hundred years as if he'd assigned them the week before while teaching a class on fantasy literature, and we are all expected to go down to the University bookstore and pick up copies of them. Would that we could.<br />Still, as an overview of what's out there, where both the aspiring fantasy reader and the aspiring fantasy writer should be looking to find the stuff that really is worth being influenced by, despite its age Wizardry and Wild Romance is still the definitive survey on epic fantasy. It'd be nice to see a second edition. I, for one, would love to see what Moorcock thinks of, say, Philip Pullman, Terry Goodkind, or Neil Gaiman. But the recommendations in here should be enough to keep me hunting down obscure titles for the next decade, and the approach he takes to epic fantasy is a witty and readable one. ****spiring fantasy reader and the aspiring fantasy writer should be looking to find the stuff that really is worth being influenced by, despite its age Wizardry and Wild Romance is still the definitive survey on epic fantasy.

Kiernan, Candles for Elizabeth (MM Publishing, 1998)<br />MM Publishing, aka Meisha Merlin Publications, has quietly become one of the driving forces in publishing the cutting edge in fantasy and horror. Fantasy fans will probably recognize the name; the same company put out the painfully expensive (and just as gorgeous) limited editions of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels a few years back, but their origins were not nearly so bold. Candles for Elizabeth, a chapbook-sized short story collection from uberauthor Cait Kiernan, was one of their first offerings. And damn and blast, is it a fine one.<br />Kiernan is one of the new generation of \\"horror of absence\\" authors, a realm populated by such luminaries as Patrick McGrath, Kathe Koja, and Lucius Shepard. While Koja takes her best inspiration from Andre Breton, Shepard worships at the altar of H. Rider Haggard, and McGrath has spent more time ('twould seem) browsing through the works of Agatha Christie, Kiernan's influence is the most logical for a genre like this--Sartre and his contemporaries. The dreck being spewed out by such hallowed authors as Bret Easton Ellis and Jay McInerney is not the new generation of existentialist fiction. Cait Kiernan is.<br />If Sartre were alive and writing Roads to Freedom today, one could probably find the characters in these three stories in the fringes. They wouldn't be main characters; Sartre was too wrapped up in the petit bourgeois to have given these folks more than a couple of paragraphs of screen time. But he would have been fascinated with them, just as we are today; the homeless, the outcasts, those who live on the fringes of society, taking nothing from it, but willing to give in return if anyone would allow them to. Poppy Z. Brite writes in her introduction to this collection that the characters therein \\"would still love to believe in magic and happiness, but don't dare let themselves.\\" Indeed.<br />In \\"The Last Child of Lir,\\" three homeless twentysomethings, one of them dying of an unspecified disease (Kiernan hints that it might be pneumonia), are referred to an abandoned warehouse by a crack-addicted acquaintance as a place to spend a few days out of the cold. \\"A Story for Edward Gorey\\" is also of the homeless-person variety, this one a nineteen-year-old butch lesbian obsessed with a purple curtain in an upstairs window, and the things she finds when she finally is allowed to venture behind it. \\"Postcards from the King of Tides,\\" the most \\"traditional\\" horror story in the bunch (it bears the scars of Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes,\\" by way of Koja?s The Cipher) doesn't tell us if its protagonists are homeless, as they're on a roadtrip. In all three cases, the events of the stories are designed to give us, though not the characters themselves, insight into their own humanity more than they are to scare. That what they find in their dreams and introspections is not that much different than what the characters in such would-be existentialist writers as Ellis find is beside the point (and, in fact, becomes somewhat admirable given the method of delivery); it?s how they come about the knowledge, and whether they know enough to grasp what they see, that counts.<br />One of the things that makes Kiernan's characters so attractive in the horror milieu is that they're not your typical horror story protagonist; these are the kids horror fans have been waiting for for thirty years, the ones who grew up in a post-Night of the Living Dead world. They're not scared by the usual mean-and-nasties, as (for some odd reason) most horror story protagonists still are. Kiernan's characters, like those of Koja, McGrath, Thomas Ligotti, et al. before her, are scared by what's inside, not what's outside.

Takashi Matsuoka, Cloud of Sparrows (Delacorte, 2002)<br />Takashi Matsuoka's debut novel, Cloud of Sparrows, is quite a treat. The similarities between the code of the Samurai and the code of the Wild West gunfighter have been done before, of course, but never within such an elaborate framework. The novel begins on New Year's Day 1861, with the arrival of three American missionaries to Akaoka. Akaoka's present Great Lord, Genji, has a reputation as an effeminate dilettante, keeps company with Japan's most beautiful geisha, has a completely insane uncle who's locked up in a monastery after he murdered his family, is marked for assassination by the head of the Shogun's secret police, and sees prophetic visions, like one member of every generation in his clan. Or does he? It might be a ruse to keep the natives from getting restless.<br />And that's all within the first few pages. The reader is advised to sit back and get ready for the ride.<br />Despite everything that's going on in those first few pages, there's a slowness to them; for about fifty pages or so, as we meet and get to know the characters, the novel progresses at a quite leisurely pace. Don't let this put you off. The book picks up quickly enough and the rest of its four-hundred-odd pages fly by. All that background does have a use.<br />If there is one nit I can pick with this book, it's in the character of Emily, one of the missionaries. As with all fantasies (though this book is far more historical novel; the only real fantasy element in it is Genji's family's gift of prophecy), there is a romantic component. Emily, betrothed to the head missionary, stays quite in character for most of the novel; towards the end, however, she breaks character rather radically. Takashi does his best to hide this (most of it is done offstage), but there's still a niggling in the mind that a book with such well-drawn, true characters takes such an easy way out. In the greater scheme of things, however, this is a minor enough detail when held up against the rest of the novel.<br />Well worth looking into. ****ough detail when held up against the rest of the novel.<br />Well worth looking into. ****	2003-09-11

Michael Moorcock, The Ice Schooner (Berkley, 1966)<br />Michael Moorcock is a singularly prolific writer; the number of novels and short stories that has flowed from the man's pen is almost unforgivable. Over the course of the last twenty years, I've read roughly a hundred of Moorcock's novels, maybe half again the same number of short stories. So when I say that The Ice Schooner may be Moorcock's finest hour, take it with as much salt as necessary, given that I've read such a small amount of his output.<br />The Ice Schooner is Moorcock's high-fantasy retelling of Moby Dick, but without the two-hundred-odd-page \\"how to kill, skin, and eat a whale\\" interruption in Melville's bloated tome. Actually, it's not so much a retelling (as was, say, Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres a retelling of King Lear) as it is a retooling. Instead of a big whale, Konrad Arflane, the book's main character, is on a quest to find the ancient, legendary city of New York. (One wonders if Pierre Boulle read this in the year between its publication and his writing of Planet of the Apes.) The quest comes not from his obsession with the city, but with another's obsession. But still, when it comes right down to it, Arflane and Ahab are more similar than just in name. Certain supporting characters are also recognizable (the similarities run deeper than name, too, in Urquart and Queequeg, and dandyish Manfred has more than a bit of Ishmael about him). The conscious warping of Moby Dick alone would be enough to make this novel stand out with the litt-rat-chaw crowd, where most of Moorcock's stuff is so easily dismissed by most of them. But it's also romance in the finest sense of the word, as the word was used back in the days when Melville was writing. Burly whalemen putting their lives in danger every time they harpoon a whale (and whales do get harpooned here, though not in the living detail rendered them by Melville), star-crossed lovers, and Manfred in the middle of it all, happy to be adventuring, despite (or perhaps because of) the adventure's possibly fatal nature.<br />A word on the star-crossed lovers. Moorcock has a long tradition in his novels of the traditional love story; even when things look bleakest for his protagonists, their lovers are beacons of hope, no matter how distant. He turns his (and romance's) convention on its head in this novel; from the moment the two lovers are introduced to one another, the air of foreboding in the novel palpably thickens. You know as well as they do things are not going to turn out right for the two of them. For the veteran reader of Moorcock, this is a refreshing change from the norm, especially in the Eternal Champion novels. (Moorcock neophytes may take a different view, as this particular pair of star-crossed lovers is of the most traditional sort: adulterers. And, as we all know, adulterers can never get away with it.)<br />The one failing the book has is in its ending. The book was originally serialized in a magazine, which may account for the rather rapid fantasy-clich&eacute; ending. Still, despite the annoying deus-ex-machina approach Moorcock takes in the last chapter, he does remain true to his characters; Arflane and what little of his company remains when they get to the final confrontation with the white whale-oops, excuse me, New York-act exactly as one who has come to know them through these pages would expect them to. Not that this doesn't keep Moorcock from throwing in a final, unexpected twist or two at the end. Not all the loose threads get neatly tied. (This is a good thing.)<br />Those of you, and I know you are legion, who have yet to pick up a Michael Moorcock novel, this may be the finest place you could possibly start. All the brooding grandeur of high fantasy without any of the parody of, say, the Kane of Old Mars novels, and far less of the otherworldliness to be found in the Eternal Champion books. Moorcock turns inward here, as Melville did in the book that he wrote as atonement for Moby-Dick (Pierre, ironically Melville's most hated novel by critics and fans alike; at times I think I'm the only person on Earth who thinks it's the best book he ever published), and what he finds is utterly fabulous. **** ½y-Dick (Pierre, ironically Melville's most hated novel by critics and fans alike; at times I think I'm the only person on Earth who thinks it's the best book he ever published), and what he finds is utterly fabulous. **** ½	2003-09-11

Nancy Ann Watanabe, Love Eclipsed: Joyce Carol Oates' Faustian Moral Vision (University Press of America, 1998)<br />The very fact of Oates' Nobel Prize nomination in 1998 is in dispute, as the Nobel Committee stresses again and again that lists of nominees are never given, only winners; Celestial Timepiece, one of the most complete Oates sites on the Net, tells us \\"It has been reported numerous times in books, and in newspaper and journal articles, that JCO has been nominated or has been on the 'short list' several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature. I have yet to locate a report that bothers to cite the source of their information.\\" Whether or not Oates has been nominated, though, Nancy Ann Watanabe's 1998 book Love Eclipsed is dedicated to the Nobel Committee.<br />Seemingly coming to research Oates thanks to a shared interest the two have in Yeats, upon whom Oates has written a number of critical articles (one of Watanabe's other books, Beloved Image, is on Yeats), Watanabe seems both attracted and repelled by her subject, but the attraction wins out. Early on, she wishes aloud that she could have worked with expurgated versions of Oates' novels that cut out the rampant profanity, yet more than once she notes that said profanity has its place in the work (and is usually a symbolic point that strengthens whatever case Watanabe happens to be making at the time). This odd dichotomy is a rare occurrence in a critical work; a look behind the work at the author. It's one of the things that keeps Love Eclipsed compelling.<br />Not that any connoisseur of Joyce Carol Oates won't find much to savor in this slim (less than two hundred pages) critical overview, covering works from Oates' second novel, A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), to the Rosamond-Smith-penned You Can't Catch Me (1995), and touching on a good number of stories and novels in between. While many of the facets of the recurrent themes Oates touches on in her works are easily connected by the casual reader, Watanabe goes farther in, linking the works of Oates to their historical precursors, comparing the author (rightly) to such previous lights as Shakespeare, Goethe, and Rousseau.<br />Watanabe's treatment of Oates centers on two different lines of thought; the minor one (a surprise given the title) is on Oates' characters' recurrent hubris, the quest for omniscience in a world that values ignorance, and the downfalls that occur because of it. Her main focus, however, is astronomical; she looks at the Greek symbols of Sun, Moon, and Earth, and their meanings in ancient Greek literature, and maps these meanings onto Oates? characters in such a way as to trace Oates' pedigree back as far as Western literature will allow. The end result is not only a book that portrays Ms. Oates as one of the finest American novelists of the twentieth century (again, rightly), but one who fits in with classic writers going back three thousand years and more. The research is well-done, with the attention to detail a critical work like this calls for (and is lacking in more and more books of this stripe these days); this is, in a phrase, the good stuff.<br />The book's main failing is not Watanabe's, which makes it all the more annoying. University Press of America is obviously in dire need of a good proofreader/editor, or the person who does it for them (and there must be only one) must have been suffering one nasty hangover the day this manuscript hit his desk. It?s rife with spelling and grammatical errors that distract the reader at least once per page, especially toward the end of the book. I wondered more than once if, assuming the Committee really was considering Oates for the prize, whether the shoddy editing of Love Eclipsed was any influence on them. I certainly hope not (though the relative merits of Oates and eventual 1998 winner Jose Saramago really make me wonder even more).<br />Be that as it may, if one can look past the errors in proofreading and printing, and if you will forgive me the necessity of a truly awful pun, Love Eclipsed is a garden of earthly (and celestial) delights for the Joyce Carol Oates fan, and a book which is capable of handing the open-minded reader a deeper understanding of one of the five or six finest working authors in America today. Very highly recommended. **** 1/2you will forgive me the necessity of a truly awful pun, Love Eclipsed is a garden of earthly (and celestial) delights for the Joyce Carol Oates fan, and a book which is capable of handing the open-minded reader a deeper understanding of one of the five or six finest working authors in America today.

Freeze, Windows Game Programming with Visual Basic and DirectX (Que, 2002)<br />First and foremost, a warning. Freeze's book, despite its publication date, deals exclusively in Visual Basic 6. If you're using VB.NET, a lot of this stuff is going to cause you to wonder what on earth Freeze is on about. I strongly suggest reading Keith Sink's DirectX 8 and Visual Basic Development in conjunction with this, and asking a lot of questions on a lot of VB.NET tech support mailing lists. (Microsoft's documentation on how to go from VB6-VB.NET with DirectX is not nonexistent, but it is such that nonexistent would have been better.) Given that .NET had already been in prerelease for over a year by this book's publication, one would think that, at the very least, the publisher would have made it very plain somewhere on the cover that the book dealt in a technology that's not compatible with the next generation of the language. An unforgivable oversight, especially if you happen to spend the full retail price for a copy of this book.<br />That aside, Freeze's book is quite good in the way it introduces the reader to the new, and largely esoteric, combination of Visual Basic and DirectX (the latter technology was exclusively the realm of C++ programmers until 2001, when DX8 began to include VB wrappers). He's not afraid to use repetition to get his point across, and he does so in a laid-back atmosphere that's quite different from what one sees in most how-to programming manuals.<br />Freeze teaches the VB/DX intersection through the programming of a SimCity-style games called SwimMall, which is in and of itself at least worth a discounted copy of the book. Needless to say it's not a commercial-quality game, as one would expect from a single person programming such a thing while under the pressure of a book deadline. But the routines and ideas therein are just the thing to spark the imaginations of novice game programmers; no matter what genre a person is working in, there are certainly routines here that will help a programmer out in various ways. Much of this code is easily ported to any other type of game framework.<br />Very good stuff. Just remember the admonition in the first paragraph if you're working with .NET and haven't used VB before. (Actually, I recommend Sink in conjunction with this book anyway; the atmospheres of the two are a pleasant mesh, and when you can't find a niggling piece of information you need in one, the other is sure to have it.) *** ½ere are certainly routines here that will help a programmer out in various ways.

Rex Feral, Hit Man (Paladin Press, 1992)<br /><br />The incredible amount of attention Hit Man received after the 1993 James Perry case has blown the book way, way out of proportion, mostly because of first amendment issues. Paladin settled a lawsuit out of court by promising to pull all extant copies of Hit Man off the shelf and no longer offer the book for sale; this, of course, did nothing but garner huge amounts of free publicity for a book very few people had ever heard of from a press very few people had ever heard of, splash both book and press across the pages of newspapers across America, and immediately send the price skyrocketing on the collectors' market. (Copies of the book destroyed by Paladin--and this isn't the usual \\"strip\\" destroying, the books were actually torn in half horizontally--regularly go for upwards of $50 on ebay, well over three times the original cover price.) Another, even more harmful (from the lawsuit's perspective) side effect: the book is now out of copyright, and is thus easily found free online with a quick Yahoo search. What a great way to suppress a book: get it far more publicity than it would have ever had, and make it available free to any twelve-year-old who knows how to work a search engine!<br /><br />Many already existing reviews on the book, and a good deal of commentary inspired by the court case, consider it a joke. (One wag goes so far as to suggest \\"Rex Feral\\" is actually a romance author, judging by \\"his\\" attitudes towards women in the book's last couple of chapters.) If so, it's a pretty good one; the author has taken a good number of pieces of data that one can find in your average David Morrell or Ian Fleming novel, put them all in one place, and constructed a how-to book on the art of covert murder for hire. As Reason columnist Jacob Sullum says in his rant on the idiocy of the lawsuit, \\"Still, it's doubtful that people like James Perry were the main audience for Hit Man. If they were, somehow the thousands of murders they committed have gone unnoticed.\\" No joke.<br /><br />This leads to another, more interesting (and sinister) hypothesis, and note that I have no evidence at all to back me up on this: Rex Feral really is a hit man. He wrote Hit Man to eliminate the possible competition. (After all, how much work is really out there, per year, for a contract killer?) Any reader of murder mysteries and espionage books is going to chuckle at the impossible complexity of some of Feral's supposed methods; what better way to get earnest young would-be hit men out of the way than having them spend weeks working on homemade silencers while the pros from Dover are out doing the actual job and collecting the fee? (And lord knows that homemade silencer would be, how shall we say, distinctive, when pieces were found.

Any reader of murder mysteries and espionage books is going to chuckle at the impossible complexity of some of Feral's supposed methods; what better way to get earnest young would-be hit men out of the way than having them spend weeks working on homemade silencers while the pros from Dover are out doing the actual job and collecting the fee?

Keith Sink, DirectX8 and Visual Basic Development (Sams, 2002)<br />It's 2003, now, and the world is slowly migrating to Microsoft's .NET standard (well, those who aren't using Linux, anyway). Here's a prediction, built on past observation of the process: companies who have been developing apps in Visual Basic for years will get copies of VB.NET, expecting a no-brainer transition from one to the other. Their programmers will import the programs, and immediately die of massive aneurysms at seeing the number of errors (especially the number of seemingly unfixable errors, if you happen to be programming in DirectX or any other API where classes expose other modules, which is verboten in .NET's \\"managed code\\" environment). This will leave the companies stranded and unwilling to move to .NET. They will be stuck behind those companies whose programmers have read DirectX8 and Visual Basic Development.<br />Keith Sink's book was written at the perfect time, and he often goes step by step through processes both writing code for VB6 and for VB.NET, making the book an invaluable resource for .NET VB programmers who are converting VB6 programs (or who are programming in an area where there are far more VB6 books than .NET books, which is, well, just about every area you can think of). Even if you're not planning on using DirectX, seeing the way things transition from one language to the other in one aspect of the language should give you a clue on how to make the transitions in other areas.<br />Sink doesn't mention at any point that there's actually a Microsoft.DirectX library in .NET. But then, neither does Microsoft's documentation. Nor does its upgrade wizard. (I only found about it after asking a random question on a message board.) So it's hard to fault Sink for something that, at the time he was writing, may have not been in the framework, or may have been considered an unsolvable problem. That aside, Sink's book is, for the reasons mentioned above, the best I've read to date about Visual Basic .NET at all. For such a specialized book to be so generally useful puts it in a class by itself. ****o date about Visual Basic .NET at all.

Marcia Muller, Trophies and Dead Things (Mysterious Press, 1990)<br />Sharon McCone (in her tenth appearance) has what seems like a routine probate; a well-known Northern California activist and Vietnam War protestor (and acquaintance of her boss), Perry Hilderley, has died. While going through his things, McCone finds a superseded copy of his will, disinheriting his (divorced) wife and their sons, and leaving all of his assets to be divided equally among four people who seemingly have no connection at all to Hilderley. Who are they, and what connection did they have to him?<br />Muller is often referred to as the founding mother of the hardboiled female detective. All well and good, except there's not much hardboiled here. (My definition: a hardboiled detective is in true physical danger at any point during the story. Otherwise, it's a cozy.) Granted, everyone around McCone is in danger at least once, and some of them wind up dead, but she takes an almost Miss Marple attitude towards this at times; let's get them out of danger, give them a cup of tea, and get back to solving this mystery.<br />Not that a well-written cozy isn't a lot of fun, and this is a well-written cozy. It does get a bit slow now and again, but like the mysteries of Robert Parker, the McCone novels are that wonderful type of series where the background soap-opera-style info merges so seamlessly with what's going on that you can hop in at any point in the series and be caught up on what's gone on before in a few pages, tops. And it doesn't get in the way of the present story, which is the all-important rule in writing series novels.<br />If the book does have a failing, and this is something that the individual reader will have to decide, it's in the mystery itself. There really isn't much of a mystery, and Muller lays that on the table from the get-go. The main question here is about what the four beneficiaries of Hilderley's will have in common, and there are enough hints in the opening pages to give you an idea of what will be in the closing ones. But getting there is half the fun, and Muller gives us a wonderful cast of characters to ride with. In other words, with not much mystery and not much danger, Trophies and Dead Things has more of a feel of Jane Smiley than Agatha Christie to it; I had no problems at all with that. Others may disagree. But whatever it is, it's fun. ***to give you an idea of what will be in the closing ones.

Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Herland (Dover, 1909)<br />I always found it odd that Gilman, a prolific writer during her life, had become so obscure less than a century later as to be remembered for only a single short story, \\"The Yellow Wallpaper.\\" Now, having had the distinct displeasure of having read a second piece of Gilman's writing, I have to wonder if that obscurity isn't well-deserved.<br />Herland is everything that \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" is not. It is boring, overly expository, dry as dust, and most importantly, didactic. It is didactic in the same way your history teacher who spoke in a monotone is didactic; you end up hating the delivery so much that whatever's being said gets tuned out along with the noise. It doesn't help that Herland is a vastly inferior knockoff of such nineteenth-century fantastic-journey novels as Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, James DeMille's A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder, or Doyle's The Lost World. All three of those novels had the same generally socially conscious bent as does Herland, and held up a dystopian land to our own to show us where our own civilization is lacking. But all three of them (even Poe, who despised the novel form and never wrote in it again) had a basic understanding of the structure of the adventure novel and how to keep things moving while passing along their message about what's wrong with society. Gilman lacks this facility, and what's worse, she's of that strip of author who feels that, in order to make sure the message is clearly heard by the reader, she must go out of her way and add a clarifying sentence. After all, the reader is far too stupid to pick up on inferences.<br />The popularity of The Yellow Wallpaper and the obscurity of Gilman's other work cannot, of course, be dismissed as understood after reading only one of her other works. But Herland certainly doesn't have me straining at the leash to go looking for anything else Gilman wrote. Uniformly awful. (zero)	2003-08-25

Sue Doro, Heart, Home, and Hard Hats (Midwest Villages and Voices, 1988)<br />Especially since I consciously increased the number of pages of poetry I read per year in 2000, I have read, and reviewed, some incorrigibly awful books. I have read things that would (and probably did) make magazine editors groan aloud in pain that only found their way into print via self-publishing. I have read published work that contains nary a shred of redeeming value to qualify it as \\"poetry\\" and not nearly enough substance to qualify it as \\"prose.\\" I truly believed I had, if not taken in all the bad poetry there is (because Lord knows there is far more than enough bad poetry to go around, and were the whole Barn to do nothing but read 100 pages of awful verse per day, we would not cover a tenth of all the awful verse extant in the world in our lifetimes, to be sure), at least plumbed the inaugurable depths. I had hoped I would never see another book as bad as those by John Joseph Hughes, Rod McKuen, Jim Morrison, Susan Polis Schutz, Brandon Watt, or many other equally painful writers of mind-numbing, ear-shattering elephant dung that passes for poetry.<br />Adding more hard evidence to the old saw that no matter how far down you go, there's always another step, this month I encountered the writings of Sue Doro. And realized that even on his worst days, Roger Lewin couldn't be this bad if he tried.<br />(Warning: examples follow. Those of weak stomach may want to stop reading now.)<br />It's not enough that there is no sense of language or word choice here. Not enough that there is no sense of grammar, no idea where line breaks should go, not a single line that looked as if it either underwent any revision at all or that the author does any revising in her head before setting this stuff down on paper. Not enough that it all comes out sounding like (bad) essay writing chopped up into lines to make it look artistic (here's a tip: chopping it up into little lines doesn't make it SOUND any more like poetry).<br />\\"i begin to feel responsible<br />i can't help feeling responsible,<br />not for the storm,<br />but for the fact that I AM NOT [sic]<br />having difficulty flying...\\"<br />(\\"Motherdream\\")<br />But no, dear reader, that is not all. Of course not. The title should have tipped you off.  No, despite all that, we have not yet delved into the true core of what makes this so awful. (As if the above weren't enough to put you off a couple of meals.) No, this is \\"poetry\\" with a message. And were Marshall McLuhan still alive, I have little doubt he would hold this book up at speeches as the perfect, quintessential example of what happens when the message overrides the medium: art not only suffers, but gets shoved into the corner after a lifetime of drunken abuse, without the weaponry to strike back, so utterly defeated it can do nothing but commit a kind of merciful suicide as a way of deserting the premises altogether. And here we have eighty-five pages of work that art has, in fact, utterly abandoned:<br />\\"I am trying to register<br />as accurately as possible<br />trying to record this communal fever<br />we are burning<br />burning<br />burning<br />Capitalists<br />beware!\\"<br />(\\"Fever\\")<br />I should probably add that the same domicile has also been deserted by any consistent grammar, as well.<br />If the material were just bad, I wouldn't be as absolutely stunned as I am with the depths to which this book sinks. But it's not just bad, it's PUBLISHED bad. There's a list of credits on the acknowledgements page that (if you changed the magazine names, I guess, because any magazine that publishes this stuff is one I'm sure quality poets stay far, far away from) most published poets would envy being able to put into a book. Twenty publications (nineteen magazines and an anthology, as far as I can tell). One assumes by the language some of them took more than one poem. If you buy this book, buy it to mark those twenty publications in your Poets'Market as places to avoid is probably worth the price you'll pay.<br />This is not just the worst book I have read this year-this is the strongest of candidates for the single worst book I have ever read. (A reasonable estimate would be fifteen thousand books over the course of my lifetime, with maybe a fifth of that being books and anthologies of poetry.) It has absolutely no artistic value, is morally and ethically ill-informed, and shows no sense of regard for, much less love of, the language used to create it. This is one of those rare books I will not donate to Goodwill nor put up on a give-away list; I will burn it, instead. I wouldn't inflict such a book on my worst enemy, let alone a total stranger shopping at Goodwill who may be discovering poetry for the first time. I give it zero, because that's as low as my scale goes, but if I had negative, this would be the first book ever to receive negative stars.is probably worth the price you'll pay.<br />This is not just the worst book I have read this year-this is the strongest of candidates for the single worst book I have ever read.

Eavan Boland, The Lost Land (Norton, 1998)<br />Irish poet Eavan Boland may be one of the most critically acclaimed and much-lauded unknown poets in the world. She's served two terms as the Director of the Creative Writing Program at Stanford University, won the Lannan Award, curated poetry exhibits, published eight books of poetry and one of prose to the delight of critics everywhere, had poetry appear in all three of the great triumvirate of American poetry magazines (The New Yorker, Poetry, and The American Poetry Review), and yet, somehow, when the name comes up, even many of the most astute and well-read poets cock their heads like dogs trying to learn a new command. Why this is, I've no idea. But it could have something to do with the poetry itself.<br />Don't get me wrong. Obviously, if the editors of the Three Best Poetry Magazines in America are thrilled with Boland's poetry, the rest of us would be heathenish rabble to criticize. And yet, while reading through The Lost Land, it dawned on me that Boland likes to use short sentences. Very short. A lot. In every poem. (You get the idea.) Her subject matter is almost always thought-provoking and fresh, the presentation of them impressionist, minimal, and often sublime. But then some those short sentences that transform the thing from a gentle flow into the rapids.<br />\\"I have two daughters.<br />They are all I ever wanted from the earth.<br />Or almost all.\\"<br />(\\"The Lost Land\\")<br />It's as if Boland is trying to replicate a pattern of speech that grates on the nerves. Which, in small doses, can be a powerful statement, but in a book-length collection, where it's used frequently, it does get annoying.<br />Still, that's not a reason to completely disparage the book. Boland's work does have a compelling nature to it, a method of expression that keeps the pages turning and is, in fact, quite impressive. With a bit better flow control, this would be perfect stuff. ** ½	2003-08-11

Vonna Adrian, A Gaggle of Verses (Bits Press, 1988)<br />It's especially painful reading this particular collection of Doggerel so soon after Richard Howard's Untitled Subjects. Adrian touches on many of the same historical personages as does Howard, inviting comparison between them. Which is roughly akin to comparing a three-year-old's stick figure drawings to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.<br />This is painful, horrible stuff. It might be salvageable were the rhyme scheme to be paired with an excellent sense of enjambment and rhythm a la Thomas Hardy, or even a strong sense of the organic a la Hopkins and his sprung rhythm. But this has neither, and most of these poems land not even with a thud, but with a kind of wet smack, on the pavement:<br />\\"Nature he loved, in verse he said it,<br />and yet to his discredit<br />he hurled the cook into the garden.<br />True, he begged Dame Nature's pardon,<br />Clasping his white impetuous head:<br />`God!

Joe Coomer, Apologizing to Dogs (Scribner's, 1999)<br />Apologizing to Dogs does, finally, take off. If you're fifty pages into it and ready to throw it into the fire, take heed; it does eventually start going somewhere. The problem is, it takes so long to get there.<br />Apologizing to Dogs is, ultimately, the story of Worth Row, a series of antique shops in Fort Worth, Texas, and its inhabitants (including the stray dog to whom one character apologizes). Worth Row has stood for years, with inhabitants coming and going, all along the way building up secrets, lies, blackmail, and other various oddities. But then a stray dog digs for a bone, and the radio reports a tornado warning, and it all starts to unravel like one big sweater. It's a small premise for a book, but a good one, and it's been done many times in the past. The problem with Apologizing to Dogs is that Coomer tries to pack just too much into the book without it really needing to be there; it's almost as if he thought that if he focused on a few main plotlines, the book would be too short, so he added a few more for filler. The end result is that a good portion of the book, especially during the first three quarters, feels like filler. Some sections drag on forever, while others flit by like nobody's business. Once it all comes together eighty or ninety pages form the end, everything falls into place and this becomes a fine comedic (in a deadpan way) novel. It's just getting through the first bit that's likely to alienate some readers. ** 1/2	2003-08-11

It's refreshing (to say the least) to find a writer of good old-fashioned haunted house novels these days; this is probably the first (aside from Thorne's own Bad Things) I've come across, chronologically, since Paula Trachtman published Disturb Not the Dream some twenty years ago, that doesn't have some sort of post-atomic ecological message to shove in my face or some sort of hardboiled-mystery natural explanation. (We'll conveniently overlook Barbara Michaels. After all, she writes romances, delicious as they are, not horror novels.) And that, alone, is enough reason for me to automatically slap above-average status on Miz Thorne's every word.<br />The only problem, really, and I will be the first to say this may be my fault for reading two of Thorne's novels so close together, is that the words seem remarkably similar between Haunted and Bad Things. We have a single (male) parent moving to California with child(ren) who are sure (we know, as the author winks at us) to be placed in the path of great danger, though the parent doesn't know this. There's a friend at home who, at a moment of crisis, must come out to assist with everything, and the child(ren) has/ve an obsession with taking the car and the Visa card into town (because, of course, we're out in the middle of nowhere). The ghosties, ghoulies, and long-leggetie beasties can't be seen by the rest of us most of the time, but they materialize in order to convince the townsfolk they do exist, thanks to some mechanism that forces them farther into our reality. Etc.<br />Formula? Absolutely. It's switch-the-characters as much as Barbara Cartland. But Thorne is a far finer writer than Cartland (or Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts, Cartland's living heirs o the multibillion dollar romance market), and at least the characters being switched out are not carbon copies of one another, despite their similar situations. The differences in character from book to book are enough to keep the reader going, which is necessary through some of the book's slower points. (The protagonist here is a writer, and Thorne tells us he's always somewhat nervous through the first half of his books, then towards the end starts writing obsessively, often finishing them in a few weeks. Haunted, it should surprise no one, is paced exactly this way.)<br />Thorne does Bad Things one better here, with the inclusion of a nasty erotic side to this particular ghost that one couldn't introduce to the Green Man in Bad Things (at least, not without ludicrous chuckles from the audience). This is balanced out by the somewhat slower plot development in the first half of the novel, but once it takes off, it most certainly takes off. The book becomes more compelling as each page turns, until the last hundred pages, which demand to be devoured in one gulp.<br />Haunted and Bad Things are pretty equal in quality, and Haunted only gets half a star less because I read it second. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. Just don't read them back to back, or the similarities will throw you off. *** 1/2cter from book to book are enough to keep the reader going, which is necessary through some of the book's slower points.

Kaye Gibbons, Ellen Foster (Vintage, 1987)<br />So I finished this novel coming up on two weeks ago now, and I've been letting it marinate. I don't normally do that; I try to write reviews within a couple of days to keep everything fresh in my head. But when I finished Ellen Foster, all the voice in my head said was \\"...I don't know...\\", so I figured it's get clearer as I spent some time mulling the book over. But here we are two weeks later, and when it comes right down to it, I still don't know.<br />I wasn't aware this was an Oprah book until I just started doing research for this review (about ten minutes ago), but it's easy to see why. Another entry in the Dysfunction Junction genre, but then, when has Southern fiction not aspired to that great community? Faulkner and McCullers are looking proudly down from heaven at their figurative grandchildren who carry on the tradition. And if this book were nothing more than a study in dysfunction, I'd be able to say `great, it does its job, it's mercifully shorter than most of the tripe Oprah recommends, one of the few she's picked that can be recommended without reservation.\\"<br />But therein lies the problem, Ellen Foster is not just a novel about familial dysfunction. Oh, don't get me wrong, all the good stuff is covered; alcoholic father with incestuous and pedophilic tendencies (and isn't it interesting how those features go together more and more in American dysfunction fiction?), teacher with a heart of gold who wants to save the kid but is enough of a maverick the school fires her, evil \\"stepmother\\" (not literally, in this case), redemption through the church, etc., etc. ad infinitum. And Gibbons handles it all with a deft enough touch that we can put aside the fact that we saw it all in the Brothers Grimm and sit back and enjoy the ride. But Gibbons wants to take us a couple of steps farther. And here, depending on your point of view, is likely where the book is going to either succeed or falter.<br />Gibbons has a strong subtextual level in this book about race, the main reason it gets so many nods In comparison with good old Huck Finn. Ellen (who describes herself as white)'s best friend, Starletta, is black, and Ellen is often making comparisons between her life and Starletta's. Mostly the usual stuff one would expect from an eleven-year-old girl, but every once in a while she shows more adult flashes of insight that resound powerfully within the novel (and it's hard to figure out what the actual timeframe is, but I got the distinct feeling it was after the activists were killed in Mississippi in 1964). She does all this, however, with a different delivery method than most of the rest of the novel. She's not too shy about calling her father and his behavior onto the carpet, or taking about the antics of the characters who represent the archetypes of the evil stepmother and stepsister (an aunt and cousin), but she always seems hesitant when getting into the racial issue. (We don't find out Starletta is black for a few chapters, and Ellen does not mention her own race-or what she believes is her race-until the last chapter). Which is all well and good. It fits with Ellen's character and is part of the clue to the timeframe. However, it also raises nagging questions about Ellen's own race, especially given some of the other clues in the book, and the issue remains ultimately unresolved. How a reader is likely to interpret the book depends, then, on whether the reader is willing to take Ellen at her word (or whether the reader believes Ellen is white, instead of biracial/passing, whatever she says).<br />It is certainly a worthwhile book, and as I've mulled it over the last two weeks I've kicked it up half a star simply because it's stayed fresh in my mind this long. But it seems that such an important issue should have at least been alluded to. *** 1/2as a strong subtextual level in this book about race, the main reason it gets so many nods In comparison with good old Huck Finn.

If you picked this up and couldn't get past the first few pages, press on. Trust me on this.<br />The story revolves around an ensemble of characters, but the central two (who seem to be becoming a detective team, as Ms. Hart's website informs us that she is working on a second novel featuring them) are American expatriate Nora Gavin, who fled to her ancestors' home country after the murder of her sister, and Irish archaeologist Cormac Maguire. The two of them meet at the site of the discovery of a new bog body (an archeological curiosity of natural bogs, in which bodies can stay perfectly preserved for hundreds of years as long as they're not exposed to the air), but this one has a twist; it's not a body, it's only a head. As they're uncovering it, an hysterical local arrives to find out if it's the head of his wife, who went missing a couple of years before. Despite themselves, and for very different reasons, Nora and Cormac find themselves working on the two parallel mysteries of the disappearance of Mina Osborne and her son in the present day and the identity of the head found in the bog.<br />There is a good deal of setup, much of it slow, in the first half of the novel. (This seems to be a common thread in the novels I've been reading recently, for some odd reason.) A little trimming could probably have cut thirty to forty pages of the setup, just by rearranging sentences, and made the book more readable. Thankfully, though, once it gets past the halfway point, Haunted Ground gets more compelling, and by the time I got to the last fifty pages, I was staying up late to keep reading. Because of the differing layers of the mystery, it would have been impossible to tie everything up at once, so the ending may seem a bit drawn-out, but at the end, all of the loose ends are tied, everything is resolved to everyone's satisfaction, and the book has turned out a lot better than the first half presaged.  A very good debut from a promising new author. *** 1/2end, all of the loose ends are tied, everything is resolved to everyone's satisfaction, and the book has turned out a lot better than the first half presaged.

Evangelos Petroutsos, Mastering Visual Basic.NET (Sybex, 2002)<br />It's hard to rate such a multiple-personality book as this one. Much of what is here is in error, or subject to interpretation, at the very least; something unforgivable in a programming book. And yet, when I need a quick reference or a refresher on how to do something basic, this is usually the first place I turn. So there IS some value to it, at least that's the way I see it, but I can't unhesitatingly recommend it for egregious editorial (one assumes) errors.<br />This is certainly a book for those (like me) who have almost no familiarity with Visual Basic. I'd done a little program modifying a few years ago for my company, and had worked with a much, much earlier version of VB (2.0, for those of you who remember the stone age) a ways back, but my development knowledge lies in other areas. Petroutsos' book, combined with my knowledge of C++ and SQL, got me up to speed exceptionally quickly, but non-programmers picking this up as their first programming book are likely going to be extremely frustrated finding errors they don't know how to debug in the published code. But for the programming veteran who's just a novice to Visual Basic, there is likely a lot to be learned from this book. Just watch your step. ** 1/2	2003-08-11

Lorri Jackson, Scat (Oyster Press, 1994)<br />When Lorri Jackson overdosed in 1990, she was just starting to get noticed in the small press world. Then she died, and, well, everything went downhill from there. For a while, at least. The manuscript for Scat, Jackson's third book, was sitting at Oyster Press, unreleased, the victim of financial woes from the press. 1994 saw its release, along with some excellent word-of-mouth publicity and some retrospectives in those magazines which had adopted her as a kind of patron soiled dove during her lifetime, and the short-lived, but heartfelt, Lorri Jackson revival was on. Here we are some ten years later and Lorri Jackson is about as obscure as ever.<br />At the risk of being somewhat profane, Jackson had a whole lot in common with Arthur Rimbaud. Sure, Jackson wrote free verse and Rimbaud wrote formal (though is sometimes credited with being the inventor of modern free verse). However, both were ignorant of, or ignored, he basic rules of poetry while writing, and both had such deep and abiding pools of raw talent that the throwing of the rules to the wind is sometimes no more than a minor annoyance, a kind of \\"this would have won the Pulitzer if it seemed more like actual poetry\\" nattering voice at the back on the mind. Both were roundly criticized by the grater poetic community during their lifetimes. We have yet to see if, as they did with Rimbaud, that greater community will end up coming to realize what a brilliant talent Jackson, in fact, was.<br />Jackson was around at the beginning of the eighties revival of \\"slam\\" poetry, a distinctly non-poetic form of writing that still somehow gets passed off as poetry. And she embraced it wholeheartedly, but Jackson didn't have the studied artlessness of years of slam poets who had come before to draw on; what she wrote was in a new style all her own (which, of course, was one of the first generations of work that has influenced others since). As with most movements in any medium, someone with great talent started the ball rolling, and legions of mediocre imitators have come since. So if you're disgusted with what you hear now, it's still worth going back to the source and seeing what could have been, and what was for a very brief period:<br />\\"I am bothered by snatches<br />bits of old motion<br />Motown choruses<br />mimed by gay men<br />refrains of betrayal made<br />catchy by fish hooks<br />and melody...\\"<br />(\\"Breakdown 101\\")<br />Even the weakest of the pieces in Scat is full of internal rhythm, alliteration, and image, which so much of today's slam poetry has put aside in favor of political sound bites and rap hooks. There are pieces of Scat, a line here, an image there, that are breathtaking in their excitement. Were Lorri Jackson still alive, and this book just released, I might be proclaiming the emergence of the Next Big Thing, the next poet who actually had a chance to bring poetry back to the masses. Instead, I find myself in the role of carnival barker in a world of archaeologists. Find Lorri Jackson's work.

James Dickey, Buckdancer's Choice (Wesleyan, 1965)<br />Buckdancer's Choice, Dickey's fourth book, should have been the one that catapulted him into the national spotlight. (That didn't happen for another five years, until he released his first novel: Deliverance.) Buckdancer's Choice won Dickey the 1965 National Book Award for poetry, as well as getting him named consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. But, as is usually the way with these things, in the wider world, Dickey remained just as obscure as ever for another half-decade.<br />There are few nits that can be picked with a book full of stuff as powerful as James Dickey's. Two of the best poems he wrote in his long and illustrious career, \\"The Fire-Bombing\\" and \\"The Fiend,\\" both found their first homes in this slim volume. Both are in the style Dickey invented, presumably nameless, which plays with line breaks by putting them in the middles of lines. (Yes, folks, I know these are called caesurae, but they're not regular, like one would find in Old English poetry; think of it more as a form of Gerard Manley Hopkins' sprung rhythm applied to free verse.) The effect is to get the reader to pause more often than normal, and thus to force the reader to emphasize images in his reflections on the poem than he otherwise normally would:<br />\\"He descends.....a medium-sized shadow.....while that one sleeps and turns<br />In her high bed in loss.....as he goes limb by limb.....quietly down<br />The trunk with one lighted side....\\"<br />(\\"The Fiend\\")<br />Coupled with these are, of course, poems written in a more \\"regular\\" style, equally as powerful, combining enchantment and revulsion. It was said in Victorian times that the mark of British gentility was to have a copy of one of Tennyson's works prominently displayed in one's home. Were America to value poetry that much, there is little doubt Buckdancer's Choice would be on the short list of books that would mark American gentility in a similar way, or at least a certain type of American gentility.

Charles Simic, Unending Blues (Harcourt Brace, 1986)<br />To call Charles Simic a poor man's Clayton Eshleman would probably not be giving Simic his full due. After all, Simic is a Pulitzer Prize winner (1990, for The World Doesn't End), a recipient of a New York Times Notable Book of the Year (Jackstraws), a finalist for the National Book Award (Walking the Black Cat), a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, and elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. I mean, the guy's good. Only a purist would find fault with Simic, right?<br />Probably. And faults to be found with Simic are minor at best, for the most part (the odd \\"what was he thinking?\\" line break, etc.). But sometimes, while reading Unending Blues, one of Simic's over-sixty books, it occurred to me that the fundamental premise of what Simic has been trying to do since his first poems were published over forty years ago is one that invites failure. That he succeeds with it as much as he does is astounding.<br />Simic is a surrealist in many ways (thus my comparing him to Eshleman, by far the foremost American surrealist of the latter half of the twentieth century), but at the same time he has a desire to write accessible, commercially viable work. This is not a bad thing in itself; the quest for commercial viability in poetry, the quest for accessibility, is one of the things that drives many of us. But to combine it with surrealism, one of whose main tropes throughout its existence has been the deliberately obscure? Flirting with disaster, one thinks. The hallmark of the search for accessibility in poetry over the past fifty years has been to provide easy answers to those whose first question upon completing a poem is \\"but what does it mean?\\" (and damn the eyes of all English teachers across the world who have led us to believe that what a poem means is the most important thing about it.) It would seem that surrealism, which forces the reader to think, would be anathema. And yet somehow Simic has been pulling it off for decades. And once again, in Unending Blues, he for the most part succeeds. He loses his way every once in a while, but far less than most poets treading such a dangerous path would; the majority of the work here resembles an odd, surrealist T. S. Eliot (in the early years, before Eliot got so wordy) more than it does Billy Collins (or Eshleman).<br />Unending Blues is not a landmark book. It isn't as mind-numbingly brilliant as Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk, it isn't as commercial as Jackstraws, it doesn't ring with the bell of importance as does White or Walking the Black Cat. But as an intro to Simic, or as a lighter read between two more weighty works, Unending Blues can't be beat. Still in print, which is a tad surprising for a book that in the poetry world was printed in the ice age, and worth picking up. ****ic has been pulling it off for decades.

All the good stuff in the last decade or so has been splatterpunk, ecohorror, the horror of absence, and the like. The fine, atmospheric horror novel with one of the classic buggity-boos has been relegated to the short story, the Ravenloft novel, or (ugh) Anne Rice.<br />Or so I thought. Then I discovered the novels of Tamara Thorne. Bad Things is one of them. It's a novel about a haunted house, with shades of The Green Man thrown in for good measure. And it's a stunner.<br />Rick Piper, at the beginning of the story, is a good kid with a bad problem-he had inherited the family curse of being able to see the Greenjacks, little shadow-like creatures whose sole aim in life is to swap themselves with a human soul and inhabit the human's body. Only a few male members of the Piper clan can see them, and Rick is one of them. His twin brother Robin can't, and Robin, though basically another good kid, teases him about them mercifully. On Halloween during their seven-year-old year, Rick is attacked by Big Jack, the physical manifestation of the Greenjacks everyone can see, who can only form on Halloween night. In the process of saving Rick, Robin is knocked unconscious, and when he wakes up, he has become rather a nasty character. Has he been possessed by a greenjack, or did he suffer brain damage in the fall? The answer to this question haunts Rick, who eventually convinces himself (after fleeing the family estate to Las Vegas) that the greenjacks were all in his head, and that his brother was just an evil kid. All well and good until Rick, a widower in his forties with two kids of his own, wants to get his kids away from the easy, loose lifestyle of Vegas, and moves them back to the family estate, where he starts seeing little green men again...<br />Various pieces of Bad Things remided me, more than anything, of Paula Trachtman's extreme-horror classic Disturb Not the Dream (okay, it was extreme when it came out. Today it'd barely rate a PG if made into a movie. But that's beside the point). Big old haunted house, crazy relatives, secret passages, incest, dead animals (Tamara Thorne must really hate toy poodles, but then, doesn't everyone?), murky ponds, dead kids, ghosties, ghoulies, long-leggetie beasties, it's all here. While Thorne doesn't go to the same lengths Trachtman did, she adds on some wonderful twists, including the crossdressing best friend of the protagonist, Dakota, who plays combination psychotherapist and matchmaker for Rick; the old nanny, who has stayed on as caretaker and is one of the few people who really believes Rick is seeing ghosts; and, most notably, a refreshing absence of the token religious figure who faces the demons and is destroyed. (It's just too easy a clich&eacute; these days.) Thorne is one of those authors who can pen a five-hundred-page novel and have the reader turning pages and staying up late in the night to finish it over the course of a long weekend, and Bad Things definitely fits that mold. Thorne is one of the fantastic new voices in horror, and deserves to be heard by many more people than she has thus far. ****(okay, it was extreme when it came out.

Penelope Fitzgerald, The Blue Flower (Mariner Books, 1995)<br />The Booker Committee finally honored Fitzgerald with a prize in 1995 for The Blue Flower, her retelling of the early life of celebrated Romantic poet Novalis. Finally, after a string of books that left the reader wanting more, Fitzgerald expands her spare prose style to give us enough.<br />Fritz von Hardenburg, later Novalis, is a poet and philosopher who is expected to go into the family business if inspecting salt mines. A thrilling job for a poet, of course, and his academic colleagues are quite horrified. But, good son that he is, he accepts the charge with aplomb and goes to apprentice at the house of Coelestin Just, an accountant (from the way his duties are described, we'd likely call him an auditor today) who travels from mansion to mansion making sure the books are in order. While accompanying him one day, von Hardenburg meets Sophie von Kuhn, described by von Hardenburg's associates as a dullard (again, translating into the modern, an airhead; Fitzgerald makes gestures towards the idea that Sophie is slightly mentally retarded, but never actually comes out and says it, and her behavior is delightfully ambiguous in this regard), and is instantly captivated with her. Modern readers of this tale will probably be more incensed at the age difference (when they meet, Fritz is nineteen, Sophie twelve) than the difference in mental capacity, while the families themselves couldn't seem to care less about a nineteen-year-old suitor for a twelve-year-old girl. (One thinks, perhaps, with a jaundiced eye, that Ms. Fitzgerald may be subtly comparing Novalis' time to ours, and finding ours wanting.)<br />Fitzgerald's books are usually minimal in both style and plot, and in The Blue Flower, less actually happens than in most of her novels. Such is the peril of biography, even when fictionalized. At the core, our lives are pretty much boring. And apprenticing to be a salt mine inspector? Few things could possibly be more boring. Fitzgerald keeps the book strong not only with her usual spare style, but also by switching back and forth between viewpoints so that we're not always stuck with Fritz and his books. We do get some scenes of such, though, and the effect is amusing rather than dull, as Fritz, for example, reads from a book of laws on salt mining as he would a book of Goethe's poetry. And, of course, being a Romantic poet, von Hardenburg's work is unintentionally (one assumes) hilarious of itself. The overall effect is that of great amusement; not that this is a light novel, per se, but there is always at least a shadow of satire surrounding it, even within the tragedy.<br />Honestly, despite all the above, I had a hard time figuring out if I actually liked the novel or not. It does drag in places, though I put that down to my expectation, when reading Fitzgerald, of finding a hundred fifty pages instead of two hundred fifty. And I had a hard time telling, at times, whether the humor was intentional or unintentional; it's impossible to tell whether Ms. Fitzgerald actually likes Novalis or whether she's satirizing him. But overall, the book isn't a bad one. Fitzgerald has certainly done better (The Bookshop, passed over for the Booker, is the best of her novels I've read to date), but for the reader who has already sampled and enjoyed Fitzgerald, there is a good deal to be liked here. ***sibly be more boring.

Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything Is Illuminated (Dutton, 2002)<br />My, what a clever novel!<br />In any case, that, I imagine, is what Jonathan Safran Foer kept saying as he was writing this. And really, much about it is clever. The comparisons to A Clockwork Orange are completely unwarranted, as Alex, Foer's Ukrainian hero, destroys the English language in a quite different way than does Burgess' Alex. (A less politically correct but more conceptually accurate comparison would be Charlie Chan, as written by Earl Derr Biggers.)  Foer's intertwining of stories is also quite clever, and his use of the two narrators to tell the main storylines.<br />However, with all the cleverness going on, Foer seems to have forgotten in many places to actually insert a novel. Threads pick up in odd places and then die with no fanfare, never to be resurrected again; the story has holes without being told an enough of an impressionist way to allow the reader to fill in enough blanks; the characters are obviously there as vehicles to carry off the cleverness, instead of being fully-realized human beings. In other words, this is a linguistic roller coaster, not a novel.<br />Not to say Foer doesn't write well when he forgets about the tricks and applies himself. Especially in the novel's last eighty pages, there are scenes of great beauty and tragedy that are conveyed in powerful manner that make the reader sit up and take notice. (The emotionl impact of every last one of them is dramatically undercut by Foer's following each with a needlessly scatological and/or pornographic piece of attempted humor, each of which fails because of its positioning, but the tragic pieces themselves are extremely well-written.) Unfortunately, these scenes are all too few. One of them is going along swimmingly until he decides to interject a Rick Moody-esque three-page unpunctuated sentence. Horrid. (And a trick he repeats a couple of times afterwards, also throwing in run-on words. Even more horrid.)<br />The book is billed as a comedy, and Foer tries to carry it off as such, but when the finest-written scenes are those of tragedy, it's hard to call it a success as attempted. Foer has the makings of a fine dramatic writer, once he gets away from being so consciously clever. **r />The book is billed as a comedy, and Foer tries to carry it off as such, but when the finest-written scenes are those of tragedy, it's hard to call it a success as attempted.

Edward Levy, The Beast Within (Berkley, 1981)<br />The Beast Within is the book that should have made Edward Levy a household name on a par with Stephen King and... well, okay, in 1981 Stephen King was really the only household name in horror. But the King was in one of his slumps, major presses were champing at the bit to sign AAA-league writers to produce the Next Big Thing. Well, Berkley already had Edward Levy, and here was the manuscript that was going to dethrone the horror master.<br />All well and good, and to Berkley's credit, they didn't handle the publicity all that badly. But then it was optioned for film...<br />If you've had the misfortune of seeing the atrocity that was Philippe Mora's 1982 film of the same name, be assured that what you saw was not, in any way, what Edward Levy actually wrote. (One wag, in a review of the film version of The Beast Within, called it The Script Without. Indeed.) The following description of the novel, if you're unlucky enough to actually remember the movie, will sound completely unfamiliar.<br />The scene opens in some past time. Say, sixty years ago, but in the rural area where the beginning of the story takes place, it might as well be six hundred years ago. A woman has been trapped in a loveless, arranged marriage with a Christian fundamentalist who makes Pat Robertson look like a godless heathen. A traveling Bible salesman (yes! Really!) shows up at the door, and you've all heard this joke a thousand times. Well, at least until the farmer catches them and chains the Bible salesman in his basement for years, treating him like an animal, until he actually becomes one. Levy sets the two men up against one another, one devolving, the other already devolved. These fifty pages (the fifty, of course, the filmmakers decided to cut out first) are some of the best writing in any eighties horror novel I've read (and I've read hundreds of them).<br />In any case, after the fundamentalist's death (by natural causes), the beast finally has a chance to escape. Now, we all know he's oversexed, and you know how sailors are after they've been on a ship for a year? Well, this guy's been in the basement a lot longer, and when you've had to eat off the floor (with a rather unsavory menu) for a long time, you tend to lose some of the social graces. Let's just say his escape and subsequent actions are not pretty, but they do produce a son, Michael MacCleary. All well and good. At least, until Michael reaches adolescence and becomes daddy's boy...<br />The Beast Within was the first novel I read where the setup took longer than the actual action, and I couldn't care less. After that first fifty-page whack to the head, Levy uses Carolyn (Michael's mother)'s pregnancy and Michael's early years solely to build suspense, taking up well over half the book's full length, and he does so wonderfully. By the time you get to Michael's teen years, the book would have to fall off a cliff to be bad. And it never does (certainly not to the \\"we had a few thousand extra in the special effects budget\\" way the film does). Levy takes the setup and delivers a climax that, well, let's say if the rest of the book were plausible, the climax would be the most plausible way to resolve things. But you suspended disbelief when you realized the first part of the book was going to be based on a bad joke, right? You should have. If you did, The Beast Within is one of the most rip-roaring horror novel rides you are ever likely to take. Sits on the short shelf, with Russo's Living Things, Trachtman's Disturb Not the Dream, King's Pet Sematary, and a very few other novels as one of the best horror novels of the eighties.

(That Rachel Carson doctored her data does not in any way invalidate the sheer creepiness of a good deal of ecohorror.) Came a Spider was his first novel, of only two I could ever find that he wrote, and while it's the lesser of the two, it's still a barnburner of a read. Levy hits you early on; in the opening scene, a large, nasty-looking spider bites a teenager, who gets progressively sicker over the next week, then dies, his purpose fulfilled-a cocoon for the spiders' eggs. From there, the babies of this mutant beast do what comes naturally to mutant monsters in horror novels. They launch a campaign to take over Los Angeles.<br />Came a Spider, for all the genre-writing silliness, was an insanely influential novel. Very little of what has come since has remained uninfluenced by it (the climactic hunt for the spiders' nest in the sewers of Los Angeles, especially, should be very familiar to fans of eighties mutant monster movies, starting with 1980's Alligator). It helps that Levy has a wonderfully readable style, causing the reader to want to forgive some of the deadwood in the dialogue (e.g., one of the scientists on the team trying to kill the spiders off has a tendency to use the term \\"personally,\\" as in \\"I personally know...\\" and the like, way, way too much). The pages certainly keep turning quickly enough, so that if you've got an afternoon free you can probably plow through the whole book.<br />Levy's work has been re-released, and can now be discovered by a new generation of fans. Allilujah. ****	2003-07-18

He throws rhyming couplets into a free-verse poem, comes up with the occasional horrid line break (as in the third line of the quote above), throws every grammar rulebook to the wind, and is one of those very few whose words sound as good as they do because of the way he chose to write the poems in this book. Every flaunted rule hints at hours, maybe days, of thought on whether the lines in question might sound better in some other form. In every case, it seems, the answer was no.<br />Hudgins, much lauded and yet little known, is one of modern America's finest poetic voices. The Never-Ending continued his recognition as such, becoming his third book in a row nominated for a major American prize (the National Book Award, this time); it was also his third book overall. That's a track record that's pretty hard to miss.<br />Unlike so many fine ones, Hudgins' books, most of them, are still in print. Give the man a try. You won't regret it. **** ½	2003-07-18

Donald Finkel, The Wake of the Electron (Atheneum, 1987)<br />The Wake of the Electron is billed as a narrative poem, but is in fact a collection. Good news for those who don't like long poems.<br />The Wake of the Electron, Finkel's eleventh collection of poetry, is the story of Donald Crowhurst, a sailor who, while in the 1969 Sunday Times Golden Globe round-the-world sailrace, seems to have gone insane, sailing from Britain down to the southern tip of South America, then turning course back into the Atlantic and setting himself adrift for about eight months. His boat, the Electron, was discovered by a British mail ship in the middle of the Sargasso Sea, with Crowhurst nowhere in sight. He remains undiscovered to this day, but left behind a journal, from which The Wake of the Electron quotes extensively-not long passages as Williams does in Paterson, but in lines and sentences that, more often than not, Finkel integrates into his poems. The result is a structuring of Crowhurst's alleged insanity, and a fictive retelling of what went on in Crowhurst's mind during the eight months (or less, depending on when he left the ship; current scholarship's best estimate is July 1, nine days before the ship was discovered abandoned) he drifted aimlessly in the Atlantic.<br />The result is a fine collection of poems. Finkel combines a strong narrative voice and an obvious grasp of the craft of poetry with compelling subject matter, and the book is a success. At the very least, it should provoke the reader into wanting to read Tomalin and Hall's The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst (now considered a Modern Classic). As poetry, though, it stands on its own with no outside research necessary by the reader. (Note: photos of the Electron taken in 1991 can be found at ...  I had no idea the boat was so small, and this did bring the poems into sharper focus for me after I saw the boat itself, but that didn't happen until after I'd finished reading it through for the first time..	2003-07-16

Jonathan Aaron, Second Sight (Harper Colophon, 1982)<br />Of the books presented in the 1982 National Poetry Series, the only poet who has since emerged as a real force is Naomi Shihab Nye. Which is quite a shame, because Jonathan Aaron, whose debut effort this was, is truly one of the more gifted poets to emerge in post-WW2 America. As one should expect from the cover of Second Sight (Giacometti's sculpture \\"Dog\\"), Aaron's work is whip-crack surrealism laced with a jaded eye and a sharp wit:<br />\\"...the days<br />turned into years at a speed suggested<br />only by the thin, metallic whine<br />I could sometimes hear<br />when the phone went dead: a foul-up<br />in the circuitry, or<br />the sonic afterglow<br />of the spoken word. Meanwhile,<br />her lapses of memory and taste grew beyond<br />my simple faith in the facts.\\"<br />(\\"Second Sight\\")<br />Aaron does have a few rough edges in his poetry; some of the pieces in the book (especially at the very beginning, and a few towards the end) are less than inspiring, and as should be obvious from the piece quoted above there are some line break problems (\\"or\\" is one of those words which should never, ever end a line of poetry. Ever.), but this is a fantastic debut from a poet of great promise. Unfortunately, the twenty years since have seen only one more collection, Corridor, emerge (a third has been mentioned since 1999 in various bios, but has yet to see the light of day as of this writing). Aaron is worth far more acclaim than he has so far received. ****	2003-07-16

Philip Larkin, High Windows (Faber, 1974)<br />Larkin, the celebrated librarian-poet, got somewhat cranky in his middle age. He also got more experimental, both qualities that make for fine poetry. Add to these scurrilousness, a wicked sense of humor, and an ear for rhythm matched only in the modern world's finest poets, and you have a recipe for greatness.<br />So why doesn't Larkin always pull it off? Good question. When he's on, he's very, very on, but when he's off, it's a mess. Unlike most poets, Larkin seems to have been able to switch back and forth between formal and free verse at will a number of times, but he did make the grade-school gaffe of trying to combine the two more than once. And a good deal of his \\"politically incorrect\\" (for lack of a better term) poetry smacks more of the juvenile than the Shakespearean:<br />\\"Jan von Hogspeuw staggers to the door<br />And pisses at the dark. Outside, the rain<br />Courses in cart-ruts down the deep mud land.<br />Inside, Dirk Dogstoerd pours himself some more...\\"<br />(\\"The Card-Players\\")<br />Despite these excursions into the ridiculous, however, Larkin does still exhibit his mastery more often than not in this slim volume, and it's worth picking up either for the established Larkin fan or the newcomer who wonders what happened to metrical poetry after World War II. ***	2003-07-16

Joyce Carol Oates, Beasts (Carroll and Graf, 2002)<br />Joyce Carol Oates cannot be human.<br />It is simply impossible for a single human being to turn out the work she has over the course of her career, consistently stratospheric in both quality and quantity. Her thirty-year bibliography is so vast that the major internet repository of Oates research and criticism doesn't have a full list anywhere, but is now a searchable database. Another admittedly incomplete bibliography on the web lists eighty-nine books split between novels, short story collections, and poetry, fifteen anthologies she has edited or co-edited, ten works of non-fiction, and ninety anthologies in which her work has appeared since 1980 (and those are only the horror-themed anthologies). She is the Merzbow of literature, the Sun Ra of wordcraft, both the dream and the nightmare of the bibliophile with a limited reserve of cash. The truly astounding part of all this is that one can walk into a (very well-stocked) bookshop, pick up a Joyce Carol Oates book at random, and have an odds-on chance of being rewarded with one of his finest reads of the year. Now add to this idea the fact that Oates is, for all intents and purposes, a one-trick pony, and explain how one person can write so much material on a single theme and still have it come out so very, very well.<br />Such is certainly the case with her recent novel Beasts. Anyone who's read Oates before, in whatever form, is liable to know a few things about this book even before cracking the cover: the main theme of the book will be human degradation. One of the characters in the book will be horrified by the degradation, even while experiencing it, and this horror will cause the character to commit some sort of extreme and socially unacceptable act. There will be a great deal of uncomfortable eroticism. Then you open the book, read the first two small chapters, and here's something new: Oates is going to tell you all this in the first four pages. It's almost as if she's throwing down the gauntlet to the reader; \\"you know it's coming, I know it's coming, let's see how much I can give you at the beginning and still beguile you with my novel.\\"<br />And utterly beguiling it is. Gillian Brauer is a student at a small college in Massachusetts who is enamored of one of her professors. She is not alone in this, but the lengths to which she goes in her obsession with him are rather farther than the others go (in one early scene, she surreptitiously follows his wife through town, and mentions she has done this a number of times before). She knows that sometimes the professor and his wife, a sculptor whose most recent show at the school's gallery has ignited a firestorm of outrage, will sometimes allow students into their inner circle, but that these students are very tight-lipped about what goes on there. Secret society stuff at its best. Gillian, too shy to confess her love for her professor and desire to be one of those students, begins to imagine that all of her housemates in the small house/dormitory where they live, are members of the inner circle, and eventually gets to the point where she must either confront her professor or go crazy.<br />And that's the light, optimistic part of the novel. Things get much more fun after the confrontation.<br />This novel is obsessed with small. It is slim--a hundred thirty pages in the hardback edition. Gillian lives in the smallest dorm on campus and is obsessed with gaining entrance into living quarters with even fewer people. Her obsession grows when, after a semester with the professor in a normal-sized lecture class, she is admitted to one of his workshops, with only eleven students. Her classmates grow thinner over time. Small is everywhere. There is a whole (probably longer than the book itself) thesis to be written on small in here. The themes Oates taken on, on the other hand, are not small in the least, as they never are. And, as always, she does so with such style that the reader cannot help be compelled. I didn't finish this book in one sitting only because I had to go to bed last night if I wanted to have a fresh enough mind in the morning to keep involved with the story.<br />Gillian's professor is fond of muttering Nietzsche under his breath at odd times. Funny that Nietzsche's most famous aphorism is never mentioned in the book: \\"...and if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\\" Oates has been gazing into this particular abyss for thirty years now, throwing down that gauntlet, challenging it to gaze back, and reporting on what she finds. Perhaps she will continue to do so for another thirty years, and we will continue to get such brilliant books as this. ****½hat the reader cannot help be compelled.

John McGahern, The Dark (Panther, 1965)<br />John McGahern would seem to be another of those authors whose talent is lionized in his native land, but who never quite had Americans get the hang of his work (q.v. Margaret Laurence). The Dark, McGahern's second novel, is a fascinating portrait of adolescence that deserves far, far wider appreciation than it seems to have ever received.<br />McGahern's homeland of Ireland may have something to do with that. The Dark was banned not long after its release for its rather cavalier treatments of both sex and religion, and so a novel published almost forty years ago has actually had something less than that to make a name for itself. Someday, Oprah will discover this book and feature it in her book club, and well, McGahern will have it made.<br />Oprah couldn't not love this book. It's dysfunction central. The home depicted here won't be found in the bucolic emerald landscapes on sees in movies of the time. Here, we have the poor Depression-era Ireland, where the family burns peat and straw because it can't afford coal, instead. The nameless protagonist's mother is dead, presumably in childbirth. The father is both verbally and sexually abusive to his (uncounted, in the novel) children; explicitly to his son, implicitly to his daughters (though whether there is anything to this forms the crux of a scene much later on in the novel). There is much here to lay the groundwork for the main character of this novel to hate his father, but McGahern isn't going to take the easy way out, building a complex love/hate relationship between the main character and his father, complicated by both their feelings for Joan, the oldest daughter.<br />The book has rightly been compared to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist, though McGahern's prose is far clearer and less florid, almost minimal. His characters are beautifully drawn, real in every sense of the word, and it is impossible not to at least empathize with them. McGahern takes on the daunting task of telling a story with one main character and many different points of view, while keeping all those points of view sympathetic, as if he were telling the story from everyone's perspectives simultaneously. He pulls it off with great flair.<br />This is an uncomfortable book, to be sure, but it is a very good one, perhaps even a great one. Certainly one of the finer coming-of-age novels I've run across. ****ng task of telling a story with one main character and many different points of view, while keeping all those points of view sympathetic, as if he were telling the story from everyone's perspectives simultaneously.

And deservedly so; Howard's mature work is the stuff dreams are made of. Not often in a person's lifetime does a book like, say, No Traveller come along. One is tempted to put much of this down to his impeccable taste; Howard is equally lauded for his translation skills, which he has applied to such classics as Robbe-Grillet's Repetition, Breton's Nadja, and Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince. Obviously, the boy has a thing for surrealism, and it informs his work in the most wondrous of ways.<br />But then the question becomes, what was his stuff like before that? Enter the present volumes, 1969's Untitled Subjects, a series of dramatic monologues from various great figures (or attendants to/acquaintances of same) that span the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The poetic connoisseur will likely see the words \\"dramatic monologue\\" and think, first, of Robert Browning, and said connoisseur would not be far off the mark in thinking so.<br />Howard writes for the most part in free and blank verse rather than Browning's logorrheic iambic pentameter, and that alone makes Howard's work the more readable (if at some points a bit more forgettable as well). It may be a comparison of apples and oranges, and running such a comparison puts reviewers at risk of falling victim to the \\"what is poetry?\\" debate. But Howard is worth the risk, and at the time of the book's release notables such as Harold Bloom and James Dickey were quick to point out the Browning comparison so this reviewer figures he's on relatively safe ground. Only time can tell whether such lovely pieces as \\"1915,\\" an existential crisis of William Morris' wife Jane, or \\"1851,\\" a letter purportedly written by John Ruskin while on his honeymoon, will stand with \\"Fra Lippo Lippi\\" in the canon of literature. Whether they deserve to or not is of course a matter of subjectivity, but I think they're pretty darn good. Browning needs to scoot over a bit and make room for Howard on that short shelf. ***purportedly written by John Ruskin while on his honeymoon, will stand with \\"Fra Lippo Lippi\\" in the canon of literature.

While I was working at a university in the late nineties, I was lucky enough to stumble upon a copy of this in their library after reading Ziemba and Hausch's landmark Beat the Track. For the year between my finding it and my switching jobs, the book was out of the library and in my hands every day. I renewed as often as I could, and when I couldn't, I would drop it off on my way to work and take it out again on my way home. They were inclined to be lenient, because I was the only person who had ever taken the book out of the library.<br />Let me get one thing straight from the outset: folks, this is not your momma's handicapping manual.

Michael Pizzolla, Handicapping Magic (ITS Press, 2000)<br />It's impossible to write a review of a handicapping book just after reading it, really, and comment on what the mechanics of the writing are all about. I'll be back in a year or so to cogitate on all that and whether it works or not. Or you can take a look at other reviews, which look like, well, reviews of almost every other handicapping book out there. Works for some folks. Not for others. We shall see.<br />From the standpoint of logic, clarity, theory, and understanding, though, Handicapping Magic is simply the holy grail of handicapping books. I've probably read two hundred books on handicapping in the past ten years, ranging from the sublime (Brohamer, Quinn, etc.) to the ridiculous (any book whose handicapping method is based on \\"smart money\\", etc.), and despite having read all those and more, there were still some great unanswered questions about handicapping. I've asked them, at the risk of sounding like a rank beginner, on for a far and wide over the course of those ten years, to weekend warriors and professional handicappers alike, to those who author handicapping books and those who run handicapping websites, to the guys in thousand-dollar suits in the clubhouse and the guys in tattered shorts on the apron. Ask a hundred people you get a hundred answers, at least ninety-five of which will be \\"I don't know\\" in some dialect of horse. They're simple questions, too, or seem so. \\"How can you tell if a horse is in good form?\\" \\"What IS good form?\\" \\"How can you tell where a horse is in his form cycle?\\" \\"How do you tell what horse in a race is most likely to be on the lead?\\" \\"If a horse isn't on the lead, what are the chances he'll still manage to run well?\\" (I've gotten many, many answers to that last one, and I still wonder if some of the people who expounded on that one for ten minutes managed to cash tickets on the 2002 Blue Grass Stakes, where perennial frontrunner Millennium Wind, who'd never managed to press a pace in his life, finished second after not once getting his nose in front. I suspect I know the answer.) It is the stuff pace handicapping is made of, and no one from Lucky Jim, the other guy who chainsmokes his tickets at Thistledown, to Tom Brohamer, author of Modern Pace Handicapping, has ever managed to set me straight on any of those questions.<br />Along comes Michael Pizzolla. And he makes the same basic assumptions most racing writers do, I think-that if you're reading a handicapping book for the \\"advanced\\" set, you probably already know those answers. But Pizzolla doesn't make the mistake of then assuming that you can skate by those questions and their all-too-elusive answers to get to the meat of the matter; he actually gives you the answers. I'd have been a convert for life halfway through chapter two on Pizzolla's easy-to-follow description of whether a horse is in form and capable of competing in today's race alone.<br />Without testing the actual methods Pizzolla gives us in the book, which is of course the acid test of any handicapping manual, the test of a handicapping book for me is the same as the test for a book of poetry: did I find something in it I can steal, and is the stuff around the stealable material at least readable? In both cases Handicapping Magic gets the loudest \\"YES!\\" I've managed since Composer, Jambalaya Jazz, and Knockadoon kicked back twenty-four grand in a minor stakes race at Keeneland in April 1997 on a two-dollar ticket. (And that was the simplest system ever, which I'll give you free: they were the only three also-rans in Triple Crown races competing in the race. No-thought trifecta box. Glory be and alli-lujah.)<br />A number of other reviewers have called this the best book on handicapping they've read, hands down.

Browne, SunBirds #2: Epidemic (Author's Choice, 2001)<br />One of the key words in my review of the first SunBirds novel was \\"potential.\\" Things won't be changing much in review #2.<br />We continue on in the story of the SunBirds and their aiding of the beetles in the battle against the flies for world domination. (No, I promise you, the premise really does work well.)  This book is told from the point of view of Shadow, one of Aquarius' (narrator of the first book) associates in the SunBirds, and a much flightier, happier-go-lucky character. Browne handles the change in narrative voice with aplomb, something that often catches more seasoned writers out, which makes the underlying problems a bit more confusing than they would otherwise be; this is obviously not the work of an amateur, no matter how young the author.<br />But there are problems with it. Most of them have to do with Browne's treatment of emotion (and again, this is a problem which does affect more seasoned writers, usually in genre fiction, so it's not something one can dismiss as the work of a neophyte); characters will illogically shift their emotion in the space of a sentence or two, or pop up with something inappropriate for the situation (laughing while facing the possibility of death, say, but in a carefree way rather than with bravado). When done right, this can be a powerful tool in showing a character's actual emotions through the inappropriateness of what's shown; Glendon Swarthout utilizes this technique masterfully throughout Bless the Beasts and Children, for example. Here, it fails, for either of two possible reasons: either Browne was too focused on the plot of the story to get far into characterization, or just doesn't have the life experience necessary to pick up on subtleties in the conveyance of emotions. This is not necessarily age-related, as anyone who's ever read a Danielle Steel novel will heartily attest.<br />Okay, enough with the bad. On with the good. The second novel in the series is similar to the first in its slimness, quickness, originality, and all-around fun. Nick Carter for kids, except with power chips instead of guns and far more interesting bosses sending the agents out on missions, to be sure. If you can get past the inappropriate emotional responses, which are really a minor thing here, this is another fun read in the SunBirds series. May there be many more. ** ½l in the series is similar to the first in its slimness, quickness, originality, and all-around fun.

Tim O'Brien, Going After Cacciato (Dell, 1978)<br />...P>Going After Cacciato is both the story of a troop of soldiers sent to pursue Cacciato, a comrade who deserted, and the story of one member of that troop, PFC Paul Berlin, spending the night in an observation post. For those who haven't yet read it, I won't spoil it by saying how those two stories intertwine. Cacciato has somehow glommed onto the odd idea that it's possible to walk from Vietnam to Paris, and has decided to set out doing just that. The soldiers follow him, reaching a critical point when they cross the border into Laos, and ultimately decide to keep going. They get farther and farther from Vietnam, but find that the shenanigans of the war stay with them pretty much wherever they go; as a Viet Cong officer they meet in Laos tells them, \\"the land is your enemy.\\"<br />In that sense, yes, it is most certainly a novel about the Vietnam War and how it sticks in the heads of veterans long after they've left the field (though some of the tricks O'Brien pulls toward the end of the novel undercut that). And it is a good one; the very absurdity of the plot is enough to keep the reader flipping pages. But if one is looking for the definitive Vietnam War novel, one is probably better served searching out Gustav Hasford's brilliant short novel The Short-Timers (upon which the film Full Metal Jacket is based, albeit loosely) or, perhaps, Lucius Shepard's Life During Wartime.<br />Not to say Cacciato is not well-written, engaging, fun to read, and an overall darn fine book. It is all of those things, and I have spent far more of this review denigrating the buildup than the actual book (as my rating will surely convey). Tim O'Brien is a solid writer, his characters are well-developed (though some of the supporting cast is two-dimensional; they're not in the book long enough to get a good feeling for them, really, and by the end one understands why this is and finds it somewhat justified), the plot moves along at an acceptable pace, and the surrealism of the premise is original in the extreme.

Sara Schulman, Empathy (Dutton, 1992)<br />Until roughly twenty minutes before writing this review, I was getting ready to say Empathy was going to be a definite for my best twenty-five reads of 2003 list. Then I read the last three chapters.<br />The first twenty-seven are brilliant. The story's two main characters are Anna O., a lesbian attempting to get over an old relationship and find someone new, and Doc, a post-Freudian therapist who finds prospective clients by handing out business cards on the street and will never keep a client for more than three sessions. Eventually, their two stories intertwine as Anna, finding one of Doc's business cards, makes an appointment with him. The two of them then proceed to take on relationships of all sorts, Jewish funerals, AIDS, the homeless, and a rainbow of other topics with a wicked wit. Doc obsesses over an old girlfriend as well, and feels an almost supernatural connection with Anna. When one of the main questions in a book is \\"will Doc end up having a fourth session with Anna?\\", it's impossible to write a review in a way that makes it sound as important as it actually is, but Anna, Doc, and the supporting cast of characters (Anna's family, Doc's patients and mentor, Anna's old girlfriend's mother, Doc's old girlfriend) are so well-drawn and engaging that it's well-night impossible not to be drawn in to the point where you sit up at night thinking about such things.<br />Then Schulman hits you with the kicker, the novel's climax, and though it's nothing we haven't seen before (telling you where would be the ultimate plot spoiler, however), it's a sucker punch delivered with such aplomb that it demands a \\"thank you, ma'am, may I have another.\\" I had figured I knew where the book was going, had it mapped out in my head (and it was a brilliant ending, too), then Schulman flipped all my expectations on their heads and delivered what may have been the only climax that was actually better than what I thought it would be.<br />Then we get to Chapter Twenty-Seven, and everything goes to hell in a handbasket. We spend two chapters involved in political polemic that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the novel, and while they are two brief chapters, their very existence in the book poisons the whole thing. Schulman attempts to wrap things up in the last chapter by going back to the original topic of life-after-Doc Anna, but by then it's too late. The rhythm, the style, the all-around beauty of the book has been dashed against a curb on a dark, rainy street.<br />My advice? By all means, read this novel. Up to chapter twenty-six. Then skip ahead to chapter thirty. You will still find an ending that is an anticlimax, to say the least, but you will at least be spared pointless political diatribe along the way. ** ½/>Then we get to Chapter Twenty-Seven, and everything goes to hell in a handbasket.

Lisa Rogak, Pretzel Logic (Williams Hill Press, 1999)<br />Lisa Rogak has written a pretty darn fine novel, but unfortunately couldn't get it published by a major. So instead she went to a small, regional press with this book, which has probably kept it from getting a wide enough distribution to reach the audience it deserves.<br />Pretzel Logic is the story of a married couple who move back to the wife's hometown and take over the weekly paper. All is going swimmingly until the husband starts fighting past demons he thought he had conquered in his adolescence, finally capitulating to them and (while masking it in various ways) coming out of the closet.<br />The storyline isn't anything terribly new. We've all seen it before over the past twenty years more than once. What makes Pretzel Logic worthwhile is Rogak's easygoing style, somewhat rare in journalists, especially rare in journalists writing autobiographical novels and there are quite a few clues lying around to give this away as an autobiographical novel). Rogak is still close to her material, to be sure, but that doesn't stop her from recognizing, and telling, a good story around it.<br />It is entirely possible that the way Rogak approaches the subject matter is what stopped the book from getting published. Various episodes in the book, from an offhand comment made early on to Rogak's attempt at sleeping with another woman are not handled with one iota of political correctness, which would no doubt cause most publishers to shy well away from this book. At the same time, the political incorrectness of the book doesn't come off as offensive as much as it comes off honest (and if you can't tell the difference between the two, you can both stop reading this review right now and avoid this book like the plague. Those with chips on their shoulders are guaranteed to be offended by this book). In other words, as often happens, the book didn't get a big contract precisely because of the things that make it a good read in the first place.

[NOTE: This is a review solely of _On Love_.]<br />A. R. Orage, On Love (Janus Press, 1974)<br />What a phenomenally bad little book this is. I picked it up not knowing who A. R. Orage was (it was horribly miscast in the \\"poetry\\" section at the CWRU book sale). I've done a bit of research since, and, well, had I known before, I'd have avoided this nonsense like the plague. Orage was the longtime editor of the magazine The New Age (and the term \\"new age\\" gets all of its most pejorative definitions from the stupidity of the magazine, originally), and it's pretty easy to tell from reading this.<br />The title essay, \\"On Love,\\" is subtitled \\"freely adapted from the Tibetan,\\" and I can honestly say that this being a translation is the only possible explanation for \\"On Love\\" being slightly more lucid than the rest of the essays contained herein. Every once in a while, Orage does manage to hit the nail on the head, and most of the time, he does so in this essay. (Thus it is not hard at all to believe it's a translation and not an original work.) This kept me at least interested enough to continue on to the rest of the book. My, was that a mistake. The three essays afterwards (\\"On Religion,\\" \\"What Is the Soul?,\\" and \\"Conversations with Katherine Mansfield\\") are all steeped in pseudo-religious double-talk (in the first, Orage posits his belief that behaviorism will be the bridge between science and religion. A bit of reflection for the modern reader will, one trusts, sufficiently serve to show how well THAT worked.), and it gets far, far worse in the last section, some pages of Orage's aphorisms. These are where the book truly reaches the heights of ignominy. One wonders if Orage actually understood the meaning of the word \\"aphorism.\\" Certainly such passages as this don't fit the bill:<br />\\"A human being is one who works with three centres; he who works with two or one is sub-human.\\"<br />Which may make sense to those who are versed in Gurdjieffian jargon, but for the rest of us makes no sense whatsoever. Pithy it may be, but understandable it is not. If I'm going to read aphorisms, I want aphorisms, not disconnected sentences that read like a spiritual version of the monthly magazine of the American Electrical Engineering Society.<br />So why, after all that, did I give this monstrosity a star and a half? Because Orage, who obviously was the six hundredth monkey on the six hundredth day now and then, manages a few coherent (and good) sentences in \\"On Love,\\" and once in a great, great while comes up with an aphorism like \\"It is possible to have aesthetic emotions and not have human emotions.\\" Now that is an aphorism. * ½of us makes no sense whatsoever.

Hugh Prather, Notes to Myself (Real People Press, 1970)<br />Ouch. This was an ugly experience. The worst part is, it didn't HAVE to be an ugly experience. Yet more evidence that, yes, it's all in the presentation.<br />Notes to Myself is a collection of observations and thoughts from Prather's journals. They range from the surprisingly insightful (\\"The principle seems to be: it is a fault if I am capable of it, a disease if I am not.\\") to the charmingly naïve (\\"What is the difference between `I want food' and `I want sex'? Consent.\\") and just about everywhere in between. And had they been presented as prose journal entries (in other words, as they were no doubt written), this could have been a small surprise, a bit of a self-help book that doesn't try to batter the reader over the head with stupid jargon.<br />Instead, however, it is presented as poetry, and in this presentation it becomes a marvel of offense. You know how magazine editors are constantly decrying submissions that are \\"prose chopped up into short lines?\\" Well, Notes to myself is the epitome of prose chopped up into short lines. It's literally prose chopped up into short lines. (If Prather's journal actually contains this stuff in poetic form, that makes it even more monstrous.) The material in here, while workable prose, violates every possible rule of poetry one can conceive. No thought at all went into the line breaks, the word choice, the image (what very little here is presented as image in the first place!), the diction, anything. It's obvious thought and reflection went into the material, but one of the main differences between poetry and prose is that the presentation of the material is far more important in poetry than it is in prose. In fact, the presentation is more important than the material itself, something Prather (or his editor, blame whichever you like) obviously didn't grasp.<br />In other words, the material gets three stars, the presentation gets zero (and would get negative stars if I gave such things out), leading to an average of * ½.rs if I gave such things out), leading to an average of * ½.	2003-06-20

Buck, The Mother (Pocket, 1934)<br />It is hard to know what to make of this early novel (her fourth) by Pearl S. Buck, who had won the Pulitzer Prize the year before for The Good Earth (her second) and would, in a few years, be a Nobel laureate. Hard because it is difficult to reconcile such a widely-acclaimed author with a novel such as this.<br />In her autobiography, Buck mentions that she almost destroyed the manuscript of The Mother, fearing it wasn't as good as her previously published novels. In this, she was correct. The Mother is not so much a novel as it as a combination of character study and morality play. Other reviewers have commented on the Biblical nature of the events herein, which is likely as apt a description as one is likely to find. The story revolves around, of course, a mother. She is never named, nor are any other members of her family (her husband's last name is mentioned once in the book's two hundred pages, but in such a way as to make it as forgettable as possible). One assumes this is an attempt to give the characters an \\"everyman\\" quality. The mother and her family have a hard life, and the mother's life gets harder as time goes on. The crux of the story happens about halfway through the novel, when she is forced to make a decision she ends up regretting for the rest of her life; she blames her hardships from there on out on that decision, forgetting that the hardships that came before put her in that position. (In other words, this is not a criticism of the novel so much as of the character; it is entirely possible Buck meant the character to be erroneous in her judgments, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.) In essence, the novel becomes the chronicles of the hardships of one person, a relentless, depressing catalog of failures unleavened by any successes whatsoever.<br />Other reviewers have also commented on the universality of the character. I pity them, and anyone else who overidentifies with the mother here. Anyone who has truly suffered this much hardship without the slightest glimmer of joy has been dealt the worst of lots in life, and need all the escapism they can get. It is probable, however, that the majority of readers do, at least, have a few moments of happiness, or at least contentment, now and again. They are rather more likely to question the tunnelvision of the character, and perhaps that of the author as well. Rightly so. * ½yone who has truly suffered this much hardship without the slightest glimmer of joy has been dealt the worst of lots in life, and need all the escapism they can get.

Philip Larkin, The Whitsun Weddings (Faber, 1964)<br />Philip Larkin's fifth collection of poetry, The Whitsun Weddings, was the one that firmly established him as one of Britain's major poets. He remains today one of the best-known and most popular British neoformalists. A devotee of Yeats, Hardy, and Dylan Thomas, Larkin never wears his influences too far away from his sleeve, but don't begrudge him that; marvel, instead, that in the turbulent anything-goes sixties lived a poet, misanthrope, and mild-mannered librarian (all in the same body, no less!) who swam against a stream of free verse and wrote, arguably, better formal verse than anyone since Swinburne.<br />Larkin is a master of enjambment; if you encountered a random Larkin poem isolated from a collection, you might well not realize it's a formal poem until you're well into it, a hallmark of the best formal work. It reads easily and well, and Larkin never allows the meter and rhyme to get in the way of image; in short, Larkin combines the best traits of both lyric and narrative poetry, and packages them up neatly for the reader in small verse of purest pleasure.<br />Okay, I've just spent two paragraphs describing the best of Larkin's work. Thankfully, this collection is more \\"best\\" than \\"worst.\\" But one of the tragedies of the formal poet, and one no formal poet (save, perhaps, Dante Alighieri) has ever been able to avoid, is that when you're not on top of your game, slipping a notch or two down the ladder of quality leads to the steepest of descents. The sublime can become the ridiculous far faster in formal verse than in free verse, leading to a judgment of \\"when he screws up, man, does he REALLY screw up.\\" Such is the case with Larkin. The dulcet tones and free-flowing nature of his best work curdle in the mouth when he's off form, leaving trite rhymes, dull rhythms, and some of the most godawful thumping lines one is likely to see outside Helen Steiner Rice.<br />Still, as I said, there is far less bad than good in The Whitsun Weddings, and it does deserve its place in the annals of British literature. For those who wonder where all the formal verse has gone, Philip Larkin is one of the four or five modern poets to whom anyone can point to say \\"verse may be out of favor, but believe me, it is still alive and well.\\" ***d than good in The Whitsun Weddings, and it does deserve its place in the annals of British literature.

Kaneda Santoka, Mountain Tasting (Weatherhill, 1980)<br />Kaneda Santoka, itinerant Zen monk, storied drunkard, and haiku poet, never achieved the fame in the West as did more traditional haiku poets like Basho and Soseki. Some few admirers of his work have been silently pulling strings offstage to change that, and while it hasn't happened yet, things slowly progress.<br />Santoka was on the cusp of the nontraditional haiku movement when he began writing, and was drawn to the idea of haiku that didn't use seasonal imagery, nor stick to the exact seventeen-line syllable used for traditional haiku in Japan. In the hands of a good enough poet, nontraditional Japanese haiku remain haiku; short, image-laden pieces that beg reflection from the reader while offering a quick view through the eyes of the poet. And Santoka was assuredly a good enough poet.<br />This selection of just over three hundred haiku from his works was, to my knowledge, the first collection of his work published in English (a complete works has been published in Japan, along with a few biographies). Santoka's haiku are deceptively simple, but open farther upon meditation (which is why the books' subtitle calls them \\"Zen haiku,\\" presumably):<br />Going deeper<br />and still deeper<br />the green mountains.<br />or<br />The green grass!<br />I return, barefoot.<br />A wonderful little book, well worth reading.

I didn't even make the fifty-page mark with this turkey, quitting twenty-seven pages in, because Bugeja broke the cardinal rule of poetry in a flagrant and offensive way; while discussing a poem he uses as an example, he writes, \\"...but none of this is important; the only thing that is is what was in [the author]'s head at the time.\\" This is, as any poet half worth his salt knows, not only untrue, but offensive in the extreme. If this is the kind of thing which poetry 101 classes are being fed today, it's no wonder the world is so crammed with people who write bad poetry (one rejects the idea of calling them poets).<br />So why am I giving it the Gentleman's C? Well, because judging from the earlier writings here, when Bugeja isn't flaunting the idea that reader interpretation is meaningless and unimportant, he does have a few things to say worth reading. Also, the book can double as an anthology of poetry stretching from Shakespeare to modern times, and it has some value in that regard. As a teaching tool, though, readers are advised to stay far away until they fully understand that reader interpretation is not only valid, but as valid as author interpretation, of any poem, so as not to be poisoned by such irresponsible statements on the author's part. ** ½	2003-06-20

Ada Jill Schneider, Fine Lines and Other Wrinkles (Gratlau Press, 1993)<br />Ada Jill Schneider is that rarest of birds, a poet who did not start writing until relatively late in life (she penned her first poem at fifty-three) and still managed to achieve a deal of acclaim while still alive. (She is still alive as I write this; those within driving distance of Somerset, MA, can attend her poetry workshops at the Somerset Public Library every Wednesday afternoon, in fact.)<br />The acclaim is quite deserved. As with most of this issue's collections, Fine Lines and Wrinkles can be inconsistent at times, but it does deliver more of the former part of its title than the latter. Schneider, still the enthusiastic youngster when it comes to poetry, gobbles up form dictionaries and tries her hand at various types of formal verse, often with a modicum of success, speckling them amidst simpler formal verse and the odd free verse piece here and there. She rarely loses sight of the importance of the image in writing effective poetry, and her word choice is spot-on 90% of the time or more. All of these ingredients, of course, lead to a pleasurable read. While the work itself doesn't quite have the seasoning to push Schneider's poems from the realm of the very good into the realm of the timeless, there is undeniable power in many of these pieces, and what holds them back does not come off as incompetence, but rather as a charming naivet&eacute;; Schneider's enthusiasm shows through enough to keep the reader on her side. *** ½	2003-06-20

In my opinion, the series had been on a long, albeit gradual, downhill slope before this, and The Pillars of Creation gave it some much-needed revitalization, not to mention a different viewpoint that will no doubt be critical in the upcoming climax to the series.<br />Gone, for the most part, are Richard, Kahlan, and the rest of the bunch you're familiar with if you've been following along for the past nine years. Gone are the armies of the Midlands, Aydindril, the Wizard's Keep, the Mud People, all the things with which we've become familiar. Instead, we are in the heart of southern D'Hara with a young woman named Jennsen and a mysterious traveller who finds her and helps her out of an unexpected jam named Sebastian. (That plot line should sound very familiar, if Wizard's First Rule is still fresh in your mind.) Now, here's the twist; in the backwoods of D'Hara, most of the populace of your average small town isn't even aware Darken Rahl is dead yet, much less that the guy who's taken his place is one of the good guys. Thus, it becomes an understandable leap in logic for Jennsen-who was hunted unsuccessfully from the time of her birth until Darken Rahl's death-to assume that Richard Rahl is going to carry on his father's tradition and keep hunting her. In the opening scene, a D'Haran soldier is dead at the foot of a cliff, having slipped and fallen, and Jennsen realizes the D'Harans have found her again, and it's time to move on...<br />Giving the book a whole new set of characters and a new setting avoids the trap that every book since Blood of the Fold has fallen into of having to use the first hundred pages to rehash old stuff, one of the series' greatest weaknesses. So we get into the action much faster here than in earlier novels. Also, having protagonists who are decidedly anti-Richard not only gives the book a fresh perspective on the events going on in the world but, when Jennsen meets Emperor Jagang, gives us a new perspective on the Emperor's character as well. Instead of the merciless monster he's been portrayed as in the last few books, he becomes almost sympathetic here, and far more human than he has been. This is a great boon to the story, as Jagang has been pretty two-dimensional throughout the series, and cannot help but lend strength to the series' remaining title(s?).<br />A refreshing change from what we'd been used to. Here's to hoping book eight continues back up the hill. *** ½who are decidedly anti-Richard not only gives the book a fresh perspective on the events going on in the world but, when Jennsen meets Emperor Jagang, gives us a new perspective on the Emperor's character as well.

[NOTE: This review is based on an excerpt of the book published as a promo.]<br />Jan Seale, Poems from \\"Sharing the House\\" (The Knowing Press, 1982)<br />Here's an interesting idea: in order to promote your chapbook, take an even smaller selection of the poems in it, have them published by another press, and distribute them for an outrageously low sum in order to give people a sample so they'll go buy the full book. It's blessedly brilliant.<br />Jan Seale did this with a sixteen-page selection of stuff from her second collection, Sharing the House (RiverSedge, 1982). As with Seale's first book, Bonds, the poetry here is sometimes inconsistent, but there is more good than bad, and in fact this small collection rings somewhat truer to the tones of the muse than did Bonds. Seale does more experimentation with traditional forms here, and does them quite well, along with the usual free verse work.<br />Inanimate objects conspire as well:<br />chairs beg to be kicked.<br />Tables scrunch down.<br />Doors slam on privacy.<br />Corners, ceilings, floor tiles<br />make themselves more interesting<br />too look at than you.<br />(\\"Lies, You Wish\\")<br />Seale is a good poet, one worth seeking out if you get the chance; too bad that, like most poets published mostly by small presses, much of her work is out of print. ***	2003-06-20

Lewin, Lamentations (Evanston Publishing, 1993)<br />Thank you, Oscar Wilde, for having the stones to say something that allows the rest of us to quote you and thus not come off sounding like such hard-hearted bastards: \\"all bad poetry is sincere.\\" The problem with reviewing (much less critiquing) bad poetry is that it makes the reviewer, oft-times, feel like an ogre. You pick up a book full of thoroughly awful verse about a topic that it would be heresy to bash. There are an awful lot of bad poems about rape, child molestation, and other such light and airy topics; one need not look far to find a thousand examples. In this case, your obstreperous, bullheaded reviewer is going to take on one hundred twenty-eight pages written by Dr. Roger A. Lewin about the death of his wife and the effect it had on him and his two-year-old daughter. And, so I don't sound like too much of an ogre, let me, dear reader, gently remind you of Wilde's quote, and say that denigration of the work is not denigration of the inspiration of the work.<br />Roger Lewin is a psychiatrist. Roger Lewin is also an exceptionally bad poet. I have no idea if these two things are combined, but I suspect that, at least in Lewin's case, it is. Lewin manages to flaunt all the rules of what makes good poetry, sometimes all of them in a single poem. We have expressionless laundry lists of verbs, we have telling and not showing, bad puns, little psychological tricks, the whole painful mess of teen angst. Which might be forgivable if Lewin were still a teen; one does not want to make assumptions regarding his age, but his late wife would have been forty-nine when the book was published; thus, one guesses his teen days are relatively far behind him. Growing up and gaining life experience has not made the man a better poet.<br />In the great tradition of \\"I don't know art, but I know what I like,\\" a few examples of what I'm talking about above:<br />\\"The range<br />of verbs<br />is too narrow<br />to name<br />my horrified<br />acquiescence<br />in your demise.\\"<br />(\\"Autumn Voice\\")<br />Let me point out the piquancy of word choice here, and say that I have never before seen the phrase \\"horrified acquiescence\\" in a poem. And I hope to never see it in a poem again. (As you may be able to guess from the first few lines of the strophe, this was preceded by, yes, an expressionless laundry list of verbs.)<br />\\"Language<br />is<br />spoken;<br />otherwise<br />it's<br />broken.\\"<br />(\\"My Lips, Your Face\\")<br />Do I need to say anything about that? It's the kind of thing college freshmen should be getting in poetry 101 classes as examples of how not to write poetry.<br />Perhaps the most painful thing about reading a Lewin collection is that on very, very rare occasions, he gets it right. Not in the way an Ira Sadoff or a Debra Allbery gets it right, not with a whole, sustained poem that sings its perfection to the heavens. But he'll come up with a line, or even a whole strophe, that Hilda Doolittle, T. S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound look down and smile upon. The image is concrete, there are no extraneous words; there may still be bad line breaks, but it's as good as Lewin gets:<br />\\"First hard frost<br />like hair spray<br />arrests<br />the willow's branches<br />leaning south and east<br />in memory<br />of last night's breeze.\\"<br />(\\"Soon After My Wife's Death\\")<br />A tad long for haiku, but with the same economy of tone and verbiage. In a hundred-twenty-eight page book, you get more of these minor gems than you do in a smaller book like New Wrinkles, but an increase in pearls guarantees you a greater increase in swine. Ultimately, it's not worth the frustration.<br />The vanity press business has flourished for decades, if not centuries, and one suspect that it's been feeding off the blood of aspiring (and very bad) poets since its very inception. For all I know, poets were the reason for the genesis of the vanity press business. Evanston Publishing (and its more recent and equally loathsome subsidiary, Chicago Spectrum Press) claims it is not a vanity publisher, but someone who takes your money and lets you self-publish using their equipment. (The difference: you, not the press, keep the rights to your work.) It's not exactly a difference of semantics, but the end result is the same. This is the third offering from Evanston/Chicago Spectrum I have had the misfortune to read, and if I remember to check from now on, it will be the last. *, Chicago Spectrum Press) claims it is not a vanity publisher, but someone who takes your money and lets you self-publish using their equipment.

It's certainly got its good points, and just as certainly its bad ones. And yet, there is no feeling of inconsistency in the poems themselves; it's obvious both the good and the bad stem from the same source. Sometimes it just makes you want to shake a writer and say \\"you're almost there. Just fix these things...\\"<br />Seale, who's since been published in most of America's best literary magazines and been an NEA fellowship recipient, seems to have managed to fix them. But in Bonds, which is (as far as I can tell) her first book, they are still evident. And one can find the good and the bad in the same poem all too often, for example:<br />\\"Yes, Virginia, obscurity recorded:<br />the lives of women metered out<br />in a dailiness monumentally unspoken...\\"<br />(\\"Song for Obscure Women\\")<br />...which practically falls all over itself to tell instead of show, juxtaposed with:<br />\\"She asks for a drink.<br />Her hair crescendos on the pillow.<br />I fill the syringe and<br />her tiny embouchure closes on the plastic tip<br />(no silver tone hole today).\\"<br />There is much here to like, but prepare to wade through. ***	2003-06-06

Marti Steussy, Dreams of Dawn (Del Rey, 1988)<br />Steussy's second novel returns us to the same universe as her debut, Forest of the Night. The characters are different, but there are enough similarities to link the two without a problem. This time around, Circle Dawn, sort of the frontiersmen of the colonization movement, are called to a planet where, it seems, humans may have inadvertently broken the nonaggression treaty with the native race, the Karg; Kargan hatchlings are dying on their way through the change to adulthood. The book jacket goes much farther into the plot than this, but explaining the how and why of things would be, to me, a spoiler; you'll just have to read the thing.<br />I originally thought Dreams of Dawn was just getting off to a slow start, but what seemed to be a lack of ability to pace a novel is more Steussy's writing style. This is not necessarily surprising, considering her nonfiction publications (anyone seeing a title like Gardens in Babylon: Narrative Faith in the Greek Legends of Daniel, who has ever been exposed to literary criticism, will likely pull out the dictionary before even cracking the cover). And it can be a stumbling block for some readers, no doubt. But Steussy's strengths belie the weaknesses of pacing and somewhat leaden explication; her characters are very well-developed, the plot does move along (albeit slowly), and her ability to build tension under these conditions is somewhat, well, remarkable. By the time you're a quarter of the way through the novel, you're still in character development mode, and while the main problem has been advanced, Circle Dawn haven't really started the quest to figure out what the problem is yet... and you don't care. You're too busy getting to know these people. And liking them, for the most part. They help mask the relatively recycled plot and its underlying very recycled theme (to Steussy's credit, she never crosses the line between recycled and clich&eacute;, and never gets preachy on us; no one in the novel ever actually hugs a tree).<br />\\"Compelling\\" is not the right word to use for this novel, thanks to its leisureliness, but it kept me reading well enough.

Ron Hubbard, Typewriter in the Sky (Bridge, 1940)<br />Why I continue to dabble in the writings of good old Elron is completely beyond me. Perhaps it is because his writing style is the kind that will let you breeze through a two-hundred-page hardback in an afternoon. Or maybe to remind myself why I read so little forties pulp sci-fi. I don't know.<br />Typewriter in the Sky is, above all, the story of Horace Hackett, a very bad pulp fiction writer during the Depression. Horace has a friend named Mike de Wolf, a down-on-his-luck pianist with an upcoming audition. As we open, Horace is trying to fend off his agent, who wants a book and wants it pronto. Horace comes up with the idea, the plot, and the plot twists (all of which, we get the idea from his agent, are old news), and models his villain on Mike, who happens to be in the apartment at the time. All well and good, until Mike finds himself actually living out the novel as Hackett writes it, able to hear the keys going in some other dimension (the typewriter in the sky of the title).<br />All of this would be painful, were Hubbard not to inject some details to make it, well, funny. De Wolf, in his seventeenth-century swashbuckling Spaniard incarnation, has a habit of noticing things Hackett doesn't research or puts out of place (for example, de Wolf stays the night in 1642 in a castle not built until the 1700s, and finds a 1900s Steinway in another building), while every once in a while we go back to the present day and listen to Hackett agonizing over his book. The end result is saved from awfulness by a sense of self-deprecation.<br />Unfortunately, said sense of self-deprecation is not applied to Hubbard's own writing. The book is chock-full of painful one-sentence paragraphs, overloaded with exclamation points, and other such pulp conventions stolen from the pens of G. A. Henty and his contemporaries. They are slightly forgivable thanks to the humor, but that doesn't make the book any less painful a read.<br />Quick, easy, but not all that good. **<br />Quick, easy, but not all that good. **	2003-06-06

The missing wife might be dead...or she might be an accomplice to a string of serial killings. People keep turning up dead. And somehow, a fitness guru factors into it all. Everything's set up perfectly.<br />Then it all goes down the tubes. The last fifty pages or so of this novel have \\"Hollywood ending\\" written all over them, as if just before he started writing them, Grippando got word that this book had been optioned, and he had to come up with an ending that would work in Hollywood. The whole tone changes; what would have taken two hundred pages earlier in the novel is rushed into far less than half that. Aside from the lack of wires and big masks, a lot of the ending has \\"deus ex machina\\" stamped on it.<br />That's not to say it's not worth reading for the first three quarters of the book.

Terry Goodkind, Faith of the Fallen (Tor, 2000)<br />We are six books into the Sword of Truth series, and one fact has become undeniable. The farther along you are in the series, the more time Goodkind is going to spend reprising old stuff. It's starting to feel almost as if he's not refreshing the readers' memories of past events, but his own. When you've gotten a hundred fifty pages into a just-over-five-hundred-page novel before anything actually happens, you're probably in trouble.<br />Once the action picks up, though, it rolls along much like the Sword of Truth books of yore. Jagang has taken Anderith (in Book five), led a bloodless revolution in the Westlands, which are now loyal to him (Between Books Five and Six, implied in the first scenes of Book Six), and is poised to make an attack on the Midlands, an attack which Richard, commander of the D'Haran Empire, refuses to challenge, fearing the people cannot be led; they must crush the revolt themselves. As the book opens, Kahlan has been attacked and badly beaten by a number of people Richard grew up with; their loyalty to the Order has overrideen their friendship, forcing Richard, Kahlan, and their guardian Cara into the high, secluded forest of the western Westlands. While there, Richard is trapped by an old foe, leaving Kahlan and Cara to their own devices. Meanwhile, many of the other characters who have splintered off are touched on (the only one conspicuous in his absence is Nathan, the prophet, who is in hiding), sometimes only briefly, and a few new twists are added. (One expects to be seeing a lot more of The Healers in the remaining books.)<br />This should sound somewhat familiar to viewers of daytime television. Yes, the Sword of Truth is becoming quite the soap opera. And while the writing continues to be strong and easy reading, it's becoming more predictable as time goes on. Simply put, the quality is going down, and I fear for the next novel (which many fans of the series seem to regard as the nadir), The Pillars of Creation.

Here, we have Hawkmoon and Yisselda, the only survivors of the battle of Londra, married for five years, and with two children. During a moment of reflection, Hawkmoon opines that he'd give anything to have his old friend Count Brass, Yisselda's father, back. The story then turns into a \\"be careful what you wish for\\" fable, as the townsfolk of Aigues-Mortes start reporting the ghostly figure of Count Brass haunting the town cemetery, swearing to kill Hawkmoon. Hawkmoon goes to meet the challenge, and when he finds Count Brass, the two of them have to figure out why the Count-twenty years younger and unable to remember any of his long association with Hawkmoon-has been sent from the grave to kill his dearest friend.<br />As with the rest of the series, there is much here to delight the Moorcock fan and more than enough to bring in the lover of sword and sorcery novels who hasn't yet encountered Moorcock somehow.

Richard Jackson, The Dismantling of Time in Contemporary Poetry (U. of Alabama Press, 1988)<br />Yes, I did finally finish this book. Took me two days shy of nine months to do so, but I did.<br />It should be no surprise from the title of this work that Richard Jackson is a deconstructionist. All meaning, all perception, is arbitrary. Keeping that in mind, especially in the first sections (where it's not quite so evident), is a very good idea when reading Jackson. Here, he takes the work of six poets and focuses on the way they view time to resolve the seeming paradox of how narrative poetry, which takes place within a specific timeframe, can achieve timelessness.<br />The easiest way to write this review is to say he succeeds, but harder is to get across exactly how he does that. It strikes me that in creating a book that attempts to resolve the question, he has actually created a different conundrum. As poetry's purpose is to express the inexpressible, Jackson has also expressed the inexpressible in his deconstruction of poetry (which, if course, makes it very hard to express). There isn't necessarily a specific method Jackson uses in his analysis, but he ends up with the feeling that, yes, the question has been answered.<br />Much is made by one reviewer on the book's jacket about the book's accessibility. Caveat lector. The person writing the blurb has been reading too many academic journals and not enough popular nonfiction, one thinks. The Dismantling of Time in Contemporary Poetry is, arguably, an easier read than most pieces of literary criticism, in that it doesn't require the reader to sit with a dictionary and have to look up three or four words per page. It is still, however, thick writing that requires a great deal of concentration to understand, and from that point of view, it is just as difficult reading as, say, Kristeva's Pouvrirs de l'Horreur or Greimas' Structural Semantics.<br />A good, solid piece of research for those who like to go below the surface of their poetry. *** ½urface of their poetry. *** ½	2003-05-27

China Mieville, Perdido Street Station (Del Rey, 2000)<br />Mieville has created a monster with this novel, a beautifully dystopian science fiction setting quite unlike any other I've ever encountered. The world of New Crobuzon is populated by many strange and exotic races (humans among them, of course), and it radiates outwards from the train station of the title, constantly expanding, sprawling out into the countryside from beneath the ribs of some giant, long-extinct creature.<br />To go into the plot at all would require a number of spoilers, as it twists and turns its way through this gargantuan masterpiece and spawns new threads on a fairly constant basis. But the novel begins and ends with two characters: Isaac, a brilliant, somewhat mad, scientist who keeps himself in equipment by contracting to (and stealing from) the university he left a decade before, and Yagharek, a garuda (woughly, a bird-man) from the Cymek desert, thousands of miles away. Yagharek comes to Isaac in disgrace, having had his wings stripped from him for crimes committed in his own country, and asks Isaac to find some method of getting him to fly again. Now if that were the whole novel, it would probably be somewhat boring (though Mieville can write like a big dog, and could probably have pulled it off). But there is much more to it, pulling in multiple levels of drawing-room drama, automatons that think for themselves, some very nasty beasts, New Crobuzonian history, and much more.<br />Mieville handles the whole thing with the most deft of hands, and never allows the book to get away from him. His attention to detail is stunning, especially in a twentysomething writer who's onto just his second novel. No threads are left untied, and in some situations where he has a choice of knots, he never takes the emotionally or intellectually easy way out, giving the book a sense of moral and ethical rightness that's lacking in most modern fiction.<br />A wonderful book that will easily make my ten best reads this year. *****best reads this year. *****	2003-05-27

William Bernard McCarthy, The Ballad Matrix: Personality, Milieu, and the Oral Tradition (U. of Indiana Press, 1990)<br />After reading McCarthy's small book about the ballads of Agnes Lyle, one is likely to think that the Scots ballad tradition is more reminiscent of modern death metal than \\"Danny Boy.\\" Ms. Lyle was a very angry sort of lass, it would seem, and the twenty-three ballads McCarthy examines (collected by J. F. Child in the nineteenth century, and presumably comprising Lyle's entire repertoire) are a rather nasty, brutish, depressing lot. McCarthy does mention that the ballads the singer chooses to sing are often a reflection of her temperament, and mentioned a few other singers in the Child writings who have a much better outlook on life.<br />That said, McCarthy's study of the oral tradition in Scots ballads is a fun and fascinating one. Now this is an academic study that is readable by a layperson, and accessible to the common man. McCarthy introduces us to the main schools of thought on ballad creation and composition in the introduction, then goes on to examine the Lyle texts in order to get a more objective view of the actual creation process. He never gets bogged down in jargon and never goes off into the academic heights preferred by many of his contemporaries on the literary criticism scene. He starts out without a case to make, but by the end, he's made one anyway.<br />All in all, one of the best pieces of literary criticism I've read. A number of authors could take a few tips from McCarthy's writing style-make it readable and more people, hopefully, will read it. ****	2003-05-27

Darcy Steinke, Suicide Blonde (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1992)<br />`ware the media event-book, film, whatever it may be-that is presented as something \\"in the tradition of.\\" Robert Olmstead says on the back cover of Steinke's second novel that it is in the tradition of Djuna Barnes, Georges Bataille, and Marguerite Duras; certainly the kind of recommendationt hat is going to get under the skin of any connoisseur of enlightened pornography. Unfortunately, \\"in the tradition of\\" does not mean \\"comparable to.\\"<br />Steinke gives us the life of Jesse, a woman who is, as she says, \\"attracted to people who make me feel inadequate.\\" Her lover, Bell, is obsessed with a former schoolmate he hasn't seen in ten years. She realizes she's falling into the same routine to try and keep him interested that her mother used to do the same with her father, but is unable to break the cycle, just sit and watch it in a kind of disinterested existential horror. Such might be refreshing to someone who's never read a book of its ilk before, and to be fair, upon its publication ten years ago the dysfunctional-main-character novel had not become nearly as prevalent a theme as it is now. But it certainly doesn't rouse like Bataille or Duras does, and Steinke doesn't have the chops to pull off the world-weary existential crisis the way someone like Kathe Koja does. Even her sex scenes have the same detached feel. Duras used the mechanism, but created feeling in the reader underneath with pacing, sentence structure, and word choice, all things of which she was a master; none are in evidence here. Not worth the time. (zero)	2003-05-27

Harlan Coben, One False Move (Delacorte, 1998)<br />Harlan Coben's fourth novel, and the fourth in the Myron Bolitar series, One False Move gives Coben a new client with bad surroundings. (Surprise, surprise, eh?) Brenda Slaughter is the star player in the new Women's Professional Basketball League. WPBL head Norm Zuckerman wants Bolitar to represent Slaughter, since her father, who had managed her career up till a week before, had gone missing. Slaughter's mother had done the same twenty years before. It doesn't take long for Bolitar to realize that, somehow, the two disappearances are connected, and that both disappearances are somehow connected to Myron's old nemeses the Ache brothers. Hilarity, as they say, ensues.<br />Readers of the Bolitar novels will be used to Myron being a bit too much of a wiseguy. Once you get past that, this is a good, solid novel that comes slightly unwrapped at the end (Coben wraps up the main mystery nicely enough, but there are some pretty big loose ends). As usual, Coben keeps the pages turning with the best of them, and the book flies by. The characters are well-developed, and as long as you don't mind a main character who makes Spenser look like a prophet of doom, Coben's books should be right up your alley. Give them a try. *** ½	2003-05-07

John Godey, The Talisman (Berkley, 1976)<br />Way back when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, I read John Godey's The Snake. Well, I read part of it. I thought the parts about the snake wandering around central park threatening people were bang-up, but the rest of it was rather boring. Now, some twenty-odd years later, I decide to give Godey another try to see if he's as good (and as inconsistent) as I remember.<br />At least where The Talisman is concerned, the answer is a solid \\"no\\" on both counts. Godey's tale of disenfranchised Vietnam vets kidnapping the Unknown Soldier could, in theory, be more unexciting than it is. I don't know how off the top of my head, but I'm sure if William J. Coughlin had written it, it would be worse than this.<br />On second thought, no, I don't think so.

Nawal el Saadawi, God Dies by the Nile (Zed, 1974)<br />Nawal el Saadawi, Egyptian doctor, feminist, and activist, has written close to thirty books, spent time in prison for being a subversive, and for more than forty years has been a leader of progressive thinking in Egypt. So why is she almost unknown in America? Im not entirely sure anyone can answer that question completely. Better to just try and correct the problem.<br />God Dies by the Nile, originally published in Egypt in 1974, is the story of a family living across the street from the mayor of the peasant village of Kafr el Teen, along the banks of the Nile. We learn early on that the Mayor is a nasty fellow, and with his three cronies (the village doctor, the Captain of the Guard, and the head of the mosque), he controls all the power in the village. Needless to say, he uses this power for the most corrupt of ends.<br />Zakeya is the titular head of the family across the street. Four years ago, her son Galal went off to fight at Suez, and has never been heard from again. Her brother, a widower, and his two daughters, Nefissa and Zeinab, live with Zakeya. The four of them work in the fields, as does everyone else in the village, until a summons comes from the Mayor: if Nefissa will work in his house as a maid, he will pay the family an almost unimaginable sum per month. Nefissa goes. All this happens before the beginning of the story (but its better than doing the synopsis on the back of the Zed paperback, which is truly a synopsisright up to the final chapter, a spoiler extraordinaire). After Nefissa runs away, the Mayor becomes taken with Zeinab, and the whole painful cycle begins again.<br />God Dies by the Nile is worth reading to the American reader for the same reasons as most other African novels: to get a sense of how similar we are in our cultures despite the various differences in them. Apart from that, while the writing is a tad on the clunky side (this could easily be a problem of translation rather than the original work), the book, which clocks in at a slight 108 pages, is an easy and somewhat compelling read in the vein of classical metatragedy (meta- in that the agents of tragedy here are human, and thus the protagonists can do something about them). El Saadawis characters are wonderfully drawn, for the most part, and the differences in culture mean little when characters are drawn in this detail; you get a feel for the body language of the characters, and what it means, even if it is unfamiliar to you. In this is the books largest weakness; el Saadawi is so excellent at drawing these characters and showing us their feelings and motivations that when she reiterates them explicitly, shes redoing a job shes already done very well, and so the book tends to slow with repetition now and again. Still, that makes it no less pleasurable, if a story this tragic can be in any way pleasurable. ***nslation rather than the original work), the book, which clocks in at a slight 108 pages, is an easy and somewhat compelling read in the vein of classical metatragedy (meta- in that the agents of tragedy here are human, and thus the protagonists can do something about them).

Bob Larson, Abaddon (Nelson, 1993)<br />Bob Larson's Abaddon, the sequel to his novel Dead Air, is possibly the funniest book I have read in the past decade. In many ways, Larson reminds me of the kind of televangelist who's out to get ratings and nothing else; he attacks popular culture (even when it's not really popular, as in this case), does just enough research to get some glitzy facts, and then either makes up the rest or completely misunderstands what he's seeing as he goes along. And like said televangelists, Larson's work is always good for a long, loud laugh when you most need it.<br />This time, we find Wes Bryant (according to a few reviews and interviews, a character Larson based on himself), his new wife Annette, and her daughter Jennifer in Colorado, where Wes is the GM of an all-talk radio station. His main competition is KZOO, a rock station no one who's listened to the radio since the advent of Howard Stern won't recognize, a morass of shock DJs and awful music. With a twist: the station plays death metal. In heavy rotation. Okay, THAT'S new. (Larson does, to his credit, mention very late in the novel that most radio stations don't.) KZOO is sponsoring a Night Sacrifice show on Halloween night, and Bryant, whose stepdaughter is falling under the spell of Night Sacrifice, has singer Clint Blade come into his studio for a dust-up with his most popular talk-show host. Bryant ends up confronting Blade over the air himself, and, disturbed by what he sees (and the depths to which his stepdaughter is getting into the stuff), starts researching the phenomenon that is death metal.<br />Yes, there is a mystery here, although what that mystery is one isn't sure until the final few pages. Nuff said about that.<br />The true humor in the book comes from Larson's complete and utter misinterpretation of his readings (one hesitates to say his experiences) on both death metal and psychology. Now, to be fair, such landmark tomes as Lords of Chaos had not yet been released when Larson wrote this book. But still, one figures a guy who goes over to Boyd Rice's house for dinner on a sporadic basis is going to know a little more about underground music and the motivations behind it than the average bear. And for all I know, Bob Larson is actually an expert in the subject; it just doesn't come through here. His occult research seems a bit lacking as well (e.g., his description of a Book of Shadows, confusing a pentagram and a symbol of Baphomet, and various other hilarity-inducing niggles), but not in nearly the scope as the others.<br />Larson might well have been able to use this book to address the real reasons for the underground popularity of the death metal movement, but instead, he takes a rather more dangerous path-attributing a love of death metal to, of all things, multiple personality disorder, and then going on to assert that MPD is a common and easily-controlled (by the enemy, of course-the good guys will have to spend years curing it, but the enemy can make new personalities appear almost at will!) disease. Hopefully those who have read this do remember that this is fiction, and that multiple personality disorder is a rare and very difficult disease. Not something to be flippant with, one would think, when an author is trying to assert deeper truths. But there you go. I could have even bought that Larson was using MPD as a metaphor for disaffectation and apathy--wouldn't be the first time such things have happened--if not for the acknowledgements page, which should have been placed after the text so as not to mention the MPD angle the book ends up taking (I'd not have included it here had it not been spoiled on the very first page of the book, before the text even begins).<br />Unfortunately, my humor fades when I realize that Larson's target audience is probably taking this stuff seriously. Those who would like a better look into the phenomenon of underground music and the reasons for its existence are encouraged to look to nonfiction by and about the artists themselves. The aforementioned Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground is a landmark; American Hardcore: A Tribal History, Apocalypse Culture, and such biographies as Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs are all well worth seeking out. The soon-to-be-released England's Hidden Reverse holds much promise as well.<br />Abaddon, on the other hand, gets * ½ for amusement value and absolutely zilch for accuracy, writing skill, characterization, unpredictability, or anything else remotely related to writing a good novel.look to nonfiction by and about the artists themselves.

Robert Atkins, Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution (Quill, 2002)<br />Well, you can't beat the Atkins Diet for sheer number of coverts. Millions of people are following the Atkins Nutritional Plan, and all of them seem to be losing weight. The only \\"official\\" bureau to have come out against it has been exposed as a lunatic fringe of militant vegan doctors, and once again all is right with the world. Or is it?<br />I'm not going to deny that the book is accurate in its claims of helping people lose weight. It sometimes seems that everyone in the country knows two or three people who are on the Atkins Diet. I know, casually, seven (and those are just the ones whose eating habits I know). Of those seven, I know four who have been on it for more than two months, and all four have lost significant amounts of weight. Can't argue with stats like that. And most of the scientific stuff the late doctor puts in the book is backed up with an almost endless list of scientific papers and abstracts listed in the back. Hard to argue with that. In those places where the science is still somewhat in the future, he goes to pains to point that out, saying certain things are still in question, or are still being researched. All well and good, and on the surface it looks fantastic.<br />The problem is that one irrationality can throw the whole thing into question. And there is one. It is a glaring one for any professional skeptic. (Before writing this review, I wrote to the Atkins Center folks for confirmation that the Atkins people espouse the beliefs below, and I received a response in the affirmative.) Dr. Atkins and his professional followers are believers in what professional followers of urban legends have come to call the Aspartame Lie. There is a small, and very vocal, segment of the American population who believe, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary, that aspartame is the Great Satan, and causes everything from cancer to multiple sclerosis. All claims have been refuted multiple times (Amazon does not allow the posting of exterior links in reviews, or I'd send the same fifty or so links I sent to the Atkins Center), and yet Atkins holds onto the belief, saying there are \\"questions about aspartame's safety.\\" One has to think that if the man is still holding to a view espoused only by a few so far out on the lunatic fringe they're liable to fall off a tassel, there may be some other urban legend-style skeletons farther down in the man's closet. Everyone reading this book, and adopting the Atkins Nutritional Plan, is encouraged to do as much research as necessary to convince yourself that he's on the money. And because of the belief Atkins holds in the junk science of the dangers of aspartame, \\"none\\" is not, in any way, an option.ultiple times (Amazon does not allow the posting of exterior links in reviews, or I'd send the same fifty or so links I sent to the Atkins Center), and yet Atkins holds onto the belief, saying there are \\"questions about aspartame's safety.\\" One has to think that if the man is still holding to a view espoused only by a few so far out on the lunatic fringe they're liable to fall off a tassel, there may be some other urban legend-style skeletons farther down in the man's closet.

Michael Moorcock, The Champion of Garathorm (Berkley, 1973)<br />Moorcock continues the Chronicles of Castle Brass with this odd little novel, perhaps one of the riskiest novels of Moorcock's career. Dorian Hawkmoon, united with his old friends, has paid a deep price-the loss of his wife and children. Or did he ever have them in the first place? Many at Castle Brass say he's been mad for the past five years, inventing the marriage and children after the death of his betrothed at the Battle of Londra (in the novel The Runestaff). Brought back to what they consider sanity by the arrival of a guest, an old friend of Count Brass', Hawkmoon feels that adventuring may be the best thing for him, and goes off into what is certainly the eternal champion's oddest adventure yet.<br />The oddities begin about a third of the way into the book, and explaining them would be impossible without major plot spoilers. Suffice to say that originally, the oddities seem as if Moorcock has just spliced together-badly-a series of unrelated stories. Such is not the case. Everything ties together, and as strand after strand comes full circle, the reader will get the idea of what Moorcock is on about. Once the whole weave is in place, the picture is staggering. ****	2003-05-05

Michael Moorcock, The Runestaff (DAW, 1969)<br />Ah, you may think the adventures of good old Dorian Hawkmoon come to an end with the fourth and final novel of the Runestaff. Likely, so did Moorcock (the fifth book in the series, the start of a new trilogy, wasn't released for another four years, while these four were released over a period of a little more than twelve months). Now, with everything in place, it's time for Hawkmoon and his friend Huillam d'Averc to seek out the Runestaff itself. Problem is, Hawkmoon isn't fond of the idea; he'd rather go back to Castle Brass for a spell and see the rest of his friends. In the course of his erratic journey, we meet a new main character, Orland Fank (the brother of Hawkmoon's longtime advisor The Warrior in Jet and Gold), a few brand-new monstrosities, and the like. The series comes to a conclusion that is surprisingly, in retrospect, satisfying; had Moorcock never taken up the pen and applied it to Hawkmoon again, readers of the series would likely have been satisfied with what's here.  Well, perhaps \\"satisfied\\" is not the correct word; longtime fans of the Eternal Champion books will understand what I mean. In either case, a good conclusion to the series, and one of the more worthwhile books in Moorcock's vast (and expanding) repertoire. ****	2003-05-05

Cavafy, Complete Poems (Harvest, 1961)<br />In his introduction to this book, W. H. Auden repeatedly stresses that there are elements in the poems of Cavafy, \\"the foremost modern Greek poet\\" (in the defense of the publisher, Seferis and Ritsos had not yet emerged as major forces, and Odysseus Elytis was still a few years away from winning the Nobel Prize), that are untranslatable. That is true (as he goes on to say) about most works in translation, but when Auden describes the structure of Cavafy's work, the red flags should start going off in your head. \\"No one can speak of Cavafy's imagery, for simile and metaphor are devices he never uses...\\" The astute reader of poetry will likely ask the question, \\"so then, what makes it poetry, and not prose broken up into lines?\\"<br />In Greek, the answer to that question is \\"rhythm and rhyme.\\" Cavafy is a formalist, perhaps one of the last modern masters of form poetry. The problem is, that doesn't translate (especially in this translation, by Rae Dalven) into English, and the effect becomes that of reading a disjointed, pseudo-erotic History of Greece rather than a book of poetry. Cavafy's wit and subtlety are completely lost, as is any attempt to show the original framework on which the words hang, and which, in this poetry, is so very important:<br />The joy and essence of my life is the memory of the hours<br />when I found and sustained sensual delight as I desired it.<br />The joy and essence of my life for me, who abhorred<br />every enjoyment of routine loves.<br />--\\"Sensual Delight\\"<br />The sad truth is, while in Greek it's a rhymed poem where each line is fifteen syllables, in English it would have a hard time getting published as an aphorism, much less a poem.<br />Perhaps a better translation of Cavafy's work has emerged in the intervening forty years; between reading this and leaving Cavafy's work untranslated, the better option would have been the latter. **	2003-05-05

Eileen Goudge, Garden of Lies (Signet, 1989)<br />This book was, upon its release, not just a sensation; it posted numbers that scandalized the publishing world. How on earth could a romance, of all things, sell like this? Almost fifteen years in the future, we can look back and snicker at our naïvet&eacute;, of course. The last piece of the genre fiction puzzle gained respectability, and now Danielle Steel, Sandra Brown, and Nora Roberts sit atop the bestseller lists as comfortably as do King, Clancy, and Grisham. Steel was already on the brink of megastardom (and was, of course, a megastar in the romance world long beforehand), but most, if not all, other romance writers owe a great deal of their present respect in the world of modern literature to Eileen Goudges debut novel.<br />Garden of Lies is the torrid tale of two girls switched at birth. After ones mother dies in a hospital fire, Sylvie, the mother of the other, switches the two babies in order to prevent her spouse from realizing her actual daughter is the product of an affair. The two girls, Rose (Sylvies natural daughter) and Rachel (Sylvies adopted daughter), lead oddly parallel lives despite their vast gulfs in economic and social status. Through a series of coincidences, the two both end up in love with the same man, and the close ties both have to him threaten to reveal Sylvies long-held secret.<br />The first thing to say about this novel, as any romance novel, is to benchmark it against the doyenne. And Garden of Lies is so much better than the works of Danielle Steel that they may as well not be on the same planet. Aside from the proofreading (Ive never yet encountered a Danielle Steel novel that looks as if it had been proofread at all), Goudge seems to have turned her back on the cookie-cutter philosophy of genre fiction (simply stated, create character who fits plot, insert here). Not that you havent seen this plot and these characters before, but unlike most straight genre fiction, Goudges characters are three-dimensional, they react to the plot as if they were actually reacting to it instead of doing what thousands of cookie-cutter characters have done before them, and when they emote, theyre not giving us dialogue straight out of the pages of the scripts for The Guiding Light. Refreshing, to say the least.<br />This epic (and really, when a romance novel goes over 500 pages, its acceptable to call it an epic, no?) has a whole lot going for it. Its probably best to have your suspension-of-disbelief mode set pretty high; there are a few okay, thats too coincidental events, and the whole stretch that takes place in Vietnam is too pat. But by the time you hit either of the above, the novel is barrel-racing along too fast for you to stop and compare Goudges jungle to, say, Lucius Shepards, you only have time to hang on and enjoy the ride. A rollercoaster aint a rocket, either, but its still fun.<br />Garden of Lies has rightly carved itself a place in the history of the modern romance novel. Probably the best of the bunch Ive encountered since the glory days of Stephanie Blake in the early eighties. Definitely worth your time if youre looking for a good, easy summer read. *** ½ght genre fiction, Goudges characters are three-dimensional, they react to the plot as if they were actually reacting to it instead of doing what thousands of cookie-cutter characters have done before them, and when they emote, theyre not giving us dialogue straight out of the pages of the scripts for The Guiding Light.

Dennis Lehane, Gone, Baby, Gone (Morrow, 1998)<br />Lehane clocks in with the fourth novel in the Kenzie and Gennaro series with his most intricate plot and satisfying novel so far. In this one, Kenzie and Gennaro are bullied into taking the case of a missing four-year-old by the girl's aunt. The mother seems not to care much about her child's whereabouts when she's not in front of the TV cameras, preferring to watch television and drink beer with her best friend and next door neighbor. What's already an atypical missing persons case gets weirder and weirder as Kenzie and Gennaro, working with a couple of Boston cops named Poole and Broussard, peel off layer after layer that links the case to organized crime, drug dealing, a two-hundred-thousand dollar heist, and imprisoned renegade mob boss Cheese Olamon, a schoolyard acquaintance of Kenzie's.<br />While the moralizing of A Drink Before the War is back (though far more subdued here) and Lehane seems to buy into the urban myth of the ever-present Child Molester on Every Corner, such concerns for the intent of the author tend to fall by the wayside when a mystery is so intricately plotted. Red herrings fly thick and fast, the case twists and turns with startling frequency, no one is in any way happy, and ghosts of old cases the two have worked return to haunt them with regularity as they bump heads over and over again with higher-ups in the Boston and state police departments. It is the skill with which the mystery is plotted, and Lehane's affable writing style, that keeps this book from falling into the one-trick-pony trap of a Jonathan Kellerman or an Andrew Vachss. Lehane finally made a solid name for himself with the success of Mystic River two years ago; here's to hoping fans of that novel will come back and discover the Kenzie and Gennaro novels, some of the best neo-noir writing there is to be had today. ****	2003-05-05

He is pulled into a land of limbo suddenly while on a journey to Londra, there to find himself with his old friend Jhary-a-Conel, and the two of them adrift in a boat. They soon work out that they are in limbo, and have been sent there for a particular purpose...<br />Readers of the Eternal Champion novels will no doubt remember Hawkmoon popping up in various places throughout where he doesn't seem to have ever gone before in the series dedicated to him. Well, here it all is; the battle with Agak and Gagak (and what happens afterwards, when whichever manifestation of the Champion the series in question revolves around leaves Hawkmoon and his coterie in the ruins), the boat on the seas of limbo and its odd, blind crew; the whole mess. (One point, for those who have read the Elric series; how the Runestaff itself ends up in the tower of Voilodion Gaghnasdiak is never explained.)<br />All in all, the series draws to a satisfying conclusion, with the events coming in the most logical time flow they ever do in the eternal champion novels, and with the final mystery of the deaths of the gods, presented at the end of the first Corum trilogy, solved. Everyone (well almost everyone) who has survived ends up happy, and all is right with the Universe. Or so we think. ****	2003-05-05

Maj Ragain, Twist the Axe: A Horseplayers Story (Bottom Dog Press, 2001)<br />Twist the Axe is the best book Ive read this year, a conglomeration of Ragains writings on racehorses and the culture surrounding them culled from many years of work. This book collects previously published and unpublished work, poems, stories, journals, and the odd drawing or two, pairing them with newspaper clippings, result charts, family trees, and just about anything else one could think of. Ragain can lay claim to being one of the ten or twenty best poets working in America today; his distinctive poetic style, the storytelling diction Williams tried and failed to achieve time after time, meshes with the juxtaposed images of hopeless, cheap horses and the memories they raise. On one level, of course, its all about the horses; on another level, its about the rest of life.<br />Ragain never makes the reader dig too far; there are layers beneath, of course, for those who want to pursue them, but the average John Q. will certainly be able to understand the connections in Morning Line;<br />Jim Henson, father beard of muppets,<br />died of bacterial pneumonia, May 17, 1990.<br />The next day at Thistledown, fifth race,<br />a mare named Big Time Bird went off,<br />unacknowledged, at odds of 134 to 1.<br />Big Time Bird ran the race of her life,<br />drenched in and driven by grief,<br />the hot lasix of tears.<br />She finished second, a half length short,<br />beaten by a horse named Woman in Love.<br />You will never figure out this one.<br />This is one of those books that, if anyone outside the world of poetry knew of its existence, might have the power to draw thousands back into the fold. It is understandable, perfectly written, accessible not only to the poetry junkie but to the average reader. For most people, its a pleasurable new world; for the chosen few who have been lucky enough to have been reading Ragains books for longer, it will be another rest stop on the way to Paradise. They are all too few (this is Ragains fifth book, with the first published in 1979), and should be eagerly devoured, once found. *****aradise.

Michael Moorcock, The Sword of the Dawn (DAW, 1968)<br />First, to get it out of the way: the worst, absolutely unforgivably worst, thing about the 1968 DAW edition of The Sword of the Dawn is its unforgivably bad cover. It's so bad I actually knocked half a point off the book's final rating. DAW, who usually came up with top-notch artists to do Moorcock covers, really dropped the ball in the Runestaff series, and this is the nadir. Cover it, school-textbook style, before reading.<br />That said, the book itself is top-notch, one of the better novels in the whole Eternal Champion cycle. Dorian Hawkmoon, reluctant servant of the Runestaff and another incarnation of the Eternal Champion, is off on the quest to find the last piece of the puzzle he needs to strike back at the Granbretanian army, an artifact called the Sword of the Dawn. Needless to say, getting his hands on it will not be easy...<br />The same cast of characters from the first two novels returns, along with some throwaway characters, a new villain or two, and all the adventure one could possibly want. As well, The Sword of the Dawn is set on a new continent in the purview of the Eternal Champion, Amarehk (yes, it is what you think it is), and Moorcock's descriptions of the city of Nawlin (yes, it's at the delta of the big river) are perhaps the most detailed urban descriptions in the whole series.<br />The novel could probably stand on its own without too much of the ongoing plot being lost, but aspiring Moorcock readers are encouraged to read the whole series (preferably after those of Elric, Corum, and Erekose, at least). ****	2003-05-05

Harlan Coben, No Second Chance (Dutton, 2003)<br />Harlan Coben checks in with his ninth novel, No Second Chance. With all the publicity surrounding his last novel, Coben has become something of a household name in the Internet comunity, but the larger non-hardcore-mystery-reading book community has probably never heard the name. I'd like to say that No Second Chance will be the book that will change all that, but it probably won't. Not to say it isn't a good, solid read.<br />Marc Seidman, his wife Monica, and their six month old daughter Tara live in New Jersey, not far from New York City. They are not the perfect family, but they get along, like most families do. That is, until one night when Marc is standing at the kitchen sink eating a granola bar and takes two shots. He wakes up twelve days later in the ICU, his bedside flanked with a nurse and a police detective. From the two of them, he learns that his wife is dead, his daughter is missing, and he's been unconscious and presumed a vegetable for the past twelve days. Faced with the knowledge that most kidnapping cases turn very, very cold when the child's been missing for over seventy-two hours, Seidman and his best friend and lawyer, Lenny, set about trying to accomplish the impossible: finding his daughter.<br />First, the good things about this book. It's an easy read and a compelling one; the kind of book that will lure you in for an hour or two without you realizing any time has passed. The plot is well-done and intricate, and Coben keeps the pages turning nicely with plot twist after plot twist. Just when I thought I had it figured out, it turned tail and went flying in another direction; always a good thing in a mystery novel. And in genre fiction of this stripe, that's usually the most important thing; it is here.<br />The bad things about it are, in most cases, minor niggles rather than major disasters. The characters seem well drawn enough, but there's something missing from them; they're not as complex as they could be. Seidman's father-in-law, Edgar Portman, is just a little too evil; Lenny plays the sidekick role just a bit too well, etc. They're not exactly stereotypes, but they're only one step removed. This shouldn't be a problem for any Mickey Spillane fans in the audience. Also, Seidman plays the wiseass just a bit too much, as if he were a combination of Spenser and Mike Hammer with a practice in reconstructive surgery on the side. Sometimes, this is a good thing. Coben has an eye for quotidian detail that many other mystery writers leave out; Seidman and others in the novel from whom we see points of view have a knack for describing the kinds of things most of ues see out of the corners of their eyes and quickly forget, giving many scenes an astonishing level of realism. On the other hand, when you've read enough pages of Marc Seidman, he can get exasperating. One of the book's villians tells Seidman during a phone conversation that the villian has noticed Seidman has a tendency to get cute when he's tangling with the opposition. This is all too true, and after a while it can frustrate even the most dedicated person rooting for the underdog. Also, Coben falls into the \\"we need pages of explanation at the end for the reader\\" trap that really annoys me.<br />That said, those are certainly not reasons not to give this one a good going-over once it's released.

Andrew Browne, Sunbirds #1: Beginnings (Writer's Showcase, 2001)<br />Andrew Browne is a young Canadian writer just starting to make his mark in fantasy literature. And while the first novel of his Sunbirds series has the potential to make a mark, it falls short in places.<br />The tragic thing about this is that where Sunbirds falls short is not in the places where most fantasy novels fall short. His plot is an excellent one, and a wonderfully original twist on a time-honored genre; his characters are well-fleshed and alive (and perhaps unwittingly, Browne chose perhaps the most difficult way to create characters; more on this later), and the book is quite well-paced. Overall, from the standpoint of the major pitfalls, the book is a joy to read. Were it not for a few key weaknesses, I would hope it'd be atop the young adult book charts at your local bookstore.<br />The problem is that the book's flaws lie not in its art, but in its craft. Sunbirds runs roughshod over many of the rules of fiction. This is not necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but an author who breaks the rules should always tip his hand, wink at the reader, and make sure he communicates that he knows there are rules, and that he's breaking them. Browne doesn't do this at all. And to be fair, once he gets into the swing of things, the craft of his writing improves almost to the level of his art. But the opening pages are full of subtle things, subtle enough that the casual reader is likely not to catch them, only to get a vague feeling that something is wrong. For example, in the first chapter, while Andrew is describing his main human character in the hatchery, Browne goes into a simple overview of the breeding of peacocks. A wonderful idea, and a passage that is likely to appeal to both children and adults (after all, how many of us have actually raised domesticated peacocks?). In his enthusiasm for his subject, however, Browne breaks protocol and starts directly addressing the reader in a third-person-narrative tale. It's jarring, to say the least.<br />But if you are a reader who is capable of ignoring the craft of writing and concentrating on the art (and their numbers, I despair, increase daily), or one who is willing to overlook such errors and assume Browne's craft will improve to the level of his art with age (the camp I am in), then Sunbirds #1: Beginnings is definitely worth a look. The story concerns a peacock farm. The peacocks there (along with, goes the inference, all birds the world over) are intelligent and communicate on a level that humans are incapable of understanding. The peacocks are approached one day by the beetles. After some back and forth of each side trying to convince the other of their harmlessness, the beetles attempt to enlist the peacocks in a battle against the flies, who are trying to take over the world. (One wonders why Michael Moorcock didn't come up with this in the sixties. It's simple. It's brilliant. And is there really a human being on the planet who likes flies?) The peacocks vacillate, but their de facto leader suddenly finds he has a good reason to be moved off the fence...<br />I spent a good deal of time talking about the bad here, so I should spend just as much time highlighting the good. Browne's writing is enthusiastic; he obviously loves being a writer. As I've said, his material is original, his pacing is excellent, and he's very good at plot development. His greatest achievement may be in foreshadowing, and plotting four or five moves ahead of where he needs to be; his revelations of previously set up details would be more in place in very well-done mystery novels than in science fiction (and that is a compliment). Browne never fails to leave you a trail of breadcrumbs, but he hides them well enough that the ravens won't come and eat them. There are far too many adult novelists who could learn a trick or two<br />from this rising star.<br />A fine beginning, and one which will lead me to seek out the restof the series.

Ann Patchett, Bel Canto (Harper, 2001)<br />I have spent quite a while mulling this over, and have finally come to the conclusion that, patterned after Greek tragic opera or not, I can't forgive Ann Patchett for the climax of this novel. Much of that has to do with the beginning of the novel; I'd have been inclined to be more forgiving had the first hundred pages not moved at a snail's pace. But the book finally picked up, everything was going along swimmingly, and then, suddenly, bam-the most predictable possible climax.<br />The story is based on accounts of the guerrilla takeover of the Peruvian embassy in 1992, but Patchett moves the action to another, unnamed, South American country and adds a few extra ingredients into the mix. In Patchett's story, opera singer Roxane Coss has been lured to the embassy for the birthday party of a wealthy Japanese industrialist whom the country hopes will build a factory there. During the festivities, the guerrillas invade, and a hostage situation begins. It drags on, and soon the strict militarism with which the siege begins evolves into a more relaxed system, where the line between terrorist and hostage begins to blur.<br />It's after that line begins to blur that the book really takes hold. The original three chapters, that describe the scene and introduce us to most of the main characters, are painfully slow. Patchett hits her stride, and the book takes off. For the middle two hundred pages, it's easy to see why the book won the Orange Prize and was shortlisted for so many others.<br />Then comes the climax. My initial reaction is that it was the biggest letdown I'd had in a novel in a number of years, and that's saying something. After some discussion, I tried to accept it as the pace and events of the book being modeled on Greek tragic opera (where such clich&eacute;s as the climax of this novel were coined). I don't know enough about Greek tragic opera to really make a judgment one way or the other as to the accuracy of Patchett's patterning. I do know that in modern reinterpretations of older works (think Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres for an excellent example), what we often change is what has become clich&eacute;d in the years since the work was originally written. Such is not the case here, and it certainly kept me from enjoying the book as a whole as much as I otherwise would have.<br />Great middle. Mediocre beginning. Awful ending. Still, the hundred pages that are worth saving are remarkable, and worth the price of admission. ** ½ett's patterning.

Michael Moorcock, The Jewel in the Skull (DAW, 1967)<br />Dorian Hawkmoon, the last Duke of Koln, is another of Moorcock's instances of the Eternal Champion. Hawkmoon's tales are especially amusing, as the world on which Hawkmoon adventures is the nearest allegory to the world we know in Moorcock's sword-and-sorcery writing.<br />Count Brass, protector of the south-Provence country of Kamarg, is content to be left in peace in his castle as the Dark Empire sweeps down over Europe from the island nation of Granbretan. His neutrality is questioned by an emissary from Granbretan, Baron Meliadus. While Meliadus is at Brass' castle, he falls in love with Brass' daughter Yisselda, and attempts to kidnap her. Meliadus is forcibly ejected from the Kamarg, and begins to plot revenge.<br />That's where Hawkmoon enters the story, but to say how would be to spoil the fun. Read it for yourself.<br />The Hawkmoon novels are, of the \\"classic\\" Eternal Champion books (Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon, John Daker, and Erekose), those which best approach the brilliance of the Elric series. Where the problems lie in the DAW editions are in the pervasive and annoying typographical errors. Someone at DAW was asleep at the wheel the day The Jewel in the Skull landed on their desk. Hardly a page goes by without an ugly typo that, if the reader is skimming, will change the meaning of a sentence.  Very sloppy work from the publisher. Unfortunately, Murphy's Law dictates that the better the book, the more likely this sort of thing is to happen. And make no mistake, The Jewel in the Skull is a very good book.

Hawkmoon, with the immediate dangers of the first novel neutralized, wants nothing more than to return to the Kamarg and his friends. Of course, this is fantasy literature, where nothing is simple. He gets sidetracked a couple of times, we spend some more time in the company of the mysterious Warrior in Jet and Gold, things blow up, old enemies return, new enemies crop up, and then there's the Mad God of the title. All of which, of course, happens at the same time that the full might of Granbretan's army marches on the Kamarg, the last European outpost of independence against the depraved King-Emperor Huon.<br /><br />Fun stuff. Very easy reading. All the womderful things I said about the first book still apply. Unfortunately, so do the pervasive typographical errors in the DAW editions. Whoever was asleep at the wheel the first time must have lapsed into a coma, because they are even more frequent here.

After that, she sinks into exactly the emotional mess for which she criticized friends earlier. Murphy's Law reigns throughout. Hilarity ensues.<br />The main good thing about the book: it's a fast, easy read. Excellent beach material.<br />The two main bad things about the book (they tied for first): the stereotypical treatment of women (and the inferred belittling of those who choose to stay single) and the homily- and clich&eacute;-laden last few pages.<br />Thankfully, the stereotyping is mostly at the beginning and the clich&eacute; flinging is mostly at the end, so the bulk of the book can be read without fear that you're going to turn the next page and be offended by a particularly bad choice of words. You still run the risk of being offended by Wolf's neurotic protagonist's actions, but try to remember: this is comedy. It really IS funny. There are overtones of My Big Fat reek Wedding, but with Andrea Martin (long may her career suffer) as a scheming, evil grandmother instead of a maiden aunt. And no members of `N Sync show up anywhere in the novel, which is always a big plus. ** ½	2003-04-04

April Carter, The Political Theory of Anarchism (Harper, 1971)<br />A slim book, but a very difficult read. Carter's survey of the anarchist movement over the past couple of hundred years isn't comprehensive, but it's enough to show even the casual reader that the image of the anarchist in the popular imagination is completely backwards. In fact, the vision of anarchy presented by the sources Carter gives us here (everyone from Marx to Bakunin) sounds quite a bit like hard-right American conservatism. Yes, go back and read that again, you heard me right.  This book is a must-read for all true American conservatives (i.e., those who still believe in government decentralism and haven't fallen under the sway of the religious right). Many of the ideas here are more modern takes on those presented in Mill, de Tocqueville, and other writers who should inhabit the shelf of sacred writings for every conservative; the anarchists have already done much of the necessary work in updating them for a technological world, all you have to do is follow along for the ride and further modify them for the information age.

Michael Moorcock, The Chronicles of Corum (Berkley, 1973)<br />Moorcock returns to the world of the Eternal Champion, in the guise of Corum, then rips him out of it. Over a thousand years after the events of the last novels, Corum has become worshipped as a demigod. His followers summon him  into their time to do battle with extraplanar beings of (at most) animal intelligence known as the Cold Gods. The Cold Gods are dying, slowly, but they have every intention of taking all of humanity with them.<br />Together with the last of the Sidhi, a race of magic-using nonhumans roughly akin to elves in most fantasy worlds, Corum and those who worship him go to do battle with another force bent on destroying the planet.<br />The plot may get old, especially when so many fantasy novels by so many authors revolve around it. But it's still fun to read and easy to deal with. As with the first part of Corum's epic (The Swords Trilogy), Moorcock doesn't take as many chances with fantasy conventions as he does in the Elric novels, and so these are slightly less challenging to the reader's conceptions of what's \\"supposed\\" to happen in fantasy novels.

James Reese, The Book of Shadows (Morrow, 2002)<br /><br />James Reese's debut novel gives us nineteenth-century France's dark side in a grisly, but often interesting, way. Herculine sees the unexpected, ugly death of her mother just before she's consigned to a convent. There, being studious, she becomes the mother superior's pet. When the mother superior's rather diabolic niece comes to stay, she is put into Herculine's care and tutelage. The girl ends up getting them both into a world of trouble, the end result of which drives much of the rest of the novel (the summary here takes in the first hundred pages or so). The book is lush, lavishly-researched, and a pleasure overall to read.<br /><br />Where it fails, and this is a minor point for some people, is in its lack of consistency in pacing. A number of portions of the story are told in extended flashbacks, and each of these moves far slower than the rest of the novel, making it tough going in some places. While Reese's love of flowery language never fails, and his words are a joy to read, the switching in pace is somewhat jarring at times. Also, it seems as if pieces were missing--especially at least one scene that should have come after the book ends. Still, it is a fine debut effort from an author whose next book could cement his place on the front line<br />of the new, atmospheric horror novel. *** 1/2	2003-03-30

Sheldon Harris, Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare 1932-45 and the American Cover-Up (Second Edition) (Routledge, 2002)<br />During the time of the Great Depression in America, and up through the end of World War II, the Japanese medical corps, operating through the imperialist Kwantung Army, conducted thousands of biological warfare experiments on live human subjects. These subjects were primarily Chinese peasants convicted of petty crimes, but also included, as WW2 wore on, prisoners of war and non-criminal Chinese. For over forty years, these facts were kept an almost complete secret from the general public; glancing references would surface now and again, or a slick TV documentary would pop up for a British of Korean version of the TV magazines that are those countries parallels to something like 20-20 in America. No one treated the subject in depth; no one knew how to get enough proof. Even the Chinese government, when it attempted a full-length film documentary, was unable to come up with enough information (their aborted attempt was made into a fictional film, the notorious Men Behind the Sun).<br />Then came Williams and Wallace and their book Unit 731. Seven years later, Sheldon Harris expanded greatly on Williams and Wallaces knowledge with the definitive text on Unit 731s war crimes, Factories of Death. Another seven years has gone by since, and Harris and Routledge have released a second edition of Factories of Death that contains the updated information from documents that have been declassified since. As time goes on, the book gets even more horrifying.<br />Unlike Williams and Wallace or Hal Gold (whose book Unit 731: Testimony is a brilliant, if anecdotal, complement to this work), Harris keeps his feet rooted firmly on the ground, keeping any conjecture to the most logical conclusions to be drawn from the facts at hand. Gold, for example, speculates in Unit 731: Testimony that both MacArthur and Truman were fully aware of the America cover-up of Unit 731s activities; Harris refrains from even hinting at such a thing until all the evidence is completely laid out, and even then, he only glancingly makes reference to then-President Truman at all. Because of this loathness to speculate, when Harris does let the cork out and start ranting (which happens only very briefly, at the end of the penultimate chapter), some of the teeth are taken out of his vituperation; hes just not willing to go where he needs to go. One might cynically think that the stronger language that haunts the last third of the penultimate chapter is there simply because ranting sells and scholarship doesnt. (That said, those reviewers who have noted the books dryness are right, to an extent, but anyone who considers this painfully dry should try reading any other book Routledge has ever released. This is a John Grisham novel in comparison, going by readability. I was surprised, and pleased, at how quickly the book flew by, given its imprint.)<br />That same failing is Harris greatest sin here; not one of commission, but of omission. Other books on Unit 731 have raised a number of questioning specters that Harris doesnt touch on at all, including a few for which there is smoking-gun evidence (use of American biological warfare in North Korea in the 1950s that has Ishii Shiros stamp on it, the biological munitions plant at Hiroshima that led to Americas bombing of that city in 1945, etc.). It could reasonably be concluded that Harris didnt think the evidence was sufficient to warrant mentioning them in the text, but even the casual Unit 731 scholar is sure to have heard the allegations; better, if youre writing the definitive piece of scholarship, to address them rather than leave them<br />twisting in the wind.<br />Still, an excellent piece of work, one that history buffs are well advised to seek out. Schoolchildren (for this material is definitely in need of dissemination) could do with an abridged version; those who seek this out because they loved Men Behind the Sun should probably stick with the film unless theyre used to reading nonfiction.

It might not be the Pulitzer or the National Book Award, but there's something out there for just about everyone. In this case, Debra Weinstein's collection Rodent Angel won the Mamdouha S. Bobst Literary Award (or the Elmer Holmes Bobst Literary Award, depending on whether you're reading the cover or the awards page), presented to \\"individuals who have brought true distinction to the American literary scene.\\" It then goes on to list a few of the former recipients, including Toni Morrison, John Updike, Joyce Carol Oates, and Edward Albee, among others. The three winners for 1996 were Weinstein (poetry), Lori Baker (short stories), and Don Judson (novella). I doubt anyone is likely to equate the three latter names with the four former, on the scale of literary and popular reputation. Having now read Weinstein's spare collection for the second time, I can see where the comparison might well be warranted from a strictly empirical point of view.<br />Winstein's poetry is a powerful thing, full of visceral images that practically steam off the page:<br />...I remember fearing<br />it would coast down Broadview Drive<br />with me in tow, fearing<br />the squirrel who would<br />climb into a carriage and suck<br />a baby's face<br />for milk....<br />Put enough of this together in a manuscript, even if that manuscript is only seventy-two pages long, and it's bound to make an impression. Certainly, in its darkness, comparisons to the work of Oates are warranted.<br />Weinstein's weakest point is in repetition. There is a fine line, admittedly, between a book of one's work exploring a theme and a book of one's work being repetitive. And perhaps what brings out the repetition in this one is the very strength and shock of the images mentioned above as a strength; when one of the images to which the poet returns is a dead squirrel on the sidewalk, it makes one hell of a stronger impression than does, say, Philip Levine's use of rain. However, one way or the other, there are places where Weinstein definitely crosses the line; the best example of this being the two line poem \\"Mother Eye:\\"<br />You said, \\"A woman loves her child more<br />than her husband.\\" You did not say \\"I.\\"<br />...compared with a piece of the book's central piece, \\"In the Year of the Stopped Car:\\"<br />\\"A woman loves her child<br />more than her husband.\\"<br />My mother sat me on the queen-<br />sized bed. \\"Let's keep<br />this our secret,\\" she said.<br />It is, of course, possible (if not obligatory) to pull off that kind of repetition in a long poem; in a manuscript of short poems, especially when they are quick, imagist blasts like the poems here, it comes off as a weakness instead of a strength.<br />That said, there is much here for the reader with a stronger stomach than most to appreciate. Weinstein has a fine command of language, to be sure, and the work here is liable to stick with a reader long after the turn of the final page. One that has had me looking for another book from Weinstein since I first bought it back in 1997. ***es to which the poet returns is a dead squirrel on the sidewalk, it makes one hell of a stronger impression than does, say, Philip Levine's use of rain.

Still sounds like Coonts.	...Stephen Coonts dips his toes into the waters of science fiction and comes up with what he does best-a techno-thriller. Rip, a college student summering as a geological survey worker, spots a gleam under the sand in the middle of the Sahara desert, and from such auspicious beginnings he unearths a seventy-foot, hundred forty thousand year old flying saucer. Everyone from a band of Australian mercenaries to the Libyan government knows about it, and wants it, within forty-eight hours. Rip's got himself a dilemma-how to get the saucer out of the hands of the various agencies who want it?<br /><br />The Saucer is exactly the kind of turn-your-brain-off entertainment one expects from Stephen Coonts, and he delivers in spades. All the plot pieces are there, all the trappings (including the gorgeous sidekick, of course), all the loose-end-tying at the end. This is perfect beach reading. It never breaks formula, and the pages don't stop turning until you hit the last one. A good, solid read. ***	2003-03-30

Michael Moorcock, The Swords Trilogy (Berkley, 1971)<br />Michael Moorcock here introduces us to another aspect of the Eternal Champion, Corum of the Scarlet Robe. Corum fits the Eternal Champion mold well in the first three books of this six-book series-he's a chap who's rather like the rest of his race, normal from that perspective, but whose race is somewhat divorced from (older than, as are Elric's race) the humans who share a planet with them. While devoid of supernatural powers himself, he gains them in the pursuance of a quest. Also like Elric, Corum's destiny, in the first books, is shaped by the Dukes of Hell-Arioch, Xiombarg, and Mabelrode. He also has a trusty sidekick (in this case, Jhary-a-Conel, who does make a brief appearance with Corum at the very end of The Vanishing Tower in the Elric series). In other words, you've got an inkling of what's going on here simply because this is an Eternal Champion series and you've already read the Elric books. (You have, haven't you? If not, go do so.)<br />Moorcock does throw in a few elements to keep you guessing. Corum serves Law, rather than Chaos (as Elric does), and doesn't have any of the fatal weaknesses at the beginning of the book that other manifestations of the Champion do. The variations lead to great musing from the reader over the true nature of the Eternal Champion and why it's so changeable. While this is an excellent thing, and raises the stakes for the whole extended family of books, these three tales themselves (available separately as The Knight of the Swords, The Queen of the Swords, and the King of the Swords) often follow the same formulae as the Elric novels, and thus become predictable. That doesn't make them any less fun. But one wonders whether there could have been something more to them, that ineffable something that sent the Elric novels to heights unmatched in fantasy since J. R. R. Tolkein. Whatever it is, there's far less of it here. *** ½	2003-02-25

Paolo Maurensig, The Luneburg Variation (FSG, 1993)<br /><br />Talk about brushing greatness. Paolo Maurensig's first novel comes so close it could probably smell the fetid, decaying breath of greatness on its shoulder, then turned away at the last minute. to leave the reader with an almost palpable feeling of something being missing.<br /><br />Maurensig sets things up beautifully, opening with the discovery of the body of a chess magazine editor in his garden. When the police can't decide if it were murder or suicide, the death is labelled \\"mysterious circumstances\\" and filed away. We then travel back in time to a few hours before the man's death and are given the circumstances surrounding it. This happens in two extended flashbacks, the first of the victim's long train ride to his country estate, the second the story of a legendary chess player during world war II. (There is much more to these, but to reveal more details of them would set off a chain of unforgivable spoilers.)<br /><br />All works quite nicely, and everything is going along swimmingly, until you get to the book's last page and wonder where the final present-day scene, the one the whole book begs for, went. It's certainly not in the book. It's possible the author left it out in order to preserve the \\"mysterious circumstances\\" surrounding the editor's death, but in that case, why write the rest of the book?<br /><br />Maurensig has been compared to Friedrich Durrenmatt on a number of occasions. From the perspective of writing style, the comparison may well be justified; both seem fond of brief, straightforward novels with mysteries at their center about which the greatest question is \\"why\\" rather than \\"who?\\" (Heinrich Boll is another author who does this very well.) However, Durrenmatt is capable of handing the reader all the clues and letting him work things out; Maurensig left out a few pieces of this puzzle, and it makes the book, ultimately, a frustrating exercise. ** 1/2	2003-02-25

Valerie Wolzien, All Hallows' Evil (Fawcett, 1992)<br />All Hallows' Evil was my first, and very likely last, foray into the world of Valerie Wolzien's bedroom community of Hancock, Connecticut. Not necessarily because the book was bad, or the mystery wasn't workable. It's the little niggling details that really dropped the ball here.<br />Amateur sleuth Susan Henshaw is at the library one Halloween day when she stumbles upon a body in the stacks. It looks like a prop, but turns out not to be. Later on, the town's newest celeb, morning talk show host Jason Armstrong, turns up dead on his own front porch. Obviously, something is not right in the town of Hancock. Susan and her sidekick Kathleeen, with a little help from the town's new sheriff, get to work trying to figure out whodunit.<br />All well and good, to be sure. Nothing we haven't seen and enjoyed in a passel of other mystery novels. What sets this one apart is some painful sentence construction, grammatical errors that are too consistent to be editors' mistakes, and some continuity errors that are almost painful to behold (my favorite: about two-thirds of the way through the novel, Susan gets home late. Her husband immediately jumps up and says, \\"Where have you been? I was worried about you?\\" They barely have time to get another two sentences in the conversation before Susan asks him why he wasn't worried, and he not only admits to it, but then goes on to offer up a valuable clue. Oops.)<br />You may be better off sticking with that passel of other mystery novels. Stylewise, the first name that came to mind when I tried to think of a comparison was Marcia Muller; if you enjoy Wolzien's work but have been bothered by the niggles above, you might want to give Muller a try. ** ½	2003-02-25

Michael Moorcock, The Sailor on the Seas of Fate (DAW, 1974)<br />The second novel of the Elric series picks up where the first left off. (There is one major detail regarding Elric's betrothed, Cymoril, that seems to have shifted back in time, but Moorcock resolves it later; still, it seems to have been something of a gaffe.) Here we are introduced, for those who have never read any of Moorcock's other fantasy series, to the idea of the Eternal Champion, and that many of Moorcock's heroes and antiheroes are facets of the same personality throughout time and space. Moorcock meets up with three other incarnations of the Eternal Champion-Corum, Hawkmoon, and Erekose. (Excellent advertising for the other series, whether intended that way or not.) Things get confusing here, as some of the others mention events that haven't happened yet in the Elric series, but just ride with it. It'll all come clear eventually. Needless to say, having read (or reading just after the Elric books) the Hawkoon, Corum, and Erekose series will deepen one's appreciation for this part of the Elric series.<br />The main complaint I have about Moorcock's writing, while not to be found solely in this novel, is most notable here. Moorcock's action scenes, for all that they are some of the book's turning points, are often described minimally, even sparely. The climax of a battle is often given one sentence, as is the death of a companion, no matter how long that companion has known the characters in the story. (I have made mention many times of what I call characters who enter stories with \\"kill me now\\" tattooed on their foreheads. This is the opposite extreme-Moorcock will sometimes spend chapters building up a character, only to treat him as if he did have \\"kill me now\\" tattooed on his forehead. It can be disconcerting, to say the least.)<br />Still, the originalities in the premise, the unique take on the antihero along with the whole concept of the Eternal Champion, coupled with the simple readability of the series, make them all worth picking up. Each can be gotten through in a single afternoon, for most people. ****ability of the series, make them all worth picking up.

Kathy Reichs, Death du Jour (Arrow, 1999)<br />Death du Jour is the first book I've read in 2003 that made me want to not put it down until I had turned the final page. It's well over twice as long as most of the novels I've read over the course of this year, and yet it took me less time than many of them to get through. It does have its problems, but readability is certainly not one of them.<br />Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist who divides her time between North Carolina and Quebec, is in the latter province as the story opens, sifting through the supposed grave of a nun who is being proposed for beatification. Things don't go as planned. Not long after she gets home, she's called to the scene of a devastating house fire to check out a few more bodies. Things don't go as planned. She gets caught up in the twin mysteries of the nun and the house fire, and off we go.<br />The best thing about the book is its compelling readability. Reichs makes her work unputdownable through throwing clues, monkeywrenches, and events at the reader nonstop from the first chapter till the last. There's never a let-up, no pause for breathing. And this in a novel that tops four hundred pages; it's like making an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick that runs six hours. Few people are going to try, fewer still will succeed. Reichs manages it well here.<br />The bad thing about the book, and yes, there is one, is its predictability. There are many points in the book where something happens and it's obvious to the reader how the event connects into the whole puzzle, even while it escapes the police, the main character, and everyone else in the novel. When it comes right down to it, the mystery isn't really much of a mystery; it's more a police procedural than anything else. Or it would be if it weren't trying so hard to be a mystery.<br />Still, that's not a reason to dismiss a book that hooks a reader this quickly and this decisively. Death du Jour is the perfect way to kill a weekend, a fast-paced, easy read that will make the hours fly by as you wander through the world of Tempe Brennan. ****weekend, a fast-paced, easy read that will make the hours fly by as you wander through the world of Tempe Brennan. ****	2003-02-03

Holt, When We Dead Awaken (Bantam, 1990)<br />It may be stretching it a bit to stick John Holt's wonderful first novel into my ongoing re-reads of 1980s horror novels, since it was published in 1990. Indulge me for a few minutes, though, because When We Dead Awaken was one of the finest horror novels published during the decade, even if Bantam missed the cutoff by a few months. Holt's novel still has the feel of eighties horror; it's still wrapped up in old legends and ghosties/ghoulies/long-leggetie beasties that go bump in the night instead of taking the decidedly ecological turn that has been the basis of much of the horror fiction of the past fifteen years. It's gloriously awash in excess (without hitting the pitch that splatterpunk would only a year or so later), while the language used to convey it is minimal, almost journalistic. You know, eighties horror fiction. Holt was deserving of being among the decade's great lights with this novel, but for whatever reason you care to blame, it never made a huge splash. Lack of advertising dollar by the publisher is usually a good punching bag. We'll go with that one.<br />Holt's novel takes another old, almost-forgotten legend revived by the upswing in popularity of Dungeons and Dragons, the revenant, and puts a savage spin on it. By legend, the revenant is the avenging ghost of someone against whom a great wrong was committed, let loose upon the earth to achieve vengeance. Such is the case here, except the great wrong to the ghost in question is all in his mind. What happens when your revenant is insane? Very bad things.<br />The story centers around a family-owned motorcycle sales and repair shop in Florida. One of the members of the family, Billy, a mechanic in the repair shop, went nuts a year before the story opens and killed his wife and child before dying himself (the story is intentionally vague in the beginning as to whether Billy's death was suicide, accident, or murder; it's revealed later on). Billy, never the nicest person to be around, has gotten a whole lot worse after death. He's had a year to do nothing but lie around and nurture his hatred for those who he thinks wronged him over the years. And when something brings him back to the point where his consciousness can affect things in the living world, there's going to be some trouble.<br />The plot, the action, and the delivery are nothing special, though Holt throws in a few twists and turns that are unpredictable (layering them, quite cleverly, right under the predictable ones). Those aren't the reason this book deserves to still be around in a hundred years. What really makes this thing tick is the development of the characters and Holt's mastery at revealing the right details at the right times. Why is Billy nuts? And why, when his kid is the only thing in the world he cares about, would he suddenly decide to go on a bloody rampage that specifically targets his own family? Why is there such a love/hate relationship between Billy and is brother? The reader will be asking all the right questions by the end of the first chapter, and Holt knows exactly how long to let them drag on in order not only to heighten the reader's pleasure when the answers are finally revealed, but to highlight the depth and complexity of his own creations.<br />An excellent book. Hard to find these days, but well worth tracking down for the horror fan. Holt deserves a far wider audience than he's got. ****y, never the nicest person to be around, has gotten a whole lot worse after death.

Michael Moorcock, The Blood Red Game (Dale Press, 1970)<br />I found it odd that this book was the only one by Dale Press in my collection until I cracked the cover. Hopefully, Dale have gone out of business, but not before a long, tortured obscurity. I'd say a year for every typo in this book, but were that the case, they'd still be around well into the twenty-second century, and we can't have that.<br />Typos that a week-old dead cockroach would have caught aside, the book itself is pretty standard Moorcock. Fans of the eternal champion will feel right at home in this particular science fiction universe; while it would be stretching things somewhat to call any of the protagonists here an aspect of the eternal champion, they're most certainly on a quest (though they don't realize it at first) for Tanelorn, the eternal city.<br />The book starts with three old acquaintances, Renark, Asquiol, and Talfryn. Renark is a former government employee with a price on his head, Asquiol a prince who was forced to abdicate, and Talfryn is, well, just along for the ride. As we open, the three of them are on a lawless planet near the rim of the galaxy, waiting for the legendary coming of a planetary system which pops into existence now and then, a place all the lawless wait for. After all, if you hop into a different planetary system that's not a part of your universe, it's not going to be subject to the same laws, right? The system comes, the three of them take off, and the real fun begins.<br />The hard part of reviewing a book like this is that a plot synopsis is impossible. The above paragraph takes you through well under a quarter of the book, but to say anything else would be a spoiler. You'll just have to read for yourself. Yes, the title does come to make sense, but only in the last third of the book or thereabouts, and there's a lot of ground in between the two.<br />One interesting thing about The Blood Red Game, in relation to the other Moorcock novels I've read over the past few months. Moorcock is a writer who seems more concerned with description and plot advancement rather than mysterious subplots most of the time. In The Blood Red Game, however, Moorcock holds a few things back to spring on you in the grand Agatha Christie tradition; no one is what they seem, and no one's part is quite what it first appears to be. It's somewhat jarring, and pleasurably so, to find in a Moorcock novel.<br />It's slightly less readable than the Elric novels, but that may be a personal preference thing more than anything; I almost always find science fiction harder than fantasy. This is, to my experience so far, a rare treat where Moorcock is concerned, and a fine one. ****the past few months.

And when reading Blunt's first novel, the reader who is a Law and Order fan is likely to know, even without knowing Blunt's allegiance to the show, that there are similarities. Needless to say, for the Law and Order fan, this means you've pretty much got a free pass on this one; you're going to love it.<br />John Cardinal is a cop with his career in the toilet and a clinically depressed wife. His usual partner is tied up in court on another case, so Cardinal is assigned another one, Lise Delorme, who's just come to homicide from Special Bureau (Americans, think \\"internal affairs\\"). Cardinal, who some folks in the branch suspect of being crooked, immediately suspects she's been paired with him in order to investigate him. But he's got too much on his plate to spend much time worrying about that; first, his wife goes into the hospital with a particularly nasty bout of depression. Second, a body is found in a mineshaft, believed to be that of Katie Pine, a missing girl whom Cardinal always suspected of being murdered; his obsession with her case got him demoted from homicide in the first place. Who can worry about whether you're being investigated by your partner or not?<br />Perhaps the most intriguing thing about Forty Words for Sorrow is the tension between Cardinal and Delorme, and trying to decide whether a romance is getting underway. The two of them are very deftly handled, and while they seesaw back and forth between being nice to one another and loathing one another, there's never a sense that anything is being exaggerated for the reader; the perils of having a new partner, and one of the opposite sex.<br />That said, the best-written scenes in the book are those between Cardinal and his wife in the hospital. Cardinal is hopelessly adrift, completely unsure of how to handle himself around her as she struggles in the mire of her depression. Both characters are painted spot-on in these scenes, and they alone are enough to warrant the purchase price of the book.<br />What's missing from the above two paragraphs is the mystery itself. And, ultimately, the mystery takes a back seat to the characters. This is not a bad thing, as long as the characters can sustain the novel (and they certainly do here). But the end result is that the mystery becomes somewhat predictable, especially for regular watchers of (you knew I'd get round to it sooner or later) Law and Order. The twists and turns in the plot will be easily recognizable to the show's rabid cult following. Again, not that this is a bad thing; in fact, regular Law and Order viewers have come to expect this, and will feel right at home. (Non-regular viewers, or those who have never seen the show, may not find anything here predictable at all.)<br />A good, solid work, Forty Words for Sorrow, a promising debut from a promising writer. John Cardinal is coming back soon in Blunt's second novel, and if the first one is anything to go on, it will be just as well worth reading. *** ½e of how to handle himself around her as she struggles in the mire of her depression.

Michael Moorcock, The Vanishing Tower (DAW, 1970)<br />Some wag is bound to notice the odd release dates on the DAW definitive editions of the six \\"classic\\" Elric novels and ask \\"what's up?\\" It only starts making sense when you pair the books with the events therein; Moorcock makes mention of the events in The Vanishing Tower, for example, in The Sailor on the Seas of Fate (q.v.). Those events hadn't yet taken place in Elric's time, as Elric notes in The Sailor on the Seas of Fate; however, they had already taken place in Corum's time. And so yes, it does make some semblance of sense that the definitive Vanishing Tower was released four years before the definitive Sailor on the Seas of Fate. If that sounds confusing, well, it is. Trust me when I tell you that Moorock makes the whole thing as clear as possible. And it does make sense, in the greater scheme of the story.<br />The Vanishing Tower is where the divergent pieces of Elric's saga are weaved into a single tale; the saga of Elric's dealings with Melnibonë, his homeland, related in books one and three, and the saga of his journeys through the Young Kingdoms (as Melnibonëans call the rest of the world), related in book two, come together in book four.<br />Elric and his surviving countrymen are stateless wanderers, mercenaries hated and feared by those in the Young Kingdoms whom they dominated for ten thousand years. Elric is apart from the others (a rogue mercenary band led by Elric's childhood friend, Dyvim Tvar); he and his companion Moonglum are occupied by their own problems, most of the time. One of those problems is the desire if the rest of the surviving Melnibonëans to see Elric's head on a spear. But aside from that, Elric's patron deity, Arioch, is becoming more and more loath to help Elric, his actorios ring, his last link to the ancient dynasty of Melnibonë, has been stolen by the king of Nadsokor, city of beggars, and Elric, unused to life as a regular wanderer, has no concept of fiduciary responsibility. (That one tends to be a minor worry, as Moonglum is quite an accomplished thief, and there are no lack of people willing to employ the most powerful sorceror on the planet as a mercenary.) All of these factors weave in and out of the fourth book in the novel, coupled with all the usual strengths and weaknesses of Moorcock's writing in this series, culminating in Elric finally getting to the tower of the title and discovering yet another piece of his fate. It is here that Moorcock throws the series' most intriguing twist into play, but to mention the nature of that twist would be quite the spoiler; you'll just have to read the series for yourself. ****sponsibility.

1250695:US	50068216	RB5UAPU1MXB1X	0441888054	972695419	The Weird of the White Wolf (Elric Saga)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	3 of 6: Back to Melnibone	Michael Moorcock, The Weird of the White Wolf (DAW, 1977)<br />The third book in the Elric series introduces the reader to Moonglum, Elric's longtime companion (and, thanks to AD&D's Deities and Demigods book, the companion most readers can't imagine him without). Much of the second novel moved away from the events of the first, and concentrated Elric's character on other adventures. The Weird of the White Wolf brings Elric back to Melnibonë along with Moonglum, their friend Smiorgan Baldhead, and an army of raiders bent on overthrowing Yyrkoon, who stole the throne when Elric left Melnibonë for a year to travel the world. For those wondering, whether you've read the book or not: the \\"weird\\" of the title is an archaic definition of the term, given by Merriam Webster as \\"One's assigned lot or fortune, especially when evil.\\" And when he finds it, he's not all that happy about it. But that's to be expected when one's antihero has a crisis of conscience, I guess.<br />Certainly not a slow book by any means, nor a weak one in the context of the series. And it's definitely a necessity as a prelude to what comes after it. But I still felt there was something missing here; some pieces of description left out, a few places where things could have been filled in better. All of the Elric novels are short, to say the least (Stormbringer, the last and longest of them, clocks in a 217pp.), and feel as if they could use some fleshing out; this one, however, gives that feeling the most. One wonders if the brevity of them was not the insistence of the publisher, and what Moorcock would do with them, given the opportunity (a la King's unexpurgated edition of The Stand). Loads of fun, and highly recommended for fantasy and non-fantasy readers alike, as is the whole series. ****	2003-01-27

Michael Moorcock, Stormbringer (DAW, 1977)<br />Moorcock, in his acknowledgements, calls Stormbringer the first novel he ever wrote. (Much of what has come before in this series, in truth, is collections of shorter works.) It makes sense, in that Stormbringer, the last of the classic Elric novels, is a more coherent piece of work than those that have come before it, and is thus an easier read despite its being forty to seventy pages long than the other books in the series.<br />As the novel opens, Elric, Moonglum, and Zarozinia, with some other old friends and a large delegation from the southern and eastern continents, are trying to figure out what to do about Jagreen Lern, the sorceror king of the island nation of Pan Tang. Lern has allied himself with Elric's old masters, the Lords of Chaos, and Lern and his army are taking over the planet, piece by piece, with Chaos reshaping the planet into formless mass wherever it goes. The Lords of Law are stuck behind barriers raised by Chaos, and unable to communicate with earthbound folk; is the fate of the world sealed?<br />Of course not, this is fantasy literature.<br />Much of the pleasure of reading Stormbringer comes from seeing all the elements of the previous five books wrapped up into one neat package. I have mentioned before Moorcock's inability to foreshadow without hitting one in the face with a week-old herring with \\"FORESHADOWING\\" writ large in purple gothic script, but the effect of that is lessened greatly when the payoff is so much fun.<br />There are, once again, two factors which keep Stormbringer from a leap from the world of good, solid fantasy into the world of immortal literature. The first is the final battle between Elric and Jagreen Lern, which takes place over, essentially, the whole novel. The ability to draw such a thing out to almost two hundred pages is a rare quality in itself, but one cannot read of war on such an epic scale in a fantasy setting and not compare it to the final battle in Tolkein's The Return of the King; whereas much writing in any genre would be found wanting when compared to that scene, it seems more so when the subject matter is so parallel. Second, after it's all over, there is the inevitable denouement (as there must be in any classic tragedy). Again, Moorcock has set it up well, and with slight modifications it would have stood up to the rest of the novel; in fact, the rest of the series (and one of the tests of a truly great series is whether its last scene is a fitting, and well-scripted, ending to the whole schlemiel). Unfortunately, the last line of dialogue in the novel is unforgivably cheesy. All the more so because it's followed up with a perfect last sentence.<br />But the series ends, all is right with the world, and the reader must sit back and marvel at how well executed the whole thing is. Astounding, to say the least. ****Tolkein's The Return of the King; whereas much writing in any genre would be found wanting when compared to that scene, it seems more so when the subject matter is so parallel.

Michael Moorcock, The Bane of the Black Sword (DAW, 1977)<br />The fifth of the six classic Elric novels picks up, as is usual with these books, where the fourth leaves off. Moorcock sets the last pieces of the puzzle into place (and here, we get a chance to see how everything that has come before is building to the climactic novel, Stormbringer), introducing us to Zarozinia, the love of Elric's life (and most of his motivation for continuing on the path upon which he was set in The Vanishing Tower). Much of this is setup for Stormbringer, but that's in no way to say this isn't good stuff. Once again, Moorcock takes his already intriguing concepts that he's built up throughout the series (unique hero, solid motivation, the excellent concept of the Eternal Champion, et al) and adds a few more twists and turns, to make them even more intriguing than they already were. Unfortunately, the series' main problem-its penchant for not going into detail on some of the truly fun stuff mentioned (e.g., the Forest of Troos, in the barren land of Org, where Elric and Zarozinia meet, both trying like mad to avoid the denizens of the forest)-is here in spades. But there's enough detail for the reader to get the general gist of what's going on and eventually hope Moorcock will write some stories set in Elric's world that have to do with these ancillary details. This would not be unprecedented; a story with Elric's friend Rackhir as its main character is included as an epilogue to one of the books, for example.<br />There is one other annoying thing about the series I haven't yet touched on. It's ultimately annoying that Elric, no matter what he's faced with, has some form of supernatural ally who can help him with it. (You're attacked by lizardmen who are unaffected by normal weapons? Call on the god of the insects and get the help of millions of mosquitoes!) Never fails. This particular convention pops up in a number of places in the series, not just here.<br />Still, overall, the book is good, it's readable, and the payoff, in Stormbringer, is astounding. ****book is good, it's readable, and the payoff, in Stormbringer, is astounding. ****	2003-01-27

Michael Moorcock, Elric of Melnibonë  (DAW, 1972)<br />Perhaps more than any fantasy series since The Lord of the Rings, the six \\"classic\\" Elric novels stand as the definitive fantasy novels. Not long after their original American publication in the authorized editions (with stunning Michael Whelan cover art), the TSR folks included a section on Elric in the original AD&D book Deities and Demigods, removed in subsequent printings for legal reasons. Then the gothic metal band Cirith Ungol used some of Whelan's Elric paintings for their album covers. And thus, the legendary books gained fame beyond that of normal readers...<br />But I digress. Given the unique nature of the growth of the Elric cult, the question needs asked: do the books themselves, the subject matter therein, stand up to all the hype? Yes, they do. Despite having some problems in the execution (clumsy handing of foreshadowing and detail introduction, overuse of exclamation points, inability to call a character by either a first or last name when a character has both [e.g., Dyvim Tvar is never referred to as \\"Dyvim\\" or \\"Tvar,\\" but always \\"Dyvim Tvar\\"], etc.), Elric hands us something fantasy readers up to that point hadn't been used to: an antihero, and a sympathetic one to boot.<br />Elric is the eighty-eighth lord of the island kingdom of Melnibonë, once a power that ruled over the world. Its power has waned in the interim, and some see the sickly Elric as proof of this. His cousin Yyrkoon wants the throne as badly as Elric doesn't. The bulk of the first novel deals with the struggle between Elric and Yyrkoon for the throne, with Yyrkoon's sister Cymoril, who also happens to be Elric's betrothed, caught in the middle between them. It also sets up much of what comes in later books-Elric's meeting with his longtime friend Rackhir, descriptions of the defenses of Melnibonë against outside invasion, the rules which dragons follow on Moorcock's earth.<br />There are some minor niggles to get through in the way Moorcock presents his characters and their backgrounds; however, that may be retrospect speaking (it's impossible to compare stories Moorock was writing in the sixties, stylistically, to, for example, George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire; Martin is far better at slipping pieces of his characters' backgrounds into the text without drawing our attention to them, but few if any authors working in \\"genre fiction\\" were interested in the conventions of high literature at the time these books were written).<br />An excellent beginning. If you haven't yet read the Elric novels, whether you are a fantasy fan or not, this is where to begin. ****in the way Moorcock presents his characters and their backgrounds; however, that may be retrospect speaking (it's impossible to compare stories Moorock was writing in the sixties, stylistically, to, for example, George R.

Stephen King, From a Buick 8 (Scribner's, 2002)<br />Most of us, at least among the Stephen King fans on the planet--and we are legion, much to the dismay of academics around the country--met the news of King's announced retirement with surprise and outrage. The man can't retire. Who could fill his shoes? Etc. And how could he say he's lost a step after, within the space of three years, publishing Hearts in Atlantis, containing 'Blind Willie,' one of his finest stories ever; The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, a book so good it brought George Romero back to America after a decade of self-imposed exile; and Everything's Eventual, the latest in his string of just plain excellent story collections (not a one of which has been less than same)? Somewhere in there, we overlooked the bloated horror that was Dreamcatcher, and while no one really expected much of Black House, it lived up to those expectations with a nefarious excellence. And now we have From a Buick 8, and I can't help but think, okay, maybe the man's right.<br />Not to say there isn't a lot here for the dedicated King fan. The man can do more to give us a character in a paragraph then some authors can in a whole novel. And there's no shortage of the weird, the wild, and the woolly to be found betwixt these covers. But under the surface, it feels like King is treading water; there's nothing new here, nor is there anything inspired. It feels rather like Miles Davis' performance at Live Aid; the man showed up to perform, but there's no passion here. Not that that should stop King fans from grabbing a copy and getting their fix, but don't be expecting another one of the timeless tales he spins during those times when he's on his game.<br />What's it about? Well, take Christine, add a dash of The Dark Tower (to the point where I kept wondering when he'd reveal that there was a portal to mid-world to be found somewhere in this book), a whole heaping tablespoon of Dreamcatcher, shake, chill, and serve. Those who liked Chrstine and Dreamcatcher more than I did will probably have a differing opinion; I found it enjoyable, but ultimately unsatisfying, like a lemon meringue pie from which the layer of lemon has been eviscerated. ***Chrstine and Dreamcatcher more than I did will probably have a differing opinion; I found it enjoyable, but ultimately unsatisfying, like a lemon meringue pie from which the layer of lemon has been eviscerated. ***	2003-01-13

Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet (Norton, 1962)<br />I should preface my judgment on this by saying that I've been misled for the past twenty years regarding this book, which I somehow never got around to reading until I was older than both of the principals therein (the young poet hasn't yet reached his twenties at the beginning of the correspondence; Rilke is twenty-eight). Norton's categorization of it as literature (instead of philosophy), and various rave reviews of it that concentrate on the fact that Rilke wrote these letters to a person who wrote him looking for help with his (the original writer's) poetry, led me to believe this small collection of essays had to do with poesy. No, they have to do with philosophy. Rilke informs his reader that he (Rilke) is unqualified to remark on craft and technique on the very first page, and does not do so for the rest of the book. So, in other words, I didn't get what I was expecting.<br />The philosophy therein seems pretty dated forty years after that fact (and almost a century since the letters were actually written), but we didn't have an avalanche of self-help books in 1962, many of which were probably derived at least in part from Rilke's words, feeding us this endless stream of unbearable pap. The book can be summed up neatly in the words of a particularly memorable Monty Python song (I'm sure I don't have to mention which), but that's not something to hold against the book. Rilke was a thinker of the illigitimi non carborundum school of thought; while his prose does get a tad wordy in a few places, he generally sticks to the point, and his words are far more intelligent than those of what has come since.<br />The Norton edition of 1962 also contains a mini-bio of Rilke centered around the time the letters were written, to give the reader background on the events in Rilke's life that were influencing his words. Nice addition that helps deepen the understanding of what he was on about.<br />I just wish he'd been on about poetry. ***he'd been on about poetry. ***	2003-01-13

Two? Three? More? In any case, Gaiman spent the five years between his novel Neverwhere and this one very constructively, it would seem. All the many flaws of Neverwhere have disappeared, and we are left with a stunning achievement, perhaps the first (horror? fantasy? What is this, anyway?) novel of its ilk that can be called truly original since Kathe Koja unleashed The Cipher upon us over a decade ago.<br />Shadow is a man just into his thirties whos spent the last three years in prison. Hes released a couple of days early thanks to the death of his wife. While flying home to attend her funeral, Shadow meets a man who calls himself Mister Wednesday. Wednesday tells Shadow a storm is coming, the offers him a job. Things are all downhill from there.<br />Well-drawn characters, a perfect pace, plots and subplots by the score, red herrings, masterful clue-dropping, double-crosses, triple-crosses, and of course, a plethora of gods, brought to America on the heels of their believers and left to be abandoned. The prose is more readable than that in Neverwhere, which was also a pleasant surprise; this one feels like it needs to be a movie, not like it was written from a movie script (which, in essence, Neverwhere was). Theres nothing wrong with the book, save a minor editorial glitch (a barefoot Shadow at one point reaches down and takes off his shoes). Its somewhat ironic, but ultimately understandable, that a book that goes to the heart of America so well was written by a British author. As one of the other characters observes to Shadow early on in the book, no other country spends as much time looking for its soul as America. Perhaps were better off letting others look for it. Gaiman has certainly done a more than capable job at finding it.<br />The first of the years reads to be a shoo-in for the top 25 of 2003. **** ½hoo-in for the top 25 of 2003. **** ½	2003-01-13

Mo Hayder, The Treatment (Dell, 2001)<br />The last page of The Treatment, Mo Hayder's second (and, according to interviews, final) Jack Caffery novel, is likely to leave readers screaming in frustration. It wouldn't surprise me to find out she'd been abducted by some crazed male version of Stephen King's Annie Wilkes and held against her will until she promises a third novel tying up the loose ends left at the conclusion of this book. We are an impatient lot, we mystery readers, and we don't want the questions left unanswered. More fool us. The end of The Treatment, as with the whole latter half of the book, is wonderfully written, a cracking good mystery that does her debut novel, Birdman, justice. Unfortunately, it's prefaced by the first half, which does nothing much justice.<br />The book starts slow. Did I mention slow? I mean slow. Proust could have given Hayder some pacing lessons in the opening chapters. We are reintroduced to Jack Caffery, just about a year after the events in the final pages of Birdman. He's still Jack Caffery, jaded, not sleeping well, far too thin for his own good, unable to figure out how to make a relationship work, and completely obsessed with his job. his time, his job involves figuring out what happened to a child who was abducted from his home after the abductor had stayed in the house for three days. Readers of Birdman will recognize that this is ground Jack Caffery will not want to tread. (There is also, in the opening chapters, a piece of misdirection that is blatant, after one finishes the book, and very badly handled. A few points off for lack of editing.) We then spend the next hundred fifty pages or so getting to know the principals and a few ancillary characters; while character development is never a bad thing, it's as if the plot slows to a crawl while we get to know the folks, and then takes off again in a rocket halfway through. Credit goes, though, to the fact that it does take off again.<br />Readers of Birdman will want to pick this one up to close the book on the unanswered questions left from that novel (and really, when it comes right down to it, you know, deep in your gut, the answers to those questions left at the end of The Treatment); those who have not yet been introduced to Hayder will definitely want to go with Birdman first. *** ½want to pick this one up to close the book on the unanswered questions left from that novel (and really, when it comes right down to it, you know, deep in your gut, the answers to those questions left at the end of The Treatment); those who have not yet been introduced to Hayder will definitely want to go with Birdman first. *** ½	2003-01-13

Buck, A Bridge for Passing (Pocket, 1962)<br />The strength of Pearl Buck's writing, it becomes evident from page one, is in her ability to tell a story as if she were sitting next to you sipping lemonade on an unseasonably cool August day. Her observations are flowery, well-described, and often at least a touch naïve; one wonders, had she written the book ten years later, if it would have had the same tone it does.<br />A Bridge for Passing intertwines the filming of her novel The Big Wave, the first major collaboration between Japanese and American filmmakers (and now unforgivably obscure), with the death of her husband of twenty-five years. And oddly, though the ratio of the two in page real estate is about 90/10, the reviews, the blurbs, and the cover reverse the ratio when talking about the book. To the rest of the world, it seems, A Bridge for Passing was a precursor to the spate of books that started appearing roughly a decade later about how to handle major life crises. The movie was just an afterthought.<br />Not so, Othello. The movie is the mechanism by which Buck learns to deal with her grief, true, but there is much more to it than that. This is no fictional memoir; we are treated to the lives of real people, most of whom have remained obscure from the American perspective, but some of whom are not (Big Wave director Ted Danielewski, for example, has a pair of kids well known to media critics, House of Leaves author Mark Danielewski and his sister, the singer known as Poe). And when one keeps one's mind on the idea that these are real people, one starts to realize the enormity of the task Buck and her cohorts have set themselves. This is not just an on location shoot, this is politics of the highest order (and only fifteen years after the unpleasantness at the end of World War II).<br />There is much to be said for the way in which her husband's death pervades the book, but any Buck fans who have avoided this, fearing it to be nothing but a celebrity-penned self-help tome, put your fears at ease. This one's a keeper. *** ½ebrity-penned self-help tome, put your fears at ease. This one's a keeper. *** ½	2003-01-13

Good if you're interested and don't already have a copy, and can usually be had cheap; if you already own a translation of the Rune Poem or any of the critical works on the subject, you can pass on this safely. ***	2003-01-13

Debra Allbery, Walking Distance (Pittsburgh, 1991)<br />I figured it was high time for a re-read of this volume (one of the first, if memory serves, I ever reviewed for the Barn) after a span of years. Allbery is a rural poet, focused mainly on small-town life and the horrors, however existential, of childhood therein. Her lines remind me of these annoying Ohio winters; sparse, unforgivably cold, but the heavens open up and dump on us so rarely that it's still safe to venture out now and again for the sheer joy of basking in below freezing air. It's not thrilling for those who have to do it every day, but it's a refreshing change from the desiccation of survival in an office building.<br />Few enough poets today are even attempting spare, and of those, fewer still know how to do it right; the art of minimal poetry is knowing what to cut out and when. Cut out too much and you run the risk of being indecipherable; cut out too little and you run the risk of being William Carlos Williams (toward the end of his career). Allbery walks the line from first page to last in this book, and she never once falls into the safety net. There is great beauty here, for those who know the landscape about which she writes (both the physical landscape and the emotional); like most truly wonderful American poets working today, she is almost unknown, and that is a tragedy. **** ½	2003-01-13

Michael Moorcock, Kane of Old Mars (Warriors of Mars/Blades of Mars/Barbarians of Mars) (Lancer, 1965)<br />For the first book and a half of this trilogy, I had no idea what Moorcock was on about. Then I did a little research and found out Moorcock was parodying Edgar Rice Burroughs; that helped put things more into perspective and helped me get over some of my usual annoyances with many fantasy writers (the plethora of exclamation points and one-sentence paragraphs, etc.); traps Moorcock usually doesn't fall into.<br />Once that was behind me, I enjoyed these three books quite a bit more. The astoundingly cheesy premise herein is that a writer, Edward Bradbury (under which pen name the books were originally published), encounters and befriends one Michael Kane while vacationing in the south of France. Kane is a physicist who previously worked for the military but went off to the private sector to develop what he calls a matter transference machine (in this post-Star Trek world, we know them better as transporters or teleporters). Its only problem is that, when Kane tests it on himself, it sends him not to the receiving transference machine, but to Mars millions of years ago, a Mars that is full of thriving communities. They are, of course, at war with one another or in tenuous peace treaties that could erupt into war at any moment, leading to many examples of Kane's ability to show off the swordfighting techniques he learned as a child (how coincidental!), while forging alliances between peoples who have been at war for generations and earning the respect of all he encounters. It's high silliness of the order to be found in old Douglas Fairbanks pictures from the silent era (or the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs, presumably).<br />Moorcock keeps the pages turning, and each of the books is slim; it's possible to get through one of them in a lazy afternoon and still have time to tackle thirty of forty pages of the newest Danielle Steel potboiler, if one is so inclined. Just don't be expecting great literature. For that matter, don't be expecting material up to Moorcock's usual high standards. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. ***ed.

Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game (Tor, 1985)<br />Orson Scott Card says in his preface to Ender's Game that one of the main criticisms with the book people have is that gifted kids just don't act and talk like Ender and his battle school mates. To which Card usually responds with something like \\"they're just smart enough not to talk that way around adults.\\"<br />Been there, done that. He's right.<br />The main criticism of the book dispensed with, Ender's Game focuses on young Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, a genetically-engineered genius recruited by the army at the age of six as a potential battle commander in a war against another race of beings from far off in the galaxy. But, as with most good science fiction, the actual science fiction parts of the book are tangential to the main thrust of the book at best; take out the stuff we can't do in modern-day society and put Ender and pals in a present-day prep school, and the human drama at the book's core remains credible. This is a necessity in any novel written in any genre, and Card carries it off with grace and dexterity.<br />The book's only real failing is that some of the minor characters (a number of Ender's schoolmates with small, but key, roles throughout his life) could have been better developed. But what is there is good; unlike most underdeveloped characters, Card's aren't there solely to advance a specific political or philosophical point of view; think of this particular set of underdeveloped characters as paler than usual rather than cardboard cutouts. They also don't get introduced with the words \\"kill me\\" already branded into their foreheads a la Stephen King or Joe Lansdale. It just would've been nice to see more of them, though that probably would have required a change in narrative perspective.<br />Other than that, everything works here. The book is eminently readable, the characters are believable, the plot flows along. I didn't find myself with the same obsessive devotion to it as many of the book's fans have, but it certainly put me in the mood to continue on with the series, and that can never be a bad thing. Highly recommended. ****fans have, but it certainly put me in the mood to continue on with the series, and that can never be a bad thing. Highly recommended. ****	2002-12-26

Clive Barker, Coldheart Canyon (Harper Collins, 2001)<br />One of the most disappointing things one can come upon is a weak book by one of one's favorite authors. Especially if the book isn't weak by dint of the story, or the writing, or anything else that ordinarily allows for a good slagging. Coldheart Canyon is 98% vintage Clive Barker; weird, quasi-Biblical stuff, compelling characters, the kind of sex that wakes Jesse helms up at 3AM in sweat-soaked sheets. And the 2% that makes the book painful is editorial mistakes. Someone wasn't firing on all cylinders here, though who it was will probably remain a subject of debate among nitpickers until the end of time.<br />Most readers may not even notice the slight logical slips. But we're not getting paid to. The editors at Harper, on the other hand, are, and so is Barker. It was said in a book for kids about monster movies that I read way back when that it's impossible to be scared by King Kong when his rampages are interrupted every fifteen minutes by a deodorant commercial. In the same vein, when the attentive reader finds protagonist Todd Pickett asking an acquaintance of his for the number of a doctor whom he's already called three chapters before-as if he's never had it-the atmosphere drains from the book as if someone had pulled the stopper out of the tub. (And this after one of the book's most emotional scenes.)<br />More galling--and this heresy can be laid squarely at the feet of Messrs. Harper, Collins--the book jacket synopsis contains a major spoiler regarding the fate of one of the other main characters. This is stuff that any entry-level proofreader should be capable of catching.<br />Those things aside, if you can put them aside, Barker has turned out another page-turner. It is unfair to compare any of Barker's other novels to Sacrament, one of the finest novels of the twentieth century; but this compares quite nicely to Galilee or Weaveworld for readability. And while the world Barker spins here is much more contained than the ambitious alternate reality of Weaveworld, it can be just as easy to get lost in...if you're not thrown by the devil who lives in those details. *** ½much more contained than the ambitious alternate reality of Weaveworld, it can be just as easy to get lost in...if you're not thrown by the devil who lives in those details. *** ½	2002-12-26

Philip K. Dick, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Millennium, 1968)<br />This short novel is best known these days as the basis of Ridley Scott's finest film, Bladerunner. The two are as different as night and day, but the two are roughly recognizable in places, in the same way some people will say \\"you look just like your father\\" to an adopted son. And since it's been a few months since I committed any great literary heresies, it's high time for one: Ridley Scott took the meat of this novel and adapted it into something greater, asking some hard questions that Dick avoided (or, perhaps, never thought to ask).<br />For those who've been living under a rock since Bladerunner's 1982 release, the story involves Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter whose specialty is androids. Androids are no longer supposed to live on Earth; they were created as servants and workers for the mass of the populace, who migrated off earth after a nuclear war left most of the planet devastated. (Those reading the book after seeing the movie are likely to wonder where the huge population of LA comes from, given the mass exodus stage up Dick gives us. Oh, yeah, and the book is set in San Francisco.) Those hardy souls who are left Earthside try to eke out a living however they can, and everyone raises animals. There aren't enough animals to go around, though, and not everyone can afford them, so some people have android animals. Those who have android animals keep such things a grave secret, lest their neighbors shun them. (Deckard and his wife, conspicuously absent from the movie, own the electric sheep, also conspicuously absent from the movie, of the title.)<br />You will notice that very little of the above description matches the film version. Neither does much of the book's action. The number of androids loose on earth is larger in the book, and they go to great lengths to try and off Deckard before he offs them (no descriptions of how here, lest I ruin the book for enterprising readers), leading to some of the book's most surreal, and fun, passages. By the time the reader gets to the end, there are questions in his mind as to whether any of it's real at all, or whether it's existed nowhere but in Deckard's head. The most pressing question in my mind, though, was why Harrison Ford didn't have himself an electric sheep in the movie (and why Rachel, a teen in the book, was played by the much older Sean Young).<br />Had Dick's writing style been as stark and minimal as Scott's vision of the future, the book would have worked in spades. However, Dick tended towards melodrama here, and some of the books passages come off as amusingly overwritten given the subject matter therein. Definitely worth reading for Bladerunner fans, but those attempting Dick for the first time may be better off with his brilliant novel Valis.

Gearino, Counting Coup (Simon and Schuster, 1997)<br /><br />I'm sure most of the people who read Counting Coup will see the last ten pages coming from a mile out; I was completely blindsided by them, and that's probably coloring my judgment of this little gem. It was raised from a competent, wicked novel about a southern mystery into the realm of the truly great whodunits. In fact, the montage of revelations in those last ten pages feels a whole lot like the montage of revelations Chazz Palminteri goes through in the last few minutes of The Usual Suspects. Yeah, it's that good.<br />Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tad Beckman's first editor once told him that journalists get cocky, and then they take a big fall. In the opening pages of this novel, that's exactly what happens to Beckman, the kind of op-ed guy everyone wants to tell their problems to; he's having a bad day, a woman tries to tell him her problems, he's brusque with her, and she ends up very nastily dead. He then disappears for a year, and upon his return to civilization, a cause, and a reason to start writing op-ed pages again, almost literally falls into his lap. It's too much to pass up, and Beckman starts digging into the details of the life of the man whose wife he's now acquainted with, the man who wants to buy his historic-landmark apartment building and tear it down, an all-around nasty guy if ever there was one. He just can't get over the idea that something is just a little bit off...<br />I realized how much  was going to like this book when I hit the halfway point, was still involved in the setup (that year-long disappearance, and his getting involved in the mystery at hand, takes quite a while), and realized I didn't care. In the hands of a less talented author, that much setup for fifty or so pages of actual mystery can be a slow-moving disaster; Gearino uses it to weave in not only clues as to what's happening, but events from Beckman's childhood to make us understand why he's so eager to take on a new cause celebre as soon as he gets back to civilization. Gearino makes us understand his charge; that, more than anything, is what propels this book into the stratosphere. Well, that and the last ten pages. **** ½eager to take on a new cause celebre as soon as he gets back to civilization.

Ringu (Hideo Nakata, 1998)<br />Welcome to the world of Japanese New Horror (JNH), a concerted attempt by a number of Japanese filmmakers to get away from the excesses of Hideshi Hino and his Guinea Pig films on one side and the emotional manipulation that passes for drama on the other. JNH filmmakers want to do nothing but tell good, solid, scary stories. As a result of stripping away the other layers, such things as emotional manipulation are cast to the wind, leaving spare frameworks within which the directors can weave what artistry they have. Because there have now been remakes from two countries (Korea and the United States), Ringu towers over other JNH films in terms of worldwide popularity. And while it may best serve as a gateway into the neophyte who wants to discover the world of JNH, it serves that purpose well.<br />The basic story is simple: an urban legend exists that there is a videotape which will kill you seven days after you see it. A reporter whose cousin died under very mysterious circumstances discovers that the urban legend is real, and the tape seems to have killed her cousin; she then sees it herself, and comes to the conclusion that deciphering the dadaesque series of images on the tape will keep her alive past the seven-day deadline.<br />Nakata does his job exceptionally well. The casting is perfect, and the characters are astoundingly believable, given that the premise itself has enough holes in it to rival a five-pound block of swiss cheese. This isnt about realism, though, as much as it is about artistry; the realism herein is injected solely by the characters, and they do a pretty fine job of it.<br />Nakata breaks the JNH mold slightly by beginning the film with something of a teaser, but then slips right back into lockstep with his fellow directors by laying off the horror angle and concentrating on the story of the reporter and her quest to solve the mystery. The story has enough of its own dramatic tension, and so (like many other brilliant films miscategorized as horror) Ringu ends up coming off as more of a straight mystery than it does a horror film for the first hour and a quarter of its existence. Again, as with every JNH film Ive seen, however, once the horror starts, its Katy-bar-the-door. The last few scenes of Ringu are not necessarily as explicit as the storied excesses of Hinos movies, but theyre more graphic than most things youre going to see in modern gore films (and because the horrific aspects have less to do with fountains of blood and weaponry and more with subtle touches of makeup, the nastiness in Ringu is definitely of the creep-out factor type, rather than the oh, boy, heres a guy in a mask chopping up teens again).<br />Special mention must be made of the subject of the film itself, the videotape known in film circles as the curse film. It is a nightmarish, dada masterpiece, a series of short gut-punches that are about the closest thing film has to an actual successor to Bunuel and Dalis Un Chien Andalou, but an Andlusian dog worked on as well by Guillaume Apollinaire and Rene Char. Ringu is worth tracking down and seeing just to catch the repeated viewings of the curse film.<br />Ringu is a wonderfully crafted little gem, and certainly deserving of its worldwide success. (Not to say that many other JNH films arent; hopefully, theyll make it across the pond in the same way Ringu and Audition have.) Well worth the extra time it will require to track down for fans of atmospheric horror tales, but be warned: there are more than a few shocks awaiting you once the film builds to its climax. **** ½ther brilliant films miscategorized as horror) Ringu ends up coming off as more of a straight mystery than it does a horror film for the first hour and a quarter of its existence.

Ivan Arguelles, Hapax Legomenon (Pantograph Press, 1993)<br /><br />The ninth installment in Ivan Arguelles' long and surreal poem Pantograph is the eighty-eight-page Hapax Legomenon, a book it took Arguelles only ten days to complete. Eighty-eight pages of poetry in ten days leads to one of two conclusions: either the stuff blows goat, or the poet is of a singular construction, the kind of person who can spin out, well, eighty-eight pages of at least salable writing in ten days. Arguelles is very much the latter, and I don't think I've ever read a single piece of his work that is only 'salable.'<br /><br />Arguelles is one of the few American authors extant who is capable of capturing the essence of Surrealist writing and translating it to American culture. Arguelles' obsessions are spilled out onto the page in stream-of-consciousness format, and we are left to interpret them as we will. It's not quite as hard as figuring out tea leaves, but it's close.<br /><br />As with most surreal poetry, however, meaning takes a distant backseat to the single question every poet should ask upon completing every poem: does it sound good? In Arguelles' case, the answer to that question is always 'yes,' be the poem a few scant lines or an eighty-eight page piece of a much larger epic. When picking up a book by Ivan Arguelles, the one thing of which a reader can be sure is that everything contained therein will sound good; this is no exception. Get out of it what you will, but allow the syllables to flow over you like the waterfall they are, and you will have extracted the true essence of the work. **** 1/2	2002-12-03

Jose Saramago, Blindness (Harcourt Brace, 1995)<br />Over the years since its publication, Blindness has been hailed as a modern classic and made more ten-best lists than anyone not a CPA is going to be willing to count. And I guess I can understand why, but I was far less impressed with the book than most.<br />To be fair, that's probably because I'm more of a stickler for grammar. It's obvious that Saramago has a distinctive style in his writing, and one that caused people to latch onto this book in amazing numbers. But a big part of that style is run-on sentences, some of which last a whole paragraph (and some paragraphs in this book last more than a page). It's maddening. I also couldn't help comparing the style of writing, and always unfavorably, to that of Cormac McCarthy. McCarthy also has a distinctive style about his prose, and it's as clipped and rhythmic as Saramago's is lengthy and free-flowing. Which a reader will prefer is likely a matter of taste; I fall on the clipped and rhythmic side of the fence.<br />The story is a political allegory about an unspecified modern city where the residents (at least, the ones we see throughout) have been struck blind. (One wonders if Saramago is aware of Joe Frank's 1991 radio play Rent a Family, in which Arthur Miller spins such a scenario during a monologue.) Saramago weaves with a deft hand, and the messages under the surface never get to the point of hitting the reader over the head with a hammer. This is a refreshing change from most political fiction, even if, in order to do so, Saramago spends what seems an inordinate amount of tie avoiding the political by immersing his characters in the scatological. (There is more talk of human excrement in this book than in, perhaps, anything written in the twentieth century outside medical journals and certain sexual fetish novels.) Again, this is a personal thing, but I found myself quailing at the turn of every page, wondering how many of the words would have been better printed in brown.<br />So many conflicts about this novel, and all of them of a personal nature. I have no choice but to give it a straight middle-of-the-road ** ½ and come back to it at a later time.

Ryder Brady, Instar (Ballantine, 1977)<br />The first question you'll likely ask yourself after picking up Instar is, \\"what kind of a name is Ryder Brady?\\" It pretty much screams New England  blueblood at you. And, true to the name, the book takes place in the heart of New England blueblood congregation spots in (presumably, given an offhand Falmouth reference) Massachusetts. And while the text generally reads as if  William Makepeace Thackeray were trying his hand at a horror novel, the book does work on some levels as a sort of odd mix of drawing-room satire and existentialist suspense work.<br />Hugh Murray, a man who married into money, is destined to spend a few weeks over the upcoming summer of 1976 at the house of his wife's aunt and uncle.  The uncle's all right, but the aunt makes Hyacinthe Bucket (of Keeping Up Appearances fame) look like an unprincipled ninny in a housedress. Thankfully, we learn pretty early on, the rich aren't that much different, and the  first few days go rather well, considering. The only really odd parts are the disturbing aunt and a strange, echoless screaming that occurs on foggy nights. One night, while Hugh is out walking, the fog rolls in, the screaming  starts, and Hugh is in a place where he can investigate. He does, and as the result of his actions, he comes into possession of an odd little dog named Waffles. And that's when things start to get really weird.<br />Brady's got a lot to say about such topics as emotional diseases, the horrors of inbreeding, the Roman Catholic Church, and other such things that are  (at least, according to Brady) shunned on the surface by New England bluebloods while they turn around and indulge in them when they thing nobody's looking. He also seems to have a lot to say about pastoral life and  whether it's worth living. Unfortunately, not enough of it comes together to really get his message across, and thus while the drawing-room satire bit does make for a few chuckles along the way, it never really coheres. We're left with  the horror of existence. Here, flipping the coin, it seems almost as if Brady were trying too hard to make this into a bona fide horror novel while still wanting to keep his allegiance to Sartre intact, and instead of blending the  two as he was seemingly attempting, he ends up getting about three-quarters of the way to the meeting point on each side. There's a gap in the middle, but the reader should have little problem figuring out where everything was  supposed to come together.<br />This novel is the literary equivalent of the rock and roll bootleg tape. If you can listen to a bootleg of your favorite band and visualize what the  music would have sounded like had it been recorded from the board and put through extensive post-production, you'll probably be able to puzzle out what this novel should have been and appreciate it for that. Otherwise, it'll probably  leave you wishing Brady had gone those extra steps. **really coheres. We're left with  the horror of existence.

Robert Devereaux, Walking Wounded (Dell, 1996)<br />To saw that Walking Wounded is Robert Devereaux's weakest effort is rather like saying that Atom Heart Mother was the weakest Pink Floyd album; when looked at in relation to the rest of the canon, it suffers, but compared to the greater view of the horror novel (or psychedelic rock), you're still head and shoulders above the cloud. The moon can still eclipse the sun, despite its relatively small stature.<br />Most of my problems with Deveraux's second novel are nitpicky at best, especially in horror. Sometimes it seems that the everpresent perversity is more forced than before (or since, for that matter); I hesitate to use the word \\"gratuitous,\\" especially where naked flesh is concerned, but every once in a while it reared its ugly head while I was reading. As well, some subplots and minor details seemed to float off into the distance and disappear artificially; for example, one of the main characters finds herself dissociating from her circle of friends as quickly as does the other, despite a much (timeframe is never given, but \\"much\\" is the heavy implication) longer association with them; during a later scene, it's almost as if her passing from amongst them has gone unnoticed. Granted, that sort of thing could be (and has been often, in other realms of fiction) a novel all its own, and here it's a plot point at best. Still...<br />Criticism aside, everything about this book will tell even the most scanty acquaintance of Devereaux's other work that he's crossed into that recognizably-Devereaux territory where even such celebrated libertines as (early) Clive Barker have always feared to tread. Devereaux is the undisputed master of the twisted horror novel. Here, he gives us a woman who finds herself, suddenly, with the power to lay on hands. As with all responsible healer-type horror novels, the healing power also has a darker side. She finds herself in an interesting situation; she knows her husband is cheating on her. She also knows he has Parkinson's. Use the power to heal his disease, or accelerate it? And just to throw a monkey wrench into the works, what should she do with the woman with whom her husband is cheating when the two of them start to fall for one another? A less twisted mind couldn't have come up with stuff half this decadent, much less make it work. Where the novel weakens (and let me stress, pardon the pun, that it never fully gives way as did the other recently-read healer-horror novel I reviewed last month, Saul Wernick's Cain's Touch) is when Devereaux takes this gorgeous framework and attempts to add the garage. There's a reason homeowners' associations don't let you do too much weird stuff to your house. It starts getting ungainly.<br />In defense of Devereaux, I might have given this book a far different review when it came out. All of the extraneous things tried in this novel succeeded when tried in \\"Caliban,\\" which also has odd stuff jutting out here and there. Perhaps it's best to look upon Walking Wounded as a first novel, despite the publication of Deadweight some four years previous. (Nothing in the horror genre, still, ten years after its publication, approaches the brilliance of Deadweight.) Some false steps got taken, but they were righted later in the author's career.<br />I've spent way too much time slagging this novel and not nearly enough praising it. It sometimes seems, though, as if the same compliments can be attached to every book Robert Devereaux puts out. As usual, if you're a fan of horror with a high squick factor, once you've started page one, it's a relatively good bet you won't be sleeping until you've turned the last page. This is both a product of Devereaux's inherent readability and the same function in lizard-brain that makes us all slow down for car accidents (the more violent the accident, the more likely it is traffic will be blocked for miles, natch). Once you're involved, you can't help but stare at these poor, twisted creatures that come out of Devereaux's brain. It's only after you finish the book you realize how much they resemble you (again, with those extraneous parts jutting out). The ending is the kind of thing every self-help \\"guru\\" has wanted to write for decades and has never had the cojones to actually set into print. Needless to say, the strong female protagonist is a rarity in horror fiction (let alone a pair of them). All of these are excellent reasons to be reading Bob Devereaux. Despite the relative amounts of space given to them in this review, the criticisms above are in no way reasons NOT to read Devereaux. Recommendation: read his books in the order they were released (and definitely save Caliban till after you're done with this).

Needless to say, the strong female protagonist is a rarity in horror fiction (let alone a pair of them). All of these are excellent reasons to be reading Bob Devereaux.

Recommendation: read his books in the order they were released (and definitely save Caliban till after you're done with this).

And what a debut.<br />Birdman gives us a serial killer with a pathology unlike any other I've ever encountered, and it's actually somewhat distressing that someone managed to come up with it in the first place. To then backtrack through the lives of the characters and make the pathology plausible hints at a deeply unstable mind. Would that we had more of them behind the world's typewriters and word processors.<br />There is no way to give even the merest synopsis of more than the first five to ten pages of this novel without getting into spoiler territory, so I'm not going to try. Fans of the serial killer mystery as offered up by writers like P. D. James (there was more than once I was put in mind of Devices and Desires while reading this) are more than likely going to adore this book. It is, however, not for the weak of stomach. My advice to those who have a bad reaction to gore? Take a few Dramamine and pick this up anyway. ****	2002-11-24

Steve Rasnic Tem, Decoded Mirrors (Necronomicon Press, 1992)<br />Steve Rasnic Tem is one of those guys who's never quite gotten the recognition he deserves. That may be because some of his best material ends up being released at places like Necronomicon Press, a small Massachusetts company devoted to releasing Lovecraft-themed stuff on a shoestring budget. Decoded Mirrors has all the hallmarks of shoestring publishing save one; this is professional-quality writing. That won't surprise anyone who's familiar with Tem's work.<br />This exceptionally small collection gives us three short Lovecraft-themed stories, but rather than doing the usual \\"if I'm going to write stories about the Old Gods, I'm going to try and write in Lovecraftian style\\" that permeates the writings of most post-Lovecraft homage-payers, Tem sticks to the same modern-horror storytelling style one is apt to find in writers like Koja, Lucius Shepard, or (post-paying-homage-to-Lovecraft, of course) Ramsey Campbell. Tem gives us the horror-of-absence motif by personalizing Cthulhu and friends; the blind idiot gods are us, and there are no two ways about it. Not to say odd supernatural things don't happen here, but for the most part, it's all in our heads. We look for Azathoth and we find mirrors. It's all the more chilling when you're the eighty-foot monster everyone fears.<br />Much of Tem's work, including this collection, is pretty hard to find these days; it's worth the search. *** ½	2002-11-24

Michael Paine, Owl Light (Charter, 1989)<br />As the eighties wound down, so did America's fascination with horror novels not written by people who sell millions of books on the day of their release. Even the most promising eighties horror authors who weren't publishing hardback originals lost their big book deals and had to go to smaller presses, if they continued writing at all. Needless to say, a number who had been signed at the height of the fad deserved to fade into obscurity, but a smaller number did not; number in the \\"where are they now, and why aren't they at the top of the publishing heap?\\" file such luminaries as John R. Holt (When We Dead Awaken, one of the best horror novels of the late eighties), Joe Lansdale (who saw the shift in the tide and started writing straight mysteries), and Michael Paine, whose second novel, Owl Light, is a treat.<br />Owl Light is not really a horror novel in the traditional sense, but Paine seems to have gotten lumped there along with other non-horror-writing folks like Geoffrey Household (The Sending) and Stephen Gregory (The Woodwitch) when no other genre seemed to fit their work. Actually, Owl Light has quite a bit in common with those two novels. All have a creepy air about them, a relatively slow pace, a readable tone, and the type of mismarketing that can hurt a career. There are overtones of the supernatural here, but more in the sense of a spiritual crisis than your run of the mill monsters, aliens, serial killers, or what have you.<br />The setting is a small town north of Pittsburgh (at the northern top of Butler County, for those in the area), where new girl in town Sybil Antissa has managed to insinuate herself into the lives of three men-the town pastor, Paul Eiden; the university's biology professor, Grant Stewart; and one of the few people who straddles both camps, high school student Peter Newell. Eiden and Stewart are about to embark on an historic creation-evolution debate that's been picked up by the media and polarized the town; Peter is one of the few people who hasn't picked a side yet. Added to this confusion is Sybil, a mysterious older woman whom he is attracted to upon their first meeting.<br />Most of the story takes us through the interactions of these characters and those around them, and how Sybil emotionally manipulates them. Like Ender's Game, remove the supernatural elements from this novel and you've still got a cracking good story. And despite an ending that leaves the reader with far more questions than it answers, there is still a feeling of completeness at the end of it; Paine knew what he was doing in ending the book like that. (One wonders if it was a setup for a sequel, or whether Paine was really willing to take that much of a risk.) Either way, this reader sees a successful book. *** ½ia and polarized the town; Peter is one of the few people who hasn't picked a side yet.

Octavio Paz, A Draft of Shadows (New Directions, 1979)<br />I am kicking myself for having had this book in my collection for long enough that I dont remember buying it and not getting around to it until now. Paz is the most exciting poet Ive run across since discovering the work of Ira Sadoff five years ago. His work, more than capably translated here by Eliot Weinberger (with a few translations from others thrown in for good measure), is a perfect blend of the art and craft of poetry. It is also the finest overtly political work I have read since Aime Cesaire last put pen to paper. Paz understands that if the poetry is good enough, the message of the poetry will come out on its own, something nine hundred ninety-nine out of every thousand political poets never grasp. Those who would dispute it need only read the title poem here and hold it up against the best works by inferior political poets. The difference is stunning, and obvious.<br />When Paz won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1990, the committee stated that his writing was characterized by sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity. Indeed. This is poetry the way its meant to be. **** 1/2	2002-11-24

John Hawkes, The Lime Twig (New Directions, 1960)<br />A friend of mine once said of the film Eraserhead that it was as close as cinema came to capturing a nightmare onscreen. (I disagree, but the parallel is useful.) The Lime Twig, in that sense, is the rough literary equivalent of Eraserhead; it's a Dick Francis novel edited by Jean-Paul Sartre with finishing touches added by Aime Cesaire. The whole contains a marked nightmarish quality; for once, I was actually grateful for the blurb writer at New Directions explaining some of the basics to me as I went along.<br />The story revolves around one of the oldest plots in horse racing; a team of small-time crooks buy an old racehorse to enter in a stakes race, the Golden Bowl at Aldington Race Course (being a Neanderthal American, I've no idea whether there actually is an Aldington Race Course in England). The horse in question won the race a number of time previously, but in the days before lifetime past performances, few bettors had memories stretching back five and six years. The crooks alone are enough to make the nameless rabble in Reservoir Dogs look like competent professionals, but things get worse when a big-time operation decides it wants in on the deal. (This is the part where the blurb on the back saved me; I figured out that others were getting in on the action, but they seem just as disorganized as the first lot, only more savage about it.)<br />Everything is presented as a kind of pointillist painting; pieces float in and out, some disappearing altogether, some being tied up at the end. Hawkes relies on the reader perhaps more than any other mystery writer here to fill in some blanks. This is in no way a bad thing; when has an author been criticized for OVERestimating the intelligence of his audience? However, readers of more mainstream mystery novelists may feel as if pieces are still missing by the end. (Jessica Fletcher Mr. Hawkes is not. There are no neat pages of explanation at the end.) A couple of re-reads of the most relevant passages will suffice to tie things up, and unlike most mystery authors, Hawkes does very little in the way of stopping the reader from recognizing the major foreshadowing or clue-dropping as it happens. And yes, despite all that, the book still reads as if the reader has taken a rather large dose of laudanum before sitting down.<br />As with most New Directions books, there is a core of critics who feel John Hawkes is the best thing for the mystery genre since, and perhaps before, sliced bread. This may well be the case. There's no denying the effectiveness of Hawkes' literary style and his ability to keep the reader turning pages despite it. However, it's one of those cases where it almost seems too much of a good thing. To draw another film parallel, Alejandro Jodorowsky, who holds much the same core-of-critics role in film as Hawkes does in letters, created a few masterpieces of exactly this sort. His most famous film, El Topo, just goes way over the edge, and its style eclipses its substance too far. I got that feeling more than once while reading The Lime Twig, and while I'd certainly recommend it for fans of the ubiquitous British Horse Racing Mystery, it should probably come with a \\"warning: literary writing ahead\\" sticker. *** ½f re-reads of the most relevant passages will suffice to tie things up, and unlike most mystery authors, Hawkes does very little in the way of stopping the reader from recognizing the major foreshadowing or clue-dropping as it happens.

Kenneth Patchen, Selected Poems (New Directions, 1957)<br />Selected by the New Directions staff after Patchen's death, Selected Poems was meant to introduce a new generation to the poet and novelist the back cover calls \\"the most compelling force in American poetry since Whitman.\\" (One wonders what Allen Ginsberg, whose \\"Howl\\" had been published by New Directions two years previous, had to say about that.) The collection does a good job at introduction, and does an even better job at showing the inconsistency of Patchen's poetic work.<br />Even those readers who have never attempted creative writing themselves are likely to have had at least one English teacher try and hammer \\"show, don't tell\\" into their heads. Patchen's contemporary and fellow New Directions poet William Carlos Williams put it even better: \\"no ideas but in things.\\" Marshall McLuhan called this immutable rule \\"the medium is the message.\\" Patchen understood this, and his best work in this collection shows it in breathtaking style, especially in a collection of short prose pieces from The Famous Boating Party towards the end of the book that are worth slogging through the first hundred pages. However, the majority of those first hundred pages show Patchen forgot it, and regularly, in his fervor to write tepid, ineffectual antiwar poems. It's hard to imagine the same guy wrote the painfully awkward<br />He who can come to his own formulation<br />Shall be found to assume mastery<br />Over the roads which lead<br />On the whole human event<br />(\\"The Climate of War\\")<br />also wrote the jaw-dropping<br />Sword on the wind, black knuckles of a thief, is this<br />King to be left here like a cast-off dog? the bloated<br />tongues of flies licking the juice of is saving wounds?<br />(\\"Red Wine and Yellow Hair\\")<br />As the above section from the uniformly wonderful \\"Red Wine and Yellow Hair\\" hopefully makes evident, when Patchen is on his game, he is very, very on his game. Every once in a while, especially towards the end of the book, something rises out of the stew of didacticity and smackes the reader right between the eyes.

Cromie, Mr. Trifecta (ParlorGrand, 2000)<br /><br />Handicapping books can be divided into two basic types: those that rely on solid information and those that rely on more nebulous information. 99.9% of the latter (I know if I say \\"all,\\" someone will publish one that actually works) are complete and utter bunk. The majority of the \\"nebulous information\\" books rely on one source of information: \\"smart money.\\"<br /><br />The concept of \\"smart money\\" is that a horse's owner, trainer, and jockey have a better idea than most handicappers about how the horse will run. The obvious logical fallacy should be apparent: the so-called \\"smart money\\" may know everything there is to know about their horse in the race, but are likely to know just as much as the next guy about every other horse in the race.<br /><br />Mr. Trifecta is just this kind of insider-money book, taking an old system (looking for horses who have more money bet on them in the daily double pool than the win pool and assuming that's \\"smart money\\") and applying it with a new angle (Cromie uses the pick three pool instead of the daily double pool). But it's nothing we haven't seen before, and while it's not the quickest road to the poorhouse, you're far better off with books from the former camp by authors like Tom Ainslie, Dick Mitchell, Jim Quinn, William Quirin, Mark Cramer, and the like. **, because it's short, to the point, and contains some good tall tales about track life.	2002-11-24

Danielle Steel, Thurston House (Dell, 1983)<br />Over the past quarter-century or so, Danielle Steel has sold more novels than there are people in America. Fifty-three books, with sales (at present, according to Steel's website) of more than four hundred sixty-three million. She's one of a handful of novelists who have not had a single book go out-of-print in decades. Remember those old Slim Whitman late-night TV ads talking about how he'd sold more albums than Elvis and The Beatles? Well, Danielle Steel really HAS. She's the Slim Whitman of the book business. So what is it, I asked myself for years, that makes people read Danielle Steel so obsessively? What is it about her books that makes them so all-fired popular? I must have known I would eventually want to know the answer, because some years back I picked up a worn-out dog-eared copy of Thurston House. And thus my education in mass-market romance begins.<br />To start with, every bad thing I've ever heard about Danielle Steel novels is absolutely the case. Whoever does her editing needs to be boiled in oil. The grammar is atrocious. Ellipses scurry about the pages like ants on a rich man's corpse. Sentences like \\"The sun sank slowly into the hills framing the lush green splendor of the Napa Valley.\\" are endemic. (That's the opening sentence of this five-hundred-page epic.) The book itself is so overwritten as to make a Presidential speech sound spare and to the point. Keeping my cynicism in check, I decided that couldn't be the reason for hundreds of millions of books sold, and that her fans were reading in spite of, not because of, these things. And so I dug a bit deeper.<br />Hypothesis number two: sex. Romance novels have sex, right? (Well, they contain sex. Though most used bookstore owners will swear up and down they have no idea how so many of them got on the shelves, so...) Everyone's familiar with the clich&eacute; of the Fabio-fronted bodice ripper. Maybe so, but not in Danielle Steel's novels. Five hundred pages and two sex scenes that are less explicit than anything to be found in Victorian erotica. Ever read Victorian erotica? Nuns read Victorian erotica when they want to take their minds off lustful thoughts. So, okay, it's not the explicit sexual content. Deeper we go.<br />Could it be, erm, plot? This one centers (as should be obvious from the title) around Thurston House, a mansion built in San Francisco after the Civil War by Jeremiah Thurston. He builds it for his young Georgia wife, Camille. It turns out to be the only thing about being married to Jeremiah that Camille really likes, so she ends up absconding to France with a penniless Count and leaving Jeremiah with the house and a daughter, Sabrina. Sabrina is actually the main character of the book (one remembers, wistfully, Mervyn Peake's words about wanting to write an epic novel wherein the main character is only a few months old after \\"many thousands of pages,\\" and wonders when Steel read those words), and grows up to be that rarest of things, a career woman at the turn of the century. Complications, etc. As far as plots go, it's actually not all that bad. The book may be overwritten, but Steel does know how to keep the pages turning, and while everything that happens therein is predictable, she at least keeps the reader's ire in check by making sure it doesn't become too predictable until a few pages before whatever large event is coming up happens. While Americans have given up steak tartare for Big Macs, even the most jaded McFreak needs a Whopper once in a while. There has to be something more than that.<br />Characters? Oh, please. Jeremiah Thurston falls in love with three different women in the book's first twenty-five pages (well, okay, he's been seeing one of them for six years, but he falls in love with the other two within five minutes of meeting them, and he meets them within a week of one another. I mean, come on). Even if everyone else in the novel had been drawn with the precision of the characters in, say, a Don DeLillo novel, and perfect consistency, Jeremiah's antics at the beginning would have been enough to cause aspersions to be cast. Well, let me clarify. It's not just Jeremiah's antics, it's the motives that Steel ascribes to them. I've read more than enough good books where a randy main character goes rutting with multiple women in relatively few pages. Those books, though, don't offer the hope that said randy main character will drop everything and marry whichever one says \\"yes\\" first. Life just doesn't work that way. To be fair, Steel lets us know she realizes this. Camille (remember her?) says of her father that he has a mistress in New Orleans, and everyone, including her mother, knows this. She mentions this while asking Jeremiah if he's going to be that way. He, of course, says no, and sticks to it despite shabby treatment from Camille. And, of course, everyone we meet, especially in the supporting roles, is so beautiful it hurts to look at them.<br />It was at about this point in my ruminations (ed. note: originally typed there: \\"ruinations.\\" Indeed.) that it dawned on me what it is that Danielle Steel has that so deeply affects tens of millions of fans and causes them to buy hundreds of millions of novels. A few paragraphs back, I mentioned that good old Victorian erotica. You know the type. Men get simultaneously scandalized and titillated by the flash of a bare ankle, and the closest anyone gets to sex is that time-honored sport of \\"struggling with her corset.\\" While no one would accuse Ms. Steel of being Victorian in her writing style (thankfully), the morality in her books has a distinct air of nineteenth-century Queen about it. We never see anyone having sex unless they're (a) married or (b) getting married. Sex between the unmarried is only hinted at in the most oblique terms. Those who have been married before who are generally good folk and ripe to get married again are either widowed/widowers or were those who were left, not those who did the leaving. (This is an hypothesis on my part; Jeremiah is the only one in this book with a main part who gets left, and he's too married to his work to find a new wife.) Those who do the leaving are vile creatures worthy of contempt by the reader; there's never a situation in which someone could have a good reason for leaving a spouse. Men are perfectly beastly to women at times, and rape is even hinted at, but always with an eye towards plot advancement. No one in the book has a character that is any shade of grey; everyone is either good or evil. (Parties can switch sides, if necessary to advance plot. Besides, every romance novel needs a pair who are originally at each other's throats before falling madly in love.) And, most assuredly (and, one would think, most offensively to female readers) is that, while the heroine may prove herself to be a self-sufficient and capable career woman in a male-dominated society over the objections of all around her, surmounting insurmountable odds in order to do so, the career woman is only a career woman as long as is necessary. The purpose of the woman in the romance novel is to marry and beget children.<br />Once you've got your head around the particular form of escapism that takes 1900-era morals into account, everything falls into place. Steel is read for the same reasons other romance authors are, but her formula contains a particular set of rules that are stricter than most. I started out wanting to learn why so many people read Danielle Steel. I seem to have done so. The idea that so many millions of people could wholeheartedly embrace such strictures as actual ideals for the way the world should be is cause for intense, painful despair. That's not the fault of the book itself, however. It does what it sets out to do. It creates its own fantasy world (consistent, one assumes, with that of the other fifty-two mega-bestsellers that have flowed from Ms. Steel's pen), populates it, and gives the reader a story within it that conforms to its rules. It is safe and predictable. It would be better were some uppity editor to curtail Steel's overwhelming use of ellipses and adverbs, but must be given some grudging respect for its readability. Still, as much as I try not to fault the book itself for its moral structure, I can't help letting some of that creep in.

Shizuko Go, Requiem (Kodansha International, 1973)<br />One of the review blurbs on the back of Requiem calls it The Japanese counterpart of Anne Franks diary. Actually, Requiem is a much better book than The Diary of a Young Girl; Go does a fine job of weaving her main characters dying moments in with recollections of the last year of her life. Go gives us no illusions from page one; her main character, Setsumo Oizumi, is lying in a bomb shelter close to death, clutching a grey notebook containing letters from her best friend, Naomi Niwa, and the flashbacks alternate between letters between the two of them and scenes from Oizumis life.<br />Where this short novel fails, and this is rare in Japanese novels, is in its lack of reserve. Go wanted to pen a horrors-of-war novel, and for the most part she succeeds. Much of the book uses the imagery of war, and Oizumis developing disillusionment with the war effort, to convey its pacifist message. But every once in a while Go drops the veil and comes out with a passage where the message overrides the medium; the book goes from a fine, sparse novel to a political polemic. There is never a point where this gets out of hand, and Go recovers herself quickly every time; still, one feels that perhaps one final revision under the watchful eye of an editor concerned more with the craft of writing than the art might have been a good idea.<br />Still, there is much to like here. You can safely ignore another of the reviewlets on the back (Should be compulsory reading for every Western schoolchild.) that would imply this to be a bad Americans! go to your room without supper! polemic; there is more of All Quiet on the Western Front here than there is Johnny Got His Gun, and Gos message is directed not at any one set of allies but at the futility of war in general. There are no guilt trips to be had aside from those all of humanity shares. Recommended. *** ½	2002-11-08

Kathe Koja, Straydog (FSG, 2002)<br />Over the course of my existence Ive read somewhere between fifteen and twenty thousand books. While I am one of those people who will start sniffling at the merest hint of decently-rendered emotion in a movie, and bawl like a baby when certain songs come on the radio, Ive never been that way with books. With reflection, Ive been able to think of three books that reduced me to tears while reading them (Wilson Rawls Where the Red Fern Grows, Kathe Kojas Strange Angels, and Clive Barkers Sacrament). Add a fourth to the list: Kathe Kojas newest offering, the short novel Straydog.<br />Marketed as a young adult title (but those of us who know Kojas writing know better), Straydog is the story of a high school outcast, Rachel, who volunteers at an animal shelter while not at school. She develops a bond with a feral collie brought into the shelter one day. While writing a short story to submit to a competition, she begins to identify with the dog to an almost supernatural degree.<br />Kojas writing is, as always, dead on in its ability to capture and explain the essence of the outcast in society. Anyone who was part of a fringe group during high school should be able to well identify with Rachels words, and more importantly with her actions as shes thrust into unfamiliar situations. Straydog explores adolescent coming of age in a way few books have, and shines in so doing.<br />As usual where Koja is concerned, there is no comparison that gives a good understanding, no way to recommend the book based on anything youve already read; Koja is still too far out on the bleeding edge for that, with a style that approaches poetry in places and the same strong undercurrent of classic surrealism that runs its way through almost all of her work. (The only book I was put in mind of while reading this is Ursula LeGuins novel Very Far Away from Anywhere Else.)<br />A shoo-in for the ten-best list this year, and will probably be at its pinnacle. *****d will probably be at its pinnacle. *****	2002-11-08

William Carlos Williams, Paterson (New Directions, 1963)<br />To hear the staff at New Directions tell it, Paterson is the be-all and end-all of the American long poem; there is no work being done today that is not influenced in some way by Williams milestone of American verse. And there may be some truth in that statement, but it neglects to address the question of whether Paterson is, in fact, a good poem; after all, the album title tells us ten million Elvis fans cant be wrong. Well, guess what, folks? Ten million Elvis fans ARE wrong.<br />Paterson is the magnum opus of a man who forgot that one of the ways that poets are divided are those who are obsessed with the art of poesy, and those obsessed with its craft. Ninety-five percent or so of modern poets are of the art school, and few pay any attention to craft at all, which is why there is so much painfully bad high-school-angst poetry in the world. Maybe one percent know how to balance the art and the craft, and from that one percent come the finest poets in the English, or in any, language, folks like Ira Sadoff, David St. John, and Debra Allbery. The rest are of the craft school, and get so wrapped up in the construction that they forget the one great rule, that poetry is language elevated. Paterson is a testament to craft, and it forsakes art altogether.<br />This was not an unconscious thing. Williams was a staunch proponent of the idea that the way to make poetry more accessible to the people was to try and fit the natural rhythm and flow of human speech into the rhythms of poetry, be they strict forms or the internal rhythms of free verse; Williams dips into both here, and more often than not hes trying to fit the squarest of pegs into the roundest of holes. He also throws in long prose passages that, while they contribute to a greater understanding of Paterson as Williams sees it, are not poetry in any sense of the word.<br />All that said, the collection approaches brilliance more times than it misses the mark. There are snippets where Williams writing is so powerful as to take the breath away, where he approaches the genius of the early years of his career, and the stuff sounds just as good as The Red Wheel-Barrow or This Is Just to Say. In other words, it would have made a great collection of poems, but as one long piece, it falls somewhat short.<br />If nothing else, it does state the greatest rule of poetry as succinctly as ever before or ever since: no ideas but in things. If only Williams had listened to himself just a tad more. ***times than it misses the mark.

Actually, it's less a novel than a collection of vignettes about the (non-fictional) coal-mining ghost town of Crum, WV, and the author's (presumably fictional) experiences growing up. After a long and tedious chapter of setup, Maynard takes off. He wears his Jean Shepherd influence on his sleeve a bit much in places, but there are far worse authors in this vein by whom to be influenced. As such, Crum tends to read like In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash with a bubbling cauldron of Freudian influence and a little A Man Called Horse for good measure. The whole thing is front-to-back delicious.	2002-11-08

Melissa Murray, Changelings (Attic Press, 1987)<br /><br />A debut collection of short stories from an Irish writer better known for her theater work. Changelings is what it advertises-a book of stories about people (and, occasionally, the odd nonhuman) going through changes. The stories here range from science fiction to that morass known as \\"eighties fiction,\\" the plotless look at a character or characters with whom no one who actually reads books can identify; as you might guess, this makes the book inconsistent. When it is good, though, it does what it does and it does it well. You'll find yourself skimming some of the stories, but it's worth picking up for the ones you don't. ** ½	2002-10-01

Frank Peretti, The Oath (Word, 1995)<br />I got this a few years back from my mother as a Christmas present. I pointed out to her that Peretti is widely known as a Christian author (one would think that the book's publisher, who also releases books by folks like Billy Graham, would have been a giveaway there), and her response was \\"it certainly doesn't sound like Christian fiction. It sounds like Stephen King.\\" And Frank Peretti is, without doubt, the Christian version of Mr. King, both in subject matter and in sales figures that make the rest of the publishing industry quake in fear. One thinks that when Frank Peretti grows up, he wants to BE Stephen King. And with The Oath, he comes very, very close.<br />There's something very large, very nasty, and very hungry hanging around near the town of Hyde River. When it kills and half-eats an outsider, nature photographer Cliff Benson, Benson's brother Steve starts poking around. As he gets closer to the identity of the killer, however, he finds out that the town doesn't necessarily want to find out what killed Cliff Benson-and may go to great lengths to stop Steve from doing so, either.<br />Good, scary, keep-you-up-at-night stuff. And for the first four hundred pages of this five-hundred-odd page book, that's what it remains. The only thing during this portion of the book that keeps Peretti from achieving the standard of writing set by horror authors like Stephen King and Dan Simmons is that Peretti isn't quite as good at writing his minor characters; as with a lot of lesser lights in the horror genre, Peretti sets up some of his minor characters with the \\"I'm going to die in a few pages\\" signs on their foreheads and then leads them to their grisly ends. (For the record, at least Peretti's minor characters usually stick around for a while, and do have some other function aside from dying.) There's no real life in them the way there is in Peretti's major characters. And while this makes the book suffer, it's a forgivable thing, especially when the book is as fast-paced and readable as this one is.<br />Also in those first four hundred pages, before I start firing off criticisms at the end, Peretti does a great job with his symbolism and the obvious points he's trying to get across. Let's face it, you pick up a book by a Christian author published by a well-known Christian imprint, you know you're in for an object lesson. And in the first two-thirds of this book, Frank Peretti shows you what the word \\"parable\\" means. Everything is low-key, well-done, visible to those who know what to look for. Peretti even takes the secular convention of the local religious nut and bends it to his own ends in a wonderful way; Levi Cobb wouldn't be out of place in almost ay eighties horror novel I've ever read. Had he stayed right where he was and kept going in this vein till the end, The Oath might have hit my top ten reads of the year list.<br />Then everything went downhill... and fast.<br />The book's climax throws everything you just read about above out the window. Symbolism? Subtlety? Well-drawn characters? See you later. Peretti takes the velvet cover off the sledgehammer and starts beating. The message doesn't just become the medium, it overwhelms it. Those of you who have heard me trying to illustrate this particular point and haven't been able to follow what I'm talking about, read this book. You can see both good socially-conscious writing and bad socially-conscious writing in one fell swoop, and because you're still in the same story, it becomes obvious which is which.<br />Peretti's already got the skills to be a major player in the field, and judging from the first four hundred pages of The Oath, he's already better than most of the competition. Now, if he'd take a few tips in parable writing from authors like Madeleine L'Engle or Francois Mauriac, he could turn sales of two million copies into sales ten times that, and get his message across to secular readers as well-for isn't thatthe whole point? **the whole point? **	2002-10-01

Marcia Muller and Bill Pronzini, Beyond the Grave (Carroll and Graf, 1986)<br /><br />Marcia Muller and Bill Pronzini team up for a novel that takes place in two times focusing on the same mystery. Elena Oliverez, in the present day, accidentally stumbles upon a piece of the report of one Detective Quincannon, hired to find the stolen treasures of a Mexican ranchero in the 1890s. As Oliverez gets absorbed in Quincannon's story, she finds herself looking to solve the mystery Quincannon wasn't able to uncover eighty years previously.<br /><br />The two stories interlock without a hitch, and both Oliverez and Quincannon are engaging protagonists.

It didn't help matters that the main character was unable to spell.

William Carlos Williams, Pictures from Breughel and Other Poems (New Directions 1962)<br /><br />Pictures from Breughel, the 1962 Pulitzer Prizewinner in poetry, is an excellent example of how far poetry has strayed from where it should be. I doubt you will find a serious scholar of twentieth-century American poetry anywhere on the planet who would dispute the influence of William Carlos Williams on almost everything that has come since, and you will probably find even less who would be willing to come right out and say there's anything in this book deserving of less than worship. But there are dissenting opinions, and mine is one of them.<br /><br />When Williams was on his game, he was one of America's finest poets. Problem is, Williams wasn't always on his game. A non-trivial amount of the work in this collection-perhaps a quarter of it, all told-is that hobgoblin of all poetry magazine editors, \\"prose cut up into lines.\\" There is simply nothing poetic about some of the poems therein. While I was still in college, one of my professors mentioned that Williams (in the long poem Paterson, not a part of this book) used a grocery list as a piece of a poem, and then went on to ask us whether that was actually poetry. It was obvious from the context that he was looking for a yes. I thought then, and I still think, the answer to that question is painfully obvious, and I would have gotten it wrong in that class. And we wonder why poetry today isn't read?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. There is much here of great worth, including the classic love poem \\"Asphodel, The Greeny Flower.\\" It is long, and stumbles in places, but is still one of the finest examples of the long poem in twentieth-century American poetry. This is a book well worth the time and effort, but if you stumble across something in it and find yourself wondering why both author and publisher considered it a poem, rest assured you're not alone. *** ½	2002-09-25

Katherine Neville, The Eight (Ballantine, 1988)<br /><br />This novel has achieved almost cult status in some circles, and many people consider it one of the best adventure novels ever written. It's a useful way to separate folks you know into two categories: those who are more interested in plot, and those who are more interested in writing.<br /><br />The plot is pretty darn good, when it comes right down to it. The novel takes place in two parallel times, the first being 1972 and the second the years during and after the French Revolution. Both plot lines center around the search for a mystical chess set and attempts to discover the human counterparts to various pieces (the hero and villain in each time line are the Black and White Queens, respectively; very nice little twist, that). The board, once complete, will supposedly impart unlimited power to he who possesses it, and thus leaders from Marat and Catherine the Great to Muammar Khaddafi run throughout the book, looking to get their hands on it. The pace is quick, the action almost nonstop (the present-day time line is quicker-paced and much more compelling, but the past ain't all that bad).<br /><br />The writing, on the other hand, is almost painful in places. Neville descends in to the realm of clich&eacute; at least once per chapter, at times more than once per page. Clumsy attempts at foreshadowing (you know the type: \\"but I never thought, when I woke up in the morning, that this day would change my life forever!\\") are more commonplace here than in a whole shelf of novels by Bulwer-Lytton. It's possible that Ms. Neville took the nineteenth-century definition of \\"romance novel\\" a tad too seriously for being a twentieth-century writer. And this is certainly an unique experience in that regard; a classic nineteenth-century romance novel written, all too often, like a Harlequin circa 1985.<br /><br />All in all, it is a fun little book requiring great suspension of disbelief. I'd have given it another star if part of my suspension of disbelief didn't have to be in the author's writing ability.of my suspension of disbelief didn't have to be in the author's writing ability.	2002-09-25

Ian Rankin, The Hanging Garden (St. Martin's Press, 1998)<br /><br />In a couple of months of reading almost nothing save mysteries, The Hanging Garden stood out as the best of the lot. Rankin is capable of weaving clues into a narrative with the deftest hand in a British mystery author since Colin Wilson, and his characters are more than engaging enough; as with most series mysteries, reading them out of order is liable to drop the reader into the middle of a plotline, and so it is here. The soap opera quality is not, however, as intrusive as it is in, say, the Spenser novels of Robert Parker. Funny, unexpectedly sweet at times, and more contemplative than your usual mystery novel. Rankin is something of a change of pace for the mystery reader, and a refreshing one he is. *** ½	2002-09-25

Elizabeth Mitchell, Three Strides Before the Wire: The Dark and Beautiful World of Horse Racing (Hyperion, 2002)<br /><br />No less a personage than Tom Wolfe proclaims on the back cover of this book that Elizabeth Mitchell is the perfect person to tell the story of the meteoric rise of a no-name colt called Charismatic in 1999 from the claiming ranks to missing the Triple Crown by a fractured sesamoid a few feet before the finish line of the Belmont Stakes. Which may well be true. It is unfortunate, however, that the result comes off as an unsuccessful mating between the recent literary smash Seabiscuit: The Making of a Legend and the much less-known and much finer Bill Barich book Laughing in the Hills, which remains to this day the finest racing book ever published.<br /><br />This is not to knock Mitchell's work. She takes the same basic tack Hillenbrand did in Seabiscuit, using each chapter to focus on a specific connection: the jockey, the owners, the trainer, the horse, tracing the history of each as they got closer to Derby Day 1999, and then combining them all to go through the Triple Crown. Where she crosses into Barich territory is in the addition of personal experience, and her own story as it intermeshed with that of Charismatic's connections. These sections didn't ring quite right, for reasons unknown. There are also a number of factual errors therein; most wouldn't be caught by non-racing fans, but there are a few that glare (in one particularly nasty one, jerry Bailey is on a horse as that horse loads into the gate, and around the far turn, said horse is being ridden by Gary Stevens. Not the same guy, even if all jocks look alike to you).<br /><br />Better to start with Hillenbrand and Barich, and come to this afterwards. ** ½	2002-09-25

Jack Sargent, ed., Suture: The Arts Journal, vol.

II and solved the main problem with vol. I in the same way; cut the length in half. There is much to be discovered here, but it can be overwhelming at times.<br /><br />When most people think of what we consider underground art today, the names that come to mind are Andy Warhol, Elias Merhige, maybe for those a little more in the know Masami Akita or Kenneth Anger. A select few are aware of how much farther the artistic underground goes, and Jack Sargent takes on the role of tourguide in this book/magazine though some of the basics, running the gamut from music (Lydia Lunch) to film (Mark Hejnar) to art (Trevor Brown) to photography (Romain Slocombe) and just about everything in between. Profiles and interviews of some of the biggest names in underground art, people who have been working at their chosen professions for years without ever achieving the popular success that should have gone along with the critical acclaim they have continued to pile up over the years. In general, the articles therein start with a quick profile and then go into an in-depth interview with the subject (most of the interviews were conducted by Sargent himself, but a few others were conscripted as well). Most everything here is good, solid stuff, and the words and images presented would most likely succeed in getting the uninitiated intrigued by a subject here to go seeking out more about any particular artist. Two hundred pages, though, is just too much to take all in one bite. If you pick this up-and if you have any interest at all in the stuff going on today that's more exciting than anything in the mainstream, you should-be prepared to take this at a most leisurely pace.	2002-09-25

Dennis Lehane, A Drink Before the War (Avon, 1994)<br /><br />This was my third trip through the wonderful world of Dennis Lehane (I started with Mystic River and then went on to Darkness, Take My Hand). While it was enjoyable enough, and is of historic value for introducing the world to Kenzie and Gennaro, I didn't get as much of a kick out of this one as I did out of the first two. Much of the reason for this is that Lehane spends far too much time in this book having Patrick Kenzie stop the action, turn to the reader, and make speeches about various political subjects. To Lehane's credit, at least they have something to do with the novel's plot, and they're never long enough to really start detracting from the novel itself. That they exist at all, though, is a problem. To his credit, it's obvious from the two more recent works I read before this one that Lehane has gotten much slicker at integrating medium with message since, and thus a little leeway should be allowed him here; those who found themselves turned off by the moralizing here should give Lehane another chance. Those who haven't read it yet, be prepared. Once you get past the moralizing, there's a fine little mystery/action hybrid here. ***	2002-09-25

Nicci French, The Red Room (Mysterious Press, 2001)<br /><br />I've heard a number of times that The Red Room is just plain not as good as French's previous blockbuster, the much-loved Beneath the Skin. I don't really agree. While The Red Room is marred by something of a weak ending, the novel does its thing just as well as Beneath the Skin did. And the latter was such a cleverly-executed concept that expecting any mystery novel to hold up in comparison is probably a bit unfair.<br /><br />The plot centers around a psychologist, Kit Carson, who every once in a while consults for the local police force. During one such consultation, a mentally challenged chap named Michael Doll shatters a coffee mug and uses it to scar Kit's face. Once she's back to work, the police bring her in on a murder where they believe Doll to be the perp, to give her a bit of closure. She ends up thinking he's innocent and starts going after the real killer, while the police keep trying to pin it on Doll.<br /><br />There is much to this, and what's in the novel is good. There could have been more of what's in the novel; the relationship that develops between Kit and Michael is handled in a kind of easy-way-out tone, rather than exploring the places it had the potential to go. The police officers also seem to shift a little too quickly from solicitous to annoyed; the town has the word's first all-manic-depressive police squad (wouldn't be to out of place in an Ian Rankin novel, but here it feels less like quirks and more like shallow characters). But everything moves along, the plot strings are juggled deftly, and everything is tied up in a neat little bow at the end of the game. Worth checking out for French fans, but those who have not yet been introduced should probably go with Beneath the Skin. ***	2002-09-25

Sister Midnight is the sequel to Reed's novel The Pleasure Chateau, the latter being one of the few erotic novels to combine the worst elements of Anne Rice's unreadable Sleeping Beauty books with those of the \\"naughty\\" novels of J. K. Huysmans. It took me about five pages of Sister Midnight to realize it was going to be more of the same, but I continued until I hit the fifty-page rule before tossing it to the dustbunnies.

Lois Lowry, The Giver (Laurel-Leaf, 1993)<br /><br />There are a few books released every year that gain both wide-ranging critical acclaim and deep popular support. They are few and far between, and fewer still when the book in questions stirs up as much controversy as has The Giver. Personally, I don't see what all the controversy is about; everything in here that could possibly be seen as questionable is an echo of a canonized piece of science fiction (the two books that most come to mind are Logan's Run and Brave New World). Yet, as soon as you try to boil down Nolan or Huxley for the kidlit crowd, hackles get raised. I just don't get it.<br /><br />A distillation this may be, but it is in the same way that Things Fall Apart is a distillation of Greek tragedy; there's enough there for the author to have worn her heart on her sleeve, but the themes are places within a different framework of characters well-enough drawn that no one's ever going to be accusing Lois Lowry of plagiarism (one hopes). The story centers on Jonas, on the brink of turning twelve at the beginning of the novel, in a utopian society where there's no crime, no poverty, etc. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for the colony; he's something of an uber-consultant, the person to whom the ruling council turns when they come across something they have no way to understand. For Jonas, and those Receivers before him, store the collective memories of those things which their society has managed to forget over the time they've been apart from the rest of the world (never actually stated, but by the way the characters talk about the world previously, it's been hundreds, if not thousands, of years). Lowry sets things up exceptionally, and there's a wonderful revelation about halfway through the book that alone is worth the price of admission (when Jonas figures out what seeing-beyond really is-Lowry has managed throughout the beginning of the book to lull the reader into such a state that the reader hasn't even realized what it is that's missing). While that's the only real surprise here, the predictability of much of what comes after is forgivable enough. Lowry sets up a number of easy endings, none of which she takes, and the predictable pieces to the puzzle are all part of that setup. Just because the end result could have been done better doesn't mean it's not good as it stands. Highly recommended. ****he reader hasn't even realized what it is that's missing).

He attempts to understand the glory of Mozart's music (and in the process refute various tunnel-vision styles of Mozart scholarship popular at the time) in light of Mozart's single-minded, exclusive dedication to music (pointing out a number of times that Mozart was almost impervious to other forms of media, as well as current events). Not an original response to Mozart, but one that, perhaps, had never previously been codified-Barth gives us an understanding of Mozart from the gut, running it through the brain in order to translate it into words.<br /><br />Barth is always a good writer. Where many of his books in English fail is in the translation; German can be a nasty language viewed from the perspective of English speakers. The translation here is hands down the best I've ever seen in a piece of Barth's work. The book is easy and accessible. Too bad the same translator didn't work on the Dogmatics.<br /><br />Wonderful stuff, highly recommended not only for Mozart fans but also for those who want to gain an understanding into why Mozart's music is so revered. ****	2002-07-02

Polite does this repeatedly (most egregiously, he writes himself into Casablanca), and the pieces where he does it drive me up the wall. That said, among the rest of the book, there will once in a while be a gem. Those gems are too few and far between to make this a recommended book.

However, she does get into a number of advanced topics that TYVC++ only touches on: database access, the Standard Template Library, and other things that most C++ programmers only learn if they're forced to for work. An excellent choice as the second book aspiring Visual C++ 6 programmers should reach for. *** ½	2002-06-18

Williams, A Crowd of Voices (Pariah Press, 1985)<br /><br />I found this Australian collection of poetry while looking up Richard Lortz's recently-dustbunnied novel of the same title while researching the review of it, and the coincidence was amusing enough that I went out and picked up a copy of this. My recent explorations into the world of as-yet-unfamiliar-to-me poetry have been something less than pleasing, so I went into this book without too much hope.<br /><br />The first two lines of the first poem, \\"The High Price of Travelling,\\" seemed to confirm my worst fears: \\"Even though our eyes are bruised/From reading all the daily news...\\" I almost threw the thing across the room and jumped away from it as if it were a tarantula. However, I steeled myself and went on. Not a bad choice, as those are the only two rhyming lines couched in a free-verse poem in the book, and the only time Williams ever stretches far enough to use a filler word in order to pick up the rhythm (\\"all\\" turns it from a poetic line into something out of a pop song. A very bad pop song). Bear with us, though. I should have been thinking \\"after that, where is there to go but up?\\"<br /><br />Williams does go up. He doesn't hit the heights of a David St. John or an Ira Sadoff, but don't stick him in the same bin as Rod McKuen. There's nothing all too new here, but every once in a while Williams comes up with some excellent phrasing, and everything falls together quite nicely:<br /><br />Some of the men cry, and many of the women<br /><br />Make impossible devotions. Some others<br /><br />Who are neither men nor women go about their work<br /><br />Invisibly - or else, becoming.<br /><br />(from \\"Hunger\\")<br /><br />The only other major problem in the work, aside from those first two lines, is that Williams has the type of social conscience that manifests itself with a sledgehammer (cf. such titles as \\"The Weight of Freedom\\" and \\"The King of Hate,\\" which have roughly the content one would expect from such titles). Not to say, of course, that Williams is being wrongheaded in his social values. As we have seen thousands, if not millions, of times over, though, socially conscious poetry tends to find itself mired in metaphor rather than letting the images impart the metaphor.<br /><br />This is not an unreadable book, to say the least, and while some of what's here could have used reworking, there are enough moments of small pleasure contained therein for the average poetry fan to consider picking it up, if you find it easier to come across than did I.such titles).

You can never be sure what you're going to come up with when picking one of these up; \\"inconsistent\\" is a kind way to describe CSU's output over the past thirty years or so. Beach Glass falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. They've released better material over the years, but they've released far, far worse as well.<br /><br />Gabel, a merchant Marine during WWII, picked up an excellent eye for detail somewhere along the way. In many cases, this saves his work from being run of the mill; in others, it takes what otherwise would have been overwhelmed by political message and makes it readable. What stops his work from coming through into the realm of true greatness is a lack of ability to carry a metaphor; often, it seems as if he's just getting geared up to roll with an image when the poem ends.<br /><br />It is usually better to leave a reader wanting more than it is to overfill him. Hard to fault someone for erring on the side of caution, especially in poetry, where overfilling is the norm. Still, I left this collection wishing that some of it felt more complete. ** ½	2002-06-18

Charlotte Perkins Gilman, The Yellow Wallpaper (Feminist Press edition, 1973)<br /><br />One of the best things about this small volume is that there's good deal of biographical and context information in the back. The story itself, already creepy enough on its own, takes on added weight when tied in to various minor details in Gilman's life. The biographer notes at one point that of Gilman's many writings, the only ones to survive in print at the time were this story and a textbook, Women and Economics. While this is certainly an above-average piece of work, there are a number of things about it that make it easy to see why less gripping tales in Gilman's corpus might have fallen by the wayside.<br /><br />The main annoyance of Gilman's writing style is the constant paragraph breaks, a longstanding (and, one wonders, is there any reason behind it besides tradition?) affectation of what we'll call euphemistically erotic novelists. Really, subtlety is a good thing. While we're at it, the story would be more effective with half, or less, the number of existing exclamation points. The only parallel I can think of these days, stylewise, is the chatter of vacuous fourteen-year-old girls mooning over the Backstreet Boys. It gets painful after a while.<br /><br />Annoyances of grammar aside, the story itself is quite a work. It purports to be the diary of a woman descending into madness thanks to, in essence, being treated like a woman in nineteenth-century America (the story itself dates from 1899). One wonders if H. P. Lovecraft didn't lift some of his descriptions of raw chaos from Gilman's descriptions of the wallpaper in the title, which is about the closest thing to raw chaos one is likely to find outside a straight horror story.<br /><br />There is nothing here to suspend disbelief; there is nothing here that requires it. By the time the last few sentences roll around, the author's state is entirely plausible, and that, more than anything, is what makes this such a fine piece of work. Should be, and in many places is, required reading. ****fine piece of work. Should be, and in many places is, required reading. ****	2002-06-18

Patrick Whalen, Out of the Night (Pocket, 1990)<br /><br />Much of the geographic detail of Patrick Whalen's novels makes it seem as if this guy lives in the same California everyone else does. Everything else makes it sound like he lives on another planet. If half the things in California happened that Patrick Whalen write about, the state would be deserted. (Some would contend that the election of Sonny Bono is scarier than anything Patrick Whalen has ever written about, though.)<br /><br />In this case, a public lynching during the nineteenth century is the focal point of the novel's beginning. A number of townsmen band together to hang six outsiders they believe to be responsible for a rash of deaths in the town outside which the strangers are camped. After the lynching, the town experiences a suspiciously high number of suicides, but no one (seems to) connect the dots.<br /><br />The bulk of the novel takes place a hundred years later, when murders begin again in the same tradition as previously. A ragtag band of protagonists eventually come to the same basic conclusions-that the strangers who were lynched a hundred years previous are back. Not the stuff of good dreams.<br /><br />A number of the problems that made Whalen's first novel just a touch under the par line are gone here. This book rolls along like a two-ton boulder on a smooth downhill slope. The foreshadowing is subtler, the characters more believable, the climax set up very well. There are a couple of places where predictability rears its ugly head, but such is the case with most horror novels; there are certain characters who always walk around with \\"kill me\\" tattooed on their foreheads, and some of those in Out of the Night are no exception. Still, the horror reader will find that an easy (and familiar) enough pill to swallow in the general scheme of things. Now, if only someone would make a movie of this with John Hurt and Denzel Washington.<br /><br />In my recent kick of late-eighties out-of-print horror novels, this is one of the best I've come across. *** ½rint horror novels, this is one of the best I've come across. *** ½	2002-06-18

Much of what the basic C++ programmer needs to know in order to create working programs in VC++ is covered with competence. There are a few areas of Windows-specific programming the author could have discussed in greater depth (especially more advanced graphics programming than the usual drawing program), but those faults are common to most books about VC++, and have existed since the first books on the first release of the program.<br /><br />Very good for those moving over to VC++, especially from command-line-based platforms. *** ½	2002-06-18

Nicci French, Beneath the Skin (1999, Warner)<br /><br />Think of Nicci French as the darker, rougher side of Judith Michael--a collaboration between two folks, one male, one female, on some very nasty mysteries. In this case, the main character (though he gets relatively little screen time) is a serial killer who enjoys stalking his victims, leaving them love notes, outwitting the police, that sort of thing. Your typical above-average-intelligence serial killer. We see him, and the police trying to catch him, through the eyes of three of the women he stalks. It's a clever conceit, and it's pulled off quite nicely here. The use of different first-person narrators gives more insight (especially into some of the minor characters) than one normally gets in books of this type. Add in a clever twist at the end (predictable, but still clever), and you've got a bang-up novel. I'll be reading more of Nicci French in the future. ****	2002-06-18

John Ridley, Stray Dogs (Ballantine, 1997)<br /><br />Stray Dogs is the epitome of the needless book. There is nothing to be learned from it, no deep meaning involved, no moral to the story. A guy on his way to pay off some loansharks he's into has a breakdown on the outskirts of a very strange little town in Nevada. While waiting for his car to be repaired, he finds himself in a unique situation (for him, anyway): he meets a beautiful young woman, then meets her husband. Each wants to hire him to kill the other. Nothing much to it, really.<br /><br />So why is Stray Dogs, then, such a fine piece of work? It is mostly because John Ridley knows how to keep the pages turning without ever dropping into genre fiction; there's no real genre this book would fit into anyway. It has elements of hardboiled detective fiction, a dash of the action thriller here and there, and it's loaded with the weirdness one expects from many \\"postmodern\\" European authors, but it never settles down. It just keeps moving along as fast as it can. As well, Ridley knows when to quit. Stray Dogs is a very short novel, and its brevity adds to the punch it packs. The ending may be a little too pat for some readers, but it does have a poetic justice-style twist to it that will allow the majority to at least get a cynical smile out of it. Good stuff. *** ½	2002-06-18

Jordan Smith, Lucky Seven (Wesleyan, 1988)<br /><br />Jordan Smith's second book of poems is a fine one. On the ashcan-to-academic scale once proposed (with tongue only half in cheek) by an editorial wag at a small-press magazine, Smith falls solidly within the realm of academia, yet his poems contain one quality that is markedly absent from the majority of academic poets: accessibility. Perhaps more than any poet since T. S. Eliot, Jordan Smith combines the elevation of language that marks poetry with both the erudition that distinguishes the \\"academic\\" poet and the plain speaking that makes the subjects upon which he writes understandable to the guy on the street. This isn't poetry that requires, or even begs, deep study to get at the meanings therein. There are, of course, many layers beneath for those who want to find them. But it's possible to enjoy the work of Jordan Smith simply because it is.<br /><br />Note that this technique is tried by many an aspiring poet, and in most cases it results in spectacularly bad failures. (Ah, the world wide web. Stop by a few poetry sites at random, or better yet personal web pages where the aspiring unpublished have posted the best of their high-school angst. It shouldn't take you long to see what I'm getting at.) Somehow, somewhere along the way, it seems most poets are either captured by the University system and molded into the basic academic or captured by the University system and rebel (i.e., molded into the basic ashcan). Somehow, Smith managed to tread the whole line without being molded either way, and he fooled so many people into thinking he had been that he landed a book at one of the premier academic presses. Good for you, Jordan Smith, and may you be the beginning of a renaissance of erudite poetry that the average Joe can understand. ****	2002-05-14

Ramsey Campbell, Ghosts and Grisly Things (Tor, 1998)<br /><br />I sometimes wonder where books get their titles. In this case, I have to lay the blame on some copy editor at Tor who hadn't even bothered reading the manuscript, or at best skimmed it a tad. There's the odd ghost in this collection of stories, and a grisly thing or two, but anyone who's read Ramsey Campbell before should be well aware by now that the horror which Campbell makes his stock in trade has far less to do with such external fear-inducing stimuli. Stephen King writes in the opening pages of Cujo about how our fears change as we grow older, how the monster in the closet becomes the horror of not knowing how you're going to pay the rent on time. Within that perspective, Campbell is very much an adult horror writer; while his characters find themselves in widely disparate situations doing widely disparate things, the horrors that plague them are usually those who invoke the same fear as not knowing whence the rent check. And perhaps this is why Campbell has yet to find the audience in America that King and his monsters or Koontz and his aliens have found. When the monster is something other than the average Joe (even if he's a serial killer or some other damaged version of humanity, he's still \\"other\\"), there's a cushion of safety against which the reader can lean. When the monster is a guy on a cell phone (\\"Going Under\\"), a return to one's hometown (\\"Welcomeland\\"), or the banal passengers you're stuck with on the train (\\"Missed Connection\\"), you can't help but identify. We've all been there and done that.<br /><br />Campbell is probably better known as a novelist, but he's published a number of collections of top-quality short stories. Add this one to the list. He's the grand master of writing the type of horror that has fueled the recent careers of such lights as Kathe Koja, Lucius Shepard, and Patrick McGrath; fans of such writers should have no problems glomming onto what Campbell's doing, and those few who haven't discovered him yet deserve to. ****nd those few who haven't discovered him yet deserve to. ****	2002-05-14

Colin Watson, Just What the Doctor Ordered (Dell, 1969)<br /><br />This slim novel (originally entitled The Flaxborough Crab) is yet another in Colin Watson's excellently twisted series of mysteries centering around a rural British town that makes the place where Murder, She Wrote was set look like a walk in the park. This time, the redoubtable Inspector Purbright and his sidekick Sidney are stuck with an older chap who seems to lurk about attempting to sexually assault women, always failing miserably and the scuttling off sideways when attempting to escape. I'll bet you never thought you'd come across a book that reminds you of a cross between a serial killer novel and the film Better Off Dead. Well, you've got it. Funny thing is, it was written fifteen years before either the film or the rise of the serial killer novel. Go figure.<br /><br />As usual, Watson laces his story with a heavy dose of the arsenic of social commentary on the supposed pastorality of rural British life. This is funny stuff, but always with a bite to it; the sense of humor comes off as almost bitter in places. Fans of Dorothy Parker will be more amused by this than will fans of Martin and Lewis.<br /><br />Also as usual, Watson does one of the things that drives me nuts in detective novels: there has to be someone sitting around at the end explaining some of the piece that never got tied up. (Jessica Fletcher, phone home.) However, the sitting-around-explaining bit at the end shouldn't necessarily put you off Watson, because what comes before it is top-notch stuff, even if it is recognizably genre writing. No one will ever mistake Colin Watson for Dashiell Hammett, but the man's turned out some witty, wonderful novels nonetheless. ...	2002-05-14

Robert Devereaux, Caliban and Other Tales (Leisure, 2002)<br /><br />Robert Devereaux is one of the modern masters of the horror novel. Here, he turns his twisted eye to shorter fiction (well, for half the book), and we have to ask ourselves the question we have to ask with all novelists working in another genre: is he as good in medium B as he is in medium A? That's a choice each reader has to make on his own, of course, but as far as I'm concerned, he may actually be better in medium B. \\"Ridi Bobo\\" is such a stroke of pure genius that, ten years from now, it may have entered the same space in my head reserved for such once-in-a-lifetime magnum opi as Richard Christian Matheson's \\"Red\\" or Dan Simmons' \\"Summer of Monsters.\\" Yeah, it's THAT good. Who in the name of all that's holy would think to cross a hardboiled detective story with a bunch of clowns? Bob Devereaux, that's who. (And for those who always say the same things in response to such a comment, the point isn't that you could have done it; the point is that you never thought to do it. Now go away.)<br /><br />The rest of the short stories here are just as amusing, gut-churning, and otherwise out-there, as any Devereaux fan would come to expect. However, when you've finished this book, what will have stuck with you most is the title novella. Perhaps because it's actually novel-length, clocking in at almost two hundred pages itself, or perhaps because, while there has certainly been a rash of modern retellings of Shakespeare over the past few decades (two others, in fact, that come to mind just on The Tempest), once again, Devereaux managed to tread the same old ground and cause the new feet to make it look fresh.<br /><br />\\"Caliban\\" is one thing no other Devereaux work to date has been; it is difficult. Whether this was a conscious attempt to write in a more Shakespearean style (don't worry, you'll find no sonnets here) or the beginnings of Devereaux going to a more literary style for his work remains to be seen, but \\"Caliban\\" isn't the kind of thing that can be read in one gulp. He story demands, at the very least, being put down now and again between chapters so the reader can reflect on and absorb the events that have just crossed his eyes. This is likely to jar against the heads of some readers, since one of the hallmarks of Devereaux's writing until now has been its better-than-average accessibility. However, those who are capable of making the<br />transition will be amply rewarded come the end.<br /><br />There is a writer of great brilliance lurking among us, and as most writers of great brilliance, he has somehow failed to find the audience he deserves. Robert Devereaux remains one of the ten or so best writers working in America today; if you haven't yet discovered him, by all means do so at your earliest opportunity. ****seen, but \\"Caliban\\" isn't the kind of thing that can be read in one gulp.

Haruf paints a picture of half a year in a small Colorado town, intertwining the lives of seven people into one powerful novel. While it wouldn't be accurate to call the book plot-driven, it's not your typical character study, either; too much goes on. Haruf's book inhabits the same literary terrain as does Cormac McCarthy's wonderful novel Child of God; it's a character-based book that reads too well to be a character-based book.<br /><br />The main plot thread, if there is one, concerns Victoria Roubideaux, a sixteen-year-old high-school junior who gets pregnant and is thrown out of her house. Her story touches that of the rest of the folks the book centers on, including two of her teachers, the two sons of one of those teachers, and a pair of brothers who have never known anything but the farm upon which they were born and raised. It is partially Victoria's plight that brings about the changes in these characters, but it's also just the way life goes; you live, you experience things, you learn from them. That's the way it's supposed to be, anyway, and Haruf creates a controlled world in his small town where the hand of the creator is, at least, invisible. This lends the book a fascinating realism, as if there weren't enough here in the simple stories of the simple people portrayed to keep you going anyway. I doubt there are more than a handful of people who haven't already read this book; hopefully, they'll get around to it soon. ****	2002-04-23

Parker, Taming a Sea-Horse (Delacorte, 1986)<br /><br />One of the fun things about Robert Parker's Spenser novels is that way folks keep popping up and making Spenser's life miserable. In this case, the poppee is April Kyle, a prostitute Spenser encountered a few years before. That story didn't end to anyone's satisfaction, least of all Spenser's. Now it's time for him to find out why. April has left the employ of the madam with whom Spenser set her up to turn tricks for her new boyfriend, a woodwind player struggling through Julliard. Or so everyone's been told. Spenser starts asking around, and the more he asks, the less he finds out. Typical, huh?<br /><br />In no time, one of April's associates who Spenser talked to is dead, and the pimp has had his face rearranged. There's more to this than a runaway streetwalker. Enough \\"more,\\" at least, for another Spenser novel.<br /><br />This isn't one of Parker's more elegant works, but then, a bad Spenser is still better than most anything else. It has all the hallmarks of Robert Parker. There's some cooking, some literature, a lot of snappy one-liners, and inherent readability. What's missing is the necessity to down the whole thing in one long swallow that pervades such Spenser gems as A Catskill Eagle and Early Autumn. But that's comparable to a pizza with one slice gone; the rest will still taste good. ***	2002-04-23

Then one of their small-time pranks got out of hand, and the four of them ended up in a juvenile detention facility for varying periods of time. Their tenure at that facility is the centerpiece of the book, but it is in no way the whole story. There is more to the four friends than that. That's what lifts Sleepers out of the ranks of the basic autobiography; while most everything in the book points to its central motif, many of the episodes contained here also point in other directions. Carcaterra paints a bleak picture of Hell's Kitchen in the sixties, but is still able to look back on his and his friends' life of petty crime and quotidian ruin with something approaching joy. Given the trauma of the events that followed, that's something special.<br />Not to say that the book looks at life through rose-colored glasses. Far from it, in fact. Those who've read Dwight Edgar Abbott's excellent autobiography about the California juvenile penal system, I Cried, You Didn't Listen, will find nothing in Sleepers to surprise them about the four boys' experiences in a correctional facility (others may be shocked). The material is presented in a light that comes off as surprisingly objective, but the reader is made well aware of the pain and suffering Carcaterra and his friends were subjected to at the same time. Unlike Abbott, however, Carcaterra was able to achieve some closure regarding his stay there (covered in the third of the book's three parts), giving the book less rage and more balance. Good stuff. *** ½he four boys' experiences in a correctional facility (others may be shocked).

Parker, Poodle Springs (Putnam, 1989)<br /><br />Raymond Chandler died leaving the first four chapters of a new Philip Marlowe novel. Eventually, Robert Parker's publisher got hold of them and figured that if Parker were truly the most worthy successor to the Chandler legacy, who best to complete the book? And while the finished product is a decent piece of work, it's not Chandler, and it's not really Parker, either. It certainly isn't Marlowe.<br /><br />Chandler throws a twist into the opening sentences of the book. He's married Marlowe off to a wealthy socialite who lives in Poodle Springs, a town some hours from Marlowe's usual LA haunts.  Being Marlowe, he's unwilling to retire and live off his wife's fortune, so he goes about setting up shop in town. Within an hour of starting, he's already got himself a job tracking down a good-for-nothing who's welched on a hundred thousand dollar gambling debt. Problem is, the welcher happens to be the husband of one of Marlowe's wife's best friends, who also happens to be the daughter of the richest guy in a very rich neighborhood. Things aren't looking up.<br /><br />That's all well and good. Where the problems come in is the reader's perceptions of Philip Marlowe, based on Chandler's novels, and where Parker takes the character. As with many of Parker's non-Spenser excursions in the last thirty years (with a few exceptions, notably All Our Yesterdays), this ends up sounding somewhat like a Spenser novel. If Spenser and Susan ever got hitched, they'd sound a lot like Marlowe and his wife. (Spenser would have a better time making fun of the houseboy, though.) Marlowe's treatment of the rich loses the edge it has in Farewell, My Lovely and becomes more Spenserian, a kind of resigned amusement instead of contempt. You get the idea.<br /><br />It may have been a fine plan, and the end result is readable, but not much more than that. ** 1/2	2002-04-23

Parker, Valediction (Delacorte, 1982)<br /><br />One of the best things that can be said about Valediction is that it sets up the events in one of the best Spenser novels to date, A Catskill Eagle. That alone is enough to make it worth reading. Its also a little heaver on The Continuing Saga of Spenser and Susan than many Spenser novels; judge as you will and buy accordingly. Somewhere beneath all that, theres a mystery waiting to happen. In this case, Spenser is hired by one of his foster childs dance instructors to find said instructors girlfriend, whom he believes has been kidnapped by a sect of religious extremists. The story sounds wonky from the beginning, but what seems a little off at first ends up being stranger than anyone involved ever imagined.<br /><br />The cast list reads rather like a Spensers Greatest Hits novel. Almost everyone in here has popped up before in a Spenser novel, from kids to hoods. The framework of the characters is already set up, and the plot pretty much writes itself. Its empty calories, the kind of stuff youd never catch the main character eating. However, this book is less about the mystery therein than it is about Spenser himself and how his changing relationship with Susan affects his own outlook on life. It sets the book apart somewhat, and that, combined with the events in the next book it sets up, makes this one a worthwhile addition to the canon. ***	2002-04-23

Ronald Wright, Henderson's Spear (Henry Holt, 2002)<br /><br />Liv Wyvern has a problem (well, aside from that of having been beaten up every day after school for having a name like Liv Wyvern). She's in jail in  Tahiti on suspicion of murder, having gone down to track down her father, who's been MIA since the Korean War. She's recently been tracked down by her twenty-two-year-old daughter, whom she gave up for adoption shortly after her  birth, and is now attempting to write a letter to that daughter explaining the life that is Liv and, in no small part, her extended family. Coincidentally, a few years back, she also found in the basement of her ancestral home a  number of notebooks penned by a man with some connection to the family (no one really knows what)--Frank Henderson, who journeyed the Pacific himself with Princes George and Eddy back in the 1880s. There has always been a good bit  of scandal attached to Eddy (aside from that supposed Ripper business), and a lot of it centered on a possible side trip Eddy and George made to certain Pacific islands...<br /><br />It all does sound intriguing, doesn't it? And to some extent it is.  Once the book gets off the ground, the two mysteries therein take on lives of their  own. However, it's the getting off the ground part that requires a bit of doing. The book's pace never gets above slow, so saying that the pace increases tremendously two hundred or so pages in should tell you all you need to know about  the first two hundred pages of this.<br /><br />The most intriguing piece of the puzzle is left for the very last page (and never answered, probably because Wright doesn't know the answer himself):  Wright gives us a one-page afterword telling us that he is, in fact, related to Frank Henderson, and while large stretches of Henderson's journals are works of utter fabrication, some aspects therein are true. This should have been  a foreword. Two hundred pages of glacially-paced writing are far better served when one is busy trying to figure out how much of the stuff about Henderson being captured by the Sofas in the 1870s and then running off to the  South Pacific with two grandsons of Queen Vic is true. (More, Wright intimates, than the Tahiti expedition. But, as Dick Francis recently reminded us in Wild Horses, sometimes the maker of fiction basing his materials on  real life stumbles upon the truth of it quite by accident.) Oh, one other thing that would have been helped by having that as a foreword: realizing that the Sofas are an actual existing African tribe would have stopped me fifty pages of  snickering about naming a tribe of African warriors after living room furniture. But I digress.<br /><br />At a guess, the book's enjoyability hinges upon both one's tolerance for leisurely-paced writing and one's ability to find a character to identify with  relatively early on. Thus, this is going to find a limited market in a world where Tom Clancy and Danielle Steel outsell the Bible year after year.  Still, for all that, it's not a bad little book. ** 1/2ng to figure out how much of the stuff about Henderson being captured by the Sofas in the 1870s and then running off to the  South Pacific with two grandsons of Queen Vic is true.

Wendy Walker, The Sea-Rabbit, or, The Artist of Life<br />(Sun and Moon, 1988)<br /><br />Wendy Walker is one of America's finest living prose stylists. 1988's The Sea-Rabbit, her first release, is a bit less polished then her 1992 novel The Secret Service, but is no less a joy to read for it. This collection of nine fairy tales is sure to captivate any reader who appreciates language for the sake of language from beginning to end.<br /><br />The stories herein are based on the usual fairy tales, though the reader will probably have to look pretty hard to find some of the more obscure originals (e.g. Grimm's \\"Hans the Hedgehog,\\" the basis for the central story, \\"The Contract with the Beast\\"). Walker takes these skeletons and makes them her own with the addition of sumptuous detail. Anyone who's read The Secret Service will know what I mean by that; those unfamiliar with Walker's prose style may take that statement too lightly. It's hard to explain what differs about Walker's particular eye for detail (as opposed to, say, Clive Barker's or Robert Lowell's), but in reading a Walker tale there's always a sense that the details are just the slightest bit off. Even though you're in the land of the fairy tale, and so things should be somewhat out of kilter, there's that added layer. It's like constructing a science fiction world with physics laws that resemble our own in no way, and then breaking them so subtly that only the most astute physicists would notice, but lay readers will get the feeling that something's not exactly right.<br /><br />Once you've got your head wrapped around that idea, pull out to the next layer, the conscious distortion of time and narration that keeps the reader's head spinning. For example, in \\"The Contract with the Beast\\"'s opening pages, the existence of Jack My Hedgehog (Hans, in the Grimm tale) is presented to us as a wild flight of fantasy by Jack's alleged father; a few pages on, Jack takes on a life of his own. A few pages later, the father enters back into play, telling the reader about his dream of the night before. And so on. One can never be sure whether he's stuck in fantasy within fantasy, or whether Jack's world is real within the story. And if it's not, who's doing the dreaming, Jack or his father? Much in the same way as first encountering Cormac McCarthy's distinctive prose style, the reader is forced to adapt to Walker's wheels within wheels; once you've figured out that \\"figuring it out\\" is a hopeless exercise best left to dissertation writers, it's a lot easier to go along for the ride and see where it takes us.<br /><br />Walker should be one of America's best-loved and top-selling writers. As it stands, she's America's best-kept secret, and unjustly so. She deserves a much, much wider audience. **** ½her enters back into play, telling the reader about his dream of the night before.

Larry Niven, Convergent Series (Del Rey, 1979)<br /><br />Convergent Series is half previously published material and half new material written for this book, including five new Draco's Tavern tales and some new Known Universe stuff. (Some of the previously published stuff is proto-Known Universe material, as well.) If you're a Larry Niven fan, you know what that means. If you aren't, what it means is that this is a pretty good place to get to know Larry Niven.<br /><br />There is (as there is in most science fiction; about 90% of this collection is solidly in the sci-fi vein, while a story or two is more in the straight mystery genre) a little of the annoying \\"this was put in just to make this sound like a science fiction story\\" claptrap here, but it's kept to a bare minimum, and Niven allows the stories to be carried by the characters and the plots within, rather than relying on gadgetry and technology to do the work for him. As such, Niven's science fiction is more accessible than a good deal of the hard stuff, and he's easily as readable as, say, Greg Bear. If you've not managed to glom onto Niven yet, thirty-five years into his career, this collection is a fine way to start. ***	2002-04-08

Upon reflection, that's probably because I was (still am) a sucker for bug novels. Creepy crawly things scare the hops out of me, especially with the eco-nuts spouting their nonsensical spew. Hey, when I was ten years old, it did seem like a real possibility that fire ants would wipe out the whole country by 1980. So I was gullible. Sue me.<br /><br />I finally tracked down another of Wernick's five (to the best of my research abilities) novels. Cain's Touch, released in 1978, was Wernick's second novel, and there's not a creepy-crawly to be found therein. In fact, it's oddly reminiscent of the Werlin Brothers' novel The Savior, released by Doubleday the same year Cain's Touch came out. Whether it's the lack of bugs, the proximity to the Werlins' novel (I've no idea which was released first), or some combination of the two, while reading Cain's Touch I found myself less able to ignore the pitfalls of genre writing than I was with The Fire Ants.<br /><br />Not to say that the diehard fan of psych-horror novels won't find a lot here to sink his teeth into. Cain's Touch is the story of Michael Hietala, who has the ability to lay on hands. In the novel's opening scene, when Michael is nine, he heals an old fisherman's arthritis and mentions that he used his laying on of hands to kill his twin brother when they were three. We then skip to twenty-six years later, when Michael has become a successful scam artist. He's starting a new church after apprenticing four years with a crooked televangelist, and he seems to have forgotten about his gift altogether. Yet part of what the church does is heal people. Go figure. Problem is, all that healing requires payment. Preferably in advance.<br /><br />Cain's Touch is an easy, fun read. Nothing terribly deep, certainly nothing that would have pretenses to literary greatness. It does what it does, and it's satisfied doing what it does. As with The Fire Ants, the sexual content of Cain's Touch is a bit over the norm for the genre (even for the late seventies), and may put a few readers off. However, that doesn't mean Wernick isn't worth trying. Next time you stumble across one, if you're a horror fan, give it a try. ** ½pretenses to literary greatness.

Peter Whitehead, Baby Doll (Velvet, 1997)<br /><br />Peter Whitehead is best remembered these days for chronicling the rise of sixties London psychedelia in such films as Charlie is My Darling (arguably the finest Rolling Stones film ever made) and Tonite Let's All Make Love in London. Whitehead found himself in the south of France in 1972 with a month's supply of psychedelic drugs, a month's supply of film, and model/actress/heiress Mia Martin (best remembered these days as one of the Benny Hill Show girls during the 1971-72 season). The result was Baby Doll.<br /><br />Baby Doll didn't see publication for twenty-five years. One wonders, cynically, whether the reason is the nudity or the track marks it exposes in a few of the photos. Either way, Velvet got hold of it in 1997 and brought it to light. The photos are stark black-and-white surrealist images; Whitehead obviously spent a good deal of time during his formative years looking at Hans Bellmer's disturbing photographs of dolls. (Aside from the obvious connection, Whitehead also uses disembodied doll heads and mannequins as props; Mia is the only live subject.)<br /><br />What sticks in the mind, though, is Whitehead's ability to conceptualize. The whole, though it's obvious in various ways that the photographs are presented out of chronological order, comes together in a coherent way. The book is presented in four \\"chapters\\" of photographs, each building on the ones before in surreal/dadaist content until, in the climactic photographs, there are little more than blurred figures. (It's worthwhile speculating that Alan Parker may have had this in mind when conceiving the \\"Comfortably Numb\\" segment from Pink Floyd's The Wall; there are a number of similarities between the way the book and the filmed version of the song build.) The construction of the presentation makes this more than just prurient interest in a now-retired TV actress. It's not earth-shattering, and Whitehead wasn't covering any new ground here, but it's not bad by any means. ***but it's not bad by any means. ***	2002-04-08

It has achieved endless comparisons to John Kennedy Toole and William Faulkner, made ten-best lists the world over, and been lauded as the book most overlooked by all the major literary awards. Needless to say, after all that, it's roughly the literary equivalent of the 1963 shock film The Tingler (no pun intended); with all that buildup, someone's bound to get let down.<br /><br />First, to address the Toole comparisons: putting Lord of the Barnyard side-by-side with the unreadable piece of dreck that is A Confederacy of Dunces is to compare a Mozart sonata to a six-year-old plinking out Chopsticks on a toy piano for the first time. Everything Toole tried to do, Egolf succeeded in doing. That said, Lord of the Barnyard confirms what I have been saying for years; even if Toole's godawful tripe had succeeded in its lamebrained effort, it still would have sucked. Lord of the Barnyard doesn't, but that's less a factor of the personages and situations therein than it is indicative of Egolf's narrative style (hence the Faulkner comparisons).<br /><br />The difference between Egolf and Faulkner is much more subtle, and the comparisons therein are more understandable. Where Egolf fails and Faulkner succeeded is in the subtleties of character development. Egolf falls into the same trap many modern authors do where his characters are concerned; he mistakes event + event + event + event = accurate picture of character's psychological profile, and then goes on to point out the dysfunctionality of the events in question, assuming that those events will go on to fully explain the character's adult (to use the term loosely) behavior. This sort of thing is acceptable, even to be encouraged, in genre writing, where the plot is usually far more important than the characters within it anyway (and which is what makes someone like Stephen King so refreshing). But if you're going to write capital-L literature, where characters are equal in importance to (or greater in importance than) the plot, the author needs to understand that the whole is more than the sum of its parts; character development is as much in what you don't say as in what you do. Faulkner was a master at figuring out the art of putting together the whole. Egolf has a bit more work to do in that regard. He could also take a few pages from Faulkner's abilities with spare writing; what might have barely cleared a hundred fifty pages as a Faulkner piece soars to over four hundred in Egolf's hands.<br /><br />And that is the book's main failing. While there are certainly a number of chuckle-inducing scenes in the book, they're tied together with seemingly endless streams of explicatory prose that exist for little reason. Egolf doesn't seem to want the reader to work for anything here, and the result is almost unbearable logorrhea. Nothing would have been lost, and much gained, by editing this manuscript down another hundred or so pages.<br /><br />In short, there's nothing about this novel that doesn't correspond to the majority of first-novel failings; one just expects to see them less with such a universally-lauded book. It's entirely possible that Egolf's next work will live up to the standards the press set him for this one. We'll have to wait and see. ** ½is usually far more important than the characters within it anyway (and which is what makes someone like Stephen King so refreshing).

There are far too many examples of the former type to list; Elizabeth Graver's fine novel The Honey Thief is an excellent example of the latter.<br /><br />Sick of New York City, widowed paralegal Miriam Baruch takes her eleven-year-old daughter Eva out to Finger Lakes country for a bit of rest, relaxation, and rehab; Eva has developed a rather nasty habit of stealing things. Eva develops a relationship with a local beekeeper (that her mother doesn't know about) while her mother is off developing relationships of her own. As the book unfolds, we alternate scenes of present-day life for Eva with her mother's recollections about the decline and untimely death of Eva's father.<br /><br />Despite the way it sounds, this doesn't set off the dysfunctional-family-novel alarm bells. Being a single parent having trouble coping doesn't necessarily put you into dysfunction territory (far more dysfunctional are those novels where a couple of idiots stay together \\"for the kids\\" and end up doing said kids more harm than good; I don't think I need to provide examples here, you've all read a few, no doubt). I'd hate to think readers were feeling reluctant to pick this up because it smacks of the Oprahesque. At its heart, it's a novel about just getting along in life. Questions aren't answered, loose ends abound, people are just plain messy, and the whole thing feels perfectly natural.<br /><br />You'd think that in the thirty years since the slice-of-life novel came into vogue, it would have gotten boring. Thankfully, this is not the case. There are far more than eight million stories in the naked city, and some of them are told by writers as good as Graver. May their numbers increase. ****ay their numbers increase. ****	2002-04-03

Phillipson is a fun guy to read, has many good points to make, and has a lot of native wit, something that cultural criticism has been in desperate need of at least since Derrida. Unfortunately, it's all so firmly couched in the jargon of theoretical literature that finding the point of anything becomes something akin to an archaeological dig. Once you've found something that might contain a nugget, time to get out the paintbrush and start getting the dust away from it so you can get the general outline. More's the pity, most of what you find is going to be irreparably calcified anyway.<br /><br />I would (and have, on a number of occasions) be more than willing to brave such godawful lingo-tossing. Try to read, say, Georges Bataille or Julia Kristeva without a dictionary handy and you'll find yourself drowning in a sea of legomenon, but that doesn't make their work any less worth reading. Phillipson, however, adds the maraschino cherry to this logorrhea split (with extra nuts, of course) by descending into the woeful depths of the conscious misspeller. You know the type: the person who must use \\"thee\\" every time the word \\"the\\" appears, or can't help but hyphenate words in order to bring out their meanings (e.g. \\"dis-ease\\"). Yes, I do realize this is a piece of stylistic anal retentiveness on my part, but that sort of thing drives me up the wall and halfway across the ceiling. Why ruin the subtlety of a perfectly good word? And why speed up the degeneration of the American mind by consciously misspelling words? Leave that to the marketing people who have convinced us that \\"ketchup\\" and \\"donut\\" are the right way to spell certain food items. We don't need it from people who are supposedly writing for the cream of the crop. (zero)	2002-04-03

Clayton Eshleman, What She Means (Black Sparrow, 1978)<br /><br />It seems to me (from the perspective of the ex-English major) that we do irreparable damage to our high school and younger students in the English classroom. We hand them archaic, outdated poetry and say \\"this is poetry. Read it, learn, it, live it, there'll be a test on Monday.\\" We breed, in many, a resentment of, if not a hatred of, poetry. It has always seemed to me that the attitude that causes this malady comes from the widespread belief among teachers that modern poetry isn't, well, poetry at all. This malady continues on up the ladder, of course. No one teaches Youssef Komunyakaa outside senior seminars, and likely never will. Jorie Graham or Clayton Eshleman? Forget it until you get into graduate writing programs.<br /><br />I propose turning the system on its head. Give Jorie Graham to the junior high kids. Once they're in high school and better able to handle more nakedly-presented adult themes, give them Eshleman and Bukowski. This is stuff that high-school age kids are going to be able to read, understand, and identify with. (Then, once they've got the basics of how to interpret poetry down, hit `em with Shakespeare's archaisms when they get to college.)<br /><br />Clay Eshleman's many books of fantastic high-quality work would play an integral part in this little scheme of mine. Eshleman has been, since the sixties, one of the three or four American surrealists worth reading, despite the contradiction that surrealist poetry is about unrequited love and Eshleman's seems to be about the bliss of monogamy, in many small ways. Hey, I can't explain it, I just read the stuff. What She Means may well be one of the finest books with which to start a career of reading and understanding poetry. Eshleman's late-seventies work shows a bit more control than what he was writing earlier in the decade (cf. The Gull Wall), but there's enough of the reckless abandon therein to appeal to the audience who needs that sort of thing in their reading material. Much of it is gloriously sexually explicit, which makes for a great shortcut into the mind of the high school student, but one gets the message relatively quickly that the sexual aspect of the work is only one part of a much larger and much more interesting whole. Recurring themes and images fade in and out, crossing poems with impunity and allowing for class assignments on, say, the role of Isis in the book's middle poems, or the recurring image of the Doric column. (One is tempted to make an allusion to Shakespeare as Corinthian. One will resist as much as possible.) Final paper: use any three Eshleman books to examine Clayton and Caryl's relationship. Extra credit for writing the whole paper in free verse.<br /><br />What makes Eshleman's work so special is that, in various ways, he shows us that the geneses of these poems come from a place where the writing part of it-the grammar, the word choice in many cases, other pieces of the puzzle that is poetry-are second nature. This is a man who has mastered the language to the point where he can sit down and pull together a rough draft for one of these poems, chip away at it with a few revisions, and come up with something that elevates language in new, interesting ways. He takes his experiences and impressions of the world around him and makes them universal, and he does so in a way that both inspires and elucidates. That's what poetry is supposed to do. Yes, the stuff we all read in high school does the same thing, but you have that extra added layer of work that comes from having to translate language that's been out of date since a few years after it was written. (And people think immediate obsolescence is a new thing. Yeah, right.) Here we have a body of work, and Eshleman is the only American surrealist with such a substantial body in print through major presses, that takes away that layer; there are a few cultural references that might jar against the head of someone born after 1980, but 1980 is a whole lot closer to the modern American mind than is 1630. The themes are no less universal, the language is no less a thing of beauty for being modern, and the poetry is, simply, no less valid an example of immortal writing. Yes, Clayton Eshleman IS that good. More's the pity that so few people will ever get to read this stuff because they were turned away from poetry so many years ago. **** ½meone born after 1980, but 1980 is a whole lot closer to the modern American mind than is 1630.

Winter, Run (Onyx, 2000)<br />Douglas Winter, whose sole excursion into publishing previously was editing a number of excellent anthologies, heads to the front of the camera, as it were, with his first novel, Run. One wonders, idly, what took him so long-especially after reading this.<br />Burdon Lane is an arms dealer-mostly legal, with some grey-area stuff around the edges to supplement the income. All of it is well-known and well-sanctioned by his employer, UniArms, who do the same thing, just on a much bigger level. One day, the president of UniArms calls Burdon and his sidekick, Renny Two-Hand, into the office and asks them to accompany a shipment to Manhattan. It should be an easy job, but if it were, there wouldn't be a novel, would there?<br />Most reviews, and all the blurbs, focus on the book's fast pace and nonstop action. Which is true, for the last two hundred or so pages of this four-hundred-page novel. Once the deal goes sour, you'll finish this in one marathon session. Winter provides no place to take smoke breaks in here; the shooting starts, and it does not end. It's not every action-novel writer who can keep up that kind of a pace for two hundred pages.<br />What impressed me more about the novel, though, were the first two hundred pages, which involve a lot of waiting, a lot of background, and some nicely unobtrusive setup for the events to come. I can't count the number of action, mystery, horror, et al. novels where the setup portions drag like a three-toed sloth with a gimp leg. But even when Winter is setting up Burdon's character, introducing us to the minor players, and other such mundane tasks, the book is still brisk enough that the reader is reluctant to let go. This comes half from Burdon Lane's narrative style, which has the look and feel of an illiterate construction worker reciting the famous soliloquy from Hamlet, and half from an ability to flesh out minor characters with little details most writers would overlook. (The comparison here to one of Winter's longtime clients, Stephen King, is obvious. The man learned from the master of the quirky detail and the two-line character sketch. He learned very well. This is not to say that this sounds in any way like a Stephen King novel; Winter has a voice all his own, and it's a doozy.) Someone needs to make a movie of this book, if only to give Steve Buscemi the chance to play CK, one of the other guys accompanying the shipment.<br />I hate to use phrases like \\"adrenaline-fueled,\\" but this book deserves them all. All-natural guarana-enhanced sport drinks have nothing on Doug Winter's writing style. ****comparison here to one of Winter's longtime clients, Stephen King, is obvious.

King returns to his former glory	Stephen King, Everything's Eventual (Scribner, 2002)<br /><br />Rumors of Stephen King's demise have been greatly exaggerated. 2002 is gearing up to be another highly productive year for King, and he starts us off with his first short story collection since 1993, Everything's Eventual. It sure is nice to know that King doesn't feel the need to turn everything into a novel, and while his short stories have gotten longer, they still pack the punch that the early tales did. However, they pack it in a more literary style. This is great stuff. It's still recognizably King, but it's New Yorker King rather than bargain-basement porn-mag King (check the prepub credits in Night Shift).<br /><br />After reading the title story in this collection, I briefly fantasized about a world where the millions of people who reflexively buy King's works who've never so much looked inside a literary magazine would bring away from this (and other such tales in this volume, notably \\"Luckey Quarter\\" and \\"Lunch at the Gotham Caf&eacute;\\") an understanding of the complexities and ambiguities of the modern short story such that they could crack the binding on the new issue of the Virginia Quarterly Review, say, and not feel out of place. (From there, it's one step to getting them to like poetry, and than I can take over the world at leisure.) I came to my senses a few minutes later, but there's still something to be said for it. Up till now, King's stories have always been well-defined pieces of work, with strong beginnings and endings and enough happening in the middle to keep people reading. No one would ever accuse, say, \\"Survivor Type\\" or \\"Grey Matter\\" of being an ambiguous piece of writing. But King was already showing his literary hand as far back as Skeleton Crew (with the haunting story \\"Nona\\"), and he tipped it last year with the brilliant \\"Blind Willie.\\" Now comes Everything's Eventual, and he's laid it on the table; this is the new King, the one I've been waiting for during the last couple of transitional releases. These stories are ambiguous, they require thinking (and sometimes leaps in logic) from the reader, and they're simply better-written than his early work. King the literary author has finally caught up with King the storyteller.<br /><br />As seems almost obligatory these days, yes, there's a Dark Tower story. However, it doesn't feel as invasive as most recent Dark Tower references, because it's actually set in mid-World (rather than showing up as a reference, as in \\"Low Men with Yellow Coats\\" or Bag of Bones). It's also very much in the style of early King, despite actually being in a series, and thus begging for loose ends. Oddly, \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" stands on its own more than any Dark Tower material since the first book. Go figure.<br /><br />King's back, and better than he's been since The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I knew he'd get there sooner or later...of transitional releases.

Richard Laymon, Among the Missing (Leisure, 1999)<br /><br />Richard Laymon has been churning out suspense and horror novels since what seems like the dawn of history now, and yet is just this side of unknown in his native land. Across the pond, they can't get enough of him; few Laymon novels don't get a first press in England that outstrips his total American sales. (This, thankfully, may be changing; his 1998 novel Bite hovered around the edges of a few bestseller lists before fading into American obscurity, at least.) Once again, the Americans are missing out. I've never read a Laymon novel that hasn't at least been a kick in the pants. The best of them are a right cross to the jaw (Tread Softly, the Beast House novels, etc.). Among the Missing, on the physicality scale, is probably an uppercut to the ribcage; it's pretty durned good, but straight suspense just isn't what I expect from a guy whose books tend to be populated with mutants, inbreds, vengeful ghosts, etc. Call it my unpreparedness rather than any defect on Laymon's part that this book didn't get a higher rating.<br /><br />Not to say it isn't good. Where the murder mystery is concerned, this one works just as well as anything you'll actually find in the mystery section. An engaged couple, on their way to a canoeing outing on Saturday morning, find a headless body by the river. They also find a guy sleeping next to it, who runs off when he notices them. Draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Laymon strings the reader along very nicely, throwing in more than enough red herrings to keep both police and reader busy tracking down false avenues of inquiry. It should be noted, as an aside, that it's quite nice to read a murder mystery where the cops aren't dumber than the reader. But I digress. Clues come fast and furious, and the action goes just about as quickly. This is one of those four-hundred-page novels that, once you've started, you're either going to quit in fifty pages because you can't stand it or finish in one sitting. I went the latter route, with a little time off for such extraneous things as food and sleep.<br /><br />Fans of the mystery genre who haven't been introduced to the wild and wonderful world of Richard Laymon would definitely be well-served by this book. Horror fans looking for an inroad would probably do better tracking down the Beast House novels. One way or the other, if you haven't glommed on to Richard Laymon yet, go out of your way to give him a try. He's one of America's best-kept secrets. *** ½finish in one sitting.

Nancy Buckingham, The Dark Summer (Ace, 1968)<br /><br />I've never been quite sure what it is that defines the gothic genre, and after reading The Dark Summer, I'm even more confused. The Dark Summer (put out by Ace, better known these days for their science fiction offerings, the collectible Ace Doubles-\\"first in gothics!\\" is emblazoned across the top of this one) seems to me more a straight murder mystery with a dash of romance thrown in for good measure. No old mansions, no supernatural goings-on, no graveyards, not even a single nubile young thing being chased across a moor by an unseen assailant. There is quite a bit, in fact, more of gravy than of the grave of The Dark Summer.<br /><br />Jan, who's been living overseas for five years, comes back to England to convalesce in the care of her Aunt Frank, a crossword-puzzle constructor and quiz show host. While at her aunt's, she meets old boyfriend Mark, and of course, the feelings she thought were long-dead rise to the surface again immediately. Unfortunately, though, Mark's cousin has a thing for Jan as much as Mark does, and while Mark's wife seemingly perished in a fire the year before, she turns up very much alive... until someone kills her.<br /><br />Gothic tag aside, The Dark Summer is a slim, spare whodunit with an engaging cast of characters and an author who has a better eye for the tangled relationships of the adolescent world than most adult authors. It's probably hard to find in the original paperback edition these days (it's still in print in large print hardcover, and as an extremely expensive audiocassette, both available at Amazon), but given the price you'll pay when stumbling across it at a used bookstore, it's well worth picking up. Buckingham can easily hold her own with most genre mystery writers, and the books are slim enough to be a great palate-cleansing type read in between weightier tomes. Recommended for mystery lovers all around. ***	2002-03-29

Terry Goodkind, Soul of the Fire (Tor, 1999)<br /><br />...<br /><br />As we left Richard and Kahlan last time, the two were girding the lions of the D'Haran Empire against the Emperor Jagang and his Imperial Order, getting ready for the all-out war sure to come. In book five, Jagang's army makes their first move, attempting to annex the Midlands province of Anderith, a minor strategic gem. Richard and Kahlan happen to be in a good position to stop them, but there's a slight complication in the mix; creatures of magic called the Chimes are loose in the world, thanks to the events at the end of book four (not mentioned here for plot-spoiler reasons). Richard's job is twofold; get rid of the Chimes while stopping Jagang from taking Anderith, which would give his army a solid base in the Midlands.<br /><br />It would take a half-blind five-year-old not to figure out by page 100 of this eight-hundred-page novel not to make the right connections to figure out the bulk of what's going to happen by the end. There are still a few twists and turns to be had, but by this time the reader who's gone through the last few thousand pages with Richard and co. is probably less concerned with plot twists than he is with seeing what's going to happen next in the grand scale of things. And Goodkind gives us the grand scale here. He keeps the narrative just as readable while turning his attention to various contemporary political issues more than he has previously. The book does have a more nakedly political bent to it than the series has previously shown, and I think that's where a lot of the denigration comes from. Admittedly, it's a judgment call. I don't think it detracts from the book at all (and I'm one who usually sees alarm bells going off the second politics-as-message rears its ugly head in fiction); others feel otherwise.<br /><br />The writing, the characterization, and the readability haven't gone downhill a bit. If you've read the first four, it's definitely worth going at least this far to see if things will turn sour for you. ****least this far to see if things will turn sour for you. ****	2002-03-29

Robert Devereaux, Santa Steps Out (Leisure, 1998)<br /><br />My reverence of Robert Devereaux's first novel, Deadweight, borders on the worshipful. After recently re-reviewing it, both one of my best friends and Devereaux himself e-mailed me and told me exactly the same thing: to get my hands on Santa Steps Out pronto. So I did (well, a little less pronto than I should have). They were both absolutely correct.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this book will offend you. Any book containing scenes where Santa Claus cheats on his wife with the Tooth Fairy in the bed of a six-year-old (who's presently sleeping in it) while a voyeuristic Easter Bunny watches is bound to find some way to offend everyone. Most who brave the uproariously funny goings-on between the mythical creatures will probably end up offended by the moral to the story, as well; sometimes the truth hurts, eh? However, as should be obvious from Devereaux's afterword, \\"Making Light of Santa Claus,\\" the various publishing renegades who championed this book from the completion of its final draft until its publication eight years later didn't show up just for the beer. Devereaux shows, once again, his ability to take the looniest possible situations, things so over the top they make scenes in Dan O'Bannon-scripted films look like documentaries, and still connive the reader into forming bonds. In Deadweight, we found ourselves empathizing with a corpse; here, we commiserate with Santa Claus. Think about it.<br /><br />You may think I'm stressing this point a little hard, but, well, I am. This book is not for the weak of heart, stomach, eyes, arches, or any other body part. It's the literary equivalent of Peter Jackson's outrageously funny movie Dead Alive, but with far more emotional depth sprung upon the unsuspecting reader. Those intrepid few who find themselves at its gates and make it past the first fifty or so pages are in for a fantastic ride, and the rest are missing out.

Gail Anderson-Dargatz, A Recipe for Bees (Harmony, 1998)<br /><br />At first, A Recipe for Bees has the look and feel of your typical dysfunctional family novel. Augusta Olsen, traveling home from the hospital where her  son-in-law is being operated on after a seizure-induced stroke, ends up getting off the train at the wrong stop to use the rest room. The train goes on without her, and Augusta calls her next-door neighbor, Rose to come pick her up.  While Rose is driving her home, and after they get there, Augusta tells Rose and Karl, Augusta's husband, a number of stories about Augusta and Karl's lives up to this point, interspersed with present-day events and reflections  on things she'd rather not talk about aloud. While there is dysfunction in evidence all around, there are snatches of writing here and there that alert the reader that this isn't your typical novel; Anderson-Dargatz is capable  of much more than the average...novel of the week.<br /><br />Those moments of inspired, poetic writing are few, however, and some of them are easily missed in the greater scheme of things. A Recipe for Bees is one  of the most difficult kinds of novels to read, a book with almost no pace to it that demands all the concentration the reader can give it. The first few chapters, especially, are quite difficult to get through. Once you've got a  sense of the characters, the book gets more engrossing, and eventually it does give the distinct feeling that Anderson-Dargatz will eventually write the novels that will put her on a par with fellow Canadian authors...A Recipe for Bees isn't one of them, but years from now, scholars will come back to it and call it a formative novel.<br /><br />I'll be looking forward to reading more of Anderson-Dargatz' work. ***	2002-03-22

Nicholas Whittaker, Blue Period: Notes from a Life in the Titillation Trade (Gollancz, 1997)<br /><br />Nicholas Whittaker, just out of school, jobless, and dreaming of writing the Great British Novel, answered a small ad for an assistant editor in the  Sunday paper. This started him on a seven year career at two of Britain's men's magazines, Fiesta and Razzle. He distilled the essence of those seven years into this little autobiographical yarn. And having finished it, I'm still  not entirely sure what to make of it.<br /><br />Whittaker strikes me as the self-deprecating type, and that tends to bleed over into his descriptions of his co-workers and office areas. Obviously,  it's a different-colored lens than that of the usual self-aggrandizing autobiographer, but it still telegraphs to the reader to take everything herein with a grain of salt. It also says quite a bit about what working in the porn industry  did to Whittaker; it always seems as if he's just this side of uncomfortable talking about sex, whether he was involved with it or not.<br /><br />That's not to say the whole book has the \\"nobody knows the trouble I've seen\\" pall cast over it. Whittaker is possessed of a quick wit, even if it is  usually turned on himself, and there are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny. The balance is a bit rigged, it seems, but the attempt is there, and for the most part it succeeds. There's never quite so much despair that the  reader stops caring.<br /><br />Whittaker's ultimate aim, when one reads between the lines, is the demystification of the porn industry. He often compares himself and his workmates to  the more public porn barons (for Americans, the comparison would be the guy in the copy room looking at his life as it relates to Hugh Hefner's), and wonders how the rest of the world can think everyone who works at a magazine  could possibly live like that. But it's the illusionary atmosphere of the whole thing that keeps people buying the magazines, and Whittaker shows us the illusion time and again. It is in this where the book best succeeds; Whittaker  relates his anecdotes and lets the reader's mind make all the necessary connections. One thinks that, after he's done with the Great British Novel, he'd probably make a fine living as a barrister. Assuming, of course, they  don't castigate him for his shady past. ***Whittaker shows us the illusion time and again.

I was wrong.<br /><br />Temple of the Winds is the fourth Sword of Truth novel, continuing the adventures of the many people weve come to know and love over the course of the  last twenty-five-hundred-odd pages of the series. While the main drawback of Blood of the Fold (the constant retelling of previous events, as if Goodkind expects people to read this one who havent read the first  three) remains, the book is larger enough that it becomes no more than an annoying background buzz, and it detracts far less from whats going on this time around. This time, the ratio of buzz to action is greatly diminished,  leading to a far more satisfying reading experience than in the last novel. And much does happen (all of which contains major plot spoilers for those who havent read the first three novels).<br /><br />If you havent started the Sword of Truth novels yet, what are you waiting for? Its a big investment to make, but at least this far in, Goodkind has  yet to bungle the payoffs, and they keep getting better. **** ½	2002-03-20

Jack Kerouac, Scattered Poems (City Lights, 1971)<br /><br />Over the few years Kerouac wrote, he dashed off a number of poems that managed never to get collected, many of them in letters to Allen Ginsberg and  Neal Cassady. City Lights, with help from Ginsberg, compiled a small volume of these poems and released them some thirty years ago.<br /><br />While a few of the works here (and, in some cases, a line or two within one of the works) shows the power and natural affinity for language that makes  Kerouac one of the enduring figures of American literature, Most of what's here is solid evidence that, where uncollected poems are concerned, there's usually a reason why they weren't published in the first place. Perhaps it is the prominence of the author in question, but while reading most of this work, I got a sense of hopelessness, a pathetic (in the classic definition of the term) feeling of emptiness. Unlike both the surrealism and the jazz from  which Kerouac and his fellow Beats drew their inspiration, and also unlike the authors<br />from that time who have been incorrectly labelled as Beats (Bukowski, Alfred Chester, to an extent Paul Bowles, etc.), Kerouac's material seems to lack  either the underlying meaning or the sense of immediate purpose that separates the best of the aforementioned authors from their scads of less talented imitators.<br /><br />One place in which Kerouac does shine here, though, is in a small selection of haiku at the end of the book. Kerouac was one of the first American  authors to really grasp the spirit of English-language haiku, as mentioned in a brief intro to the book's last section. Kerouac quotes a few Basho haiku and bemoans the inability of English to imitate the free-flowing Japanese language,  coming to the conclusion that the \\"seventeen syllable\\" rule should be dropped for American haiku (as most serious haiku writers and scholars in English have also done in the forty or so years since Kerouac originally composed the  works here). In the haiku, where Kerouac is forced to work with tight lines and spare images, his gift comes through. Unfortunately, it does so in far too few other pieces in this book. **rks here).

James Lowder, ed., Realms of Valor (TSR, 1993)<br /><br />Realms of Valor was the first short story collection to showcase the continuing adventures of various well-known personages in the Advanced Dungeons and  Dragons world of the Forgotten Realms (a second, Realms of Infamy, appeared later). Each of the stories is written by someone who was instrumental in the creation of the original characters, e.g. Scott Ciencin, who  wrote parts of the Avatar Trilogy under the name Richard Awlinson, gives us a tale about Adon, the priest from the adventuring party in those books, and Robert Salvatore brings back Drizzt Do'Urden, who's spent time on the New York  Times bestseller list on quite a few occasions over the past decade.<br /><br />The book's probably not a starting point for reading about the Realms, but for those who have a few series' worth under their belts, it's great to see  one's old friends again. The stories, in general, live up to the novels that introduced the various characters within. They do so well enough, in fact, that some characters with which the reader might not yet be familiar may  inspire the more industrious reader to go looking for the books that the characters came from. Very good stuff. *** ½	2002-03-20

Terry Goodkind, Stone of Tears (Tor, 1995)<br /><br />Terry Goodkind continues his Sword of Truth series for another thousand pages, writing a book as good, if not better, than Wizard's First Rule. The adventures of Richard, Kahlan, and co. continue.<br /><br />The events that concluded the first book (not recounted here because they're plot spoilers) were supposed to bring peace to the world, right? Right--but peace is the last thing on anyone's mind as book two opens, a few minutes after the close of book one. (Nice touch, that.) Richard may have figured out how to use the Wizard's First Rule to his own advantage, but in doing so he violated the Wizard's Second Rule, about which there is much talk without anyone really saying what it is. (By the time anyone gets around to teaching it to Richard, you'll probably have figured it out on your own from the varying contexts; it's a reworded clich&eacute;.) By now, everyone but Richard is well aware that Richard has the gift. He is a wizard, albeit an untrained one. Richard's refusal to believe that he has the gift gets him into enough troubles, but now he's confronted with others who know he has the gift. Some of them are less than happy about it. And so a whole new set of problems opens up.<br /><br />Despite some of the more soap operalike aspects that are unavoidable in any multi-thousand-page fantasy epic, Goodkind keeps the string-the-reader-along stuff to a minimum, uses more subtle cliffhangers than he did in the last book, and once again keeps the reader's attention well in hand. The last three hundred pages of this book, for me, demanded to be read in one sitting. (As to a previous reviewer complaining about all the sex in this book, I wonder if s/he and I were reading the same novel. Perhaps we have different definitions of \\"sex.\\") The last few pages of this one have one truly contrived moment, but somehow Goodkind pulls it off without too much cheesiness.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about the book is that I was planning on leaving the series for a few days while I finished some other books. And yet, after I closed the back cover on this one, I was reading Blood of the Fold within ten minutes. Goodkind has created a worthy successor to book one here. ****½was planning on leaving the series for a few days while I finished some other books.

Terry Goodkind, Blood of the Fold (Tor, 1996)<br /><br />Back when I was a kid, I was crazy about the various exploits of Donald Sobol's pint-sized sleuth Encyclopedia Brown. There was rarely a week where I  didn't have at least one Encyclopedia Brown book out of at least one library somewhere near wherever I was living at the time. A fine set of books, those. Each was a collection of various mini-mysteries solved by Brown (and,  later, his gorgeous sidekick Sally Kimball; after all, every sleuth needs a gorgeous sidekick, right?) in the space of a few pages. Sobol's books had only one problem. Since the stories were collected from other sources, the first few  pages of each were like a broken record, giving all the same details about how the \\"office\\" in EB's garage was set up, reintroducing the characters, etc.<br /><br />For some reason, Terry Goodkind saw fit to pull a Donald Sobel in Blood of the Fold, book three in the Sword of Truth series. The first two books, each  verging on the thousand-page mark, blaze the way for a fantasy series that, if there is any justice in the world, is destined to become a classic. Blood of the Fold, however, is barely two-thirds of the length of those first two,  and Goodkind spends a good chunk of the first hundred fifty pages in reacquaintance. It would make more sense had there been some of it in the second book in the series, or if this book had an extra hundred fifty pages over and above  what the first two have to compensate. But given the brevity, one gets the distinct feeling that the book was padded at the insistence of a publisher who wanted to keep Goodkind pumping out one book per year.<br /><br />Not to say that Blood of the Fold isn't still a good book. Once you've invested two thousand pages' worth of time in any fantasy series, it's doubtful  that re-reading stuff about what's happened before (no matter how much of it there is) is going to deter the reader from going on and finding the four hundred-odd pages of new stuff. And with Goodkind's usual readable style and  almost nonstop action, the pages fly by here just as fast as they did in Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears. Of course, with only two-thirds of the bulk, that means you finish the book that much faster. Make sure you've got a copy  of Temple of the Winds (book four) lying around before you start this one, or<br />you may find yourself looking for a twenty-four hour bookstore at three in the morning. *** 1/2w stuff.

That is, instead of using the  tried and true mystery formula (you're introduced to a number of folks, and you know one of them did it), the intrepid adventurers out to right the world's wrongs have no connections with the killer, and while we might meet him at various  times during the narrative (Rex Miller's excellent debut novel, Slob, is the first good example of this I can think of; the most popular that comes to mind is the last Dirty Harry film, The Dead Pool), said intrepid adventurers don't meet  the bad guy until the final showdown. The idea certainly has its good points. Aside from the aforementioned realism, it also puts a stop to such dialogical insanities as \\"So, Professor Moriarty, we meet again!\\"<br /><br />That said, a lot of the first attempts to marry the idea to the slasher genre were exceptionally bad. Savage isn't quite as downright stupid as some (my  favorite target is a 1981 film, later made into an equally bad novel, called Final Exam)...<br />Our heroine is an investigative photojournalist, Chris Latham, who is sent by her editor to cover the opening of a new luxury resort that just happens  to be situated in a war-torn South American country (named Panagua in the book; the similarities to Nicaragua are a little too obvious to be overlooked). Because of the area's sociopolitical instability, only seven of those who  received invitations to the grand opening actually show up. P><br />Savage might have actually been salvageable. Had an editor managed to get Boorstin to lop off the first chapter and a half, and had the last couple of  chapters been handled just a bit more slickly this might have crossed the line into \\"good enough to be noticed.\\" As it stands, however, it's been out  of print for quite a while, and not really worth going out of your way to hunt down.	2002-03-08

Charles Sheehan-Miles, Prayer at Rumayla (Xlibris, 2001)<br /><br />I had some trepidations before cracking the cover on this one; with a very few notable exceptions, I've never been much of one for war novels, which tend to either fall into the knee-jerk anti-war camp or the \\"sis-boom-bah rah-rah-rah\\" camp. Prayer at Rumayla leans towards the left side of the division, but prefers to let the images and events therein do its preaching, which already puts Sheehan-Miles ahead of 95% of the pack. Despite the book's \\"A novel of the Gulf War\\" subtitle, this is more a case of the Gulf War being a driving force for the main character's actions after he's back in the U.S. after combat.<br /><br />Chet Brown, a tank loader in the Gulf War, is home after a particularly nasty engagement in Iraq. While there, he had no real goals other than to get home; now that he's back, he keeps wondering if he can go back over. His dissatisfaction with his former life and the changes in both himself and those around him lead him to spend a month's leave travelling, rather than staying in Georgia, and the three central chapters of the novel (about half the book) recount Chet's trip to New York and back.<br /><br />More than anything, this is a roadtrip novel, with the usual conventions of the genre. Chet finds out about himself by meeting a series of others who reflect various parts of his personality (the obvious comparison is to On the Road here, but I found my mind drawn to various post-Vietnam novels, especially those of Lucius Shepard and J. K. Flowers rather than the land-of-Camelot stuff Kerouac was on about). However, Sheehan-Miles makes one big departure from the genre (to say what would be a plot spoiler), and that gives the book a freshness and realism that are unexpected in the modern road novel. The book is unpredictable because it plays on the predictability of its genre, and the (lack of) twist at the end is all the more powerful for not bowing to convention.<br /><br />My only real problems with the book have nothing to do with the narrative itself. There are a rash of proofreading errors and more than one case where an editor should have slapped the author upside the head for sentence construction problems. Neither is overly common, however (one crops up every ten pages or so), and so the distraction value is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />A promising first novel. Hopefully we'll be seeing more. *** y real problems with the book have nothing to do with the narrative itself.

Christoph Wille, Presenting C# (Sams, 2000)<br /><br />The first thing the average reader is going to notice about this little volume is the size (just shy of two hundred pages) in relation to the price (twenty-five bucks). To say it's a little out of character for the computer book industry is roughly akin to saying that Calista Flockheart is \\"a tad on the thin side.\\" Most computer programmers shelling out that kind of moolah expect eight hundred pages, a companion CD-ROM, and an online community. Books of this sort generally go for about half the price. At a guess, the expense here is going to curtail the readership quite a bit.<br /><br />That's too bad, because as an introductory book, this one's pretty good. It's definitely of the survey school of computer book writing, and it's a very high-level overview. If you're hoping to find gobs of sample code and step-by-step tutorials, you've come to the wrong place. This is the more abstract material that will help you understand what's going on in the more general, theoretical world. As such, it's probably going to be of limited use at best for those who don't have one of those larger, slightly more expensive books. It makes a great companion volume, but to what I'm not yet sure. ** ½	2002-03-08

Buffa, The Defense (Henry Holt, 1997)<br /><br />It's hard to figure out which side of me is going to win the battle over how to review this book. One side of me wants to harp on the slowest beginning  in history. The other side of me wants to harp on the fact that once I got past those opening chapters, I ended up reading most of the rest of it in one long marathon.<br /><br />After reading the first two interminable chapters of this novel, I was sure that I was going to hate it. I'd give it the fifty page test, toss it in the  box of books headed for greener pastures than my ever-messy book room, and give it a two-sentence review along the lines of the infamous one People magazine did for Black Sabbath's Live Evil album. But then I got to page fifty, and kept  going. And going, and going and going...<br />The narrator of the novel is Joseph Antonelli, a cocky defense lawyer who's unused to losing cases. An old friend, Judge Leopold Rifkin, asks him to  take on what looks like an unwinnable case, a lowlife accused of molesting his stepdaughter. About the only person who really believes he didn't do it is the defendant's wife, and she's the essence of the unreliable witness. How to  get out of this mess?<br /><br />From there, the book goes in a number of interesting directions. Unlike most trial-type novels, The Defense doesn't stick with just this one trial, but  goes on into the further ramifications of it, years down the road, keeping the main players entwined with the family. Buffa also thumbs his nose at the detective/trial genre in the most wonderful of ways (but I can't go into detail  without revealing a major plot twist). Once you're out into uncharted territory, Buffa has you at his mercy. He messes with all the conventions of trial novels in the past thirty years, and he does it very well.<br /><br />Would have gotten a higher rating without those painful first chapters, but it's still a fine read if you can get past them. ***	2002-03-08

Robert Penn Warren, The Circus in the Attic (Dell, 1947)<br />The back jacket of the book says, \\"These stories come from the pen of one of America's half-dozen great writers.\\" Given the time period of the book's release, that was really saying something. Something accurate, but something nonetheless. Penn Warren (who won the Pulitzer two year's before for All the King's Men) wrote the stories in this book over the course of fifteen years. Most were previously published.<br />The book is framed with two novellas, the title story and \\"Prime Leaf,\\" with a number of shorter works in between. As with most of Penn Warren's work, the tales are about depression-era and WW2-era life in the American south, people going on about their day-to-day business. A number of the stories deal with the same town, and the same characters pass in and out of them, so the reader gets the feeling of getting to know different aspects of the town as he goes from story to story.<br />Part of the magic of Penn Warren's work is the ability to simultaneously expose to the reader the quiet dignity of the proletariat and the basic stupidity of human nature. Not an easy thing to make the reader respect the people he's laughing at. But that's exactly what happens time and again in this book. The characters do dumb things for various reasons, but we always understand what those reasons are, and most of the time we can see how the character gets from the reason to the justification to the act without a problem. And while there's always a moral to be had, Robert Penn Warren is certainly not Aesop. The moral is there, waiting to be found, but the reader who's not interested in the morality of the tales is allowed to go off on his merry way and not contemplate the deeper meaning of what's here. That, too, is part of Robert Penn Warren's gift. *** 1/2	2002-03-08

Gilula, The Set Model for Database and Information Systems (Addison-Wesley, 1994)<br /><br />Gilula, at one point in this book, says &quot;As far as possible, we have attempted to simplify the presentation in order to make it intelligible to readers who have had no special training in the field of mathematical logic.&quot; Could have fooled me. It's possible for the bachelor's earner to grasp, but just barely and after multiple readings. You're probably better off not trying to tackle this one unless your bachelor's is in math, or you've earned an advanced degree.<br /><br />That said, is there really any reason to tackle it at all? A number of websearches on set theory as it applies to current database technology (and specifically Starset, the language proposed and outlined herein) turns up precious little, leading this reviewer to believe that the relational model, which is what Gilula and co. are trying to overthrow, has won this battle without too much effort. This book is, at this point in time, going to appeal at most to a niche market. Gilula mentions that the original Starset interpreters were written in C, and the appendix has more than enough info for the hobbyist or vertical-market software developer to reverse-engineer Starset and program a home version of it. And Gilula certainly does make an interesting case for set-model databases, and he does so with just enough clarity to make the average DBA wonder if, perhaps, a set-model database might be of more use than a relational database for any given purpose. However, unless that DBA has unlimited time and resources, this is probably going to remain no more than an interesting artifact. **	2002-03-08

Ha Jin, Waiting (Pantheon, 1999)<br /><br />Waiting, the 1999 National Book Award winner, is something special. It is one of the first few books of what will hopefully become a renaissance in American minimalist writing.<br /><br />The story is nothing new; an army doctor, Lin Kong, has been separated from his wife for years. During that time, he's met and fallen in love with a single nurse, Manna Wu. But every year, when he goes home on leave, he tries to divorce his wife and fails, for varying reasons. Will Lin ever get his wish? And if he gets it, will it be what he really wants?<br /><br />I find it hard to imagine the reader who can't find someone in this novel to identify with. Everyone's had relationships before. Most of us have found ourselves entangled in the with-one-person-attracted-to-another net a few times. Ha Jin's soft, unobtrusive narrative style allows us to get to know the characters, giving us a leisurely pace and spicing the drama with gentle humor now and again.<br /><br />The book's only real downfall is in that pace. Being able to read more than one book at a time is a boon where Waiting is concerned; this is a book that demands to be put down every couple of chapters and absorbed, rather than to be read all at one sitting. Switching off between Waiting and something less cerebral may be the way to go with this one, if you're not the most patient of readers. One way or the other, though, Waiting is highly recommended all around. ****	2002-03-08

Stephen Stark, The Outskirts (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1988)<br /><br />Stephen Stark's debut novel is a confusing, exhilarating run through the spring of a high school senior's life. Albie Santamoravia is eighteen, almost  completely disaffected, close to failing out of school, and has a penchant for long distance running and a photographic memory for classical music. When he runs, he hears the music in his head (various Mahler pieces during most of the  book's scope). It's something to cling to, Albie's island of sanity in a world he doesn't quite get.<br /><br />Arrayed around Albie are those few people close enough to him to be friends or enemies. The head of the former camp is Carl, Albie's childhood friend;  that of the latter is Shaddock, the high school track coach who wants to get Albie onto the team. He stoops to somewhat nefarious levels to achieve his goal, up to and including having team members ambush Albie during a nightly  run (or does it only happen in Albie's head?). Still, things have achieved a sort of balance.<br /><br />Into this state of things comes Martin, an older senior who's repeating twelfth grade and has just moved into the neighborhood. It is with the coming of  Martin that complications ensue here, and ensue they do.<br /><br />The Outskirts has some of the shortcomings of many first novels, which isn't that much of a surprise. Mainly, the book takes a bit too long to get  going; when your novel is less than two hundred fifty pages, you can't afford to spend forty of them in setup. The book also wears its inspirations a bit too darkly on its sleeves, though that's somewhat excusable; the books ends up being  an intriguing blend of Lord of the Flies and Marathon Man, with a dash of A Clockwork Orange thrown in for good measure (echoed most strongly in Martin's \\"what's it going to be, then?\\" refrain). For all that, it does have its  own voice, and Stark has a lot to say about the adolescent male mind. Certainly worth checking out. ** ½. *** ½	2002-02-27

Kathleen Dougherty, Moth to the Flame (Diamond, 1991)<br /><br />A little more attention to detail and a slightly better editor and Kathleen Dougherty might have been the next Tom Clancy, pushing out high-tech  suspense thrillers that sold millions of copies. Moth to the Flame is better than your average spy thriller. You know that expression you see overused in reviews, \\"grabs hold and never lets go!\\"? This book fits the bill.<br /><br />Charlie Silverthorne is an ex-NSA programmer with some nasty secrets in her past, most of which have to do with the way she left the NSA. She's spent  the past four years as the head programmer at a hole-in-the-wall computer store in Maryland, and never wants to get near classified material again. But one day a guy named Bill Targ shows up at the store where she works, says  he's NSA, and tells her they need her back. She refuses. Meanwhile, around the world, people are dying mysteriously, burning up with seemingly no provocation. A sudden outbreak of contagious spontaneous human combustion,  or something more nefarious?<br /><br />Dougherty knows how to keep the pages turning in this one. It's definitely a keep-you-up-at-night book; lots of people dying mysteriously, shadowy  government agents, and uncrackable computer programs set to take over the world. However, the book suffers in its attention to detail. Nothing unforgivable overlooked here, but the things that are overlooked do jar (e.g.,  mention is made a number of time of Vincent's uncle, including two specific references to his leaving Vincent and his single mother, but we never find out why; also, in the prologue, the only non-American in the book to die dies, and the  reader is left wondering why the deaths suddenly start happening specifically in America). And, as with all high-tech thrillers, some of what's here seems amusingly dated eleven years after the book's release. Remember the days when  19.2K modems were top of the line?<br /><br />Still, the potholes in this particular road are minor ones at best. This one hasn't been in print for quite a while, probably, but it's well worth going  out of your way to find if you're a fan of action-heavy thrillers. *** ½particular road are minor ones at best.

Dick Francis, Wild Horses (Jove, 1994)<br /><br />Wild Horses is Dick Francis on top of his game. It stands as one of the highlights of the long and somewhat distinguished career of one of Britain's  best-known mystery novelists.<br /><br />The tale is that of Thomas Lyon, ex-jumps jockey and presently filmmaker. He's been signed on to make a movie based on a novel based on a twenty-six- year-old police case regarding the alleged suicide of a trainer's wife. In the small British racing world, Lyon and the trainer are connected through various channels, and  Lyon, along with the film's reluctant producer O'Hara, idly speculate that maybe, in the making of the film, they might actually solve the case. As all this is going on, an old  friend of Lyon's dies, leaving Lyon all of his racing-related books and ephemera. A number of others want to get their hands on this material, and will stop at nothing to do so,  including viciously beating the man's elderly sister. Lyon realizes that everything's tied in a lot closer than it seems, and the chase is on.<br /><br />Wild Horses has a readability factor that some of Francis' less consistent books lack. He puts everything in front of the reader in a non-nonsense  fashion, adding enough deception to keep the reader wondering what's a clue and what's a falsity, throws in suspects by the score, and lets Lyon go on about making his movie.  (Perhaps the fact that the sleuth not only has another job, but actually pays attention to it as the mystery is going on, is one of the book's strongest points; too often  it seems amateur detectives suddenly find themselves with more than enough hours in the day when things get underway.) Them's good reads, folks!<br /><br />A must for any fan of Francis (or any other writer of racing mysteries), and a good intro to him for other mystery readers who haven't yet discovered  his work. ****	2002-02-21

Nathan and Ori Gurewich, Master Visual C++ 2 (Sams, 1994)<br /><br />Given the dominance of Microsoft in the programming market and the plethora of supposedly platform-specific C++ books on the market, it would seem a  difficult task to come up with one definitive beginner's text. Such is not the case, and Master Visual C++ 2 is without a doubt the definitive book for the VC++2 platform. The  authors spend little time covering the basics of C++ (but enough to get someone who's never read any general material on the subject up to speed) and devote most of the book's  thousand-plus pages to the Visual C++ platform itself. While the book does have its drawbacks, it does what it's supposed to do, and it does it better than any other  book I've encountered.<br /><br />The drawbacks are worth commenting on, because despite the dominance the book has (or should have), there are some areas in which it could use  improvement. The main one is that the book spends far too much time with examples that are either dialog-based or use dialog control forms in an SDI environment. Very little  is done with actual SDI or MDI applications. Also, OLE and ODBC support is touched on far too little here, given its importance in the Visual C+ 2 framework. Computer book buyers  have gotten too used to books covering specific topics, and we've stopped demanding that general introductory books deal with those topics. Bad idea, especially when  you're shelling out $40-50 apiece.<br /><br />Still, if you're learning Visual C++, and most Windows programmers will at some point, this is an excellent place to start for DOS/Win3.x/Win95  programmers. *** ½	2002-02-21

Andrew Klavan, Corruption (St. Martin's, 1993)<br /><br />Klavan is finally starting to get the reputation he deserves, though the recent film version of Don't Say a Word may well knock him back a notch. But  the author of such recently acclaimed novels as The Uncanny and The Animal Hour has been around, lurking in the shadows, for much longer than most folks give him credit.  Corruption was written during his time back in those shadows, and thus the run-of-the-mill Klavan fan may be unaware of it. That's too bad, because Corruption may be  Klavan's magnum opus; this is the book that should have put him on the map almost ten years ago.<br /><br />Corruption, as its title implies, is the story of a corrupt small town. Klavan didn't submit to the usual stereotypes here; his small town is in upstate  New York rather than a mostly rural Southern state, and he resists (despite the back-cover-blurb's author to pin everything on the local sheriff) attacking any one particular member  of the town as being more corrupt than any other. In fact, the staff of the local paper, the editor of which has been engaged in a pitched battle with the sheriff for the last  seven years, isn't exactly the gleaming white knight one would expect from a crusading media presence; there's more than enough going on under the surface at the paper to make the  astute reader wonder which enterprise is more corrupt, the politicians or those seeking to expose them. There are bad guys aplenty here, including drug dealers with  mafia ties, puppet electoral candidates, etc., but one wonders if there's one true good guy anywhere to be found in the novel. This is the novel's main point of  brilliance; once the underlying scandal is fully revealed (the mystery portion of the novel), the reader immediately wonders whether it's really as bad as anything that's been done to  uncover it. (The novel's other truly brilliant undertaking is the last chapter. In fact, the last page stands out as well; Klavan takes a big chance with the way he ends the  novel, and in my view it pays off nicely. Without revealing any plot points, I will caution the reader that anyone who likes everything tied up in a nice, neat little bow when the  back cover of a book is closed is going to have a very hard time with the way this novel ends. I thought it brilliant and, more importantly, true to the way things really work.)<br /><br />With excellently drawn characters, a decent mystery underlying them, and Klavan's usual page-turning style, this one's sure to satisfy most mysterygoers  who can get past the caveat in the last paragraph above. If you're not a Klavan fan, or hadn't previously heard of this particular Klavan novel, do yourself a favor and get  acquainted.big chance with the way he ends the  novel, and in my view it pays off nicely.

Valtos, Resurrection (St. Martin's Press, 1988)<br /><br />Late-eighties horror novels that faded quickly into obscurity seem to be becoming something of a specialty of mine these days; I've read more than I  care to count in the past few months. I find that, in general, most of them had very good reasons for becoming obscure. Resurrection is no exception to that rule, but there's  something about it that sets it apart from your run-of-the-mill horror novel. There were some sparks of true potential running through here. If the reviews of Valtos' most recent  novel, The Authenticator, are anything to go by, it sounds like he's realized that potential in later books. More power to him. If you're a Valtos fan, this may well be worth picking  up as a \\"where did they come from?\\" type book. If you haven't yet been introduced to him, picking this up may, hopefully, make you want to grab the newer book (it did in my  case).<br /><br />Resurrection (made, incidentally, into a 1994 film called Almost Dead. Stars Shannen Doherty. Draw your own conclusions.) is the story of  Katherine  Roshak, a young associate psychology professor from New York City. Katherine is convinced her mother, who committed suicide eight years before, has returned to life and  is stalking her. She goes to the small town of Dickson, Pennsylvania, where her mother's grave is, and finds the dirt over the grave scarred, as if something had dug its way  out. Eventually, she manages to convince a local rogue cop, Dominic Dellaserra, that her story at least deserves checking, and they go out to the cemetery and open the  coffin, to find Katherine's<br />mother's body missing. From there, the book is your basic supernatural mystery-are the dead really coming back to life? If so, why? And would they be  content with the nightlife in a town as small as Dickson? You know, that sort of thing.<br /><br />Okay, silly plots aside, there really is a bit to like here. Valtos slips into a didactic tone every once in a while, but that's not necessarily a bad  thing. The guy knows of what he<br />speaks, and he uses various scenes to communicate that to the reader. E.g., at one point Dominic takes Katherine to a funeral parlor in an attempt to  convince her that once someone's been embalmed, they're not getting back up. Valtos has the funeral director give a relatively detailed account of what goes on behind the  scenes. Fifteen years on, we've had a number of Discovery Channel films about the embalming process, and Valtos has the details right on. This attention to detail makes itself  known throughout the book, which is reassuring (for no apparent reason that I can discern. Hey, I just have the reactions, I don't know why). There's also a refreshing lack  of internal rationalization that plagues supernatural mystery novels. There's not a single scene where a character finds himself believing things, then turning around five seconds  later and not believing them. What a wonderful change.<br /><br />In contrast to the book's strong points, but not enough to drag it down too much, is the inconsistencies in a few of the characters, notably Dominic.  While he's as consistent as can be in his disbelief of any supernatural phenomena, his reactions to Katherine are somewhat less one-track. It just doesn't quite resonate right, and  there's more than one scene where the reader is likely to wish the relationship between the two was a bit clearer. This is also the case with Dominic's friend Eddie, an  intriguing character of whom I'd have liked to see a whole lot more. It seemed as if Valtos was setting Eddie up to play a pivotal role that he never actually got around to playing.<br /><br />Still, flaws or no, Resurrection is a relatively worthwhile book to hunt down if you're a fan of the supernatural mystery; fans of the more out-there  medical thrillers of F. Paul Wilson will probably get a kick out of this. ***ce in a while, but that's not necessarily a bad  thing.

Friedrich Durrenmatt, The Visit (Grove, 1956)<br /><br />Another excellent piece of work from Friedrich Durrenmatt, the story of The Visit takes place in a ..town in  central Europe somewhere; the country is not given (the reasons should be obvious). As the town is on the verge of bankruptcy, with almost total unemployment and a  pervasive sense of despair, one of the town's local folk made good comes back, hinting that she will give the town enough money to bail it out: get the factory working  again, allow the stores to restock, that sort of thing. The night she arrives, she tells the townspeople that their expectations of the reasons for her visit are  true, and that she will give them the money they need. She has one condition: she requires justice in the form of a lynch mob. She wants the townspeople to [take out] one of  their own.<br /><br />The revelation of the intended victim is the major twist here; in many ways, the play's climax is actually this  scene, at the end of Act I, and the following two acts are a painfully drawn-out d&eacute;nouement as we watch the townspeople's changing reactions to the woman and her demand. Unlike  The Pledge, in which we see the gradual development of one man's madness, in this case we're given a woman who's arguably mad from the get-go (certainly,  she's as obsessed as The Pledge's protagonist is at the end of that novel from long before the beginning of this play), and we watch the way her madness,  combined with her wealth, affects the town around her over the course of a few days. Durrenmatt is a master at using small details to show how the community changes its  views over a relatively short period of time, and even manages to make the rather horrific journey humorous at times (the play is defined as, and works as, a  tragicomedy). We find ourselves alternately sympathizing with and horrified at the actions of the townspeople, and see no conflict in the two attitudes. A wonderful play.	2002-02-13

Terry Goodkind, Wizard's First Rule (Tor, 1994)<br /><br />Terry Goodkind hasn't been around as long as some of the fantasy writers who are currently churning out long- winded, seemingly neverending series; Harry Turtledove's alternate-history alien-invasion World War II series' first book has been in print longer than most of Goodkind's  whole catalogue. But, as J. R. R. Tolkein and Greg Bear have shown us, you don't have to be established to come up with a really whiz-bang first novel. Wizard's First Rule is,  most decidedly, a whiz-bang first novel.<br /><br />The action opens with unassuming woodland guide Richard Cypher trying to dig up a few clues as to the means and  motive of his father's recent death. While in the process, he spots four men menacing a woman, goes to her aid, and unleashes the chain of events that have taken us seven  eight-hundred-plus-page books and counting to unravel. Make no mistake, when you crack the cover on the first Sword of Truth novel, you're committing yourself to a whole  lot of reading. Sword of Truth is longer than Mission Earth, longer than Necroscope, longer than Michael Moorcock's presently-in-progress series. Think of a series containing a  whole lot of big, thick books. Sword of Truth is longer. It'll probably reach Encyclopedia Britannica proportions before long.<br /><br />The good news is, of course, that Wizard's First Rule is a whole lot more readable than Britannica (in order,  even). He's got more of an eye for the readable than Moorcock, and is more restrained than Lumley. Goodkind doesn't skimp on the character development, has an excellent eye for  description and detail, and presents it all in such a way that, when you've finished the first book, you wonder how it is you managed to get through eight hundred twenty  pages quite as fast as you did. (In other words, by the second one before you start the first, because you're not going to want to take enough of a break to run to the store and  get it. Trust me, I know-my copy of Stone of Tears is still in the mail.) With such a large canvas on which to paint, Goodkind takes the luxury of building up the minor  characters; one of my most common complaints with genre fiction is the surfeit of cardboard characters who are set up just to be killed, or what have you. When Goodkind sets a  character up to be killed, you know everything from what the character had for breakfast to his psychological makeup to his favorite color. It's a refreshing change from the  majority of fantasy novels. And it doesn't slow the book down, because even the minor characters are contributing in some way to the plot.<br /><br />This stands out, even at a time when fantasy seems to be at a high point in the public consciousness. George R. R.  Martin and Philip Pullman may be getting more press and more awards than Terry Goodkind, but Wizard's First Rule stands easily with A Game of Thrones or The Golden Compass  as the beginning to an excellent series. **** ½know-my copy of Stone of Tears is still in the mail.)

Parker, God Save the Child (Berkeley, 1974)<br /><br />One of the great enduring mysteries in the literary world-and it says quite a bit that a piece of genre writing has  had such a pervasive cultural effect-is the first name of Robert B. Parker's longstanding favorite good guy, Spenser. What short memories we have, for it's revealed in God Save the  Child, the second Spenser novel. (The book contains the one scene where someone says his first name and isn't later contradicted. And no, I'm not going to tell you what it  is.) Not only that, but it also pinpoints Spenser's age, which is something that's come up in more than one recent review. And yes, he is getting up there. (I won't tell you  that, either. But pretty soon, the A&E made-for-TV movies will have to case Don Ameche and Garrett Morris as Spenser and Hawk.) For any Spenser fan, those two things alone should be  reason enough to go back and correct any error they may have made by not reading this at their earliest opportunity. To cap off the must-read things about this book,  it's where Spenser first meets Susan. Okay, get thee to a bookstore and get to work.<br /><br />In this case, Spenser is hired to find a runaway kid. After a few days of wheel-spinning by both Spenser and the  cops, a ransom note turns up; the kid's not a runaway, but a kidnap victim. Spenser enlists the help of a smart-aleck state cop and the kid's guidance counselor (Susan  Silverman), and things go about the same way they usually go in detective novels. Those used to later Spenser novels will find the prose much drier than the average Spenser novel;  whether Parker hadn't yet developed the distinctive Spenser style or whether the publisher was leaning on him to sound more like Ross MacDonald is anyone's guess. But  don't worry, you won't be hurting for wisecracks, culinary commentary, and other such Spenserian traits.<br /><br />While the book itself is vintage Parker, it's plain to see that the publisher was still thinking of Parker in dime- novel terms back in 1974. Hopefully reprints have corrected some of the more egregious errors of spelling and grammar, but if you happen to get your hands on the mid-seventies  Berkeley paperback (...), be prepared for some painfully obvious screwups, if you happen to notice such things. I considered using the book to start a  bonfire the second time Spenser \\"payed\\" a bill. (Amazing that they didn't spell his name Spencer throughout.) Obviously, it's not a knock on Parker, but still worth noting for  those who get annoyed by proofreading errors in their pulp fiction. ****ng of Parker in dime- novel terms back in 1974.

Parker, Early Autumn (Dell, 1981)<br /><br />It may still be a little too early in the game to call the Spenser novels some of the great twentieth-century  detective fiction. There cannot, however, be any doubt as to the continuing popularity of, and loyalty to, the line of novels written by Robert Parker about the combination  renaissance man/gumshoe. Over the twenty-odd years since The Godwulf Manuscript hit the shelves, Spenser fans have accumulated like mosquitoes in a light fixture. We've watched  the characters, consistent over the space of more than twenty novels, grow and change, not just reflecting the spirit of the times (go back and read about some of the  godawful getups Spenser dressed in in the mid-seventies, and you can easily imagine Spenser himself looking back and saying, \\"what WAS I thinking?\\") but reflecting real changes  in the characters themselves. Robert Parker has<br />achieved something remarkable; he has given us a quarter century in the lives of a select few people in real-time  (for the most part) without the storyline ever degenerating into soap opera.<br /><br />Like all types of evolution/natural selection, though, it doesn't all go at a steady stream. Sometimes the changes  in characters come in short, uneven spurts. Early Autumn is one of those, and while I can't swear to it, I suspect that this book has probably garnered more fans for the  venerable franchise than any other. If there is a definitive Spenser novel, it is Early Autumn.<br /><br />Spenser is hired by beautiful divorced socialite Patty Giacomin to recover her son Paul, who's been kidnapped by  her ex-husband. Spenser finds the job remarkably easy, at least until the ex-husband sends muscle to try and get the kid back again a few months later. Somewhere along the  line, Spenser realizes that neither parents cares about the boy, he's just a pawn in a game of spite-the-ex-partner. So Spenser does the only logical thing, takes the boy  himself and tries to inject some logic into the chaotic mess of his life.<br /><br />This novel is one of the rare places where everything comes together perfectly. The history that's been laid out  before us in previous Spenser novels is obviously in play, but as in most of the books in the series, the history never overtakes the present storyline. It's there to draw on,  though. Parker uses the situation to explore some of what's come before and foreshadow things that come later; we see the beginnings of the strain on Spenser's relationship with  Susan that lead to the events a few years on, and we see the real beginnings of the loyalty that has developed between Spenser and Hawk over the past fifteen years (here,  they're still hired guns on the opposite sides of a problem, but we also get the idea that Hawk's decisions are made with Spenser in mind). Parker is, of course, at his usual  standard of writing, with the expected level of detective-novel wisecracking, lots of references to works of literature, a good deal of food talk, etc. There are few novels that  satisfy the way this one does. *****ome logic into the chaotic mess of his life.<br /><br />This novel is one of the rare places where everything comes together perfectly.

Barbara Gowdy, Mister Sandman (HBJ, 1996)<br /><br />Mister Sandman was a Publishers' Weekly Best Book of 1996, and it's easy to see why. Gowdy's third novel (and  fourth book) is an engaging look into a world the is both completely warped and so close to the surface of reality that sometimes it's hard to remember that what's on the  page is fiction.<br /><br />Mister Sandman is the story of the Canary family, who are your basic everyday family. At least, they would be if  life were a David Lynch film. Gordon, the patriarch, is a closet homosexual in a house full of women. (Perhaps it's more odd that he isn't a transvestite than it would be if he  were.) His wife Doris is exploring her own enjoyment of the members of the fairer sex. They have three children: Sonja, fat, housebound by choice, and rich from her job as a  pin clipper; Marcia, somewhat nymphomaniacal, able to converse with the aphasic; and Joan, dropped on her head as an infant, considered brain-damaged by her doctors and  family but actually a genius. Joan, we find out in the first few sentences, is actually Sonja's daughter, but for the sake of propriety (Joan is born in the late  fifties), she's passed off as one of Gordon and Doris'.<br /><br />The book looks at the life of the family, mostly as it relates to Joan, but also in other snatches at various times  in their lives (Sonja's seduction by Joan's father, Gordon's lovesickness over a redheaded plumber, etc.). Joan's inability to speak and propensity to spend her time in small  dark places makes her the perfect confessor, and we spend our time snickering at the revisions the pentitents make when they get to the alter. Joan, though, is a bit too  smart for them, as the book spends its time making clear. How she ends up making it clear is truly a beautiful scene, and quite worthy of the accolades from PW. I don't think it  would be too much of a plot spoiler to say that the book's climax takes on Biblical proportions.<br /><br />Gowdy's reputation in America didn't start growing until the novel after this, The White Bone. Thus, some Americans  who are already familiar with her may have missed this little gem, I urge you to take a step back and give it a look. Those unfamiliar with Gowdy who like their family sagas  more insane than dysfunctional are sure to get a kick out of it. Highly recommended. ****in America didn't start growing until the novel after this, The White Bone.

Stevens, Object-Oriented Graphics Programming in C++ (AP Professional, 1994)<br /><br />Whatever other faults this book may have, most of it is (quite thankfully) out of date. Remember the days when  640x480x16.7 million colors was something only the high-end computers could manage? Well, that's when this was written. Also, raytracing as a way to display graphics seems to  have gone the way of the great auk for most programmers, largely due to speed concerns. (This is unfortunate, because raytracing produces some of the highest-quality  graphics you're likely to find on a computer screen; I have a suspicion that if someone were to sit down and really work with newer implementations of C++ and today's high- powered graphics cards, raytracing could be done with enough speed to allow it to rival newer methods of graphic representation.)<br /><br />Aside from the out-of-dateness, which makes this valuable only in an archival sense at this late date, the title is  a bit on the misleading side. While Stevens does take some of the methods and tactics of object oriented programming into account, large portions of the code therein look  suspiciously like C that's still in the process of conversion. This is especially true eight years after the writing of the book, when so much more of the C++ backbone has been  standardized by the ANSI committee. Creating an updated edition of the book would require almost all the code to be rewritten.<br /><br />Given the first paragraph of this review, that might not be a bad thing. There is a marked dearth of books  available right now for game and graphics programmers that don't deal with DirectX. For now, however, the book's worn out its welcome. **	2002-02-13

Patrick Whalen, Monastery (Pocket, 1988)<br /><br />I knew five pages into Monastery that I wasn't going to like it. But still, I kept reading as per the fifty-page  rule;... you give it fifty pages anyway, because it may pick up (and it gives you enough of a basis to write a scathing review, which is usually worth the  time you put in). In this case, it DID pick up, and Monastery ends up being a compulsively readable little treatise. But the good parts end up underlining the bad more than  canceling them out and showing how good a book this could have been. With a few more rewrites and a harsher editor, Patrick Whalen's name might well be sitting with King's,  Koontz', and Barker's atop the pile of horror writers who can sell a million books by rewriting Mary Had a Little Lamb and including an axe murderer. That, however, did not  happen, and Whalen sank into obscurity.<br /><br />Monastery is the story of two basically unkillable folks, a hit man named Braille and an Ancient named Gregory.  Gregory and his pal are vampires of an indeterminate age who were trapped by the Catholic church a hundred years before and imprisoned in the basement of a monastery (thus the  book's title). A team of sociologists from a local college buys the monastery after the not-mysterious-at-all death of its caretakers and, as sociologists will, set about  going out to the secluded island where the monastery resides and opening it up. Whoops. Braille, returning home to the island after a job, finds himself walking into something of a  nightmare of vampires running around killing the townspeople, etc. Here's where the book diverges from other horror novels. Braille isn't your usual horror novel hero. No  freezing in terror, no high-pitched shrieking, just a quick inventory of weapons and trying various ones out to figure out what's going to kill the vampires as quickly and easily as  possible. This is the horror novel hero that horror novel fans have been waiting for for decades. Braille and Gregory, opposite sides of the same coin, are more like something out of  a good martial arts film (or, actually, what came to mind immediately for me was Pacino and De Niro in Michael Mann's film Heat); the two grow to respect each other, almost  becoming friends, while still realizing that one of them cannot survive. The question them becomes, what happens when the immovable post meets the irresistible object? And  those are always the best horror novels, in my estimation.<br /><br />Given such a great premise and such wonderful characters, why does Monastery not measure up? A lot of it has to do  with the writing itself, unfortunately. Whalen is a little too transparent in where he's going at times, especially with character names (when you have a TV preacher named  Chapel, you realize by page 20 one of the major twists in the final battle. After all, your hero is named... Braille). And after you meet the sociological team and see the  inevitable end they come to, you've got the template for Whalen's minor characters. Every horror novel needs minor characters who are set up just to be killed, and even a few major  ones, but ever since Stephen King pulled his \\"he's NOT going to kill HER!\\" twist in `Salem's Lot in 1974, every horror writer has aspired to follow suit: set up your  minor characters as if they're going to become major characters. Make them more than cardboard cutouts. Most importantly, don't let the reader know they're going to die until they do  (preferably in as inventive, spectacular, and grimly humorous a way as possible). Whalen handles the first two parts of the rule with considerable aplomb, but fails miserably at  the third. And it's all the more painful because of the way he handles the deaths of various characters (impossible to show specifics without getting into plot spoilers, but one  of the characters in the book you really, really want to die does, and his death could be--should be--a template for future horror writers to work from,specifically because it  deviates from part three. Handled just a little better, it would have been one of the notable passages in horror writing in the past half century).<br /><br />And so I'm stuck figuring out how to rate this novel. I'd unhesitatingly recommend it to readers of horror fiction,  because there's a lot of good here, and there was potential for greatness. That recommendation, however, comes with the caveat that you can expect to be disappointed overall. As  someone said in a movie I recently saw, \\"when it's good, it ain't bad, and when it's bad, it ain't good.\\" ** ½specifically because it  deviates from part three.

Ken Kesey, Sometimes a Great Notion (Bantam Windstone, 1964)<br /><br />I really, really wanted to like this book. An underread novel by an acknowledged American master of letters with a  core of fans who consider it one of the best novels of the last century. What could be better? Well, to put it in as few words as possible, Kesey's writing style.<br /><br />One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest works, and works so well, because it's tight. It's terse. It says what needs to be  said. Kesey knows what he wants to say and says it. You get the idea. It's been compared to A Christmas Carol a number of times, and with very good reason. But if Cuckoo  is Kesey's Christmas Carol, then Sometimes a Great Notion is Kesey's Bleak House. It's long-winded, rambling, incoherent, and could easily have lost three hundred pages from  its final length without anyone noticing anything had gone; when your main character doesn't get to the place where all the action is happening until page 88, and still hasn't  gotten his baggage from the bus terminal eight miles away fifty pages later, you know there's a whole lot of extraneous material therein. And while that makes sense within  Kesey's chosen stylistic framework (the story is told by a<br />woman flipping through a photograph album), there's just too much of the rambling and not enough plot advancement.  It's like being stuck in a whole novel of Melville's two-hundred-page cessation of action in Moby Dick. If you thought that was painfully unreadable, Sometimes a Great  Notion may well send you into apoplectic fits.	2002-02-04

Stephen White, Privileged Information (Pinnacle, 1991)<br /><br />For eight years I have been laboring under the delusion that Private Practice was Stephen White's first Alan  Gregory novel. After discovering my error, I rushed to rectify it and picked up Privileged Information ASAP. And where Private Practice was good enough to get me involved with Alan  Gregory and his therapeutic investigations, it pales beside Privileged Information.<br /><br />The best thing about this novel is that it takes the notion of privilege, something those of us who watch Law and  Order religiously are well aware of from the point of view of the police and the prosecutors, and gives us the other side of the argument. Therapist Alan Gregory, as the novel  opens, is confronted with the sudden and unforeseeable suicide of one of his patients. The system starts to work, thanks to some leaked information, and various persons ranging  from the victim's father to a persistent newshound start crucifying Gregory in the local papers. Through Gregory's conversations with his lawyer, the deputy assistant DA,  and the police, we get to see privilege from the side of those whose professions it's designed to protect, and we get a full understanding of how frustrating privilege can be to  those responsible for keeping it.<br /><br />Not to say the book is without flaw. The mystery that develops therein has a predictable path, and we know whodunit  relatively quickly. There are a few twists and turns, but nothing an avid mystery reader won't crack within a few pages after the introductions of the various clues along  the way. That, however, in no way detracts from the book's readability.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the Alan Gregory novels, but haven't read this one yet, do so at the earliest possible  opportunity. If you're not familiar with Alan Gregory yet, what are you waiting for? ****	2002-02-04

Bruce Eckel, Thinking in C++ vol. I  (Prentice Hall, 2000)<br /><br />This is what so many other books about the process of programming C++ could have been. Eckel uses the most up-to- date C++ standards, the strictest programming techniques, and takes enough time to explain both the how and the why of the things that he's talking about in  enough detail that the user, while perhaps needing to read certain sections two or three times to really get the gist of them, should have a thorough understanding of the  subject by the time the reader has finished the section. This leads to a complete absence of the usual \\"here's what to do, don't worry about why you're doing it until we get to  chapter X\\" found in most programming books. It also stresses programmers developing their own programming style, but imposes the strictures called for by the ANSI C++ standard.  Sometimes too much freedom IS a bad thing, and that's the case with the vast majority of books on C++ programming. Individuality is important, but clarity of code is  important, too.<br /><br />The book has few shortcomings. The section on namespaces could be a little clearer considering a number of the  prospective readers of this book are less familiar with them than they are with most of the other concepts covered here, for example. But the shortcomings are few and far  between.<br /><br />The most important thing about the book, though, is that Eckel uses the book's style and presentation as a physical  model of abstraction, the most important move any programmer makes from a procedural language to an object-oriented language. The astute reader will pick up from  Eckel's discussions of the philosophy of programming an understanding that not everything is about code, and that code is not the be-all and end-all of the programmer's  job. A lot of it, especially in the design stages, is concept. Many of us in today's workforce, especially those who have spent whole careers doing nothing other than modifying  existing code, forget that all too often. We're stuck in reactive environments, where the company believes that keeping things running is more important than improving  them. A grounding in the design concepts presented here may allow more adept programmers to turn a reactive situation into a proactive one--being able to keep things  running at the same time they're being made better.

Scott, it seems, was trying to present a clearheaded call for the re-evaluation of the attitude towards prostitution in America and  Britain, with the ultimate goal of legalization and regulation. In doing so, he covered the historical changes in attitudes towards prostitution, its reasons for existence, various results  of its outlawing at various times, etc. Overall, his argument is clearheaded and lucid, and his heart is certainly in the right place; all the arguments he makes for the  legalization of prostitution are solid ones, and most have been discussed into the ground by reasonable non-sex-obsessed people for decades. Where Scott goes wrong every time is in his  citations. Some of his citations are worthwhile, from official reports and the like. However, the rest of them are from supposedly-eyewitness works like Slaves to Sin: The Trade  in Women's Flesh and Walter: My Secret Life, the very titles of which lead to speculation about how much of the stuff Scott is citing as fact was exaggeration in the  first place, and how much of it deserved much, much closer scrutiny before being used as the basis for an argument. The use of such sources here is likely to lend the finders  of prurience in everything they see all the ammunition necessary to deride Scott's whole work as unreliable. And, in truth, such a position probably has legs. Scott ended  up doing more to defeat his cause than to defend it. Which is unfortunate, because it's a righteous cause with far too few defenders. ** ½	2002-02-02

Al Stevens, C++ Database Development (MIS Press, 1992)<br /><br />Two questions come to mind as to why anyone would be reading a ten-year-old book on database development in an  outdated edition written to cater to an operating system that (almost) no longer exists in any meaningful way. (Or why they would be reading a review of such a book.) Those  two questions are, first, is it still a valuable book for any reasons other than archival, and second, does it teach the reader anything that might still be applicable in a  world whose technology is so far removed from that which was extant when the book was first published?<br /><br />The answer is yes to both counts. It&#8217;s possible that newer editions of this book have belied Stevens&#8217; assertion in  the 1992 edition that he would never integrate the code from either this or his previous (C Database Development) book into a Windows framework. More&#8217;s the pity if they do,  because what Stevens provides us with here is not only a model of good programming technique, but also a ready-made set of programs that can be taken and integrated into a  Windows framework. The book itself provides something of it in its own DOS-based GUI class, which provides a starting point for those who would extend the information  herein into Windows.<br /><br />Stevens presents us with the programs to create a part-relational part-object database, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the  book&#8217;s audience should be limited to programmers who want to build a database from scratch. Stevens&#8217; excellent explanation of technique is worth reading for anyone who uses  any of the technologies on which Stevens touches&#8212;database designers and maintainers, C++ coders of any level of expertise, etc. There is much to be taken  away from this book other than its original goal, and that does make it, still, a worthwhile read.<br /><br />Stevens takes us through the software-modeling procedure step by step while building the PARODY database, and in  the process introduces us to abstract design technique. He then goes on to show us the implementation, false starts and all, and most importantly ties all the code  snippets shown in various parts of the book together into a coherent application at the end, a step sorely needed in far more programming books I&#8217;ve read than I care to remember.  Perhaps C++ Database Development&#8217;s most important potential market is that of future programming textbook writers; many could take a few lessons from Al Stevens. 3 ½ starsase, and in  the process introduces us to abstract design technique.

Davis, C++ for Dummies (IDG, 1994)<br /><br />One of the main problems (from my perspective) with the vast majority of C++ books on the market is that  they're written for C programmers who want to migrate. What's a person to do who knows very little about C and wants to learn C++? The obvious answer is that he  gets on an insanely steep learning curve, unless he wants to go back and learn C before tackling the plethora of C++ how-to books on the market.<br /><br />Davis' book is no exception, despite being from the much-vaunted (by everyone except the programming  community) for Dummies line of books. To be fair, the cover does say that the book's perfect for C programmers who want to learn C++. And it would be hard to fault a  1994 book for not taking Windows programming into account, another common failing of C++ manuals (if you want Windows programming, you either get a platform- specific book [and most commercial C++ programming platforms hide the Windows programming internals] or you're stuck with the unintelligible reference books  from Microsoft itself). So my two main complaints with the book are really not complaints I can complain about in great detail.<br /><br />That doesn't make the book perfect. One of the common complaints about the for Dummies books relating to C++  is that the authors of those books tend to ignore the ANSI standard for C++ (Michael Hyman actually touches on some of the more egregious discrepancies in Visual  C++2 for Dummies and gives the justification the authors used, but that doesn't make it any less annoying for those who like to see good code), leading to  legions of coders who believe that `void main()' is a perfectly<br />acceptable statement. At the very least, if you're going to use the for Dummies books on C++, find a resource  that lists out the discrepancies (or that's closer to the standard, e.g. the comp.lang.c++ FAQ or Bruce Eckel's Thinking in C++ books) and make the changes in your  copy of the book when you find them. Your co-workers will thank you.<br /><br />All that said, C++ for Dummies was my first major C++ reference after one comp sci course that touched on C  back in my college days, and despite that learning curve, it did give me enough of a basis in C++ that after two or three re-reads I'd pretty much figured out most of  what Davis was on about. Eight years on, it's hard to separate what he should have taken more time to cover with what wasn't standardized yet, but I think I'm  pretty safe in faulting him for not taking a lot more time covering templates, and I know that I've read a number of descriptions of pointers that make a whole lot more  sense. As any C++ programmer will tell you, the proficiency of his colleagues lives and dies with an understanding of pointers. This particular book took a  lot more re-reads and a lot of outside references before I figured out pointers, and I'm still not completely comfortable with them.<br /><br />I should point out a few of the good things about the book, if only to justify the rating I'm giving it,  shouldn't I? Despite the whole ANSI standard controversy mentioned earlier, Davis does give us some excellent rudimentary tools many programmers would be wise to  adopt (most notably the signature fields he introduces towards the end of the book, which are wonderful tools for figuring out pointer errors). The concept has been  built upon and done better since, but for its time it was an excellent concept, and it's much easier for the beginner to handle than some of the more complex run-time  error-checking routines that have appeared since. Signature fields alone may be worth the price of admission for the beginning user.<br /><br />In short, there's definitely a decent skeleton here, but it could use (and may have gotten after eight years)  a lot of work. ** ½ou find them.

But Hautala's meteoric descent into obscurity as the decade turned could be predicted by anyone who knows the  unwritten (until now) rule of horror fiction blurbs: the more obscure the previously-famous blurb writer for an author, the more likely it is that the blurbed will  make the same descent. And the blurb for Winter Wake comes from John Coyne, second only to Frank de Felitta in seventies horror, and just as obscure by the time Winter  Wake appeared in 1989.<br /><br />The rule of horror fiction blurbs wasn't necessarily the only way to prophesy Hautala's downfall. Winter Wake  suffers from the traps of many genre horror novels, specifically overdramatized writing and about ten times the number of necessary exclamation points. Neither  of these things prevents an author from attracting a core audience and achieving longstanding fame, however, as the example of Brian Lumley shows us. And what beyond  that may have erased Hautala's name from the bestseller list is something of a mystery. Winter Wake is not a bad book by any means, despite the  shortcomings mentioned above. It's not a great one, either, but no one lined up to give the Pulitzer to Dean Koontz for Darkness Falls, either.<br /><br />The story presents us with the Carlson family: father Frank, son John, son's wife Julia, and son's  stepdaughter Bri. Frank has recently suffered a stroke, and his rehab is taking longer than usual, so John and his family move back to the homestead on a small Maine island to  help Frank around the house. Frank and John have never gotten along too well, though, and while Julia and Bri start feeling affection for the old guy almost  immediately, things just get worse and worse between father and son. To throw an extra monkey wrench into the works, the house seems to be haunted, and the haunting seems to  point to a dark secret in John's past.<br /><br />The encapsulation above seems to point to Russell Bank's Affliction, doesn't it? Frank Carlson is a lot more  affable, and John Carlson isn't quite as dysfunctional, but there's something to be said for the comparison. A family disintegrating over the gradual uncovering of a  secret. Hautala, though, doesn't have the deftness of foreshadowing that Banks uses throughout his work; often, there might as well be THIS IS IMPORTANT in foot- high neon red over certain passages in Winter Wake. And while the actual dark secret is somewhat different than what one would expect, Hautala chose to channel  the dark secret into an avenue where the logical choices the reader could guess are limited enough that the revelations at the end are still somewhat  predictable. The book also suffers from the same unaccountable mood swings that seem to pervade just about every piece of fiction I've been reading recently. John and Julia  go from yelling at one another to laughing to sullen silences in the space of a few minutes without any real triggers that we can see. It makes things simple and  moves the plot along, but there's a strong feeling of attempted emotional manipulation, and it's just a little too close to the surface. When you can see it, it  doesn't work.<br /><br />Whether Hautala deserves the obscurity in which he finds himself these days is an arguable point; lord knows  hundreds of best-selling authors have the same, or far worse, flaws in their various stories than these. The problem is there's not enough here to really start any  kind of revival movement. ** ½eems to be haunted, and the haunting seems to  point to a dark secret in John's past.<br /><br />The encapsulation above seems to point to Russell Bank's Affliction, doesn't it?

Wilhelm Johannes Schwarz, Heinrich Boll: Teller of Tales (Frederick Ungar, 1969)<br /><br />&quot;It is certainly too early,&quot; Schwarz begins his conspectus, &quot;to assign Heinrich Boll his definitive place in  German literature.&quot; The Nobel committee obviously thought differently three years after the publication of this slim overview of Boll's work to date; Boll won the  Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972, based largely on the work he'd published up to 1969. Schwarz says that Boll's novels are overrated at the beginning of the book. That's the  best kind of overrated there is, one thinks.<br /><br />Teller of Tales is not so much a critical study as it is a survey. Rather than delve deeply into any aspect  of the short stories and novels of Heinrich Boll, Schwarz seems content to draw parallels between certain types of characters in Boll's novels. Each chapter except the  first (Survey) and the last (Conspectus) focuses on a type of character who crops up in multiple Boll publications: the artist, the Catholic, etc. While this is  certainly good information to have for one who's working his way through Boll's books, it would have been nice to see an extra hundred pages or so in this volume (which is  only 116 pp. sans endnotes, preface, etc.) devoted to giving us more of what, in Schwarz' opinion, Boll was really on about. Instead, Schwarz repeatedly falls back  on the claim of the survey writer that such things are &quot;beyond the limits of [the] study.&quot; This, combined with Schwarz' parade of disparaging remarks throughout the  survey (the &quot;overrated&quot; comment above, the sentence &quot;Whenever he ventures into other techniques [e.g., the ambitious symbolism of Billiards at Half-Past Nine or  the metaphysical dream language of The Bread of Our Early Years] his style appears labored and less than fully convincing.&quot; In the preface, and other such  comments throughout the first twenty pages of the book), one gets the distinct impression that Schwarz' ulterior motive here was to damn Boll with faint praise. There is  certainly something to be said for calling Boll to task for the plodding pace of Billiards or the rather deus-ex-machina ending of The Train Was on Time, but with only one  or two exceptions Schwarz ignores that which makes Boll such a brilliant writer when he's on his game--his ability to make a reader not care about these things  by being able to get his point across so clearly and competently. One must, of course, make an allotment for the possibility that Schwarz simply missed the point  repeatedly, but that seems somewhat disingenuous when Schwarz talks again and again about Boll's depictions of life in general after the war. In fact, he devotes a  whole chapter to the Homecomer (what today we would think of as DPs). How much of the point could he really have missed? It's also true that this was published  five years before Boll's magnum opus, The Lost Honor of Katherina Blum (and one thinks the Nobel committee must have been singularly pleased to see an author they'd  given the award to only two years previous pull his finest novel out of a hat!), and perhaps Blum puts more of Boll's stylistic kinks and message-bearing ability  into perspective in the earlier novels.<br /><br />It's a decent place to start for the aspiring Boll critic who wants to see what directions he has to choose  when writing a dissertation or a critical article. However, this certainly never approaches the utility for the layman contained in such critical studies as Reddick's The  Danzig Trilogy of Gunter Grass (a necessity for getting the full power of Grass' great work) or David Paul Henry's The Early Development of the Hermeneutic of Karl Barth (a  necessity for getting anything about Barth at all). As such, it's probably best left until after the layman has read a good stack of Boll novels. ** ½that Schwarz' ulterior motive here was to damn Boll with faint praise.

Installing, creating your first project, doing the &quot;hello world&quot; application in a Windows framework, noting that you're typing two or three lines of code  instead of the thousands the authors estimate it takes to do a Hello World application in Windows (VC++ handles all the underlying code for opening and positioning the  window, et al.). Great! Now we're going to get into the AppWizard options, how to program an MDI interface, what you want to do differently in your classes, and all  that stuff, right? Nope. The remaining three hundred pages in the book are an overview of, yes, you guessed it, how to program in C++.<br /><br />For the record, this book does a better job in some places than does C++ for Dummies; specifically, it has  sections on error handling, gives a few paragraphs on templates (which is more than the first book did), that sort of thing. This can probably be explained away by  the fact that Visual C++ 2 for Dummies was published a year after its thinner, more anemic predecessor. And these are things an aspiring C++ programmer should know.  But if you bought Visual C++ 2 for Dummies, it's pretty likely you have a copy of Visual C++ 2 and you want to use it for Windows programming. And after touching on  the very tip of the iceberg, the book ignores the subject to the point where all of its sample programs (assuming you don't get the disk, which must be ordered  separately from the book--at least, in the one I have, which has a page at the back telling you where to send your cash) need to be programmed as console  applications (i.e., they run in a DOS box). &quot;Disappointing&quot; is an understatement along the lines of  &quot;Caligula had some emotional problems.&quot;<br /><br />Unless it's your very first book on C++ and you're jumping into the Windows deep end, avoid this. **ject to the point where all of its sample programs (assuming you don't get the disk, which must be ordered  separately from the book--at least, in the one I have, which has a page at the back telling you where to send your cash) need to be programmed as console  applications (i.e., they run in a DOS box). &quot;Disappointing&quot; is an understatement along the lines of  &quot;Caligula had some emotional problems.&quot;<br /><br />Unless it's your very first book on C++ and you're jumping into the Windows deep end, avoid this. **	2002-01-25

Parker, A Catskill Eagle (Dell, 1985)<br /><br />Spenser, Susan, and Hawk are back for another adventure. This one spends its time ketting between the two coasts. When we last left  our intrepid adventurers, Susan and Spenser had decided to spend some time apart, and Suze was out in San Francisco dating some other guy. Now, out of the blue, Spenser gets a letter, saying  she's in trouble, Hawk is in jail in a nothing little Frisco suburb, and Spenser's help would be greatly appreciated. Spenser heads out to the left coast to get his pal out of jail, find his is-she-or-is- she-not? girlfriend, do some sleuthing, and break a few heads.<br /><br />Parker has kept the Spenser dynasty going for almost three decades now, and the quality of the novels has remained high as time has  gone on. Still, the series has its high and low points, relatively, and A Catskill Eagle is one of the high points. Hawk and Spenser one-liner each other more than the whole WWF on amphetamines. Plot  twists abound. The boys get their hands dirty. Government agencies get involved (can't tell you how without spoilers-- I told you, plot twists abound, which makes it hard to get into any  detail after the first six pages or so). Pretty much everyone ends up mad at Spenser, Hawk, or a combination of the above, but no one (who survives) can deny a good time was had by all.<br /><br />In other words, it's classic Spenser-- funny, fast-paced, and thrilling. If you haven't caught the bug yet, do yourself a favor and  start reading Parker, who's one of the best in the business today. ****	2002-01-21

John Dunning, Booked to Die (Pocket, 1992)<br /><br />This book's probably got a niche market in the same way that Christopher Morley's wonderful turn-of-the-century bookstore-themed  mysteries did. You're going to get a lot more out of this book if you've ever trod the bibliophile's path yourself, or at least have some other kind of collecting bug in your bonnet. Otherwise, you might  do well to avoid this one.<br /><br />Okay, now that we've got rid of the riffraff, let's get down to brass tacks. This is a great little mystery that introduces us to  Cliff Janeway, a Colorado cop who dreams of retiring from the force and opening his own rare bookstore. It doesn't matter that every other shop on the street where he wants to open his is a rare  bookstore; competition doesn't apply to the types of folks who frequent rare bookstores. After all, most every copy of a rare book is different, and this gang is usually looking for that one specific typo that  sets edition A apart from edition B and wants printing X; so many variables everyone's bound to hve different stock. But Janeway's bookstore dreams are a background to the novel, which is above all a mystery.  There are two plotlines here. The first concerns the murder of a bookscout, onje of that class just up from the homeless who make their living buying books at Goodwill and selling them to people  who know what they're worth. The second concerns a rather nasty person that Janeway's been trying to nab for years. Due to the American system of justice, the guy keeps evading capture. Everyone  else in the novel wants to combine the two; they're convinced the nasty type did in the bookscout, and everyone's happy. Everyone, that is, except our fearless narrator. Things get out of hand.  Complications ensue. If they didn't, it wouldn't be a mystery novel.<br /><br />Where Dunning excels here is in the balance ebtween the book talk and the mystery talk. Separating the two out would make for a  passable novel about the book trade (think Penelope Fitzgerald's The Bookshop as told by Mike Hammer) and a passable mystery novel (think My Gun Is Quick as told by Penelope Fitzgerald). Neither  side suffers from the inclusion of the other, something which is rare indeed among novels that attempt to blend two such disparate streams of thought. Add to this Dunning's eye for detail-- the  only stones that remain unturned are those necessary to set up the idea that these characters will continue on into other novels (a second Janeway novel, The Bookman's Wake, has already been published)--  and you've got a fun little read. It's not earthshaking, it doesn't break any new ground, and it's a niche. More people remember Agatha Christie than Christopher Morley, too, but that doesn't make  Morley's books any less wonderful. As Morley, so Dunning. Highly recommended for those who find themselves in the first paragraph of this review. *** 1/2trade (think Penelope Fitzgerald's The Bookshop as told by Mike Hammer) and a passable mystery novel (think My Gun Is Quick as told by Penelope Fitzgerald).

Michael Cecilione, Muse (Pinnacle, 1999)<br /><br />Among the number of ways in which this book goes wrong is one (and, in fact, it is the main one) for which Cecilione can't in any  way be faulted, and that is that the book jacket contains the spoiler that gives away the ending. The person who wrote the back jacket copy for the paperback edition of this novel should be boiled in  lead. If you already know what's going to happen in the last twenty pages, especially while the various reviews of the novel talk about how great the last twenty pages are, it takes away something  from the book. A very big something, in fact. I'll try to avoid committing the same sin here.<br /><br />The story opens with Johanna Brady, a struggling New York actress, meeting Matt Lang, fantastically successful crime novelist. The  two have a whirlwind romance, and Matt ends up asking Johanna to spend the winter with him at his secluded house in the woods while he cranks out his next novel. This will set off alarm bells in  the head of any dedicated mystery reader, but the dedicated mystery reader who's ever had a whirlwind romance is likely to do the same quick ratinoalization Johanna does. Once they get to the cabin,  things start getting interesting. (Complications... oh, you know the drill.)<br /><br />It's also where the book falls apart. Johanna and Matt, along with various minor characters (the best of whom, a Robert DeNiro  wannabe who actually drives a taxi for a living!, never gets anywhere near the due he deserves-- I'd love to see Cecilione write a followup to this concentrating on that guy), are well on their way to  being complex and believable characters until this point. Once they're out in the woods, Johanna's actions become preditable, and she starts sounding the same note over and over again; Matt's responses to  her actions do the same. While all this is going on, the two also fall into the genre-writing trap of sudden mood swings that make no sense; they go from flinging things across the room in one paragraph  to clutching each other and ripping bodices in the next. A little of that can be good fun; too much and the reader will start wondering if Cecilione has been channeling the spirirt of the late Dame  Barbara Cartland.<br /><br />Still, if you have the willpower to not read the back cover, the final twenty pages are arguably worth the three hundred eighty that  precede them; Cecilione sets the scene so that any number of endings are plausible, and then roots between them to find the perfect combination of the plausible to create an ending the reader won't be  likely to have come up with. The payoff would have been even better had the setup been in the same league, but it may be enough to lure the hardcore mystery reader who has nothing on the  shelves to read. **g things across the room in one paragraph  to clutching each other and ripping bodices in the next.

Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, Hotel Transylvania (Signet, 1978)<br /><br />Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has been doing her thing for quite a while now, and doing it rather successfully. Nothing has brough her more  success, or a wider readership, than the Comte de Saint-Germain chronicles, a series of books about an ageless vampire set against different timeframes. The whole series is well-known for its  attention to detail and stunning descriptions of life at the various times and in the various places where Saint-Germain (and the main characters in the spinoff series that have sprung from this) has his adventures.<br /><br />The series' first novel in set in France in 1743, as Saint-Germain meets one of the great loves of his life, Madelaine de Montalia.  Madelaine's reaction to Saint-Germain's rather bizarre history isn't the usual fainting-and-horrified-looks one expects in a vampire novel, and thus the framework here lends itself more to gothic romance  than it does to straight-out horror. However, the horror elements find their way into the book in a subplot involving the renewal of a thirty-year-old enmity between Saint-Germain and another French  petty noble, Saint Sebastien.<br /><br />While there is certainly enough going on here to make Hotel Transylvania a stand-alone novel in itself, it's obvious that Yarbro was  gearnig up to make Saint-Germain into a series character, and so many passages in the book have the sense of being a setup for a larger picture. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though other  authors have drawn out the necessary setup into more than one novel to make it less obtrusive. The longstanding success of the series shows that the fans don't have a problem with it; it's doubtful  readers of horror fiction new to Yarbro and/or Saint-Germain will, either. *** 1/2	2002-01-21

Adrienne Eisen, Making Scenes (Alt-X, 2001/2002?)....<br />Making Scenes is the story of (actually, four stories about, but we'll not split that hair here) the Everywoman of the 1990s as  given us by Eisen. She's bulimic but handling it, unsure about her various relationships, trying to find a steady job in a shaky market, and dreams of being a professional beach volleyball player. Unlike  most, she has an actual shot at it, and spends the majority of her time outside her various stress-causing activities either playing volleyball, getting ready to play volleyball, or coming home from  playing volleyball. And while that may sound monotonous, it's anything but. No one writes novels about professional beach volleyball. And what we get of it here, especially filtered through the eyes of our  protagonist (and her relationship crises-- after all, volleyball is a team sport), is interesting enough to have been a novel in itself.<br /><br />It should have been, and I guess I have to split that hair. The novel lacks consistency, and I get the idea that this is because  it's actually four separate stories that take place at various times in the protagonist's life as she attempts to reach her dream. Marketed as a related collection of short stories, I mgiht have been more  prepared for the jarring between sections. Also, it often seems like the material on what's happening outside the volleyball obsession is somewhat extraneous. The bulimia aspect is obviously tied in  closely, but the outside-volleyball relationships aren't. Perhaps I'm looking at it from the wrong POV, as the book has earned high praise from erotica aficionados, but I got the feeling Eisen was focusing more  on the volleyball and that the erotica aspect was less important.<br />The two didn't quite mesh for me. ** 1/2	2002-01-21

Carolyn Howard-Johnson, This Is the Place (America House, 2001)<br /><br />....The comparison on the back jacket between This Is the Place and Gone with the Wind is ludicrous. Mitchell's first (and blessedly only) novel was an overblown, unreadable piece of melodrama that should better have been published, in the words of Melville, to the flames. Howard-Johnson's first novel is exactly the opposite; it's a spare novel, rarely a word out of place and with very little filler, without long diversions that have little to do with the central characters. No, Gone with the Wind this isn't, and I, for one, couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Set in 1959, This Is the Place gives us Skylar Eccles, between high school and college, working for the local paper, and a non-Mormon living in the state of Utah. She's dating a mormon seriously, and it looks as if she's treading the same route as most of her ancestors that we get to know in this novel: she's going to marry a Mormon. But how that affects her, how her wordless battle against pre-ERA workplaces, and the various other strings of plot here are of secondary importance. This Is the Place is a novel about the Eccles family and Sky's attempt to put the recent family history into words. It is a love affair with genealogy, and that is what makes this novel shine. More than once while reading this, I found myself making comparisons to Lee Smith's brilliant novel Oral History; I get the feeling that the audiences for the two books would cross over perfectly.<br /><br />Since I felt compelled to mention the prejudice angle previously, I might as well attempt to justify it. Sure, there's prejudice to be found here. Anyone who grew up with Tom Fitzgerald's wondrous Great Brain books has a basic understanding of the ins and outs of Utah society. Not much changed between T. D. and his family at the turn of the century and Sky in 1959. Much is made of the oppression of the Mormons by American society; much is made of the oppression the Mormons foist on others, as well, both the non-Mormons living in Utah and those places to whom the mormons send missionaries. There's also a rather biting passage about the non-Mormon minority's feelings towards the Mormons that had me wanting to stand up and cheer for our heroine. Yes, prejudice is pervasive in this novel, but it's not thrown in our faces with the tacit understanding that we should Do Something About It. It's presented in a more Nietzschian fashion-- what doesn't kill us,<br />etc. Does that make this a bad book, or a \\"sell-out\\" as far as prejudice goes? Far from it-- would that more American literature treated prejudice in such a pragmatic fashion.<br /><br />My main problem with the book has nothing at all to do with Carolyn Howard-Johnson and the tales she spins within its pages, but with the publishers. The editor fell asleep at the wheel more times than I can count, and every spelling and grammatical mistake jars, especially when there are ten or twenty per page (this is commonplace in the large italicized blocks towards the end where Sky actually starts writing down all this family history). If you're a nitpicker, beware-- there are large blocks of this novel where you'll be slowed down by a shoddy editing department. I thought the book was well worth reading despite that, but your mileage may vary. *** 1/2ns foist on others, as well, both the non-Mormons living in Utah and those places to whom the mormons send missionaries.

Heinrich Boll, Billiards at Half Past Nine (Signet, 1962)<br /><br />Heinrich Boll was a brilliant mystery writer. Moreover, he was capable of writing mysteries unlike anything seen before, mysteries that turned the genre on its head. He was also capable of expanding the mystery genre so that it not only bordered on, but crossed over into, literary fiction. Unfortunately, at one point Boll allowed the mystery to slide into the background and started to concentrate on the literary side of things. This leads to the inevitable question for the reader: what does a mystery novel look like when the mystery is absent, or at least so far in the background as to be unnoticeable for most of the<br />novel?<br /><br />Billiards at Half Past Nine is your answer. While there are elements of mystery within the novel, the focus is less on what's going on around the characters than the characters themselves. This is not, in itself, a bad thing; the characters upon whom the focus rests, all of whom are members of the Faehmel dynasty of architects, are interesting enough, and it would take conscious effort to make the first half of twentieth-century German history boring in any way. We are shown that period of time through the eyes of various members of the Faehmel family in a series of recollections leading up to Heinrich Faehmel's eightieth birthday party in 1958. And were that the basis of the novel, it would have been a good, solid piece of literature; ultimately forgettable, but good.<br /><br />Boll felt the need to add something else to it, and it is there that the mystery comes into play. In the opening scenes, Heinrich's son Robert, the present scion of the Faehmel dynasty, tells his maid that, while he is playing Billiards at a local hotel, he is only to be disturbed by certain people. Most of them are family, or other members of his business; there is one name, though, that stands out, because no one knows who this Schrella character is, or why Robert Faehmel considers him on a plane of import with the others. This part of the book is where it is lacking; one gets the feeling that Boll felt it necessary to impart complications into a novel that doesn't require them.<br /><br />While it's a worthwhile read within the context of Boll's complete works, it's not a place for a novice to begn an exploration of one of Germany's finest novelists. The Lost Honor of Katherina Blum and The Train Was on Time are much better jumping-off points. ** 1/2on a plane of import with the others.

Regina McBride, The Nature of Water and Air (Simon and Schuster, 2001)<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Okay, now that my first impressions are out of the way, this is one hell of a ride. All the more so because most books that have that effect on me are your typical big budget thrillers that, were they to go to the big screen, would be directed by John McTiernan or someone along those lines who uses a lot of pyrotechnics. The Nature of Water and Air is anything but; stuff doesn't blow up here at all. In fact, it tends to do quite the opposite; characters implode on a fairly regular basis, but they do so within the context of a pervasive atmosphere that this is the way things are supposed to be. It's hard to explain why something that's so low-key can have such an effect, but I'll give it a go.<br /><br />Everything that makes this book work is atmosphere-- big old houses that are falling apart, characters for whom clinical depression means things are looking up, Catholic schools harboring reclusive nuns, it all adds up to an unshakable feeling that not only is something bad bound to happen, but that everything that's bound to happen is bad. It's the revival of classic tragedy--bad things happen not because of the flaws in the characters (and there are certainly character flaws aplenty), but because the gods have deemed that, for these folks, the dice came up snake eyes again and again, no matter how many chances they got. And yet still, when bad things happen to these people (be they good or not so good), every once in a while the way in which the bad things happen, or the scope of the bad things that do happen, is carried off so brilliantly that it might as well be the roof of the Nakatomi Plaza being blown to bits in Die Hard. Enchanting.<br /><br />The story centers around Clodagh Sheehy and her mother, Agatha. Clodagh's father has been dead for most of her life, and she has no memory of him. She has a twin sister, Margaret Mary, who's too frail to do much other than play the piano once in a while. To top it all off, she's convinced that her mother is a selkie, a seal taken human form who is destined to return to the sea at some point. Agatha married into the Sheehy family, and is not beloved of the rest of her husband's family, so they send her to the other side of Ireland to live in a decrepit mansion the family still owns over there. Mrs. O'Dare, one of the housekeepers, comes along for the ride, and it is there our story opens. Most of the action goes forward through the reader finding out more and more about Clodagh's family (the unraveling of her mother's mysterious origins, the relationships between Agatha's husband and his sisters, etc.), but there is also Clodagh's growing up; the book takes place over the span ow twenty years. from Clodagh's girlhood until just after her twenty-first birthday.<br /><br />It is an uncompromisingly dark novel, one for which the word &quot;bleak&quot; is too light and airy. And yet it never fails to be beautiful. ****play the piano once in a while.

Gearino, Blue Hole (Simon and Schuster, 1999)<br /><br />Gearino returns with his third novel about small-town life in Georgia, this one a mystery about a missing teenager, a Utopian commune, and a well-meaning high school boy who tries to connect the dots.<br /><br />Charley Selkirk finds himself kicked out of high school and girlfriendless after defending a black football player with his own brand of off-the-cuff justice. Faced with a lifetime of nothing to do ahead of him, he hires on as temporary help for town photographer (and Gearino regular character) Tallassee Tynan. The two of them, while visiting one of Tynan's subjects, are told the woman's grandson is missing. Tynan wants to drop it; Selkirk (probably still staring that lifetime of nothing to do in the face) wants to investigate. He wins; complications ensue.<br /><br />The plot gets stretched pretty thin in places in this book (having not read Gearino's previous work, I'm not sure exactly how thin it is; some things that look like major coincidences here may have popped up in his two previous novels), but the plot should be taking second seat to the characters and descriptions in this one. Blue Hole is peopled with the kinds of characters one always hopes to find in real life, but never quite does-- they look like stereotypes on the surface, but there's a level beneath that makes them anything but. The good-ole-boy sherriff has a collection of oddities he's come across during his time in office; the paranoid vet may have very good reasons to be paranoid. Etc. When the book slips in place A, it's always made up for in place B. That leads to inconsistency, but doesn't make the book any less worth reading. *** 1/2	2002-01-07

No mind is paid, seemingly, to whether these long-winded dissections contain major plot spoilers (they almost always do). Add Eric Bentley's interminable preface to the Grove Press edition of Brecht's Galileo to the list. Perhaps Grove  assumes anyone reading the thing will either have already read the play or will be so turned off by Belntley's wooden prose style that they won't read far enough to get to the spoilers. My advice: go the second route. And book publishers, if you're putting essays in your editions, PLEASE put them AFTER the actual text, so the novice reader of a given work will be able to approach it without the coloring of another reader's analysis.<br /><br />Bentley spends forty-odd pages discussing the historical inaccuracies of Brecht's Galileo and the two extant versions of the text (though Bentley says both are presented in the Grive edition, this is not the case; from his comments, I gather this is the second version of the play, completed after WW2 [the first was completed in 1937]). Bentley goes on forever about the socialist qualities of Galileo, and whether the scientist makes a worthy Marxist hero, both in the reader's eyes and in Brecht's. Whether anyone outside those writing a paper for a Marxist lit class would care doesn't seem to have crossed his mind. Brecht is one of the few authors who is capable of taking a political statement and couching it in such writing as to make the statement itself visible only to those looking for it; Galileo's Marxism, or lack of same, doesn't hit the reader in the face with a dead herring (or a dropped pebble, as 'twere) throughout the text. Commendable, especially for as fervent a Marxist as was Brecht. Here is a man who never let the message overtake the medium, and scads of modern authors could do with repeated readings of this text to get a handle on what it is they're doing wrong.<br /><br />Bentley aside, the play itself is certainly worth the reader's time. Galileo is presented from the time of his first findings with which Mother Church took offense until twenty years after his recantation. While the play mainly focuses on Galileo and how his own views toward his work affect him and those around him, we're not allowed to go away without understanding how those views also affected the Italian society around him; as with all things, the subversion to be found in Galileo's discovery that the Earth revolves around the Sun instead of vice-versa seeps into the public mind, much to the Church's dismay. But at its heart, the play is about the man himself and those around him. Galileo himself, historically accurate or not, is a convincing character, and his family, friends, and supporters are also very well-drawn (with the arguable exception of his daughter, who never seems to really flesh out and become a believable human being; her actions and reactions are predictable and wooden). Whatever the message underlying, and whether the reader agrees with it or not, Galileo is first and foremost a decent piece of drama. Leave Bentley's preface until after you've drawn your own conclusions. ** 1/2 (**** for the play, zero for Bentley's comments)ssage overtake the medium, and scads of modern authors could do with repeated readings of this text to get a handle on what it is they're doing wrong.<br /><br />Bentley aside, the play itself is certainly worth the reader's time.

While the plot moves along at a fine enough pace, and the pages turn quickly, there's not really much in the way of development going on. The characters are 2-D all the way through, and we never get to feeling that there's more than that surface. So if you're a person who can't find anything worth liking in a novel with badly-drawn characters, this probably shouldn't be the first place you turn when looking for something to read.<br /><br />On the other hand, if a well-realized plot and some great place descriptions are enough to make you eschew characterization, you could do a lot worse. Gaiman is quite good at coming up with new and interesting places to send his characters, most of which obviously started with the question &quot;why in the world was this tube station named &lt;x&gt;?&quot; Gaiman creates an alternate London that's quite a bit of fun to explore. I just can't quite shake the feeling that the miniseries would be more absorbing than the book. ***	2002-01-07

The Harvard Lampoon folks turn their attention to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and send it up with their usual blend of dead fish, toilet humor, Wizard air fresheners, third-grade satire, and fat, cheap cigars.<br /><br />No doubt legions of Tolkein fans are offended by this book's very existence. I think it's worth a few chuckles here and there, but it relies a little too much (as do most Lampoon satires) on the usual mishmash of sexually suggestive humor enjoyed by twelve-year-olds and the same bad puns you now find in newspaper headlines. Not that it was all that great to begin with, but it's not wearing well as time goes on. Still, it's an artifact of American popular culture, as scary as that thought is, and so it does have some historical value. ** 1/2	2001-12-20

And anyone who's actually spent time tracking down Coffey's work will notice a marked difference in writing styles right off the bat. (Brian Coffey, on the other hand, WAS a Koontz pseudonym. Different animal altogether.) So if you're looking for Dean R., this ain't the place to poke your nose.<br /><br />Coffey enjoyed a small amount of success in the eighties before fading into obscurity as the horror-novel craze went back to its normal level. Kind of sad, because Coffey wrote some pretty fun stuff, including this little tidbit about a girl who washes up on the coast of Maine in a very, very old ship and causes some very nasty things to happen to certain town residents. If you're a person who doesn't want to know the whodunit till the end, this isn't for you; it would take a fairly thick reader not to figure out how the prologue relates to the rest of the book by page three or so. Coffey's emphasis here is on the WHYdunit, and while it's not a particularly original why, there's also a WHO'SitgonnabedunTO aspect that makes the whole thing work. That should satisfy the mystery folks, the supernatural elements are all there for the horror folks, and everyone's happy. The characters are drawn well enough to keep the reader's interest, the pages turn quickly, and while no one's going to confuse Frank Coffey's books with M. R. James, they're certainly some good reading.	2001-12-20

Friedrich Durrenmatt, The Pledge (Berkeley, 1957)<br /><br />While Durrenmatt is a well-known and well-respected author, it took making a film of one of his books to get most people in the States actually reading him. This new film tie-in translation of The Pledge is a great way to start, and will hopefully lead a lot more Americans to a lot more Durrenmatt.<br /><br />The Pledge is the tale of Matthai, a Swiss police inspector who becomes convinced during the investigation of a child's murder that the cops have got the wrong man. He promises the victim's mother that he will find the killer, and that promise eventually leads to complete and total obsession. The novel, told by Matthai's former superior over a long auto journey and dinner, leads exactly where you think it will, and then throws in a  twist so nasty it's almost painful to read. Agee's translation was completed with an eye firmly on the readability factor, and this one goes relatively quickly (especially for a modern European novel); the payoff is well worth the time spent on the setup. Absolutely fantastic, and will cause me to have to revise my Best-of-2001 list. Very highly recommended. **** 1/2	2001-12-20

Keith Laumer, A Plague of Demons (Paperback Library, 1965)<br /><br />Keith Laumer may be a science fiction writer, but don't let that fool you. I'd bet a week's pay the guy was sitting there at his typewriter in a trenchcoat and fedora, unfiltered Lucky hanging from his lip, reading back his prose in a Bogart voice. The first two-thirds of this book is straight out of the world of hardboiled detective fiction. Well, okay, as long as you leave out the dog-faced aliens, invisibility suits, anti-gravity  devices, you get the idea.<br /><br />The scene is present-day Algeria, where your basic world war has come down to a seemingly endless conflict between Algeria and Tunisia, with the rest of the world powers backing one side or the other. Jack Bravais, an American general, is sent to observe the fighting and report back to his superiors, or so we think. His best friend, an operative for a secret government espionage agency, has different orders for him and a cover that's bound to stir up trouble-- make Bravais look like he's plotting against the UN, and a fellow American general in particular. As if that isn't enough for Bravais to get himself into, he very quickly finds out that his real mission (find out why the estimated casualty numbers for battles dating all the way back to WWI don't match the actual body counts) involves proving the existence of aliens. Well, alrighty then.<br /><br />The book's got a slow beginning, but it takes off around chapter three, and never looks back. The tone changes, inexplicably, about two-thirds of the way through and the book becomes much more a hard SF novel (one can almost hear the publisher screaming &quot;there aren't enough damn robots in here!&quot; at the first draft), but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment to be found in Bravais and his dimwit sidekick Joel (no last name). If you're a sci-fi fan looking for a good mystery, or a mystery fan looking for some aliens to play with, this is right up your alley. Have fun. *****	2001-12-20

Previous to that, Ketchum was the horror world's best-kept secret, the Einsturzende Neubauten of scary stories: influential to just about everyone working in the field, unknown outside it. Now, thanks to one offhand sentence in one very widely read treatise on how to write, Jack Ketchum has become collectible overnight. Don't try to find a copy of The Girl Next Door unless you're willing to pay [a lot] for a dogeared reading copy. But Ketchum has released a brand-spanking-new one recently, and until you come up with the scratch for the out-of-print monsters, this'll do just fine, thankyouverymuch.<br /><br />The Lost tells the story of Ray Pye, sociopath extraordinaire, who kills a camper and puts another one on life support in 1965, then waltzes off scot free because no one can put him at the scene, find the murder weapon, or any other useful little  prosecutorial trick for actually convicting someone. Most of the book's four hundred pages take place four years later, in the weeks following the death of the second camper after spending the intervening time in a coma and hooked to a life support system. (...)<br />The question almost everyone who picks this book up is going to be asking himself is \\"is this guy really as good as Steve King says he is?\\" Yup. He's that good. The question I ended up asking myself is \\"why is this guy considered a horror writer?\\" The Lost is your basic detective story where you know who the killer is from page one and the tension rests on the cops trying to pin the murders on the killer. It's no more horror than the stuff Joe Lansdale's been writing since Savage Season; it sits nestled firmly in the crook of the arm between mystery and thriller. (...) But there's more to it than that. Ketchum has a sense of delicacy one doesn't find much in either horror novels or mysteries, and he knows how to use conscious symbolism-- almost unheard of in genre fiction of any sort. Granted, it gets spread a little thick at times, but it's amazing to see it at all.

Josh Webster, Faith Killer (Zebra, 1991)<br /><br />The best thing about this book by a longshot is the title. If you pick it up, just stare at the cover for a while, then put it down and walk away. Because once you're inside, you'll find there's nothing worth having.<br /><br />Faith Killer is a serial killer novel written from the point of view of someone very, very heavily involved in 12-step programs. So much so that his characters veer off into long mental dissections of how horrible their lives were before coming to 12-step Nirvana. So much so that the good guy and the bad guy actually have a confrontation on treatment methods for addicts. No, people, I can't make this stuff up. To top things off, the &quot;mystery&quot; of who the killer is is spoiled by... the book's title! A truly brilliant piece of marketing THAT was.<br /><br />Compared to [Leslie Whitten's] The Fangs of the Morning, however, Faith Killer does have some worthwhile elements. Webster is a bit better at drawing his characters, and they're actually somewhat realistic when they're not being warriors for Bill W. (Actually, in retrospect, they're realistic then, too; I've met a few of them IRL who really do talk and act like this.) The action does move along well enough most of the time, and when you're not waiting for the inevitable recovery-spiel shoe to drop, there are a few absorbing parts. Unfortunately, they all lead to predictable places; guess what happens to the alcoholic cop? heh. * 1/2	2001-12-12

Though it weighs in at only 135 pages, the book is hysterically overwritten. Adjectives are piled onto metaphors are adverbially linked to... you get the idea. I'd provide an example if I hadn't already blocked the whole thing from my mind.<br /><br />But if you look past the writing, is there a worthwhile plot? A story? Characters? No, no, and no. Whitten sets the story up as if said fangs will be attached to something other than a vampire, but then, whoa, guess what the villain is? The characters are too flimsy to be called cardboard and hit every possible stereotype in the book, expressing feelings that only the shallowest of readers could possibly think have any backing to them whatsoever.

Stephen Solomita, Forced Entry (Avon, 1990)<br /><br />Stephen SOlomita has been laboring in the background of the thriller genre for over a decade without anyone really noticing his existence. His books are solid, easy to read, and a little on the genre-writing side, but that's no reason to give him any less air time than, say, Tom Clancy or John Grisham, both of whom suffer from the same drawbacks as does Solomita.<br /><br />In Forced Entry, we're introduced to two very nasty characters, Marty Blanks and Marek Najowski, who are hatching a plan to force rent-control tenents out of Jackson Heights brownstones so they can tear down the buildings and sell the lots for huge profits. (Solomita notes in a small foreword that this is a common practice in New York, but that his particular slumlords aren't based on anyone in particular.) One of the buildings they pick happens to contain a tenant whose niece is a legal aid lawyer, and that legal aid lawyer happens to be dating ex-cop private eye Stanley Moodrow, six feet of bad attitude who ends up getting involved in trying to figure out why a previously crime-free neighborhood is suddenly inhabited by hookers, dealers, and other various assorted types of New York-style lowlifes.<br /><br />Like most middle-of-the-road genre novels, Forced Entry does have a few drawbacks. Marek Najowski had the potential to be a really absorbing character, the kind of guy who makes an author's reputation, but Solomita never gives his character the development time it deserves. And too many minor characters in the book pop up, get described, and then die in some interesting and fun manner. (And by described, I'm not talking about the Stephen King-patented \\"here's two lines about a character who's going to die,\\" I mean a whole chapter that ends with the character's death.) But as I said before, the difference between Stephen Solomita and some novelists who are considered world-class has a lot less to do with quality than it does with promotion; if you're a fan of the rougher side of the thriller genre (think Rex Miller in a playful mood), then Solomita should be right up your alley.

He then followed it up with the euqally acclaimed The Juror, and proceeded to drop off the face of the earth, foiling a carefully-plotted career as a bestselling mystery novelist. Go figure. Based on the quality of his first two books, a whole lot of folks wish he'd come back.<br /><br />Green's second novel introduces us to The Teacher, a part-time mob enforcer, Taoist, and grower of rare orchids whose present job entails tampering with a jury to make sure his part-time employer doesn't go to jail. Problem is, the Teacher starts getting emotionally involved the the juror, and the two of them end up doing a rather dysfunctional dance that ends up with a whole lot of people dying.<br /><br />It's an absorbing novel, and a quick read. The characters are strongly drawn and identifiable, and the plot is excellently paced. The book's main flaw is that it relies a bit much on coincidences (of the &quot;of all the gin joints in the world...&quot; variety) that stretch credibility too far. But mystery novels rely on coincidence, and so we have to be willing to forgive Green in order to bask in the luxury of his writing.

That pretty much assures the uninitiated Yarbro fan (for there are two types of people on Earth, Yarbro fans and those who have not yet been exposed to her work) that any piece of fiction the woman has turned out is going to be a fun time. Signs and Portents is no exception to the rule. It's a book of short stories, and it suffers from one of the deficiencies of almost any book of short stories, inconsistency (only the truly great and the truly awful short story collections are uniform in their quality). However, that is to be expected, and no reader of short stories will fault a colelction for it.<br /><br />When Yarbro is good, she is very very good, and that's the case here. Her characters jump off the page and into the reader's brain with a minimum of hassle, and they're usually doing something altogether fun, like learning that getting a love potion from a witch ain't all it's cracked up to be (&quot;Savory, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme&quot;) or messing with the order of the universe thanks to, well, being an incompetent clod (&quot;Space-Time Arabesque&quot;).

Even bookfinder.com doesn't list a copy.<br /><br />Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel Blood Meridian is one of the finest novels in the English language, and the realization that much of the book is based on true events of 1849-1850 makes McCarthy's achievement even more harrowing. John Sepich gives us an overview of Mcarthy's cources as well as a look into some of the other conceits that tie the book together. Whether you take all of Sepich's assertions at face value or not (and he certainly does stretch things a little with his Tarot interpretations), the end result of reading Notes on Blood Meridian is an even deeper appreciation for the genius of Cormac McCarthy. Sepich hunted down obscure references by the score, source material that's been out of print for a century and a half, authors of critical works, unpublished dissertations, you name it. It's all here. You'd have to spend years doing the research yourself. Why not let Sepich hand it to you on a silver platter?

Sykes, Red Genesis (Bantam, 1991)<br /><br />Back in the day, when I was living in a small and godawfully boring suburb of Philadelphia, I used to go to a weekly series of poetry readings, get besotted, and rant. One of the other hardcore attendees was Sandy Sykes, a wonderful lady who had just completed and published a science fiction novel called Red Genesis, intended to launch a new arm of Bantam's science fiction wing, Spectra, called The New Wave. I'm not much of a science fiction fan, the last piece of hard sci-fi I actually finished and enjoyed being Greg Bear's Eon all those years ago, and so the copy I got from her ended up languishing on the to-be-read pile for almost ten years.<br /><br />Sandy, if you're out there, here's my public apology. Mea culpa maxima, because here's the answer to your inscription: you'd have to have liked my poetry an awful lot for you to have appreciated it as much as I liked this book.<br /><br />Red Genesis is the story of Graham Kuan Sinclair, a corporate bigwig as the book opens, whose slightly unethical dumping practices combine with the more unethical dumping practices of companies decades before him to create something very nasty. Nasty enough, in fact, to kill three and a half billion people. While it's pretty well established that Sinclair isn't at fault for what companies that were bankrupt before his birth did, his actions were the straw that broke the camel's back, and the courts impose a novel punishment on him-- Sinclair is banished. To Mars.<br /><br />By this point in human development, Mars is colonized, albeit by small, rival groups that have little to do with one another. Not being skilled in anything except running corporations, Sinclair would seem to be at a disadvantage in a place where everyone's got some kind of marketable skill. But through the friendships he makes along the way, he finds himself more effective than he ever imagined he could be.<br /><br />Pretty standard sci-fi stuff, no? But the characters are drawn so well, and the emotional bonds between them are so accurately portrayed, that it's impossible not to get involved in what's going on. And by the time the (completely unexpected, by the way) climax of the book comes around, it's devastating.<br /><br />Could it have been even better? Good question. I could have done without the Asimov-penned preface (dry recitations of facts-- come to think of it, rather like most Asimov novels I've tried), and while the afterword by MIT prof Eugene Mallove is more engaging than Asimov's preface, it pales in comparison to the novel itself. Skip them both and get straight into the meat of the thing.

For some odd reason, later-era James is what's universally praised in lit classes around the globe, while the early stuff, which is actually worth reading, is largely ignored.<br /><br />To be fair, James did get better at satire as time went on, but The Spoils of Ponyton has all the hallmarks of being a first attempt at a stylistic change. The novel centers on two characters who are utterly incapable of action, which wouldn't be so bad if the characters who were doing the acting were more involved. Such is, sadly, not the case. Owen and Fleda just sort of drift and react; as the book is told from Fleda's point of view, we end up with page after page of something that, in the hands of a better author (even a later James, had he re-written it) would have come off as uber-Tevye; weighing the various merits of various courses of action, not being able to decide on a course, and letting fate take her where it will. In Fiddler on the Roof, it works (largely because Tevye's monologues are brief and to the point); in Poynton, it blithers on endlessly, with all the fascination for the reader of watching cheese spoil.<br /><br />If you're new to James, by all means do yourself a favor and start with something he wrote earlier in his career. Leave Poynton until after you've developed enough of a taste for James to pick up later-era works, and then read the major ones before diving into this. *	2001-12-07
1745145:US	50068216	R22845RS38UPJD	0553569635	145267347	Blood Test (Alex Delaware Novels)	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Reasonably good mystery	Jonathan Kellerman, Blood Test (Signet, 1986)<br /><br />I spent most of this book waiting for that proverbial other shoe. Kellerman, in my mind, has always been one of those Andrew Vachss-style one-trick ponies who blames all of the world's problems on one narrow, and possibly specious, band of the psychotherapeutic spectrum. I hasten to add that I based that opinion on reviews and a cursory reading of Kellerman's first Alex Delaware novel, When the Bough Breaks, a few years back (I read it in tandem with one of Vachss' books, which may have further colored my thinking). Removed from both Vachss and the rather amateurish effort of Kellerman's first novel, I picked up Blood Test more as a way to pad the numbers for 2001-- skim fifty pages, dump it, chalk up another book in the it's-been-read pile. Blood Test, however, surprised me.<br /><br />Alex Delaware returns, this time to try and hunt down a kidnapped cancer patient. The list of suspects isn't too long, but it's certainly juicy-- the kid's parents (who have also gone missing), an alternative-medicine-loving pot-smoking ex-hippie doctor, and an organically-minded SoCal cult founded by an ex-Beverly Hills lawyer who got shot in the head. Oh, yeah, and the everpresent &quot;random crime&quot; theory. Add to this Delaware's being stalked by the extremely angry husband in a recently-finished child custody case who lost and lost big (and blames Delaware, of course), and you get 400 pages of pretty-durn-good mystery.<br /><br />The shoe does drop, of course. What makes Kellerman predictable isn't whodunit, but whytheydunit. In relation to many mystery writers, this is quite the handicap, because knowing the why before you open the cover will certainly narrow the playing field (and anyone with a passing acquaintance with Alex Delaware will know the why of it at that point). On the up side, though, Kellerman's one-man crusade isn't nearly the week-old scrod that Andrew Vachss' one-man crusade is, and that makes Kellerman a whole lot more readable. Standard mystery fare, but easy reading and compelling enough to keep the pages turning. ** 1/2an a whole lot more readable.

Comitting the heresy of reading a series novel out of order, I decided to crack the cover and see what all the fuss was about, assuming there is any fuss surrounding a non-A-list mystery writer. There isn't, really, but in this case there probably should be.<br /><br />Shackles has &quot;nameless&quot; abducted by an old enemy-- we're not sure who until the closing pages-- and spirited off to a remote cabin somewhere in the dead of winter, chained to the wall, and left with thirteen weeks' worth of food, some reading material, a dying space heater and radio, and a cheery warning that suicide is probably preferable to starving to death. Needless to say, this ain't your typical hardboied detective offering. Pronzini carries it off nicely, adapting readily to the slower pace that such a book is bound to have (no pun intended) and keeping the reader's interest nicely. The pages fly on this short novel (roughly 250 pages) as nameless spends his time alternately bemoaning his present state of affairs, trying to figure out who it was that stuck him in this mess, and accepting that the world has probably left him for dead. A fun little book, and a decided change of pace for mystery fans. Worth picking up. ***	2001-12-05

This is something of which I was previously unaware, but I became well acquinted with it while reading this book, a loose collection of stories about the life of an American consul sent to Ayer Hitam (in Malaysia) to close down the consulate there. (As a side note, Ayer Hitam is now a forest preserve maintained by the University Putra Malaysia, and dropping by UPM's website to take the photo tour lends a whole other perspective into reading this book.)<br /><br />Theroux's hapless protagonist spends his time cataloguing the odd folks to be found in and passing through Ayer Hitam, and Theroux's strength lies mostly in characterization. The population of Ayer Hitam (equal parts indigenous, Tamil, and Chinese, with a smattering of British expatriates) is the stories' real focus, and a number of them come to life in the stories dedicated to them. Not terribly much actually goes on there, but these aren't plot-driven stories anyway.<br /><br />Good stuff if you like character portraits, but if you're looking for more of a plot, other Theroux works might be a better jumping-off point. ***	2001-12-05

[...] Having read enough cozies in my life to still be able to count them on one hand, I have come to the probably erroneous conclusion that the main difference between the cozy mystery and the hard-boiled detective novel is that the investigator in the cozy is never in quite as much immediate physical danger as is the hard-boiled chap. Even if the chap in question isn't too hard-boiled.<br /><br />Such is the case with Boulder, CO psychiatrist Alan Gregory, the hero of Stephen White's open-ended series of mystery/thrillers. regory spends his time getting shot at, beaten about the head, henpecked, and otherwise threatened by a bevy of adversaries and never enjoying it much. The best kind of detective-- an amateur who gets too wrapped up in his cases.<br /><br />In this case, it's hard to avoid. The victim is Gregory's next door neighbor, a woodcraftsman who was designing sets for a theatre production in town. The murder is similar in some ways to a previous murder in Denver, and so the local police start thinking \\"serial killer.\\" Gregory's PD pal Sam Purdy hires him on as an amateur profiler, and away we go.<br /><br />Stephen White is a solid writer of thrillers, easily as good as any of the A-list names working in the genre today. His lack of widespread readership continues to baffle me. Harm's Way is of a piece with the rest of the Alan Gregory novels, and comes just as highly recommended from this camp. *** 1/2	2001-11-30

It's been received with, to be kind, mixed reviews, probably because it's a genre novel-- but what genre it is is somewhat elusive.<br /><br />Pilot Airie is a diagnosed schizophrenic whose mental problems started after the abduction of his little sister twenty years before. His mother Hannah, who's almost as neurotic as Pilot is, has started seeing double; his brother Eric, a successful neurosurgeon, says it's psychosomatic. (Dad's off in Florida with the new girlfriend.) Welcome to Oprahland, where dysfunction reigns supreme. Smith puts a twist on it, though-- the story is completely told through the eyes of Pilot, who believes himself omniscient. Thus, we are forced to ask ourselves from page one, is any of this actually happening, or is it all in Pilot's head? And if it IS really happening, what does that say about the underlying message about schizophrenia and its relation to (what we shall call for lack of a better term) extrasensory powers?<br /><br />Sounds like a mystery, doesn't it? Well, perhaps, or it could be a novel of the dysfuctional-fiction genre, focusing on drawing the character of Pilot and having him interact with those around him. Or a historical novel-- not of the gothic-romance type, but a novel of the process of attempting to rebuild history (given Pilot's narration, the mystery isn't just about what happened to his sister, but about what's happened to his family over the twenty years following what happened to Fiona, see?). And this is, perhaps, where some reviewers are getting sidetracked; how you approach the book will probably lead to how you view the last half of it. If it's a conventional mystery, it very quickly gets predictable.<br /><br />I chose to look at it as a kind of Pilot-vs.-the-world story, or a coming-of-age book about a thirty-year-old schizophrenic, and that made all the difference. The solving of the mystery of Fiona is handled more in the sense of classical tragedy than contemporary mystery; you can see the ending coming a mile off, but that's because the solving of the mystery itself is a background to the players and their motives; the real mystery for the reader lies in Pilot himself.<br /><br />An enjoyable read, especially for a first novel. *** 1/2enic, and that made all the difference.

I've wondered more than once if one of the writing guidelines for new TSR authors is Poe's old maxim that all novels should be written as if they are to be read in one sitting. (This, of course, is why Poe wrote only one novel.) I've read a lot of D&amp;D-themed novels, and very few break that mold. The most recent to cross my desk is David Cook's King Pinch.<br /><br />Pinch is a thief of indeterminate birth who leads a band of merry men (and one overly merry woman) down a road of small-time crookery-- that is, until a member of Pinch's past life shows up and takes him and his companions back to Ankhapur, the city of Pinch's birth, with promises of a nebulous job that will put enough money in their bank accounts to keep them comfortable for life, and threats of their heads on pikes if they don't come.<br /><br />The book starts off in an almost leisurely way, with Cook taking some time to develop Pinch's character before getting into the action. While that's never a bad thing, it does jar in the greater scheme of things. The pace does pick up as the novel goes on, but I wonder if most series readers who focus on TSR novels won't abandon this one given its initial slow pace. More fool them, however, because the reader of swords-and-sorcery fantasy will find much to enjoy once it gets going. ***	2001-11-26

John Farrell, Doctor Janeway's Plague (iUniverse.com, 2001)<br /><br />The first thing I thought of when seeing the title of this novel was &quot;oh, great, another Star Trek tie-in. Say it ain't so, Jimbob.&quot; Well, it ain't so, Billy Jack. The Janeway of the title is Robert H. Janeway, namesake of the Mayflower minister and lecturer at a Boston college. Perhaps. Or is he the same guy, still looking like he's forty even though he's ten times as old? And if so, how has he managed to keep himself so well-preserved? Such are the questions facing one Mollie Tailor, who believes herself to be a distant cousin of Janeway's. She gets her answers, and complications, as usual, ensue.<br /><br />This is a fast novel. It's also quite capable of hooking a reader and pulling him along, as I found out. I started this expecting I'd read fifty pages, then move onto something else I had in rotation, then come back and read another fifty, and so on, as I usually do. When I looked up, I was thirty pages from the end, a whole afternoon had elapsed, and I was late for a doctor's appointment. Whoops. It's pretty heavily plot-driven, and some minor characters suffer for it, but this is forgivable in the greater scheme of things; the major charcters are well-drawn and keep the reader's attention. It's also the first horror novel I've come across that uses astrophysics and actually makes it halfway believeable. (The cheese factor of the climax will probably vary according to reader. I loved it.)<br /><br />There are a few niggling problems I had with it, but they are minor at best. A few cultural references that could have been better documented (e.g., I know what &quot;The Moldau&quot; is thanks to having read _The Inextinguishable Symphony_ last year, but I'm guessing most people not familiar with modern classical music are going to have that reference jar), some errors that are equally likely the fault of editors or conversion to PDF rather than the author's problems. So there aren't really any major knocks against it; the reader of modern horror novels will find little to complain about here. I look forward to Mr. Farrell's<br />next effort. ***really any major knocks against it; the reader of modern horror novels will find little to complain about here.

Joseph Kanon, The Good German (Henry Holt, 2001)<br /><br />Josepah Kanon's third novel is a grimly humorous little tale of postwar intrigue. It focuses on Jake Geismar, a wartime correspondent sent back to Berlin to do a series of articles for Collier's. He also has a hidden agenda: find his wartime love, a native Berliner who's gone missing. Complications abound from the get-go, including a professional relationship dangerously close to turning personal, a blowhard Senator, and the head of the nascent war crimes division, all of whom are staying in the same house as Geismar. And they get even more complex from there.<br />Perhaps &quot;little&quot; isn't the word I'm looking for to modify &quot;tale.&quot;<br /><br />It could have been, though. While Kanon is deft enough at weaving his subplots together, keeping things believable, and providing enough suspense to keep the reader turning page after page, the novel's major failing is a sporadic lack of pace; sections of it, including the interminable beginning, crawl along at the speed of a quaalude-addicted sloth. Pieces of the novel could have been edited far more than they were without bothering plot or characterization in any way. The upside of this is that none of the novel's other slow spots approach the length of Book I, so if you make it through the beginning, sailing should be clear for the majority of the remaining time spent following Jake and friends around postwar Berlin.<br /><br />Postwar Berlin is not a nice place to be, but we don't expect it to be. Kanon is excellent at adding those details that allow us to develop a feeling of creeping tension even if Geismar is doing nothing but walking down a street in midafternoon. When he's firing on all cylinders (and he is most of the time), Kanon keeps us riveted; it's possible to lose hours at a time in here, even whole afternoons. The plot twists and turns, and Kanon throws us enough curve balls so that, even if we can predict the ultimate resolution of the novel, the stuff between point A and point B is still well worth reading.<br /><br />Recommended, but be prepared for some slow going, especially at first. ***novel, the stuff between point A and point B is still well worth reading.<br /><br />Recommended, but be prepared for some slow going, especially at first. ***	2001-11-22

Much of his early work has been allowed to run out of print and fade into obscurity; he remains a critical darling, popping up in _The Best American Short Stories_ and editing black-literature anthologies, yet he's never found a popular audience. Which is too bad, because Wideman's got a lot to say.<br /><br />Wideman covers much the same ground as Graham Swift-- the relationships between two human beings, whoever those two human beings may be. Wideman tends a little more towards the family side of things than does Swift, leading to a bit more variation on the theme, but the theme usually stays the same, how relationships end. They do not all end badly, by any means, as they do in Swift and so many other authors. They do not all end within the scope of the stories presented. But hanging over Wideman's work is always the feeling that relationships between people _will_ end, somewhere along the line.<br /><br />As in Swift, though, the similarity of tone and mood to be found in the various stories in this collection don't make it monotonous. Wideman gives us an interesting array of characters to examine, puts them into everyday situations, then throws something into the mix to jazz it up a little-- a blind man who never misses a shot from the free-throw line, a pianist who won't stop describing a dream long enough for his brother to tell him of the death of their mother (because, we can tell, he is already aware), etc. Wideman has a keen ear for the natural flow of language, and it both heightens his dialogue and keeps the descriptive parts of the stories flowing.<br /><br />The one place Wideman does falter is in letting the message override the storytelling in places. The title story in this collection works when Wideman is painting a scene, just as all his other stories work, but every once in a while the agenda gets in the way and the story flattens into polemic. Wideman never, though, allows the polemic to take over completely, and he's always able to successfully pull himself back from the brink. (In his defense, the ending of \\"Fever\\" is fantastic, a truly strong piece of writing, that more than makes up for the story's faults.)<br /><br />As with most of the books Wideman published before 1991, this is out of print at present. However, it's worth hunting down. A wonderful introduction to a wonderful author. *** 1/2lemic to take over completely, and he's always able to successfully pull himself back from the brink.

This is less obvious when you're reading the man's wonderful novels-- Waterland, for instance, which someone will hopefully soon canonize as one of the classics of twentieth-century literature-- but when you get digging into a story collection, you realize that Swift, or a close family member, was in the throes of the nasty ending of a relationship while he was writing these stories. His main characters, at least those of an age to be so,<br />are almost alwast divorced men, and the tale of the leaving wife is either the main thread of the story or part of the circumstance leading up to the main part of the story. Swift just takes that tale and paints it with different hues.<br />Any fan of Mondrian or his brethren will hasten to comment here that different hues are usually enough to make the same thing interesting anew. Indeed, and such is the case with Swift's stories. Recognizing the similarity between the characters doesn't make them any less interesting, and it certainly doesn't lessen the top-notch quality of Swift's writing, which has<br />yet to flag in any book of his I've read even for an instant. The man is truly gifted.<br />It's likely the publication date will give some readers pause. Yes, it's a collection of short stories published during the nineteen eighties. And yes, that should set off justifiable alarm bells in the reader who's been turned off to eighties lit. But what characterizes the good eighties lit (Vanderhaeghe, Swift, McInerney on his good days) and separates it from the bad eighties lit (Ellis, McInerney on his bad days) is emotion. Rest assured that Swift has emotion in spades. While his stories cover much of the same territory as those of his contemporaries, Swift is not the detached observer who narrated most eighties fiction; he is down in the muck of emotion, and has no qualms about dragging the reader in with him.<br />Another excellent book from Graham Swift. ****muck of emotion, and has no qualms about dragging the reader in with him.<br />Another excellent book from Graham Swift. ****	2001-11-15

Lisa Scottoline, Mistaken Identity (Harper, 1999)<br /><br />Three pages into Lisa Scottoline's sixth novel, Mistaken Identity, I wasn't sure I was going to make it to page ten. Scottoline opens the novel with her protagonist, Bennie Rosato, walking into the county prison where her newest client is in residence, mentally rattling off statistics that we've all heard a million times, most of which are, to say the least, on shaky ground as far as their worth is concerned. It is a horrible opening; thankfully, it is also short. The book improves tremedously on page four, and stays improved for the next five hundred plus pages.<br /><br />Rosato's newest client is Alice Connolly, who greets her with the rather surprising revelation that Connolly is Rosato's twin, despite that the two have never met before. The twin thing certainly throws a few extra monkeywrenches into the works of the normal courtroom/detective story, not that it needed any. Connolly is accused of killing her live-in boyfriend, a Philadelphia police officer, and makes nasty hints that other cops are framing her. The first half of the book alternates between Rosato trying to figure out if there really is a conspiracy and trying to figure out whether Connolly actually killed her boyfriend, as the two things aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. This section is standard mystery fare; if you're a fan of the genre, it'll work for you.<br /><br />Where Scottoline shines is once the case gets to court. When you reach page 300 and they're getting ready for trial, you start wondering how Scottoline is going to fill the second half of the book. She does so brilliantly, better even than many nonfiction true crime books cover trials. In fact, the only book I can think of that goes into this much detail of the trial, specifically the dialogue, is Bataille's &lt;i&gt;The Trial of Gilles de Rais&lt;/i&gt; (in which the second half of the book is simply unexpurgated trial transcripts). In both Bataille's work of nonfiction and Scottoline's novel, we are given solid evidence that cutting out the supposedly extraneous material of a trial, a rather common method of speeding up books/movies/TV shows, may be good for cutting time, but that all the other stuff is going to be just as gripping to the devoted reader of courtroom-procedure books. Scottoline takes us, line by line, through a cross-examination instead of summarizing. It's wonderful. Would that more courtroom-drama authors did such things. Maybe, as Scottoline gains the audience she deserves, it'll catch on.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is enough to make me drop it a notch, but still a highly recommended read. *** 1/2ction and Scottoline's novel, we are given solid evidence that cutting out the supposedly extraneous material of a trial, a rather common method of speeding up books/movies/TV shows, may be good for cutting time, but that all the other stuff is going to be just as gripping to the devoted reader of courtroom-procedure books.

John Cornwell, Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII (Viking, 1999)<br /><br />I feel guilty abandoning this book. The subject matter is tailor made to suit my tastes, and so many reviews of the book have focused, incorrectly, on Cornwell's seeming obsession with attacking the Roman Catholic Church and his methods of research, that I couldn't imagine not liking it when I picked it up. But quite simply, Hitler's Pope is an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />This is not to say that many of its critics are not still incorrect in their assessment of Cornwell's work. A number of reviewers have stated that the book has already been refuted by &quot;scholarly&quot; sources (without providing any references or other evidence of same), saying that Cornwell's previously-unused<br />sources are, in fact, not secret at all (despite Cornwell's exhaustive list of sources, in which he repeatedly states that many of them were previously public-- another straw man built by Catholics with axes to grind), pointing out that Pius XII was honored by the Jews for his work in World War II (which, as should be obvious to anyone with half an ounce of logic in their bodies, has nothing to do with what he actually did during WW2, nor does it have anything to do with what Hitler did with his actions before WW2, etc.), or combinations of the above and other similar easily-dismissed attacks on Cornwall. All of them serve the purpose of drumming up more interest in the book and making people wonder what all the fuss is about, thus increasing the book's authorship. These critics, who I suspect mindlessly bash anything containing any anti-Catholic sentiment whatsoever, miss using the most effective arrow in their quivers. Putting aside all the sectarian nonsense that's been written about the book and its research methods, Cornwell's writing simply isn't all that good. Many assertions are made throughout that should have been footnoted that weren't, and conclusions are drawn that<br />aren't labelled as conclusions, so we've no idea whether they're conclusions drawn by Cornwell himself or drawn in his sources. Worse, the prose is dry as the paper upon which the book is printed.<br /><br />Don't avoid Cornwell because he has an axe to grind against the Roman Catholic Church (assuming some fragment of that statement is actually true), avoid him because he's not a good writer.

Joyce Carol Oates, The Edge of Impossibility: Tragic Forms in Literature (Fawcett Premier, 1972)<br /><br />It seems sometimes as if the very idea of a book of literary criticism published in mass market paperback by a major publisher is absurd. Andin most cases, approaching a major publisher with the idea is likely to get you laughed all the way out of New York. But Oates was just coming off a National Book Award for _them_, and Fawcett decided to take a chance. I'm not sure, but they probably got the sales figures they were dreading. No one wants to read literary criticism anymore.<br /><br />Which is too bad, because Oates has some worthwhile things to say. This book seems almost a response to Lionel Abel's _Metatheatre_, which Oates calls &quot;odd&quot; and disputes throughout her essays on Shakespeare (Abel called Hamlet the last true tragedy, arguing that tragedy requires an outside influence, e.g. ghosts or the gods; this is the point with which Oates has some problems). While she never mentions Abel again after that, the choices of essays she used in the book, all post-Shakespeare, would seem to be a refutation of Abel by their very presence.<br /><br />No one who's ever read critical essays needs me to tell them what critical essays are like, so I shall refrain; Oates performs admirably in these. They make me want to go read the source material I haven't read, and re-read that which I have, and isn't that one critical essays should do? Perhaps if more of them had this effect, they might become popular again, assuming they ever were. ****	2001-11-14

He ended up as, basically, the voice of Pauline thought acorss the Christian religion by the time of his death in 1968. David Paul Henry, in his doctoral dissertation, looks at the differences between the first two editions of Barth's book _Der Romerbrief_, published in 1917 and 1920, in an effort to trace the development of Barth's interpretive skills and methods during this period-- in which, it can be inferred, Barth's theological underpinnings did more changing than they did at any other time during his life. Henry also includes an epilogue pertaining to Barth's 1959 release &lt;i&gt;Christ and Adam&lt;/i&gt;, which is in many ways a second revision of the original Der Romerbrief.<br />Barth as a subject is an endlessly fascinating person. His writings, on the other hand, can be something of a trial for the casual reader (I've heard they're actually worse in the original German). Thus, when Henry starts his book with a forty-page excerpt of the first edition of &lt;i&gt;Der Romerbrief&lt;/i&gt; (Henry's own translation of the work-- which, in his own words, &quot;attempts to render Barth's phrases in literal English equivalents.&quot; Oh, the pain and suffering.), the reader can get the feeling of being quite overwhelmed, even if he has been immersed in the writings of Barth before. Henry's translation does, however, achieve his stated goal of allowing the forcefulness of Barth's personality and conviction to come through; Barth, compared to most of today's well-known American evangelists, comes off as the Mephistopheles to a legion of wan, undernourished Fausts.<br />The remaining hundred-fifty-odd pages of the book are Henry's own writing, which is quite a bit more readable than Barth, and the book picks up speed. Henry first devotes two separate chapters to the two steps Barth took in his exegetical writing-- the historical interpretation of the text first, and then the (as J. T. Beck put it) &quot;pneumatic exegesis,&quot; best described in cimplestic terms as the spiritual interpretation of the text. The fourth and last chapter compares the differences in the second edition-- not so much differences in text as differences in Barth's thinking that led him to rewrite the manuscript (the textual differences are, for the most part, differing translations of the original Greek which Biblical scholars have been arguing over for centuries, are still arguing, and will likely never stop arguing).<br />If you're a fan of understanding methods of textual interpretation, you don't need me to tell you it's fascinating stuff. Trying to get at the thought processes of a writer makes for great history. Henry had an inroad that most authors don't, in that Barth left two distinct editions of one work in his corpus, and so Henry's book is more cpaable than most of tracing those thoughts. As this is his intention, he also stays away (until the last few paragraphs of chapter four) of value judgments of the work itself, a refreshing change from most exegetical histories.<br />This isn't light reading, and those completing the book are likely to crack a smile at the irony of Henry's last sentence in Chapter Four: &quot;The task of theological hermeneutics, as Karl Barth recognized, is not simple.&quot; Indeed. But that doesn't make Henry's work any less worth reading. I would suggest, however, that novices to the intriguing world of exegesis (either of original texts or exegetic texts such as Barth's) find a slightly less difficult subject to address first, e.g. Stanley Fish's exegesis of Milton, _Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost_. If you find it to your liking, Henry should be right up your alley.

Douglas Niles, The Rod of Seven Parts (TSR, 1996)<br /><br />Tired of waiting for the next installment of George<br />Martin's Song of Ice and Fire saga? Might as well head<br />back to one of the novels based on the game that<br />revitalized modern fantasy in America. The Rod of<br />Seven Parts is one of the oldest legends in the<br />Dungeons and Dragons world, tracing all the way back<br />to the first published materials (back when it was<br />still called Chainmail). Almost twenty-five years<br />after those first books were published,<br />long-established TSR author Doug Niles goes back and<br />fleshes out a little Rod of Seven Parts lore.<br /><br />This isn't, and shouldn't be approached as, one of the<br />epic novels that TSR has gotten somewhat famous for.<br />Don't go in expecting the sweeping, world-changing<br />grandiosity of the original Dragonlance saga, or the<br />deep-rootedness of R. A. Salvatore's seemingly endless<br />saga of Drizzt the dark elf (and long may it<br />continue). This is a simple standalone novel about a<br />halfling and his rod. The usual fantasy material is<br />there-- he finds himself on a quest through no fault<br />of his own, gets mixed up in a number of bad<br />situations, finds some companions along the way who<br />prove their worth any number of times, etc. It's<br />quick, easy, readable, and fun. ** 1/2	2001-10-01

Vladimir Nabokov, Laughter in the Dark (Berkeley,<br />1938)<br /><br />Laughter in the Dark was Nabokov's first treading of<br />the ground he would return to almost twenty years<br />later in Lolita-- a middle-aged man finds himself<br />desperately desiring an underage nymphet coming off<br />her first love affair, and complications ensue.<br /><br />This may have been Nabokov's fifth novel (originally<br />published in Russia in 1932), but it has earmarks of<br />first-novel syndrome. He returns in some small part to<br />his subject matter in Mary (the renewal of the old<br />relationship amidst the new one) while seeing what<br />could be gotten from the then-shocking subject matter<br />of age differences in relationships. Unfortunately,<br />both Mary and Lolita are better-fleshed-out than this.<br />While it does pick up towards the end (the last third<br />of the book or so is right up there with some of<br />Nabokov's better work as far as sheer readability<br />goes), you may well be better off grabbing those and<br />reading them back to back.<br /><br />In the interests of amusement, note that the main<br />character (whose name is Albinus Kretchmer)'s new love<br />is said to have figured out his real name by checking<br />under R in a telephone directory.

Everything is described as if the reader<br />were a cameraman making a movie of the book. In the<br />same way as Cormac McCarthy, it's a style that takes a<br />little getting used to. Once you've settled into the<br />narrator's rhythm, however, the book moves right<br />along. Unfortunately, also as with McCarthy, there are<br />going to be a lot of people who never settle into that<br />rhythm, and the book's readership will probably suffer<br />for it.<br /><br />The second thing you notice is that, while this book<br />is a sequel to The Talisman, there wasn't much reason<br />for it to be. Most of the Talisman references therein<br />are gratuitous, and seem to be there for the sole<br />purpose of tying the events in this book to King's<br />regining obsession, the Dark Tower. (No, it's not a<br />spoiler. King's been saying this novel will tie in for<br />quite a while now.) The novel suffers for it, though<br />it does raise the intriguing question of whether Mr.<br />Straub's next novel will also be set in Mid-World.<br /><br />Third, if you're a closer reader than average, you'll<br />probably note that the interplay between King and<br />Straub is somewhat looser here than it was in The<br />Talisman. Both of them were quite fond of challenging<br />readers to figure out where King's bits left off and<br />Straub's began, and vice versa, in the first novel. In<br />this one, it becomes obvious pretty early on that the<br />two had no bones about drawing the lines in places,<br />though it's still tough sometimes to figure out who<br />wrote what; but when chapter 25 begins with &quot;But<br />enough of that.&quot;, you know one of them is taking a<br />friendly shot at the other.<br /><br />All that aside, the subject matter the two of them are<br />working with is good enough, and heads right up the<br />alleys of both. A Wisconsin serial killer (despite<br />what you're probably thinking, no, Ed Gein has nothing<br />to do with this) who models his murders on the career<br />of Albert Fish is at work, and The Talisman's hero,<br />the now 31-year-old Jack Sawyer, lives in the same<br />town. Jack, a reitred homicide detective, is asked<br />repeatedly by friends and intimates to look into the<br />case, and after a while it becomes obvious that Jack<br />will have to get involved, as the case will take him<br />back to The Territories (which are, of course, part of<br />the Dark Tower's world). Straub returns to the<br />mystery-style subject matter that graced his most<br />successful books, and King gets to deliver the nasty<br />crime scene descriptions that have made him<br />successful. (These crime scenes go way beyond Straub's<br />threshold of taste; even the most extreme bits of The<br />Hellfire Club pale in comparison here.)<br /><br />Still, as I mentioned in my review of Dreamcatcher,<br />we're still in the middle of a transitional King<br />phase, and the quality herein is along the same lines<br />as that in Dreamcatcher-- better than the<br />early-eighties stuff, but a cut below his best work.<br />Straub could go nowhere but up after Mr. X, and he<br />certainly did so here. Oddly, though, Black House<br />compares to the string of novels starting with Koko<br />and ending with The Hellfire Club in the same way it<br />compares with the great King releases-- it's not as<br />powerful as, say, Mystery, but it's a worthy addition<br />to the Straub oeuvre anyway.<br /><br />A must-read for King and Straub completists and Dark<br />Tower followers. Oh, yeah, and did I mention there's a<br />Hearts in Atlantis tie-in, too? For everyone else,<br />it's optional; go by your feelings regarding<br />Dreamcatcher and act accordingly. ***of both.

Part coming-of-age novel, part crazy-preacher novel, part slice-of-life novel (but a slice of the kind of life one finds in, say, Joyce Carol Oates' more depraved characters), and all charming, in the same sort of way Ted Bundy is said to have been charming.<br /><br />The plot is pretty straightforward (girl finds evidence that her stepfather is trying to kill her), the pace is adequate, the pages turn themselves with relative ease, and Hepinstall keeps us interested enough; all this would make for an average mystery/thriller in most circumstances, but Hepinstall pulls herself one step above by creating characters more memorable than most. The family from The Hills Have Eyes adopted a few characters from Steve Aylett's Bigot Hall (with a dash of Stewart Home's _Come Before Christ and Murder Love_ for good measure)* and stopped by Twin Peaks on their way to Kathy Hepinstall's pen. Among the menagerie to be found within these pages are a brain-damaged dog who spends his days carrying a live toad around in his mouth, a pair of five-year-old twins who are both destined for the Serial Killer Hall of Fame, a teenager confined in a mental ward whose hobby is escaping, and the aforementioned crazy preacher. Set beside them, our narrator, a precocious eleven-year-old with an encyclopedic knowledge of poisons, seems normal.<br /><br />This is wonderfully fun stuff. Quite highly recommended for those who don't mind their laughter with a deeply disturbing tinge to it.	2001-09-28

Pan Pantziarka, House of Pain (Velvet/Creation, 1997)<br /><br />availability: amazon.<br /><br />The publisher's blurb on the back calls House of Pain<br />&quot;scorched earth erotica,&quot; and a more accurate<br />definition would be somewhat hard to come by. The book<br />gives us a nameless narrator (by design, of course,<br />cf. &quot;Fight Club&quot;) who is kidnapped-- perhaps-- and<br />subjected to various humiliations, etc., which she may<br />or may not enjoy, depending on her mood. As is usual<br />with such things, the degradation builds until it hits<br />a high (low?) at the climax of the book, where the<br />narrator faces the usual question: how badly do I want<br />to keep my identity?<br /><br />The earlier comparison to Fight Club is more warranted<br />than it may seem at first blush. Pantziarka's writing<br />style matches nicely with what bits of Palahniuk I've<br />been exposed to, and the dark, oppressive atmosphere<br />in House of Pain is certainly a fit with Fincher's<br />directorial oeuvre (though I have a hard, if amusing,<br />time imagining Fincher trying to direct this).<br />Palahniuk works in violence, Pantziarka in sex, and<br />both explore the paradoxical discovery and loss of<br />self in breaking successive taboos therein.

But just in case you need a quick refresher course on how Washington is helping the abusers do their thing and giving the rest of us the middle finger, Howard's book stands as a fine testimony to what doesn't work, why it doesn't work, and the bleedingly simple solution to the whole stupid mess.<br />In three long, painful chapters, Howard takes critical looks at the Congressional love of process and how that love has led us to the conclusion that process is more important than result. Looked at as a simple sentence, it's a pretty absurd belief, isn't it? Look around. Process rules. Howard points out, in multiple places, two of the recent high-profile projects that circumvented process (the rebuilding of the freeways after the California Earthquake of 1992, and the refurbshing of a major new York bridge in time for its centennial ceremony), and compares and contrasts them to numerous examples of process in action, highlighting the idiocy of process while taking a hard look at the overly liberal viewpoints that spawn it. There won't be too many people who like Howard's easy and obvious solution-- if too many laws are the problem, then get rid of as many of them as necessary to fix it. But logic leads us back to that conclusion time and again.<br />As important a book, and as deserving of a place on the shelf reserved for sacred writings, as Stanton Peele's &lt;i>The Diseasing of America&lt;/i>. **** 1/2	2001-09-17

While it's as<br />incorrect to call Night complete fiction as it would<br />be to hang that tag on, say, Bukowski's novel<br />_Hollywood_, there's still an air of duplicity about<br />it. Exaggerating and playing up the details of the<br />production of a Hollywood film can be seen as amusing;<br />exaggerating and playing up the details of Auschwitz<br />is probably best left to Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.<br />Wiesel himself admitted the book contains fictional<br />content decades ago, yet it's still marketed-- and,<br />more depressingly, assigned to high school readers--<br />as straight autobiography. We're raising a generation<br />who still believe the holocaust is called the<br />holocaust because the Nazis lined up Jews in front of<br />flaming trenches and pushed them in alive.<br /><br />That said, I finally got over my distaste for Wiesel<br />himself and cracked the cover on this. As a novel,<br />there's certainly much to be said for it. It could be<br />argued that Wiesel's style here is the basis for much<br />of what's come to be known as extreme fiction<br />(splatterpunk, etc.)-- Wiesel wouldn't allow himself<br />to write about the holocaust for ten years after its<br />end, and that time allowed him to adopt a detached,<br />almost journalist-style air. Detachment, as we all<br />know, is a much better way of getting horror across<br />than high emotion. The book is quick and coherent, and<br />Wiesel writes with an easy lucidity. The book is<br />simple and easy to follow without the feeling that the<br />author is ever talking down to his audience, which is<br />definitely a point on the positive side. In fact, the<br />only negative I can come up with about the text itself<br />isn't really a negative at all-- there's another<br />description of the forced march that takes up the last<br />third of _Night_ in Miklos Nyiszli's book _Auschwitz_,<br />and Nyiszli goes into a bit more detail, which allows<br />the reader to get a more personal view of the event.<br />However, that's not to take anything away from<br />Wiesel's account.<br /><br />Certainly worth reading, but remember-- it IS a novel.<br />** 1/2other<BR>description of the forced march that takes up the last<BR>third of _Night_ in Miklos Nyiszli's book _Auschwitz_,<BR>and Nyiszli goes into a bit more detail, which allows<BR>the reader to get a more personal view of the event.<BR>However, that's not to take anything away from<BR>Wiesel's account.<br /><br />Certainly worth reading, but remember-- it IS a novel.<BR>** 1/2	2001-09-17

It's really<br />a book for prospective owners-- what to expect when<br />your mare's expecting, as it were. Glenn keeps things<br />light and raises a chuckle now and again, and the book<br />is engagingly illustrated (this may be guilt by<br />association more than anything, but the illustrations<br />reminded me quite a bit of those in the book Great<br />Racing Disasters, which has the same tone to it). If<br />it suffers, it does so by inconsistency of tone-- the<br />humor pops up now and again, but we're never really<br />signalled as to when it's time to get serious-- and<br />also in the book's brevity. At just over a hundred<br />pages, Glenn barely touches on much of the day-to-day<br />aspect of stud farm life and work. That's not<br />necessarily a bad thing, as going into too much detail<br />would quickly bog down the average reader, and Glenn<br />chose (wisely, one thinks) to err on the side of<br />caution here. I'd like to see what she'd do with a<br />kind of companion volume, more along the lines of<br />anecdotes from farm life-- the little things, both<br />amusing and not, that shed light on the completely<br />irrational love that makes us humans spend our lives<br />thinking about, breeding, and racing Thoroughbred<br />horses. 2 1/2 stars	2001-09-17

This time, Walters uses<br />the convention to comment on the racism in the British<br />justice system and how it's changed over the past<br />twenty years.<br /><br />There are some inconsistencies in detail, which are<br />usually a killer in a mystery novel, but Walters is a<br />good enough writer that it doesn't matter (and<br />thankfully those particular details end up not coming<br />back to haunt). Not as good as The Ice House or The<br />Breaker, but still a very good read. ***	2001-09-17

The best of them grab you by the throat and pull you along. You give up eating and sleeping to get through them in one sitting. The worst of them can be encapsulized in a page and a half, you've figured out who the killer is in three sentences, and you can safely consign them to the fire without enduring the rest of the writing therein. The third type sits between the two. It's well-written enough, and fine while you're reading it, but you don't feel that compulsion to continue when something else beckons; you don't resent the phone ringing when you hear it. These are the good mysteries (as opposed to the great ones). Robert Goddard writes good mysteries. This is his eighth, the story of how a man on a hike's chance encounter with a beautiful woman gets him (and some members of his family) tangled up in her family's odd twists and turns. It's well plotted, moves along at a steady if not brisk pace, and there are enough satisfying twists and turns to keep the reader occupied. But it doesn't beg to be picked up every time it's put down. Perhaps the problem lies in Goddard's writing style, which is a bit on the thick side; perhaps it's just his characters, who always seem to be teetering on the brink of two-dimensionality without ever actually getting there (that, of course, is a charge that can be laid against many mysteries, including some of the best; Spillane's female characters, e.g., had all the depth of a lasagna noodle). Or perhaps, Borrowed Time just doesn't read as fast as some of its contemporaries. It's certainly not a bad novel, and mystery fans who have grown tired of reading the same authors over and over again might do well to refresh themselves with a dip in Goddard's pool. Just don't be expecting another Lehane, Parker, or Highsmith. ** 1/2	2001-07-19

Happy Endings, written before Scoppetone became a mystery vamp of the highest order, is a simple, if somewhat twisted, coming of age tale about high-school romance and all the pain and suffering it entails.<br /><br />Jaret and Peggy are stuck in the lazy summer before college, in the middle of a romance that's a badly-kept secret from Jaret's mother and Peggy's father (Peggy's father is a widower; Jaret's father is just plain clueless about most everything) and a well-kept secret from the rest of their somewhat conservative town. Well, for a while. Things get nasty when a local boy finds out about the romance and decides that Jaret needs some conversion to heterosexuality.<br /><br />Scoppetone's a fine writer, for the most part, and the emotions at play throughout the book are clear and well-done. Most of the book's characters are complex, solid, and far from annoying. The one exception is Peggy, who constantly uses the word &quot;gazinga&quot; for... well, everything (think back to the Smurfs and their way of speaking). It gets annoying, and it gets there quickly.

It's something poets do quite often, but without the kind of structure and formality they were setting out. The result, after two years of correspondence, was the book Segues.<br /><br />It's a neat little package, and you can pick it up assuming that what's inside is going to be good writing; both poets have a solid track record of excellent work. But what's most interesting here is a chance to look at the way poems come to form, to look at an image Bell puts in as an aside that becomes the basis of a Stafford poem, and the tangents that poem sends Bell off on, etc. The fact that the poetry is quite good seems to be something of a sidelight, given that. ***	2001-07-19

(Please control the urge to read while driving.) By now, we should all be familiar with White's cast of characters (Remote Control is the fourth Alan Gregory, psychiatrist-turned-don't-wanna-be-detective, novel) and his method of dropping loads of bricks on us when we're not looking, and slipping the clues in while we're still rubbing our head and cursing the building contractors. This time around, White gives us a self-absorbed technowhiz entrepreneur, a law-student intern with a recently-dead Senator father who falls head over heels for him, his abrasive partner, and a parallel thread running through the novel at the end of everything, where Alan's wife Lauren is being interrogated for the shooting of an unidentified man. Problem is, no one, including Lauren, is sure she actually shot the guy.<br /><br />Yes, it all comes together perfectly (think Memento, except that both threads are moving forward-- one just moves more slowly than the other). White is one of those guys who writes good, clean, fun mysteries that are on the level of the big guns, but never gets the press they do.

Of particular interest is a series of letters published in a London newspaper in the mid-fifties in which three critics snipe at one another's interpretations of the poem. It's beautiful stuff. One wonders if literary critics are ever so on fire about anything else.<br /><br />In the end, the book does what it's supposed to do; it acquaints its readers with the differing schools of thought on Hopkins' poem, and in doing so may illuminate the reader to ideas within the poem he had not previously seen. A good resource for Hopkins scholars. ***	2001-07-10

Warmer than Bukowski, more detached than Faulkner, closer to the point than Sherwood Anderson ever got, the novels pumped out thirty years later by such authors as Ellis and McInerney could have been tarred by the same brush, though Chester mixed a kind of hard-boiled romance with his stark realism. And yet, as Edward Field reminds us in his introduction to the book's nonfiction appendix, Chester was almost totally forgotten by the time of his death in 1971, at the age of forty-three. The fact that an obscure, unknown, then-out-of-print writer could have still influenced a whole (albeit a bad) genre should tell us something: specifically, that Chester is possibly the most neglected important American writer of the twentieth century.<br /><br />It seems to me that Chester became a forgotten writer as the stars of contemporaries such as Bukowski and Ferlinghetti were rising because Chester went the opposite way of such writers. What Buk et al. distilled from Faulkner was the no-nonsense prose, the ability to tell a tale in the elevated prose that marks poetry while keeping the work as readable as possible. This made Buk et al.'s work more accessible to the public, and thus it was ripe for mainstream consumption. Chester, on the other hand, wrote prose that's as close to poetry as one is ever likely to find; rather than work on the accessibility factor, Chester shuned the idea and mined the simple power of words, leaving them elevated, but unpolished. As such, Chester's stories often demand to be read at leisure, in small doses, and more often than not the writing is thick, many-layered, difficult; yet the reward is there. Chester was a profoundly good writer, and every story in this collection is a gem.<br /><br />The second section of the book, comprising about seventy pages, is a series of reflections on Chester by those close to him during his descent into the madness that ultimately, though indirectly, caused his death. Such authors as Cynthia Ozick, Dennis Selby, Ira Cohen, and Robert Friend recount anything from one-page snatches of image to long essays on Chester's life. There's a lot of good material here (and it reinforces the autobiographical nature of Chester's work), but it seems to me that Chster's material could have stood on its own, and the biographical materil would have made for a good anthology-style biography of Chester.<br /><br />The previously-mentioned descent is all too obvious in Chester's work. Early material is tight, ominous, less obtuse than the later work, and with more attentino paid to craft. &quot;As I Was Going Up the Stair&quot; is a horror story in the grand old tradition, but with a sense of newness about it that still rings fresh today; like the best of today's authors, Chester gives us not ghosts and ghouls, but the horrors of absence, of separation. This is stuff that should be in Norton Anthologies, without a doubt. In contrast, the fifty pages that have survived from Chester's final manuscript, &quot;The Foot,&quot; show the contrast between the early, almost surreal prose of Chester's early career and the loose, ultra-realistic, somewhat rambling feel of later pages. I do agree with Robert Friend (despite how that last sentence sounds) that &quot;The Foot&quot; may well be the best thing Chester ever wrote; it's a perfect study in how to write a romance novel without a single drop of excess emotion. It is as beautiful, and as stark, as the cinematography in the film version of (Chester contemporary) Paul Bowles' landmark novel _The Sheltering Sky_. It seems that the landscape of Bowles' and Chester's Tunisia-- both were part of the early-sixties expatriate community in western Africa-- may have influenced Chester's writing more than even he knew.<br /><br />This is very, very strong work, a piece of literary history America is in danger of losing, to its great detriment. Chester should be required reading for any short story writer. ****ery strong work, a piece of literary history America is in danger of losing, to its great detriment.

Barbara Michaels, The Dancing Floor (Harper, 1997)<br /><br />Well, it had to happen sooner or later: Barbara Michaels is winding down. After writing a surprisingly large number of witty, original gothic romances, Michaels is starting to get-- gasp-- predictable.<br /><br />Our (spunky, not overly attractive, pits in the self-esteem department) heroine, fulfilling plans she made with her recently-deceased father, has traveled to Britain to tour the great gardens therein. At one, she is staunchly rebuffed and refused entrance, but she gains entrance anyway. Surprisingly, the lord of the crumbling demesne is overjoyed to see her, and invites her to stay in his home for as long as necessary. He (older cad, dashingly handsome, filthy rich) has both a son (standoffish, far more interested in his research than in the goings-on around him, needlessly harsh with his words when forced to interact) and a servant (who looks and acts something like Pan) who are both around heroine's age. Add in some seemingly-supernatural goings-on and... hmm. Bet you can't predict how THAT one's going to turn out.<br /><br />Still, Michaels is Michaels. The plot moves along at a fine clip, the characetrs have just enough depth to make her work stand out from the pack, and everything is quite satisfactorily put to rest at the end of the book. It's pure escapism of the most guilty kind. Good for turning one's brain off.

Dennis Lehane, Mystic River (Morrow, 2000)<br /><br />Lehane is still an &quot;under the radar&quot; writer, to an extent, but his reputation grows with each novel. Mystic River, his fifth, should help his rep along just fine.<br /><br />It's the story of three kids, later grown-ups. Ostensibly it's about the abduction of one of them and how the effects of that abduction have repercussions later on in their lives. But as with all the best mystery novels (and it's really something of a stretch to classify this as a mystery, actually), it's about a whole lot more than that-- class consciousness in the irish sections of Boston, the ways in which different people deal with traumatic situations, family connections, that sort of thing.<br /><br />If you're a diehard mystery fan, don't let my parenthetical in the last paragraph throw you off. There _is_ a mystery here (one of our boys, a homicide investigator, is tapped to solve the disappearance of the daughter of another of our boys, now a reputed crimelord, and our third boy is the prime suspect), though it takes a backseat to Lehane's exploration of his three main characters and the ways in which they interact with the world around them. It's different enough from Lehane's previous work that you should go in without expectations, but it's a satisfying read nonetheless. ****	2001-07-09

Philip Pullman, The Golden Compass (Knopf, 1995)<br /><br />There's a (relatively) new series of so-called children's novels that's been knocking adults off their feet. It's won just about every kidlit award there is to be won, and has appeared on best-of lists around the globe. Despite being aimed at children, it's the kind of thing that gets better as the reader gets older; there's far more here than meets the eye and, like all great children's novels, reading them from an adult perspective will show you far more than you'll grasp as a kid.<br /><br />But enough about Harry Potter.<br /><br />At least, that's the hype that's been surrounding the HP books since HP and the Philosopher's Stone was published. Maybe I was just responding to the hype, but when I read it, I found it amusing enough, but wondered why J. K. Rowling was being hailed as the best thing since sliced bread. I have to admit, when words about Philip Pullman crossed my path, I approached with some trepidation, expecting another Potteresque expression of wonderment at how the marketing community impresses little minds.<br /><br />How wrong I was. Philip Pullman's series has garnered only a fraction of the mainstream hullaballoo as has the little wizardlings and their school, but these three novels, collectively known as His Dark Materials (from a line in _Paradise Lost_), could easily fill the Shaq-sized sneakers Potter has garnered, and then some. The series starts off with The Golden Compass,<br />which transcends the usual fantasy-series first-book blues (setup, setup, setup-- action's coming later, wot?) by throwing us into the thick of things from the get-go. Our heroine, Lyra Belacqua, has spent a carefree childhood growing up amongst (and annoying) the staff and scholars of Jordan College, a branch of Oxford dedicated to experimental theology one will only find in a parallel universe. In this particular parallel universe, every human being is equipped with a personal daemon (roughly equivalent to a guardian animal spirit, but with a lot more close personal contact). The antics begin when Lyra and her daemon go into one of those places where they're not supposed to be, hear things they're not supposed to hear, and (considering the whole thing a lark) decide to act on what they find. While there's obviously a good amount of setup therein, Pullman masks a good deal of it by weaving it into the adventures of the first book. The pace never slackens-- in fact, in some places, Pullman's ability to quicken the pace seems almost supernatural. By the time you're finished, Pullman has created an utterly believable parallel universe, generally sympathetic characters (with the exception of Lyra herself, who's a brat from beginning to end), and most importantly (for the author, anyway), an intense desire to continue on to book 2. *****nt to a guardian animal spirit, but with a lot more close personal contact).

The most amazing thing about The Amber Spyglass-- since by now series readers should be perfectly familiar with the setup/revelation dynamic (and again, there are many things Pullman set up in the earlier books that are obvious, but their fuction seems to be to conceal the less obvious setups, equally brilliant in this book as the last)-- is that by the last hundred pages in this novel, the reader has seen any number of ways in which Pullman could wimp out and take the easy road with his characters. Happy endings all around, the world is saved, blah blah blah. Nope. Pullman allows his characters to think that happy endings are in the offing before hitting them with the painful truth that, hey, this is real life. And after 1,200 pages of Pullman's many parallel universes, it might as well BE real life.<br /><br />I was pained to see this series end. Probably the finest series of fantasy novels I've read since first being introduced to Michael Moorcock's Elric novels back in high school.

Pullman continues the His Dark Materials trilogy by opening in our own world, and shifting back and forth during this shortest of the three novels, weaving two parallel stories. The first concerns Will, a boy from the Oxford of our universe, whose sick mother has been pursued by some rather nasty men for a good five years. (Her sickness is never really spelled out, but it sounds quite a bit, from this layman's perspective, like chronic paranoid schizophrenia.) Will stumbles onto a hole between universes while fleeing said nasty men, and when he pops through, he runs into Lyra. The second story involves some of the other characters in The Golden Compass, who are off looking for a chap who's supposedly dead, but is supposed to be playing an important part in the events in which they're all caught up.<br /><br />Once again, Pullman manages to avoid most of the conventinos and pitfalls of the normal fantasy series (ever notice how in trilogies the middle novel drags a bit?). Oddly, he does it by doing what most fantasy series do in book one: setup. It becomes obvious that Iorek and Lee seeking out the mysterious and supposedly dead Dr. Grumman is setup, and if you've read more than three mystery novels in your life, you know what Dr. Grumman's role in it all is by a hundred pages into this book, but it's still fun to watch. Pullman also subverts the genre stereotypes by revealing some of the more concealed setups early on in the book. (When Pullman maps Dust over into our world, you realize just how well you've been played, and the true genius of this series starts to come out...) By the time you've gotten through this installment, you should be onto Pullman's style well enough to see what he's setting up for book three, but by this time, that's less an issue than just watching a master at plotting a work this large doing his thing. And trust me, there are still a few surprises left. *****	2001-07-09

Normally, this is a recipe for disaster. However, Carson's ear is finely-tuned enough that what comes out more often than not does resemble both rural dialect and poetry. And that in itself is more than enough reason to consider this a noteworthy book. But every once in a while, the stories she tells are the kind that tug at the heart without the naked appeal of obvious emotional manipulation (though there's certainly some of that here, too; if you go into this not expecting to find the cliched \\"boy, I wish people wouldn't treat East Tennessee folk like hicks,\\" you're going to be disappointed-- but Carson does amnage to keep it to a minimum). A good, solid volume that's worth a quick read. ***	2001-07-09

Marilee Strong, A Bright Red Scream: Self-Mutilation and the Language of Pain (Penguin, 1998)<br /><br />It amazes me how psychologists can take a series of seemingly unrelated symptoms, come up with a hypothesis, and be dead-on right. For the past twenty years, they've been doing just that with the small, but increasing, segment of the populace who injure themselves through bloodletting, beating their heads against walls, breaking bones, and other such behaviors. Strong, a journalist, boils all the research down and combines it with &quot;thousands&quot; (as she says in the preface) of interviews with the types of people profiled in the research. The end result is a powerful book about childhood trauma and its relation to self-destructive behavior. A very important piece of work that will go unread, or not understood, by those who most need it-- neglectful and abusive parents. ****	2001-06-28

What pace you get depends more on the country of origin than the type of book. Pearlhanger, the ninth Lovejoy mystery, tries its best to be a hardboiled detective story in the Robert Parker vein (with Lovejoy an antiques dealer instead of a literate chef), but it's foiled by Gash's inveterate Englishness. English mysteries always start out leisurely and then pick up. Not the best way for a hardboiled detective story to start off.<br /><br />Still, once you're past the slow bits, like most English mysteries, Pearlhanger gets good. The irascible, pejudiced, inveterately Lovejoy and his band of merry misfits are on the trail of a disappeared antiques dealer who doesn't seem to be doing much antique dealing. Once they reach the end of the trail, things pick up and plot twists abound. Unfortunately, reaching the trail takes half the book and a bunch of minor characters (all of whom, you hope, will pop up again later, but they never do except in conversation). The whole thing does come to a satisfactory conclusion, and with a bit faster pacing at first and a little more completeness with minor characters, it would be excellent. As is stands, it's readable enough. ** 1/2	2001-06-28

Actually, it's less a novel than a colelction of vignettes about the (non-fictional) coal-mining ghost town of Crum, WV, and the author's (presumably fictional) experiences growing up. After a long and tedious chapter of setup, Maynard takes off. He wears his Jean Shepherd influence on his sleeve a bit much in places, but there are far worse authors in this vein by whom to be influenced. As such, Crum tends to read like In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash with a bubbling cauldron of Freudian influence and a little A Man Called Horse for good measure. The whole thing is front-to-back delicious. *** 1/2	2001-06-28

Paul Wilson, Legacies (Tor, 1998)<br /><br />Wilson brings back one of his hardcore fans' favorite characters, Repairman Jack, and weaves three of Jack's jobs into a tightly-wound tale of family manipulation and, as always, saving the world one step at a time.<br /><br />This time, Jack is employed by longtime on-again-off-again girlfriend Gia to recover a roomful of toys stolen from a children's AIDS crisis center, which leads him into the employ of the head of the center. She just inherited a house, and she wants Jack to burn it down. Jack's curiosity gets the best of him, and he starts wondering why. There the fun begins.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Wilson's work, you're getting what you've come to expect. Easy reading, a pace that wouldn't be out of place in a formula 1 racecar, likable characters (even the bad guys), and a dose of the supernatural, albeit a smaller one than in most of Wilson's work. If you haven't discovered the joys of F. Paul yet, start back at the beginning of our first encounter with Jack, the Nightworld books (The Keep, The Tomb, The Touch, Reborn, Reprisal, and Nightworld) to get up to speed.

The action takes place in two rooms, with two people, and runs about an hour and a half. The two characters, a late-thirties daughter and her mother, start with the idea that the daughter is planning on committing suicide later that night, and the resulting tension between them allows both an examination of the more stable, understandable reasons behind the desie to end one's life and the soul-baring necessary in any familial relationship (and present in only a few).****	2001-06-28

She's published three more since then (as of this writing), and still hasn't even achieved the fame of such unknowns outside the poetry world as Jorie Graham and Gjertrud Schackenberg, both recent winners of major (well, for poetry) prizes. This points to something being wrong with the universe, as Shore's work can easily hold a candle to the upper echelons of that being written by the talented today.<br /><br />Shore's work is deep, reflective, but still more accessible than most poets who write in the &quot;academic&quot; style; these are poems that are about the great truths, all right, but there's an easier-to-grok level above that deals in the day-to-day things of our existence, and the one doesn't have to be grasped to make sense of the other.<br /><br />Because we landed on the moon, all Americans<br /> can walk a little taller.<br /><br />Planting our carpet roll of flags,<br /> one for each state in the Union!<br /> I feel so proud of my own Garden State<br /> with vegetables stitched onto the blue field<br /> of sky instead of stars.<br /> (from &quot;An Astronaut's Journal&quot;)<br /><br />If you could smirk at that bit, you should be fine with the whole book.

Richard Hugo, The Lady in Kicking Horse Reservoir<br /><br />Two decades after Hugo's early death, he's finally starting to get the recognition he deserves as one of the twentieth century's masters of poetry. His output was sparse, starting relatively late in his life and covering less than a half-dozen books of poetry, along with a few other prose books. But what little there was was some of the best American poetry ever written.<br /><br />Hugo writes with a rhythm and style that compares best to novelist Cormac McCarthy; it's a little difficult getting over the first hump, but once you've settled into his diction, everything inside is magic.<br /><br />I got three bulls and a native cutthroat, lover.<br /> I'm phoning from the bar in Victor.<br /> One drunk's fading fast.

Pack the food....<br /> (from &quot;Phoning from Sweathouse Creek&quot;)<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, two of which focus on one of Hugo's trips to Europe, and two on Montana. There is a strong sense of place in this work, a connection to the culture, however long-dead, of what Hugo is writing about. It's all excellent, every last line.

It's hard to tell what it is that would have changed it from what it is to what it could have been; a sharper editor, a writer of slightly different temperament, perhaps a scene that should have ben set differently or a point that should have been made more, or less, subtly. One way or the other, it's still not a bad book, and one worth killing a few hours with.<br /><br />The book centers on Clive Swinburne, a seeming descendent of the devil of Victorian poetry who is quite common in everything; by coincidence, he arrives at Malthus, a prep school on the southern coast of England, with two other boys, both of whom are far more accomplished and popular than he. The three immediately meet the new music teacher, Dr. Vitaly, and from the outset there's a battle for the friendship of the other two new students between their peer and the music teacher. Over time, Clive, swayed by Vitaly's origins and under the influence of World War II-bred xenophobia, becomes convinced that Vitaly is a vampire, and starts to see the test of wills as a crusade to save the lives of his friends.<br /><br />Stewart writes with a hand that's never too heavy, refreshing in a book so obviously about the dangers of hating those who are different than you. But, as I said, there's something, however minor, that seems missing from this otherwise fine book. I've no idea what, though. ** 1/2	2001-06-11

Michael Casey, Obscenities (Yale, 1972)<br /><br />Casey, the 1972 winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets award (judged and introduced by Stanley Kunitz) offers up what Kunitz believes is the first artistic comment on the Vietnam War. Solely on that merit, the book demands close scrutiny. Casey reads like a kind of odd cross between Mark Twain and T. S. Eliot, in that his spare lines encompass the many dialects across which he ran during his time in-country. Eventually, though, the mind and the ear both tire of the unending stream of dialect and wish for one of the very few poems here (I recall two) in which Casey reverts to non-dialect-spelling English and flashes the ability to put words together that so obviously impressed Kunitz:<br /><br />Her back is arched<br /> Like something's under it<br /> That's why I thought<br /> It was booby-trapped<br /> But it's not<br /> It just must have been<br /> Over this rock here<br /> And somebody moved it...<br /><br />Casey, like most of the Yale Series, definitely had some raw talent, and it would have been interesting to see what became of him. Unfortunately, also like many of the Yale Series, it looks as if Casey may never have published another book. ** 1/2	2001-06-11

Dugan is a mix of concrete and language, without ever actually getting into the typological gymnastics of either; dada without slipping into nonsense.

Dugan makes getting lost into an art form, but allows it little enough space that it's not a big deal. A good number of poets past and present could take a tip about the latter half of that statement. A book full of poems like this would have made it into the year's top 15 without a problem; as it stands, there's enough brilliance here that I'm going to be looking for Dugan's other three books published before this one (bet you can guess their titles) to see if there's one that's all pearls and no swine. ** 1/2	2001-06-11

Sawyer, Mathematician's Delight (Penguin, 1943)<br /><br />I approached this with some trepidation, as when I picked it up recently, I discovered a makeshift bookmark (that had a date on it-- July of 1994) stuck at the beginning of chapter four. Had I started it and just forgotten, or had I given up thanks to the author's style?<br /><br />The former, thankfully. While Sawyer may well have been a fine teacher-- and this book does present that side of him a number of times-- his prose is often dry as week-old bread. If you can get past the insomnia factor, however, his methods of explaining math were even able to help me (who failed calculus 101 twice) understand the uses of integrals and derivatives. Rather than trying to explain mathematics in a conventional manner, Sawyer attacks the problem for those of us who never grasped these things in class by taking what was then (and still is, to an extent) a revolutionary approach to explaining maths: tell the student what the problems will be used for, and offer concrete examples, BEFORE explaining the mechanics of the thing. It's beautiful. Too bad more math teachers haven't read it. They probably couldn't get past the prose. ***	2001-06-05

Eliade's \\"few comments\\" (p. 511) and fifty plus pages of bibliography, if he is to be believed, are a quick overview on shamanism as it has been practiced for the past two and a half millenia, covering six of the seven continents and thousands of years.<br /><br />Shamanism is a survey, not a new work; Eliade, here, only attempts to distill what he and others have written in the past, to give the prospective student or researcher an idea of where to begin on a specific topic. As such, the book may not be meant to be read all the way through. Taken as a whole, however, it's an interesting and thought-provoking document about not only shamaism, but many deeper issues; the migration of man over two and a half thousand years, cultural \\"degeneration\\" (Eliade's word), the Judeo-Christian tradition and its heavy borrowing from religions that pre-dated it, etc. While Eliade's writing is often thick, it's certainly understandable by the layman, as always (one of the things which made Eliade a consistently popular and well-read anthropologist). It requires a leisurely pace and a good deal of reflection, but is ultimately worth the time (in my case, five and a half months) it takes to finish.	2001-06-05

Chevalier took one of Vermeer's best-known and most enigmatic paintings and built a story around it (there are a series of these novels; Joyce Carol Oates' I Lock My Door Upon Myself is the only other one I've read, and it is similarly excellent). Griet, a sixteen-year-old from the Protestant side of the tracks, becomes the maidservant of the Vermeers after a kiln accident forces her father out of a job, and the story alternately skips between the variouis tensions within the Vermeer household and Griet's courting by a somewhat ham-handed, if well-meaning, butcher. It's subject matter that could have (and has) been screwed up in too many ways to imagine, but Chevalier pulls it off by keeping the prose spare and letting the silences speak most of the necessary lines. ****	2001-06-05

One thinks that perhaps the blurb writer has been living in a cave for fifty years; Huysmans' black mass is about as scandalous today as a Jennifer Lopez dress. Even Ernest Borgnine got more sacreligious in The Devil's Rain. Sheesh.<br /><br />The story (what there is of it) revolves around a young French writer named Durtal and his best friend, Des Hermies. Durtal is working on a sensationalized biography of Gilles de Rais, Joan of Arc's main lieutenant who later inspired the Bluebeard legend (or so common wisdom has it; Durtal counters that argument at one point in the book). Des Hermies suggests that Durtal's research might go better if he uncovered various occult sciences still extant in fin-de-siecle Paris, and the two of them, aided unwittingly by a monastic bell-ringer named Carhaix and an ancient astrologer named Gevingey, set out to do so. They are also helped along by Durtal's rather odd relationship with a fan (anonymous in her first letters to him in the book, and so not revealed here) who has indirect connections with some practicing Satanists in the Catholic church (hmm, a bit of anti-Catholic bias in Paris in the 1890s? Who'd'athunk?).<br /><br />All of it could have made for a fine adventure story, the kind of thing A. Merritt and G. A. Henty were writing a few years after this; unfortunately, Huysmans turns it into endless conversations. A few fast-moving scenes where Durtal is imagining pieces of Rais' life as he's writing save the book from utter despair, but ultimately, the fact that La-Bas is Huysmans' best-known novel these days is a disservice to the man; other books would be a better starting point for him (especially Against the Grain). **save the book from utter despair, but ultimately, the fact that La-Bas is Huysmans' best-known novel these days is a disservice to the man; other books would be a better starting point for him (especially Against the Grain). **	2001-06-05

Schnabel did an excellent job with the book; while his interpretation of the text was loose in places, he managed to capture in images the style of Arenas' writing.<br /><br />In other words, if you saw the movie before reading the book, you're going to be somewhat surprised. Some of Schnabel's more memorable scenes are mentioned in passing (if at all) in the book, and one of the film's central sequences, the balloon escape, gets one sentence. Where Arenas and Schnabel intersect is in the lushness, the ability to find celebration and remarkable beauty inside the ugliness of the Castro regime (and, for a few years' worth, the Batista regime before it).<br /><br />Arenas' memoir is also likely to shock more than a few in its sexual explicitness (another aspect Schnabel rather shied away from, which I found a tad surprising while reading the book), but so be it. There is nothing gratuitous about either Arenas' promiscuity or his literary descriptions of it; it's no different than using the language of excess to describe the beastliness of a life that involves hand-to-mouth poverty and political censure. And throughout, more than anything (and perhaps this is what makes the book so powerful), Before Night Falls is a celebration, both of Arenas' life and the lives of many other Cuban writers persecuted as dissidents in the latter half of the twentieth century. **** 1/2	2001-05-16

Homes, The End of Alice (Scribner's, 1996)<br /><br />It's not often one finds a book about pedophilia with &#34;The National Bestseller&#34; across the top of its cover. I was intrigued. By the end, I was disgusted (and the pedophilia angle was actually the least disgusting of the novel's many perversities), horrified, repelled, and completely in love with A. M. Homes.<br /><br />The book centers around a narrator (nameless), an inmate in a facility for the criminally insane, and his correspondent, a nineteen-year-old female home on summer break from college. Both are pedophiles, and the two use one another as sounding boards for various ideas, and to discuss their exploits. We are witness to the girl's seduction of Matt, a neighborhood boy of twelve. We spy on our narrator's life in the hospital and his recollections of his childhood (ultimately, we are also given access to his memories of the crime that got him jailed-- the most powerful scenes in an already intense journey). Throughout, we view through their eyes the foibles of humanity, some of which make pedophilia look like a walk in the park, and yet none of it is implausible, even if the stomach does slow flips now and again.<br /><br />Homes forces her readers to identify closely with her bizarre duo. Our narrator comes right out and tells us, about two-thirds of the way through, we wouldn't have read as far as we had unless we identified with him and his proclivities. That's why I can't believe this fantastic novel was ever a national bestseller-- not that we are not a nation of pedophiles (the enduring image of the Coppertone girl and her mischevious Scottie dog has been evidence of that for thirty years now), but that enough of us are willing to admit it. ****	2001-05-16

After a while, it hit me that I hadn't laughed out loud this many times per page at any book in quite a while, so I dropped the offense.<br /><br />Imagine In God We Trust - All Others Pay Cash (the book that inspired the classic film A Christmas Story) jacked up on PCP and going on a crime spree and you have Bigot Hall, Steve Aylett's impressionist biography of hands down the most interesting family in all of literature. The narrator, a nameless adolescent called &quot;laughing boy&quot; by friends and family alike, turns his jaundiced eye upon most every family member and lodger at the family's country estate, a living (or at the very least highly unstable, from a dimensional perspective) mansion known as Bigot Hall. Amidst the witty repartee (and this would make a good handbook for those who like to find stultifyingly obtuse .sig files) these rather twisted characters come to life quite nicely, to the point where one can almost believe some of the book's most outrageous moments. I won't spoil them for you, you'll have to read it yourself, but let's just say Aylett pulled off a pretty nice chunk of real estate in making the Verger's predicament seem not only plausible, but completely in line with the rest of the doings about him.<br /><br />As with all books of the &quot;selected glimpses of life&quot; genre, there's no plot here, so the book must rely on nothing but character development to succeed, and it does so quite nicely. It's also choke-on-your-manacles funny from beginning to end. ****	2001-04-23

Stephen King, Dreamcatcher (Scribner's, 2001)<br />I should have known better than to start a new Stephen King book at 11PM on a weeknight. Two and a half days later, exhausted, I put it down.<br />Dreamcatcher (whose working title was &quot;Cancer;&quot; according to King's afterword, his wife wouldn't let him release it with that title) is not, despite what you may have heard, a sequel to It (though traces of that book show up now and again). It's the story of five friends, both as they came of age and as they came together again to battle a nasty creature. Yeah, it does kind of sound like It, doesn't it? In fact, resonances of earlier King works can be found throughout this novel, not just through the calling to mind of old characters-- a long-ingrained King trick-- but through the book's style and plot.<br />In my usual mechanism of giving writers I like the benefit of the doubt, I think King's going through a transitional phase, and this was the book where he worked it out. It's still a relatively good book; after all, King was on a real tear before the accident, having just released two novels (Tom Gordon and Bag of Bones) and a short story (&quot;Blind Willie&quot;) thank rank among the best writing he's ever produced, and it stands to reason that some of the afterglow would carry over into the post-accident work. But if he continues on in this tradition, there should be a humdinger coming next, or perhaps two books down the road.<br />I say this because, though King's writing is still of the fast-and-easy-to-read genre (whatever else it may be, a King book is eminently readable), he seems to be getting more expansive. Two hundred pages into this six-hundred-plus page monster and King was still gearing up to let fly. It read fast, granted, but the steam was still building. Unfortunately, it never really blew its top, and it ended up riging a bit hollow because of that. That's why I think King's in the midst of a style shift, not the surface style of witty on-the-mark cultural references and the ability to fully draw a minor character in two sentences flat, but down in the heart of things. There was a shifting that started a few books back, not as glitzy as the shift between Barker's _The Damnation Game_ and _Weaveworld_, but a shift nonetheless, and it's now starting to affect the writing. Soon, it'll pull an Alien-style chest-burster, and something new will arise.<br />So I end up categorizing this book with Firestarter, Gerald's Game, and a few others-- a kind of workshop that found its way to the publisher. Of that particular category of Kingisms, though, this is by far the best to date, and I feel that it may presage the finest work King's ever done; history will tell, eventually. ***the-mark cultural references and the ability to fully draw a minor character in two sentences flat, but down in the heart of things.

I can't really put my finger on why, but there it is. The Flounder contains all the things I revere about Grass-- a strong sense of history, scurrlious sense of humor, strong characters put into wonderfully unrealistic situations. But this novel, Grass' weightiest (literally), never seems to come together in all the little ways that made similarly large tomes like The Tin Drum and Dog Years such wonderful reads.<br /><br />The Flounder is a massive creation myth, seen through the eyes of a continually-reincarnated man, his continually-reincarnated longtime companion (who is always a cook of some sort), and the Flounder himself, who serves as a kind of fairy-godfather figure. In modern times, a group of feminists discover that the Flounder has been the architect of the overthrow of matriarchal society and put him on trial; the narrator and the Flounder use the trial as a method to go back over history and show the development of patriarchy in Poland, and how it relates to the potato. Yes, I'm serious.<br /><br />The novel feels as if Grass had lost his sense of dynamic while writing it. The earlier long novels each keep the reader's interest with a series of climactic events, each leading up to the larger climax upon which the novel turns; The Flounder, on the other hand, continues on at the same rlatively leisurely pace in its survey of history. And that, ultimately, is its downfall; there's just too much of it without anything really going on, on a larger scale.<br /><br />Definitely a bad starting place for Grass; turn to the Danzig trilogy instead.

Cramer, who's authored a number of excellent handicapping tomes, spends a couple of hundred pages on the concept of value and how to achieve it. His greatest strength is his simple asserion, backed up with a number of examples, that there is no mechanical formula to be used; it's different for every race. He illustrates handicapping as art, rather than the handicapping-as-science approach used by many other books. Definitely a work that belongs in the bookshelf of every horseplayer, casual or serious. **** 1/2	2001-04-05

Lydia Millet, George Bush- Dark Prince of Love (Scribner's, 2000)<br /><br />The idea of anyone finding a president sexy-- at least, any president we've had since, oh, Teddy Roosevelt or so-- strikes the same kind of nerve with me as does the idea of having weird leechlike creatures infest peoples' bodies and turn them into mutant zombies (see? there's Night of the Creeps again!). The idea that someone could take such a feeling to the obsessive heights of the stalker is right up there with having dinner at Alf Packer's house. And that's exactly what Lydia Millet gives us in her second novel, George Bush, Dark Prince of Love. It's sick, it's twisted, and every once in a while it's extremely funny.<br /><br />There's always a rather nasty outsider's-perspective criticism (Millet comes originally from Toronto, though she now lives in Arizona) rumbling just beneath the surface, rather like the ground as her three-hundred-pound plus protagonist, an ex-con named Rosemary (we're never told her last name), goes by. Rosemary is a real peach, the kind of person you never want to be on the wrong side of-- after all, she may decide to wire your office with plastique. Through a rather odd coincidence, Rosemary finds herself feeling as if she has a spiritual connection with George Bush, and we see the four years of G.B.'s presidency through the decidedly jaundiced eyes of Rosemary as she alternately deals with her life as is and tries to get herself into positions where she might manage to usurp Barbara's place in the estimations of the man of her dreams.<br /><br />Thought the book weighs in at a rather slim 159 pages, it still feels like it goes a tad long. There are some sections about halfway through that bog down. But then, one could argue, that's exactly how Bush's presidency went. Amen. So I'm willing to give Ms. Millet the benefit of the doubt, at least enough to go searching for her first novel, Omnivores. Work this twisted deserves an audience. ** 1/2	2001-04-04

Oftentimes the question is unanswerable, as the quality of poetry which makes it poetry is undefinable enough without putting qualifiers on it. But sometimes greatness is achieved simply through the act of putting an old idea in a new way. This is often what makes Ira Sadoff one of the two or three finest poets working in America today.<br /><br />Sadoff's third book of poetry continued the tradition of slow, solid work that has defined his career. This is poetry that demands a leisurely reading, but leaves enough in the open to allow the reader ease of access; much of it is painful, most of it questions incessantly, all of it demands to be read:<br /><br />Incest<br /><br />Inbred. Inscribed. Interred. In my house,<br /> the doors locked, the lips<br /> stuck to each other (like glue, she said), languishing--<br /> each seduction is a slash,<br /> an utterance with body parts, a slang<br /> of neck submerged in whispers. What breast belongs to a mother<br /> exclusively? What speech does not imply<br /> withholding union, the little boy<br /> having sex with the past? I'm not stirred<br /> by strangers. Each taboo's a story<br /> ending, bones a dog buried in the yard,<br /> the neatly-pressed negligee set out on the bed.<br /> Someone drew the shades, the eyelids closed,<br /> her finger on his lips<br /> authored the hush. Kiss me goodbye,<br /> she said. Her flesh<br /> an entrance without exit. Shame's<br /> the world's. It's not myself<br /> I hate.<br /><br />What else can I possibly say?

When Lone Star opened, they reprinted the book with a number of revisions from Badone, as a kind of new-fan primer. Too bad they kept the gramatically painful title, but other than that, there's little that will steer you wrong here.<br /><br />If you've already read the basic handicapping texts, you're not going to find terribly much here you haven't read before, though Badone does put a few things into new perspectives. This book isn't aimed at the well-read horseplayer, however, but at the new patron. Badone lays his material out quickly and easily, but without the pedantry that mars a number of books for beginning handicappers. He's extremely easy to read, and his section on class changes is the easiest-to-understand I've ever read (not to mention one of the most solid; it's not Jim Quinn's _Class of the Field_, but for the beginning player, it's great stuff).

What seem, upon first reading, to be nothing more than frameworks or outlines take on more meat upon reflection. Hemingway lets the reader fill in the small details, guiding his imagination rather than manipulating it. This does mean that the onus is on the reader more than usual with this book; Hemingway's work is meant to be thought-provoking rather than escapist. If you can make it to the end of &quot;A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,&quot; the second story in the book, and reflect on it without feeling anything, then the book's probably not for you. Those who approach it with the proper mindset, however, will find it to be full of opportunities to plumb one's own imagination. ****	2001-03-28

The mistress lives with her spinster niece, whose age is never given (one assumes mid-forties, a few years older than the narrator), and the two are impoverished. Things go as planned until the narrator finds himself starting to like the niece a bit more than he bargained for.<br /><br />The novel runs a bit over a hundred pages, which makes it an excellent introduction to James' extremely dry wit; it's much lighter-weight than the ponderous tomes he's known for. The prose here has an agility which is absent from works such as The Bostonians or The Wings of the Dove, but still manages to convey emotion quite well with only a few words and a gesture. The novel's last pages are a triumph of minimal writing, and probably deserve closer scrutiny than the works of James' that are normally assinged in English classes around the globe.<br /><br />Oddly, the one major failing of this novel is that James abandons the minimalism every once in a while, and his characters go overboard with hysterical crying and the like so common to Victorian literature. In a book that's otherwise so controlled, these episodes-- never longer than a few sentences-- seem absurd more than anything; perfectly composed people suddenly collapse into tears as if shot with pepper spray, and then within the space of a paragraph are back to their cool, collected selves once again. These intrusions are minimal, and while they detract from the scenes in which they're placed, the novel overall is still a worthy one. If you've been turned off by James through exposure to one of those million-page drawing room comedies, you may want to give him another try with this. *** 1/2ill a worthy one.

Young and married in the early sixties, living mostly off David's father and rich young stepmother, they have been beguiled by that most insidious and destructive Christian aphorism, &quot;be fruitful and multiply.&quot; They want kids, oodles of kids, a plethora of kids, a monstrous family. And they get it, in more ways than one, with the birth of Ben, the fifth child of the title.<br /><br />If you know Lessing, you probably already have an idea of whether you'll like this or not. Lessing's style is dry, English-minimalist-ironic-witty, the kind of uppercrust diction often misrepresented in the American media as a kind of disaffected snobbery. This book, perhaps of all the Lessings that have crossed my path over the years, puts paid once and for all to the snobbery aspect, as Lessing turns her didactic tone and minimalist attitude to the exploration of the horror of raising an outcast.<br /><br />Not to say this is a horror novel, any more than Geoffrey Household's The Sending, Stephen Gregory's The Woodwitch, or Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun are horror novels; none fits the genre per se, but all leave the reader with a decidedly sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. Call it the experience of quotidian horror, rather than the Lovecraftian howling-mad beasts or Steve King's terrors in the closet. (One could probably make the case that Lessing, Household, Gregory, and Trumbo were the founding fathers of what's being termed &quot;the new horror&quot; these days, which I've called in other reviews &quot;the horror of absence,&quot; so ably written by Kathe Koja and Lucius Shepard, among others. The criticisms most often levelled at this novel are exactly the same as those aimed at the newer writers, and for the same reasons-- &quot;not enough is going on.&quot;)<br /><br />It is also obvious from the start that this is a flight of fantasy, a piece of utter fiction in the truest sense, and that the characters are symbolic of something. Lessing never really lets you in on what they're symbols of until the final paragraphs, and while it's not a spoiler in the traditional sense, it would be a criminal act for me to reveal the way Lessing wraps things up at the end; suffice to say the closing paragraphs of this novel are some of the strongest I've encountered in a very long time.<br /><br />Only three and a half months into 2001, this is already an extremely strong year for my reading list, but I still think The Fifth Child has a good chance of making this year's Top 15. ****asy, a piece of utter fiction in the truest sense, and that the characters are symbolic of something.

Garrett Hongo, The River of Heaven (Knopf, 1988)<br /><br />Hongo's second book of poetry was the Lamont Poetry Selection for 1987, an award which usually lends a great amount of buzz to a poet for a very short time. Hongo, unfortunately, is no expection, and not long after this book's release, he slid back into the relative obscurity afforded most of the country's top poets.<br /><br />Hongo mostly writes in, and excels at, narrative form; a forgotten art in the Eliot-influenced American culture of the latter half of the twentieth century. Unlike most narrative poets, Hongo is willing to take the time to remember what poetry is while telling his story, and never lapsing into more prosaic sentence structure while still getting his points across. An example (I opened the book at random to pick it; seldom is a book of poetry good enough throughout to do that) from the middle of the poem &quot;Morro Rock&quot;:<br /><br />And I knew a girl once<br /> who lived near there,<br /> and whom I'd visit,<br /> hitching north, needing her still.<br /> She was the first I'd known<br /> who could sit, oblivious,<br /> still in her long shift,<br /> pull both knees to her arms,<br /> and rock gently in the sand<br /> while a thin foam of sea washed around her.<br /> I'd stand barefoot in the foam<br /> while the ocean percolated around us,<br /> and toss wet handfuls of sand<br /> towards the combers, empty of feeling.<br /> The Rock filled the space behind us.<br /><br />There's not an unwritten rule of poetic creation not broken in that stanza, and yet Hongo pulls it off without, seemingly, any effort at all. Truly excellent stuff that should never have gone out of print.	2001-03-13

Stanton Peele, The Diseasing of America 2/E (Lexington, 1995)<br /><br />There are two types of people in the world: those the recovery zombies have already attacked, and those they will. It doesn't matter if you don't drink and don't smoke, they'll find something else about which you're &quot;diseased&quot;-- perhaps you enjoy shopping, you like to eat, you spend a couple of weekends per year in Vegas. Did you know these are all symptoms of diseases? Oh, you didn't? Well, they are. Don't believe it? You must be in denial. Here, let us help you lead a more well-adjusted life.<br /><br />Peele seeks atonement for starting this craze with his book Love and Addiction in 1984. (As a side note, the one important thing Peele does NOT try to atone for is his almost singlehanded corruption of the definition of the term &quot;addiction,&quot; which he misuses throughout the book; when reading it, you might be better served by substituting the word &quot;compulsion&quot; every time you see &quot;addiction.&quot; Addiction requires, by definition, a physical component, and thus it is impossible to be addicted to most of the things that Peele admits are really addictive.) He does this by stating in no uncertain terms that the addiction/recovery industry has gotten way out of hand, then spends the next two hundred fifty pages outlining one of the scariest stories I've ever read-- the sixty-year history of the recovery industry, beginning with the foundation of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1935.<br /><br />Along the way, Peele stops on occasion to point out some obvious factors we tend to overlook in our quest for political correctness (e.g. the race- and class-based aspects of alcoholism, which are blatantly obvious to the eye but resisted by the mind thanks to decades of being told that alcoholism has nothing to do with class or race). While he occasionally slips into the same crevasse he's trying to close by citing statistics without backing them up, the majority of what he gives us is surrounded with footnotes and citations, important when you're accusing those around you of pulling their figures out of thin air.<br /><br />Some of Peele's ultimate conclusions should be taken with at least a grain of salt (he could have done himself a couple better by continuing his questioning to its ultimate conclusion, rather than stopping a step short and wholeheartedly endorsing the &quot;family values&quot; idea, which may need questioned even more than<br />AA's dogma), but that doesn't make the research any less valuable. In a society where &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; is a the rule, anyone who expects their word to be treated as gospel and makes sweeping statements only needs one person to find fault with one supposed &quot;fact&quot; they spout. Peele has found a lot of faults with a lot of facts in the original AA dogma, and shows us exactly how the most distorted pieces of the AA marketing scheme have been used to create and power the larger recovery industry in America today.<br /><br />They will come after you. The faster you read this book, and the longer you spend absorbing its contents, the better-armed you'll be when someone accuses you of &quot;addictive&quot; (actually, compusive) behavior. While I can't give the book five stars thanks to Peele's wimping out in the last chapter, this is certainly a life-changer, and one of the most important books that's ever crossed my path.

We are most aware of Nazi Germany; less in the consciousness, but still a part of the common knowledge, is Stalin's treatment of Russians during and after the war. But the actions of the Japanese army in China during the thirties and forties-- and their ultimate consequences-- have gone largely unreported in the Western press. Americans were first made aware of the scope and depth of Japan's war crimes in the late 1980s by two investigative journalists, Williams and Wallace, in their book Unit 731: Japan's Secret Biological Warfare in World War II. Soon after, Godfrey Ho released the first of four exploitation films based on the activities of Unit 731, called Men Behind the Sun (a film partially subsidized by the Chinese government). Gradually, Americans became more aware of what happened (especially in the case of the Rape of Nanjing), but the numbers-- conservative estimates put the death toll in China between 1930 and 1945 at thirty million-- and the specific case of Unit 731 are still largely unknown to Americans.<br />Hal Gold fires another shot in the battle to set things right with his book Unit 731: Testimony. During 1993 and 1994, an exhibition based on the activities of Unit 731 toured Japan, and a handful of ex-Unit 731 personnel testified about their actions and the actions of others. It was the first time the Japanese government had allowed evidence that Unit 731 even existed to be publicized. Gold's book starts with a history of Unit 731, and then provides transcriptions of many of the testimonies given during the exhibition.<br />Perhaps the most disturbing thing about Unit 731: Testimony is the quotidian attitude of the employees recounted in much of the testimony. While a number mentioned initial pangs of conscience once they realized what it was Unit 731 was actually doing, almost all of them say that they simply got used to it. And we think kids are desensitized to violence today? Wonder what the average teen would do if he found himself in a room where a live vivisection, without benefit of anesthesia, were being performed.<br />Gold gets his message across by being invisible. He puts the facts on the table as plainly as possible, and then lets the testifiers speak for themselves. The facts lead to one conclusion: the U. S. government (and specifically MacArthur and Truman) were fully aware of the activities of Unit 731, which turned over all surviving test results and documents in exchange for immunity against war crimes prosecution (many of MacArthur's surviving memos and letters dealing with Unit 731 strongly imply that the general didn't consider those activites to be war crimes at all). Allegations were made during the Korean War that the United States, with help from Unit 731 commander Shiro Ishii, carried out a biological attack on Pyongyang. Gold never conclusively proves the case, but the circumstantial evidence points to the conclusion that those allegations are true.<br />The testimonials, on the other hand, speak volumes before they are even read. Japan is changing, as a culture, and the government's ability to allow the disclosure of fifty-year-old state secrets are a promising beginning. (As a side note, Gold also mentions at least three aborted operations the Japanese were considering that would almost certainly have altered the course of the war. It really makes one think to realize that the Japanese had a submersible aircraft carrier sitting not far off the coast of Oregon-- and decided not to use it.)<br />This is a powerful book, and one that should become a standard text in twentieth-century history classes. In terms of scale and in terms of horror, the Japanese occupation of what they called Machuria was the chief atrocity of the twentieth century. And you know what they say about history forgotten. ****em say that they simply got used to it. And we think kids are desensitized to violence today?

Alyson Hagy, Keeneland (Simon and Schuster, 2000)<br />\\"Finally,\\" one reviewer raves, \\"a female character with backbone!\\" No arguments from this section. In a world of neuroses, obsessions, and \\"diseases\\" manufactured by the self-help market in order to sell products-- all of which seem to be exaggerated in modern literary heroines-- it's nice to find a main character of the feminine persuasion who doesn't [care] about any of it. Kerry is a heroine with traits we don't often see in heroines; confused but willing to muddle through, defensive, not angry at the world but not in love with it, either. In short, she's allowed to be a human being, with all the complexity that involves, rather than a cardboard cutout who fits the easy definitions of self-help books (most of which are more fictional than this).<br />One character, however, does not a book make (in most cases, anyway; I'm sure Jean-Paul Sartre would take exception to that statement). Hagy places her heroine in the opening days of Keeneland's spring meet, newly returned from a stint in New York and a bad separation from her husband. She has no friends per se, but enough acquaintances to get along, making enough money to subsist, at least. But like all communities, it's impossible to stay connected to your former life without it catching up with you, and complications ensue just as things start settling down.<br />My main problem with the book, in fact my only problem with it, is that Hagy attempted to write to the non-horse crowd by keeping some of the book filled with horse terms whil leaving them out of others; in many cases, it seems she took exactly the wrong turn in deciding what to leave in and what to take out. In most cases, the decisions were understandable, even if they could have been better; I realize someone who's spent a good portioni of their lives around Keeneland isn't likely to notice many of the small details, but it's the details that make Keeneland one of America's finest racetracks. Also, I'd expect someone who exercises horses in the mornings to take a little more note of the actual racing that's gonig on, rather than have it mentioned a few times as background noise. It's possible to write lovingly about the sport and its evirons while still creating a book that's not specifically about horse racing; Bill Barich showed the world that twenty years ago with his brilliant book Laughing in the Hills. Because of this, there were times when the book left me wanting to know more about what was going on around Kerry. After all, it doesn't matter how absorbed you are in your problems, you can't be around a horse race without getting caught up in it.<br />The book's good points certainly outweigh the bad ones, and it's worth seeking out. ***I'd expect someone who exercises horses in the mornings to take a little more note of the actual racing that's gonig on, rather than have it mentioned a few times as background noise.

The first hundred ninety-nine pages are excellent. Golding has wonderful insight into the human condition, and he applies it with rare grace and tact. And then we get to the final page, which would be best ripped out. It's impossible to go into detail without spoilers, so suffice to say this novel's ending is the single largest letdown in all of literature. Disappointing enough to knock a full star and a half off the rating. ***	2001-02-08

I don't think it would be giving too much away to say Cybele deals with the human condition, more specifically its degradation. Most Oates novels do.<br /> When Black Sparrow published Cybele in 1974, it was considered shocking, even in a time when tell-all fictional exposes were becoming increasingly common thanks to the successes of just-above-dime novels like Peyton Place in the decades before. And thus Black Sparrow, a press known for keeping books in print forever, let it lapse. Twenty-five years later, it still hasn't been reprinted, and that's a crime. Short (at least, shorter than most of Oates' novel output), engaging in the same way as a splatter film, unremittingly ugly in its honesty and forthrightness, as of now Oates has never again achieved the power she did in this novel. Do whatever you need to to seek a copy out, if you're a fan of Joyce Carol Oates.	2001-02-02

Bill Bryson, I'm a Stranger Here Myself (Broadway Books, 1999)<br /><br />At funtrivia.com, one of the (many) ways a quiz can go from a relatively high ranking to \\"very poor\\" between the time I start and the time I finish is a factual error that causes me to get a question wrong. Research is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Half of me is willing to give Bill Bryson the benefit of the doubt; the other half is ready to excoriate him on what may be a false impression. I'll attempt to keep it reserved.<br /><br />Bryson's column \\"The Waste Generation,\\" about two-thirds of the way through I'm a Stranger Here Myself, starts off with a statistic that's quite simply wrong (\\"One of the most arresting statistics I have seen in a good while is that 5 percent of all the energy used in the United States is consumed by computers that have been left on all night.\\" Wrong; a computer and a monitor, left on twenty-four hours a day, together consume approximately a dollar's worth of electricity per month. The computer is one of the most energy-efficient machines on the planet today). The American home computer revolution happened while Bryson was out of the country, so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. It would have been nice, however, had he mentioned his source.<br /><br />[ed.note 2013: using easily-available energy calculators on the Internet, going by my current electricity rate and the size of my computer's power source (450W), the current amount of power my computer uses is approximately twenty-eight cents per month, left on 24/7. I have been told this number would only be applicable if both cores in my CPU were maxed the whole time, so the actual amount is probably far less than this. I am willing to continue giving some benefit of the doubt in that EnergyStar may not have been as ubiquitous in 1999 as it is fifteen years later, but the fact remains: if you live in a dwelling with more than three rooms, your incandescent light bulbs likely cost more to use per months than your computers.]<br /><br />A forgivable error, perhaps, though basing a whole column on it is rather disturbing. But the part of the column that bugs me is farther down: \\"I have glanced out hotel room windows late at night, in a variety of cities, and been struck by the fact that lots of lights in lots of office buildings are still burning... why don't we turn these things off?... Why, after all, go through the irksome annoyance of waiting twenty seconds for your computer to warm up each morning when you can have it at your immediate beck by leaving it on all night?\\"<br /><br />Two different questions with two entirely different answers, but Bryson goes on to turn it into a discussion of American wastefulness with its natural resources. He may be reaching the right conclusion, but if so, he's doing a 180 from where he started. To answer the latter question first, in modern computers with the Energy Saver features (which do nothing of the sort) turned off, it takes less power to leave a computer on all night than it does to shut it down and start it up. (To address another point he makes in the same passage, it's also more efficient to leave cars running for short periods rather than turning them off and back on. Any electrical appliance requires something of an electrical security deposit to get started, just like an apartment renter has to put down \\"amount of monthly rent times three\\" or somesuch in order to move in.) The former answer takes longer, but the short answer is that the Federal government, during the 1974 oil crisis, was taking out full-page ads in various magazines (I used to see them on a regular basis in Time) telling us that leaving lights on all night in buildings is what we SHOULD do, because electric lights give off heat, and at the time it was cheaper to heat a building by leaving its lights on and cranking the gas heat down six degrees or so. That situation went away with the end of the fuel crisis, of course, but the government nevertook those ads out in time.<br /><br />Here's where I get a little wonky with Bryson. The subtitle of the book is \\"Notes on returning to America aftetr twenty years away.\\" If the number is, in fact, twenty, then Bryson was in the country when the Government was running those full-page ads. And thus, given that he's all too well aware of the average Joe's lack of common sense, he could have come to the same conclusion by poking fun at the fact that the average Joe never stopped leaving the lights on all night after the fuel crisis was over. But he doesn't.<br /><br />Humor is a wonderful thing (and let me hasten to say that there is a good deal of it here), but one of the prerequisites for humor of any sort should be that's it's based on fact. The humorist is, in many cases (and certainly in this one) using humor to get a point across, and doing so with factual errors leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. Factual errors by ignorance leave less of a bad taste in my mouth than factual errors by design. That's what I see in this essay, and it makes me wonder how many others, with circumstances with which I'm less acquainted in this book, are founded on the same sleight of hand. Perhaps one error shouldn't taint my view of a whole book, but I can't help it. After all, when an expert witness admits he falsified one fact in one trial that changed the outcome, how often do you think he'll be getting called to testify after that?<br /><br />I try to give Bryson the benefit of the doubt for most of it, because his heart's mostly in the right place, and his brand of humor is the understated, easy kind that resides at the top of the humor heap. But I'll never be able to read another word of Bryson's without the 1974 energy crisis in the back of my head. **took those ads out in time.<br /><br />Here's where I get a little wonky with Bryson.

It's certainly good for shock value. But is it really the  case?<br /><br />In the popular definition of the term, perhaps. Sotos  reports on, and revels in, the prurient. He shows us what most of us  would rather not see. In the two hundred twenty-two pages of Tick, we  are handed the case of Girl X, which made a very brief splash in the  newspapers and brought the name Cabrini Green back to the frontal lobes.  We're given JonBenet Ramsey's autopsy report, as gruesomely amusing as it  was. We're told the side of the Matthew Shepard killing that most news  reporters refused to report-- that Shepard's killing was &quot;most likely&quot;  drug-related and had nothing to do with his sexual orientation. It's  tabloid journalism without the pictures and the necessity for  self-censorship that one is required to follow if one wants to have one's work  published in the Weekly World News.<br /><br />But the court's definition of pornography is more  stringent. Prurience is not the only requirement; the work must also serve  no social purpose. This is the great paradox of obscenity law. It can be  argued, and strongly, that any depiction of society's dank  underbelly serves a social purpose, be that purpose reform or simply  exposure. Whether we want to see the spectacle isn't the issue, and of  course we're all aware that Americans, as a culture, will cause traffic jams  by slowing down to look at particularly gruesome auto accidents. Couldn't  you argue, in light of the cases of Girl X and JonBenet Ramsey, or  the handful of other missing-child cases Sotos mentions, that keeping  these things in the forefronts of the minds of parents is a public  service? A social necessity, even?<br /><br />Sure. And you'd be right.<br /><br />Couldn't you argue, in light of Americans' appalling  ignorance about HIV and AIDS, that a detailed understanding of its  transmission is essential not only to every man who puts himself at risk, but  every woman married to such a man?<br /><br />Sure. And you'd be right.<br /><br />If you wanted to strike out into the grey areas of the  law, you could make the case that well-written personal experience is  more likely to stick in the head than dry textbook relation. Who gets  more listeners around the fire, the Ben Stein wannabe or the jolly  old chap who makes up voices for each charater and punctuates with hand  gestures?<br /><br />Make no mistake, Sotos is a gifted writer. When he  lapses into the rhythm and dictions of a third-grader, made-up words  and all, he does so for a purpose. When he wants to be, which is most of  the time, Sotos is precise, collected. Not detached-- after a certain  amount of immersion, it is impossible to be detached-- but this is a man  who never loses his head, a voracious reader who drops literary allusions  with the frequency and obscurity of an Ezra Pound. Just because the  parallels he's drawing have to do with dead teenagers as opposed to a world  war doesn't make them less valid.<br /><br />Peter Sotos may be tasteless. Peter Sotos may be  prurient.

Unreadably thick prose with no letup. Where most trade paperbacks clock in at a minute and a half or so per page for me, I was spending ten to twenty minutes a page on this, and that's without the patented Julia Kristeva &quot;dictionary by the side to look up every third word&quot; necessity. It's just plain hard to read. And it shouldn't be-- it's a pretty simple story about a guy called home to care for his ailing mother. It's not necessarily bogged down by philosophy, or by reflection, or any of the things that make bogging down worthwhile; it's just hard to read. There's no real reason for it I can put my finger on. I even gave it a second (and a third and a fourth) chance thanks to a raging endorsement from Barry Hannah, one of the handful of authors who's actually written a truly perfect novel (The Tennis Handsome), but I finally ended up throwing it onto the fire to combat the high cost of heating the apartment with gas.

The first five are inconsistent, but pretty bang-up thrill rides all the same. When they started on the downhill slide, they started steep.<br /><br />The premise is pretty simple and very well-used in the atomic age: a whole bunch of toxic waste that's been dumped in one particular site starts mutating things and eventually takes on a will of its own. Hard to go wrong with that one, eh?<br /><br />It's hard to pinpoint what, exactly, it is about The Bridge that makes it so much less fun than Skipp and Spector's first five wild rides (I have yet to track down a copy of their final collaboration, Animals, which many fans consider their finest). Perhaps it's the kludgy, overbearing moralizing mixed in with Skipp and Spector's usual closet-romance-novel style (one-sentence paragraphs liberally used, large chunks of melodramatic prose, that sort of thing). Perhaps it's an unsuccessful attempt to combat one of horror's most glaring problems-- the &quot;I need some minor characters to kill off, so I'll just put them in the chapter where they die&quot; problem-- by introducing almost every minor character in one previous chapter before they get offed. (Not necessarily THE previous chapter, just A previous chapter.) But hey, at least they made the effort, even if it didn't work too well. Perhaps it's the feeling that there really ARE no major characters here. But then, that ties back into the first problem, which violates the One Sacred Rule of Art: if you have a Big Sociopolitical Idea you want to get across, make sure you have a good enough framework to carry it (or, to once again misquote McLuhan, &quot;the medium IS the message&quot;). Idea Novels that push for social change are almost uniformly bad. As much as I hate to say it, this one is no exception.<br /><br />That's not to say that there's nothing good about this novel. If you know Skipp and Spector, you know you're in for a gleeful ride through the wonderful world of splatterpunk, where nothing is sacred and every cow gets shish-kebabed before the book ends. All of the unwritten rules get broken here in throughly disgusting ways (the &quot;toddler bouilliabasse&quot; is a particularly nasty moment, I must say). Even with all the moralizing, the lack of connection to the characters, the usual genre-based bad editing, it was still fun. And then I got to the ending.<br /><br />Not the ending of the novel. The ending of the novel is actually bloody fantastic for a horrorbook. Not a single punch is pulled.<br /><br />But what happens after the ending of the novel.<br /><br />(Note: the above is the kind of emotionally manipulative one-sentence paragraph to be found at least twice per page in this book.)<br /><br />What happens after the ending of the novel as that John and Craig trump their overbearing morality by adding a whole lot of nonfiction morality that's even MORE overbearing. The &quot;please save our earth&quot; appendix chops a star off the book's rating by itself. Note to authors: once you've slapped raders in the face with a dead fish, proceeding to then cram it down their throats is a real good way to anger them. **.

West published three other novels during his lifetime, and while Lonelyhearts and Locust are constantly in print, the others-- The Dream Life of Balso Snell, A Cool Million, and Good Hunting-- are considerably harder to get hold of. (There is a hardcover edition of four of the novels, excluding Good Hunting, in print from the library of America.) Reading A Cool Million, it's not hard to see why it might not be as popular as his two better-known works.<br /><br />A Cool Million is a vicious satire of the Horatio Alger stereotypes popular during the Depression, the endless stories of how anyone with enough gumption could succeed in America. West takes an Alger-like hero, Lemuel Pitkin, and sends him on his way to the big city to make his fortune (actually, he's after $1500, but we'll put that aside). By the time he reaches the big city, he's been robbed and arrested. And things only get worse from there. The supporting cast contains not a single likable character (by design) save Pitkin, who's more pathetic than likable, and his childhood sweetheart, whom we first meet as she's being abducted by white slavers to work in a Chinese brothel. Everyone's out for something, and most of them seem to wact to extract it from poor Pitkin.<br /><br />It is satire that, by turns, treads the edge and hops over it into that fuzzy area where one can't be sure whether West is still being satirical, or whether he's letting a nasty streak of his own show. This far removed from the book's timeliness and publication date, only scholars can be sure, and thus the book doesn't hold up as well as it otherwise might. But if you're not a fan of the Horatio Alger mythology, this should be right up your alley. **the Horatio Alger mythology, this should be right up your alley. **	2001-01-03
2173711:US	50068216	R36L1G4GW4X2B1	0312243022	785940945	The Hours: A Novel	Books	2	10	11	N	N	The Pulitzer?	Michael Cunningham, The Hours (FSG, 1998)<br /><br />The Pulitzer? Cunningham was ignored for Flesh and Blood, and got the Pulitzer for this? There's only one explanation, and that's that the Pulitzer committe (which, it was recently pointed out, is made up of journalists) completely forgot the opening hundred seventy-five pages in the process of being stunned by the last fifty.<br /><br />Publisher's Weekly, in its review of The Hours, castigates Cunningham in a minor way for the scope of Flesh and Blood, and compares The Hours favoriably to that novel because The Hours is a little less than half as long. I can't argue with PW's assertion that The Hours shows that Cunningham can write a shorter novel that has the same power as Flesh and Blood did, but I can, and do, take issue with the inference that Flesh and Blood is a lesser book because of it. Where Flesh and Blood stayed in one general time frame and focused on one excellently-drawn extended family, The Hours cuts back and forth, paralleling the lives of Virginia Woolf in England, a fan of Virginia Woolf's who's in the process of reading Mrs. Dalloway, and the fan's son, who grows up to be an award-winning poet suffering from complications resulting from AIDS.<br /><br />When Cunningham focuses on his fictional creations, things are all well and good. The Hours contains many of the things that made Flesh and Blood a great novel-- Cunningham's powerful style of narrative, his willingness to go more deeply into the emotions of characters than most writers, an ability to pace his book that's unmatched in modern literature. Ironically, it's when Cunningham focuses on Virginia Woolf and her family that the characters stop being realistic. There's just not enough of them, and Cunningham's hero-worship of Woolf is too obvious. The end result is a novel inconsistent at best.<br /><br />When it's on its game, though, The Hours is a rollercoaster of a novel. The last fifty pages, especially, will be read at one clip, as Cunningham ties in the stories of the mother and son, and the grandiose prose used in the last few sections of the novel is more than deserved. This is a novel capable of bringing tears in its last pages. If the rest of the book had been firing on that many cylinders, it would have been a Pulitzer no-brainer, but as it stands, in the bulky shadow of its superior predecessor, one wonders if the committee weren't trying to right the mistake it had made in ignoring<br />Flesh and Blood three years previous. ** 1/2Cunningham ties in the stories of the mother and son, and the grandiose prose used in the last few sections of the novel is more than deserved.

David Markson, Wittgenstein's Mistress (Dalkey Archive Press, 1988)<br /><br />I gave up on it. I understand its appeal for many, and it's probably the best example of what stream-of-consciousness would look like written down in first person by someone with an obsessive mental editor, but that as a convention doesn't hold up for as many pages as this novel wants to be. It would have been a great plotless short story, though. The narrator's voice rings true, if somewhat grating, like reading the two-hundred-fifty page rough draft of a meandering Andy Rooney column. And that's its major problem, it never centers on anything. There's nothing for the reader to latch onto and follow, other than the voice.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the novel's originality, and I was never quite able to find it. Those who thought it original for being a first-person last-woman-on-earth narrative are encouraged to go read, well, any number of last-person-on-earth sci-fi works. Those who found it in the narrator's existential angst are encouraged to check out Alain Robbe-Grillet's The Erasers and Jean-Paul Sartre's Roads to Freedom series of novels. Those who thought it original for being a whole novel told from the single perspective of an unreliable narrator can turn many places, most notably the work of James Baldwin, to see influences. In any case, I missed the originality. (zero)	2000-12-16

Guns of the South is considered THE alternate history novel by many, the one alternate history novel that should be required reading in history classes and on just about every historian's list of must-read Civil War books. And to be fair, it's almost that good. Really.<br /><br />As with most fiction of the speculative type, especially alternate-history speculative fiction, the plot can be summed up by asking one simple question. In that case, &quot;what if the South won the American Civil War?&quot; The book is essentially divided into two halves; the first half takes place during the war, and the second half afterwards. And when Turtledove is writing battle scenes, he shines. The first half of the book flies by. It's a page-turner to end all page-turners.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when Robert E. Lee moves from military command to political life, the story bogs down. Badly.<br />It does pick up again, a hundred or so pages later, but there are a few places in the book where the pace gets so glacial I started to think I'd accidentally picked up Frank Herbert's Children of Dune instead. Yes, it gets that slow. It all wraps up pretty nicely, but the journey to get from point A to point B can sure be hard sometimes. ** 1/2	2000-12-03

Amazing.<br /><br />By now I should be inured to the pace of a Dick Francis novel, which is roughly equivalent to that of a marathon turf stakes at Ascot: in order to conserve energy, the horses start off slow, knowing they have a couple of thousand meters ahead of them; the pace picks up after you get round to the backstretch the first time, and the finish is furious. Francis spent too much time on the backs of nags at Royal Ascot to forget that, I guess. And thus you know that the first three or four chapters of a Francis mystery are likely to bog down. Stick with it; it's almost always worth the trip.<br /><br />Randall Drew has been forced into retirement (like many of Francis' jockeys). In this case, it's because the jockey club has seen fit to outlaw riding with glasses, and contacts and Drew don't mix well. Drew, friend and lover to English royalty, is tabbed by the Prince to investigate shadowy claims of threats to a Royal who wants to ride in the 1980 Moscow olympics, threats that are backed up by the death of a German olympic rider, supposedly of a heart attack-- but foul play is suspected. Drew heads off to Moscow, and the fun begins.<br /><br />If you know Francis, you already know whether you're going to buy this or not, I suspect. Francis mysteries are basically formulaic. Ex-jockey becomes amateur detective, ex-jockey discovers something nasty is happening at a track somewhere, ex-jockey investigates, ex-jockey gets into scrapes, ex-jockey gets out of scrapes, ex-jockey solves crime. It's good clean mindless fun, and this one has nothing about it that stands out from the others, save its rather odd location (which seems quaint given the collapse of the cold war nowadays). Good if you like Francis, bad if you don't, and not a book I'd suggest as a jumping-off point if you don't know his work (try Odds Against or Enquiry instead, where Francis is on his home turf).).	2000-11-30

Things happen to the characters, all of which are described in lush detail, but somehow the detail never manages to convey any emotion whatsoever.

Ngugi gives us the story of Kenya on the verge of independence (the action takes place in the days before, and the day after, Uhuru). While the book's main focus purports to be on one of his principal town's inhabitants, Gikonyo, it soon becomes evident that the story is about the town itself. And this is where Ngugi falls short.<br /><br />The structure itself could have been, handled deftly, exceptionally clever. Make Gikonyo synecdochic of the town, which is synecdochic of the region in which the town lies, which is synecdochic of all of Kenya. Unfortunately, the complexities waylay the book quickly, and while Gikonyo and his travails are never completely displaced, too much else is going on for him to be the book's main focus. Ngugi tries to compensate by having other main characters whose struggles mirror other parts of the Kenyan experience, but the whole thing gets confusing time and again.<br /><br />This is not to say the book is bad; the stories therein are engaging, and Ngugi's style is a page-turner. There's just a lack of continuity that can be disconcerting at times, and lengthy sections of flashback tend to leave the reader unaware of exactly what time frame he's supposed to be thinking about some of the time. It could have used a good editor, and perhaps a little rearranging to make things clearer.<br /><br />Hard to give a succinct recommendation to this one. As should be obvious from the above, it's not an easy read, and it's laden with symbolism, so if you're looking for something light, this isn't the place to stop. Still, getting through it is something of a rewarding experience, and when the symbolism is firing, it's wonderful; each of the major characters is there for a reason, and after a few days of digestion, as the main thrusts of the book sort<br />themselves out, it becomes clear what a powerful work this book almost is. If you're the kind of person who can listen to a badly-recorded bootleg tape and not mind the recording quality because you get so caught up in the music itself, you'll probably be able to appreciate this. ** 1/2es clear what a powerful work this book almost is.

Barry Gifford, whose markedly jaundiced eye is probably best known from the book Wild at Heart (made into the David Lynch film of the same name starring Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern), has been a longtime railbird. As all writers with the obsession do, Gifford turned his eye, and his pen, to the sport so many of us love.<br /> When you've read enough books about racing from the fan's point of view, you start recognizing the same patterns over and over again. The backside of any track is full of cagey characters, not necessarily because they're dishonest, but because they're used to harassment from folks outside the industry (INS, DEA, OSHA, various other alphabet-soup organizations). But Gifford, as is usually obvious from his books, is a personable sort, and it seems he was able to get backstretch people talking in ways few other authors have been able to. Of course, I may be partial, as one of the folks he interviewed was Liz Lundberg, than a groomer at Tampa Bay Downs, who was one of the best-respected jocks at my home track, Thistledown, when I first got involved in the game.<br /> If you've read Gifford before, you're aware enough of his style, and no one should need to tell you you're going to adore this book. If you're a racetracker who's used to Bill Murray, Mike Helm, and others of that stripe, you may find Gifford's book more accessible than most.	2000-11-25

The plot is simple and easy to work with (family watches daughter fall in love with chap with overbearing mother-- shades of Bloch, Hintze, et al.), the twists are intriguing (the main character's friend, whose house is always full of interesting strangers); etc. Fremlin had a lot of really good ingredients, and is capable of writing scintillating prose when she wants to; every five pages or so a sentence or a paragraph would make me stop cold and marvel at the quality of this woman's writing. The problem is, once every five pages or so isn't enough to make the book shine, especially when it's under two hundred pages. So I ended up dropping this one into the &quot;wasted potential&quot; file. It showed enough promise that I'll probably attempt to pick up a few of her later works and see if she ever put it all together properly, but it didn't work in this one. * 1/2	2000-11-08

The particular swimming pool that is eighties literature, [urinated] in on a fairly regular basis by Papa Hemingway and Sinclair Lewis, is home to the Barthelme brothers. And as much as I hate to draw obvious comparisons and judge by them, Donald's the better writer.<br /><br />Still, Fred is capable of turning a decent tale. His protagonist is on the cusp of divorce, staying in Florida with his soon-to-be-ex-wife's sister. The two never quite get romantically entangled, but they share bed space every once in a while, which makes things slightly uncomfortable when the wife shows up.<br /><br />Frederick Barthelme's strength resides in his ability to create minor characters and setting; much of what goes on around the main triangle here is memorable, in ways (as much as I hate to do it again... it's the same kind of semi-dada whimsy that inhabits Donald's more notable works). The problem is that the main plot, what little there is of it, never really gets off the ground. The main characters don't have the emotional depth to hold the minimal changes in their emotional states that Frederick is trying to use to signal the way their relationships are changing towards one another. He's also guilty of giving just enough in places to be ambiguous about what events will transpire, then cutting to the next morning without us knowing exactly what went on, and then never following up.<br /><br />Could've been good.

Instead, the back cover blurb calls him &quot;wonderfully touching.&quot;  Oh, please.<br /><br />Thank heaven Tawni O'Dell is a much better writer than her  blurbist, because Harley Altmeyer is the least likable hero I've run across  since Michael Moorcock decided an anorexic albino with a big black sword  sounded like a good idea. Note I didn't say antihero there; Harley Altmeyer  is certainly the hero of this book in that, while O'Dell keeps him so  unlikable he gets nauseating at times, we never stop feeling sympathy for  him.<br /><br />Altmeyer is on the brink of his twentieth birthday, and as we  open he's sitting in the box in the local police station being grilled by  three cops for killing his girlfriend-- who just happens to be the  thirty-four-year-old wife of the next-door neighbor. Not terribly  surprising, the cops muse, given his roots; Harley's mother was convicted  of killing his father a couple years previous, and is now sitting in prison  in Indiana, PA (I point this out because for the first hundred fifty pages  I wondered how they could drive from Pennsylvania to Indiana in two hours--  and I spent over half my life living less than an hour from Indiana, PA.  Obviously a truly memorable place). Harley spends about two hundred fifty  pages spinning out his tale, and it's a doozy. After his mom iced his dad,  he was dead and she was in jail, and the task of raising his three younger  sisters fell squarely on his shoulders. Nineteen, saddled with all the  bills, working two jobs, and having to raise three sisters, ranging in age  from six to sixteen. It's not exactly a Frank Capra film. And Harley, whose  love/hate relationship with all women borders on the psychotic, is in no  way going to be mistaken for Jimmy Stewart (actually, I saw Giovanni  Ribisi, circa his memorable X-Files appearance, playing this guy).<br /><br />If  you've got half a brain and have read enough books along these lines,  you've probably got half of it figured before you open the front cover. But  O'Dell's writing is so thoroughly disingenuous, and Harley (the very  essence of the unreliable narrator!) is so straightforward and  quasi-logical that he's completely believable. And so, despite the general  predictability of the plot points, they still hit with a  roundhouse.<br /><br />The tendency, of course, is to compare this with the other  novels in the Oprah stable, but it pulls me in a different direction;  there's more here that invites comparison with Ian McEwan's weepingly good  first novel, The Cement Garden (and not just the overall plot, either).  While McEwan has turned into something of a washed-out pansy since he hit  us over the head with that particular cement block, I still have high hopes  for O'Dell. This is stark, simple, minimal, easy to read, compelling, with  some of the strongest characterization I've come across in years, and  somehow the revelations that just kind of wander through the last fifty  pages (no big emotional revelatory scenes here) still manage to surprise,  not to mention tug at the heartstrings.<br /><br />Oprah found a good'un here,  that's for sure. Let's just hope O'Dell doesn't end up a washed-out pansy  who moves to England for the sole purpose of getting short-listed for the  Booker Prize. *** 1/2ee sisters, ranging in age  from six to sixteen.

Carter's book  has about as much to do with Lord of the Rings as Silence of the Lambs  actually has to do with lambs. They get mentioned now and again, but are  really quite unnecessary to what's going on.<br /><br />Carter's interesting  little tome is actually more of an encapsulated history of fantasy  literature up to the time of Tolkien-- the sources from which Tolkien got  his ideas. LOTR serves as a convenient linchpin and a good jumping-off  point, but Carter is truly in his own when he's discussing the Elder Edda  or the epics of Homer and his contemporaries, and tracing how the stories  got from the ancient texts into Tolkien's hands. It leaves behind a wealth  of wonderful reading material for the interested fantasy reader to track  down (assuming most of it can be found; Carter laments that many of the  works of which he speaks have been lost to the ages), and this is its chief  strength. As for weaknesses... well, there really aren't any. Carter spends  too much time summing up LOTR when he could be telling us about Egyptian  legends, and he makes a number of guesses about things in LOTR, since The  Silmarillion hadn't been published yet (and for all its annoyances, The  Silmarillion did answer a whole lot of questions about the First Age), but  it's impossible to count that against Carter and still remain fair. I'd  just liked to have seen more of the old stuff, and less of the new. ***	2000-08-14

It's full of ideas  that are important, anyway. Problem is, the characters therein seem as if  they're there in order to advance the ideas, instead of the characters  driving the novel and the ideas being introduced incidentally to the  characters. This, of course, violates the one supremely inviolable rule of  literature: the medium, to borrow slightly inaccurately from Mr. McLuhan,  is the message. When the message (the theme) overwhelm the medium (the  novel, which at its heart must contain at least some kind of conjunetion of  plot and character), the work suffers. It is true of music, it is true of  art, but most of all it is true of the novel, for a novel whose main goal  is to put forth an idea, rather than to give the reader characters with  whom s/he can sympathize, is necessarily doomed to fail.<br /><br />This is not  to say that said symapthetic (or antipathetic, certainly) characters cannot  advance ideas; sure they can. But for a character to advance an idea in an  effective manner, the character MUST be someone that the reader finds  believable; otherwise; the novel stops being a novel and becomes a polemic.  And that is exactly what we have here: four characters in search of an exit  (or, perhaps, an author). None of them is sympathetic; none is well-drawn;  none has enough depth to couch the ideas and beliefs that Atwood wants to  give them, because their depth lies in those ideas, and it doesn't-- it  can't-- work that way.<br /><br />The main thing that kept me reading, was of  course, the Deep Dark Secret(TM). The DDS, in this novel, is held by the  main character, a collegiate woman who is in a loveless relationship,  divorced and drifting, who goes to search for her missing father in the  northern Canadian wilderness. She takes along her boyfriend and another  couple with whom said boyfriend is making an experimental film.<br /><br />There  is much about this, reading the above and placing it in its proper  timeline, the commands comparison with Don DeLillo's first novel,  Americana, published three years previous. Both detail a piece of time in  the career of filmmakers; both are obsessed with nationality and how it is  seen by outsiders; both have important ideas about life they wish to convey  through their subjects. Reading the two side-by-side cannot help but expose  the flaws in Surfacing, as DeLillo succeedson every level where Atwood  fails; his characters are rich, sympathetic, rather odd creatures who we  can't help but enjoy, from opening scene to final downward spiral (and the  fact that we feel guilty for enjoying the various minor disasters so much  is part of DeLillo's talent); in Surfacing, we're given ideas first, then  characters to drive them. We can't enjoy the main character's descent into  madness, but we cannot feel distressed by it, either; it simply  is.<br /><br />All that said, the book does have a few redeeming qualities. After  an extremely slow beginning, Atwood's writing picks up after the quartet  decide to spend a week farther at the remote cabin, and the DDS itself,  which comes to us as an onionesque mystery, with layer after layer being  peeled off to reveal the rotten center, is quite skillfully handled. In the  hands of a more sympathetic character, the climactic scenes of this novel  and the quite well-written ending would have been, as the cover<br />blazons,  &quot;shattering.&quot; Unfortunately, they aren't, and instead they fall  flat. Marvel at the technical skill of the mystery construction, because  it's the only thing that will keep you reading.<br /><br />If I hadn't heard  exclusively wonderful things about some of Atwood's other novels,  especially The Handmaid's Tale, this would be my last try, but I'll make  another attmept in the hope that she improved with time. * 1/2ntal film.<br /><br />There  is much about this, reading the above and placing it in its proper  timeline, the commands comparison with Don DeLillo's first novel,  Americana, published three years previous.

After  an extremely slow beginning, Atwood's writing picks up after the quartet  decide to spend a week farther at the remote cabin, and the DDS itself,  which comes to us as an onionesque mystery, with layer after layer being  peeled off to reveal the rotten center, is quite skillfully handled. In the  hands of a more sympathetic character, the climactic scenes of this novel  and the quite well-written ending would have been, as the cover<br />blazons,  &quot;shattering.&quot; Unfortunately, they aren't, and instead they fall  flat. Marvel at the technical skill of the mystery construction, because  it's the only thing that will keep you reading.<br /><br />If I hadn't heard  exclusively wonderful things about some of Atwood's other novels,  especially The Handmaid's Tale, this would be my last try, but I'll make  another attmept in the hope that she improved with time. * 1/2	2000-08-14

Lots of buzz around this movie. Oddly, I don't  remember there being lots of buzz around this storm itself.<br /><br />While  Junger begins and ends with the Andrea Gail (and his last chapter lends its  sinking an almost supernatural air a la the supposed curse surrounding  Rebel Without a Cause), there is far more to this book than the story of  six guys and a boat. Of course, what more there is is about more people and  more conveyances; the storm took the wind out of a number of other boats, a  couple of helicopters, etc.<br /><br />While Junger and [Nathaniel] Philbrick [,  author of In the Heart of the Sea: The Voyage of the Whaleship Essex] have  much the same approach in their styles, Philbrick handles In the Heart of  the Sea better than Junger handles The Perfect Storm; perhaps it's because,  since there were survivors from the Essex, we have enough of a picture of  what happened for Philbrick to give us insight into what the men in those  jury-rigged schooners were thinking and feeling during their whole  nightmarish trip, while the Andrea Gail, by necessity, has left us  guessing. Still, there are enough survivors form the other ships affected  by the storm that it's demonstrable Junger is not handling his characters  as well, and the book suffers for it.<br /><br />Still, it's hard not to be  captivated by a story of man against unpredictable nature, and The Perfect  Storm keeps the reader's attention from first page to last, and the  immediacy of an event that took place within one's lifetime is more  impressive that something that happened before the birth of one's  great-grandfather. It is less an indictment of Junger than it is testament  to the prowess of Philbrick that, when comparing the two, In the Heart of  the Sea comes out on top. The Perfect Storm is in no way a bad book; it  just doesn't shine the way it could have. ** 1/2a bad book; it  just doesn't shine the way it could have. ** 1/2	2000-08-04

Tolkien, The Silmarillion (Ballantine, 1977)<br /> availability: endlessly in print<br />In the sixties, something changed. Perhaps Mother Church realized that people were turning away from her; perhaps a cadre of teachers decided the younger generation needed to get in touch with its cultural roots; whatever. We ended up with a course in either the religion, literature, or both departments at many universities: The Bible As Literature. Seems they decided that the definition of \\"literature\\" (as it all too often is) is \\"something that's very difficult to read, but should be read by school students because someone, somewhere, has deemed it of great importance.\\" (And thus Charles Dickens continues to be foisted on high school students everywhere.) And under this definition, the Bible-- which most certainly is difficult to read and is considered of great importance by tens of millions the world over, fits. Some would even attach a broader definition to it-- that it contains a bang-up plot, pretty good characterization, an elucidating theme, etc. Problem is, when it boils right down to the soup bone, the Bible is not all that well-written. Certainly, a number of other creation legends are entirely more readable and fun, despite having far fewer buckets of blood splashed across their pages.<br />Wandering into all this is a linguist who wants to create a creation myth for a world he's developed, a word loved by tens of millions the world over. He's already got the second half of the definition, so all he had to do was pen something difficult to read. And he did so, in spades. The Silmarillion is without a doubt, the thickest (language-wise), most obtuse, hardest-to-follow book I've attmpted since I gave up on nineteenth-century authors who were paid by the page for their stuff. I gave it the best shot I could, but it fell by the wayside.	2000-08-04

The \\"great american novel\\" should probably today be caleld  \\"the quintessential american novel,\\" because the word great, in  this context, refers to the novel that will encompass what we have been,  why, how we got there, and where we were going. And because of the story,  by definition, it cannot be \\"great.\\" The story of America will be  unremittingly (and unapologetically) brutal and bloody; it will lack all  traces of logic and civilization on a grand scale (though, certainly, there  will be logical or civilized characters); and throughout there will remain  the slightest glimmer of hope, although depending on the viewpoint of the  author, that hope may be snuffed out at the end of the novel or kept  alive.<br /><br />I have read the great american novel, and it is Cormac  McCarthy's stunning Blood Meridian.<br /><br />Blood Meridian centers on a  character known only as The Kid, who leaves home at fourteen to make his  fortune during the expansion of the American West (the book begins ten  years or so before the outbreak of the Civil War). (and comparisons with the hallmark of that genre,  Robert Deveraux's brilliant Deadweight, are inevitable, and correct).  McCarthy never shies away from the actions of his characters, never allows  the reader any leeway, but the prose in which McCarthy describes the  atrocities Glanton's band commits is so starkly beautiful the reader cannot  help but be capitvated by the carnage. And during the lulls in the action,  when members of the band philosophize, the philosophy is not so overbearing  as it is instructive for those who may not be able to understand the  mechanisms that work in the collective mind of Glanton's troops:<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />The good book says that he that lives by the sword shall perish by  the sword, said the black.<br /><br />The judge smiled, his face shining with  grease. What right man would have it any other way? he said.<br /><br />The good  book does indeed count war an evil, said Irving. Yet there's many a bloody  tale of war inside it.<br /><br />It makes no difference what men think of war,  said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War  was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade  awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be.  That way and not some other way.<br /><br />He turned to Brown, from whom he'd  heard some whispered slur or demurrer. Ah, Davy, he said. It's your own  trade we honor here. Why not rather take a small bow. Let each acknowledge  each.<br /><br />My trade?<br /><br />Certainly.<br /><br />What is my trade?<br /><br />War. War  is your trade. Is it not?<br /><br />And it ain't yours?<br /><br />Mine too. Very much  so.<br /><br />What about all them notebooks and bones and stuff?<br /><br />All other  trades are contained in that of war.<br /><br />Is that why war endures?<br /><br />No.  It endures because young men love it and old men love it in them. Those  that fought, those that did not.<br /><br />That's your notion.<br /><br />The judge  smiled. Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play  is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not  inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at  hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of  sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation  of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselevs sufficient stake  because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But  trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war  for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.<br /><br />Suppose  two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard  such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has  labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that  man's hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a man's  worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state  admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man  over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man  indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or  significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the  annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man  holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed  from existence.  This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game  and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of  divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within  that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select.  War is the ultimate game because war is at least a forcing of the unity of  existence. War is god.<br /><br />Brown studied the judge. You're crazy Holden.  Crazy at last.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Like James Jones' masterpiece The Thin Red  Line, McCarthy gives us men at war, though McCarthy's troops answer to no  one but themselves, and act as such, and he does it in such a way that we  cannot help but understand what it is about violence and bloodshed that  makes it so attractive to some.

Dubey, Jr., No Need to Count: A Practical Approach to Casino Blackjack (Barnes, 1980)<br /> availability: out of print<br /><br />I'm no good with numbers on the fly, especially when math is involved. This has kept me  from ever playing blackjack in the casino. I've done my damnedest to learn  some of the &quot;simple&quot; systems that require card-counting, simply  because those are the ones that will still work as you increase the number  of decks at the table. And I can't make heads or tails of 'em. Sure,  they're fine when I have the book open and I'm puzzling it all out... but  put me at the table and I'm dogmeat. So if I find a book offering a  supposedly easy system that doesn't require counting, I'm in.<br /><br />Dubey's  book (which is out of print, but can be found relatively cheaply at  bookfinder.com [and no mention anywhere of the promised horse  racing-related book Dubey hints at in here... ah, well]) sticks with the  basics: hit here, double here, stand here, bet this much at this time.  There are shadings you can add optionally, but the basic system is simple  enough to remember. And despite Dubey's background (statistician and  programmer for the department of defense), he keeps it all on layman's  terms, which in and of itself kicks this book up half a star. I haven't yet  tried it out, but card systems aren't like horseracing; they're not  breeding new generations of card decks that can run faster and with more  versaility than they did twenty years ago. Also, Dubey doesn't whitewash  the advantage you're getting over the house with this system: it ranges  between one-tenth and one percent. (One-tenth of one percent, flat-betting,  is roughly equivalent to five bucks an hour if you're a five-dollar bettor  playing a hundred hands an hour. I like the pay better on the horses.) In  other words, this isn't going to enable you to quit your job and move to  Vegas, but it'll at least allow you to even up the odds while your spouse  is blowing rolls of quarters trying to hit the progressive jackpot on the  one-armed bandits. ***lls of quarters trying to hit the progressive jackpot on the  one-armed bandits. ***	2000-07-31

Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country (Broadway, 2000)<br /> availability: it's on the bestseller list innit?<br /><br />I originally encountered the writing of Bill Bryson in a small article he wrote for National Geographic  on the Orkney Islands a year or so ago. By the time I had finished the  article, I was (and still am, to an extent) seriously considering  relocating to the Orkney Islands. Well, I've now finished In a Sunburned  Country, Bryson's travelogue of Australia-- and I never, ever want to go  there.<br /><br />Bryson gives us the world's forgotten continent (really, how  many of you who don't live there can name Australia's Prime Minister?),  mixing personal experience, history, and bewilderment in roughly equal  doses. While the history does bog down in places, I found myself--  especially in the book's first section-- glad that I was the only person in  the room while reading it, since I might well have been committed  involuntarily for laughing so hard in stretches. The most disturbing thing  is that I was laughing about the sheer number of things in Australia which  are capable of killing human beings. This is not a place you should go if  you fear death. &quot;The sea snakes are especially unnerving, not because  they are aggressive, but because they are inquisitive. Stray into their  territory and they'll come to check you out, all but rubbing against you in  the manner of cats seeking affection. They are the most sweet-tempered  creatures in existence. But cross them or alarm them and they can hit you  with enough venom to kill three grown men.&quot; Not only will the  unfriendly creatures kill you, the friendly ones will as well!<br /><br />Those  who have read more Bryson than I have hastened to say that this is a less  humorous book than his others. I'm not sure I could stand the others, for I  might die of asphyxia before reaching the end of chapter one. This is good  stuff, funny most of the time, sobering on rare occasions, and always  edifying. And don't be concerned if you forget three quarters of what's in  here by the time you're finished, including the name of Australia's present  prime minister (or the name of the silicon-tipped grass I've been wracking  my brain for for a week now). According to Bryson, there's something about  Australia that causes people to forget it exists, so as long as you  remember there are seven continents on this planet, you're ahead of the  game. ***ng.

Scott, Total Victory at the Track (Amicus, 1988)<br />The late Scott concludes his handicapping trilogy with Total Victory at the Track, a book that both builds on his two earlier works (Investing at the Racetrack and How Will Your Horse Run Today?) and introduces another concept that ties them together. While Scott's work isn't bad, and the foundations upon which it lays are solid enough, there are some blunders in here that a novice wouldn't make. Whether to blame Scott or his editors is an arguable point, but the effect is the same; a novice coming into this book is going to pick up some bad information indirectly. My advice: buy this book if you're experienced enough at horseplaying to know how to read the Daily Racing Form's past performances and result charts, and be on the lookout for the errors. They are everywhere.<br />That said, the methods outlined here are certainly solid ones, as the workout in the back of the book shows (I'm doing my own testing on it, since these things seem to change on an almost daily basis in the horse biz), and while Scott isn't promising rose gardens, nor enough money to buy the land and plant the roses, it would seem that what he offers is at least enough to turn losers into break-even types or winners, if they're willing to do a little work to get there. It just seems that the path might be a little easier to follow without the glaring Daily Racing Form-related errors that pepper the text. ** 1/2	2000-07-05

In this case, she writes about a middle-aged woman, Florence Green,  who decides that the town she lives in, in rural England, is in need of a  bookshop. It also has an old, abadoned house (appropriately named The Old  House) that would be the perfect size for a small bookshop-- so she buys  the house and sets up shop. Interestingly, as soon as she buys the house,  one of the town's powers that be, a quite disagreeable old bat named Violet  Gamart, decides the Old House needs to be a center for the arts. Green and  Gamart indirectly mix it up a number of times, and just to add to the fun,  Fitzgerald throws in a poltergeist who lives at the Old House and the  publication of Nabokov's Lolita. Better yet, at the end of all this, we're  thrown the curviest of curveballs-- a villain who turns out to be one of  the truly memorable characters in modern British fiction, whose hand in the  various plots of Clan Gamart is as invisible and ugly as Kevin Spacey's in  Seven.<br /><br />My only problem with this book, and unfortunately it's a rather  large one, is its brevity. Many authors would have turned the above into a  five-hundred-page novel. To be fair, most of them would be overblown  windbags in doing so, but Fitzgerald seems to leave many stones unturned  that could have been explored, and the end of the book's summary feel (the  last sentence could have been taken from the close of an eighth-grade book  report!) is roughly akin to what would have happened had Sebastian Junger  cut out the last half of The Perfect Storm and written &quot;well, they all  died.&quot;<br /><br />Still, it's a quick and compelling read, and based on it  I'll be looking for more of Fitzgerald's later work. ***ck and compelling read, and based on it  I'll be looking for more of Fitzgerald's later work. ***	2000-07-05

I'm still trying to figure out what.  Patrick McGrath, who'd  given the world some of its most wonderfully  gut-wrenching tales in _Blood  and Water_, started writing slick, witty  novels that came to just this  side of horror. Clive Barker started  writing fantasy. Anne Rivers Siddons  gave us one of the definitive  modern haunted house novels and then started  churning out &quot;women's  novels.&quot;<br /><br />And then we have Ian  McEwan.<br /><br />McEwan's first novel, _The Cement Garden_, is one of the  most  unpredictably horrific novels in the last half-century. It's a thing  of  absolute beauty, comparable to Koja's _The Cipher_, Deveraux's  _Deadweight,_ and a handful of other horror novels that push the  envelope  so far that the reader will have second thoughts about ever  reading  another novel by the author. Then McEwan dropped out of sight  for a while,  released a second novel I haven't been able to track down  (so this  transformation may be earlier than I suspect), and finally got  major-label  recognition with this, his third full-length offering.<br /><br />The Child  in Time is the story of a couple whose daughter is abducted in  broad  daylight in a crowded supermarket. The two of them react  differently to  the disappearance as time goes on with no ransom note,  and the inevitable  breakup occurs. We phase in right there, not long  after the breakup, and  follow the husband, Stephen, as he tries to put  his life back together  while simultaneously watching his best friend  come apart.<br /><br />I want  to savage this book. I want to get McEwan back for taking one of  the most  promising careers in horror fiction and turning it into a  career writing  slice-of-life novels that culminated in a Booker Prize.  But I can't do it.  The Child in Time is in no way a horror novel, of<br />course, and it doesn't  really classify as a mystery, but it's certainly  not a slice of life  novel. It combines drama, a little mystery, and a  sense of the detached in  much the same way as Graham Swift's masterwork,  Waterland. And it's quite  readable. But fans of earlier McEwan will  always be waiting for the shoe  to drop (preferably weighted down with  something, and on someone's head to  make that satisfying splattering  noise)... and it never does.<br /><br />It's good for what it is, I just wanted it to be something else. And I  can't fault McEwan for that. Still, I suggest starting off with The  Cement  Garden to get the full view of McEwan's considerable writing  power before  taking on this much more minimal work. ***novel, of <br />course, and it doesn't  really classify as a mystery, but it's certainly  not a slice of life  novel.

Okay, with a little  warning.<br /><br />Claude Simon's Conducting Bodies is an experiment in memory,  I think. Simon uses a number of catchphrases (the &quot;conducting  bodies&quot; of the title) to alert the reader to upcoming scnee changes.  Often, a scene changes in the middle fo the action and will be picked up  again later; sometimes a hundred pages or so later. There are no divisions  of any sort; no chapters, no paragraphs, no nothing. If there weren't  sentence breaks I'd have had to try and read the whole thing at one  sitting.<br /><br />It's possible that this is actually a work of genius. After  all, Simon did win the Nobel Prize for literature in 1985, and I assume the  committee had a reason for giving it to him. And maybe I just wasn't paying  close enough attention. And, to be fair, as things weaved in and out, I  found I was able to keep track of the threads without actually expending  time on doing do; Simon would pick up a thread again he'd left off ten or  fifteen pages before and I had no problem remembering what had been going  on at the time. But this is a very tiring book, not only because of the  attention it commands but also because of the simple visual conceit of  having no breaks anywhere on the page, line after line after full line of  unbroken text. And it's headache-inducing after a while. I kept going to  see if anything would tie all these different threads in in the end, and I  guess that's something, too.

The  whole thing is in diary style (of course), impressionist, but with the  sense of the diarist who is also a Nobel-winning writer; while most people  would lean too heavily towards one side or the other, Grass balances fact  and opinion to give as much an objective picture of what he sees around him  as he can. His descriptions are, as usual, excellent, and while he rarely  allows any overtly sociopolitical speech to enter the milieu of his travel  diary, his disgust at what he sees infuses every word. Showing one's  tongue, in Hindu culture, is a sign of shame. Grass, coming from the  somewhat neat and orderly (at the time) world of West Germany, finds much  for India, and in retrospect his own country, to be shamed about. He talks  to many about India's &quot;longing for a Hitler figure&quot; (according to  many of those he talked to, Ghandi was considered an anomaly, and the  country's real hero is WW2 general Subhas Chandra Bose, a Nazi sympathizer  who worked closely with the Japanese on a plan to crush Russia between the  two countries' armies), the caste system, the awful treatment of the  Chinese immigrant population, the mountains of garbage, and other similarly  controversial topics. But as he exposes all this and compares it to the  Germany both of the 1980s and that of the 1940s, he cannot help but be awed  by the beauty of India. This was not Grass' first trip to the country, and  during the fifteen years in between trips, he longed to go back.  Ultimately, it is this kind of division that informs the book more than  anything; attraction and repulsion, outrage and acceptance, Germany and  India. ******	2000-06-28

It's pretty close to being the typical eighties novel. It's not  really about anything. No one makes great personality changes anywhere in  the novel. There's only one other character, aside from a few minor ones,  sales clerks and the like. The book opens with the main character walking  into the lobby of his office building, and ends with him stepping off the  escalator onto his office's floor about a minute later. So what is it that  differentiates this particular eighties novel from the hundreds of others,  and what makes this one better?<br /><br />The devil, of course, is in the  details. While Baker seems as fond of brand names as the rest of his  Ellis-McInerney-Janowitz-etc. cronies, they take a backseat to the generic,  everyday revelations of life, and<br />it's amazing that Baker has managed to  come up with so much of this stuff that most people never think about. The  history of shoelaces. The development of footnotes from the middle ages.  The archaeology of the drugstore. Whether you should drink your milk while  chewing the chocolate chip cookie, or after swallowing it. This is less a  novel than it is a compendium of silly, trivial facts and opinions, and if  you gain pleasure from wandering through trivia websites and the like, this  book<br />is going to be a short, easy pleasure trip through things that no  one else has thought to write about. If you demand plot, theme, and action,  though, this is probably not a book for you. I found it wonderful. *** 1/2	2000-06-19

The basic premise mirrors that of many comedies of  manners from around its time; wife takes apartment in the city and takes a  lover, leaving the hapless husband at home. Wife feels guilty. Wife  attempts to set husband up with a lover. Husband is oblivious. The  repercussions are immense.<br /><br />I got the feeling that Waugh was trying too  hard at the beginning of this book, and that after he stopped trying and  started just plain writing, the book got a whole lot better. He spends a  relatively unnecessary length of time setting the scene before anything  really starts happening, and that scene-setting is interminable. (I should  mention that Amis' writing style mirrors those first seventy pages to a T.)  However, once Waugh stops attempting to be so damned urbane, and gets on  with the task of putting his characters in increasingly unrealistic  situations, both the pace and the humor pick up. The obligatory tragedy  happens, and when it does, it's a mark of how much better the book has  gotten that it's unexpected, and the reader realizes that maybe he feels  something more for these characters than a cordial sort of  despise.<br /><br />One could (and one is sorely tempted) compare and contrast  Waugh's novel with Amis' _Dead Babies_ as synecdochic of what's happened to  British humor over the past sixty years. One will not stoop to such a  level, since one is utterly infatuated with Dawn French, and thinks The  Vicar of Dibley is the cat's pyjamas where TV sitcoms are concerned. So one  will content oneself with saying that Waugh, using understatement and  irony, has written a far more humorous novel than Amis, whose main conceits  were slapstick and drugs. Still not one of the better things I've read this  year, could have used a good editor in the beginning, but not bad, not bad  at all.	2000-06-15

There's a particular style of mystery that I haven't quite classified yet. Maybe I'll take a line from TNT and call them &quot;mysteries for guys who like mysteries.&quot; They usually involve a whole lot of sex, a whole lot  of gorgeous, curvy women with whom the protagonist doesn't have sex (unless  he's James Bond, who should have had at least twenty-seven venereal  diseases by now), many things blowing up... you get the idea. And all of  them, at least all that I've read, share a particular writing style, from  Iam Fleming to the team who cranked out the Nick Carter books to David  Wise. Imagine if Dolph Lundgren were narrating a book, and you have the  general idea. Accent and all.<br />  Given that, the good points about David  Wise's The Samarkand Dimension: Lots of gorgeous, curvy women, with whom  protagonist David Markham both does and does not have sex; gunfire  (although nothing blows up); and writing that can be read in a Dolph  Lundgren accent without sounding too terribly silly.<br /><br />  The bad  points: the editing, the proofreading, and the printing. Someone was more  than asleep at the wheel when this thing was edited and proofread.<br />  David Markham is a CIA operative who's chosen to go into the Soviet (yes,  we had Soviets back then) psywarfare installation at Samarkand and try to  find out how far along those evil Russkies are in their psy testing.  They're far enough along to turn a top-secret missile back on its tail and  send it crashing into Vandenberg Air Force Base; what else are they capable  of?<br />  Not a bad plot, and pretty well-handled. And the underlying  mystery (which I can't give away without all kinds of spoilers) ends up  being the kind of whodunit that made me sit there clutching the book and  saying &quot;you guys are GOOD.&quot; I never saw it coming, but then I'm  awfully thick-skulled about this sort of thing sometimes.

Wallace knows how to get her characters drawn and imprinted quickly. And the description of the amusement park is about  as fantastic as the architecture in the house in The Haunting (as bad a  movie as it was, you gotta admit, the house was cool). This is a place I  would love to go to.<br /><br />In any case, the plot: A billionaire has bought  a huge tract of land in NorCal, just outside a town called McKenna's Creek,  and has erected the world's coolest amusement park. The head designer is a  twenty-year-old whiz kid whose contract stipulates that a program will be  put in place allowing five disadvantaged kids per month to come to the  exclusive, and very expensive, park. The first five arrive on the day of  the grand opening for a weeks' stay, and the story focuses on them once the  action gets rolling in the park. Among the minor players are an inquisitive  sherriff, the park's doctor (the last of the McKenna line who gave the town  its name), the kids' chaperone, the PR director of the park, who also  happens to be the billionaire's squeeze-of-the-week, and a sociopathic old  man who lives in the mountains and prophesises doom for the amusement park  because the people who constructed it drilled into the side of the  mountain.<br /><br />Uh oh, I hear you saying, it's another ecohorror novel!  Well, as soon as I encountered Ezra and his prophecies (and this guy is  really in tune with the environment, and points out some weirdnesses to the  reader), I expected that as well... but nothing ever comes of it. We see  oceans of weird carnivorous beetles early on in the book, but they never  actually attack anyone, we never find out where they came from or why  they're there, and they disappear about halfway through with no  explanation. And the amount of ecohorror foreshadowing suggests that it was  laid on with a trowel, but nothing ever happens. When we finally do find  out why things are going wrong at the park, there's no explanation given.  At all. Ever. Some pretty nice moral-dilemma subplots are introduced, and  they fall by the wayside as well. One of the book's main subplots,  regarding one of the disadvantaged kids and the mystery of his sister's  death, is brought to a halt so suddenly one thinks the inept  editor/typesetter types may have skipped a chapter somewhere. There are  enough loose ends at the finishof this book you may think you're swimming  directly below an endless school of Japanese Man-o-War. And that, very  simply, is annoying. But still, it's hard to argue with Wallace's  edge-of-your-seat, up-all-night writing. It's worth a few hours of your  time as an escape, but go into it with your eyes open.

As I mentioned, I've an advance copy of this, so I don't know whether it was ever released to the general public. The fact sheet said Disney had already optioned it for film. It might have actually made a good one; as a  novel, it pretty much stinks.<br /><br />Sherry Estabrook is a Harvard-educated  journalist working for a large newspaper in Miami. She meets Manuel Velo, a  sixteen-year-old high school student who claims to have been the triggerman  for eighteen unsolved murders connected to the Lopez cocaine ring. Sherry,  and her superiors, start seeing Pulitzer Prize nominations everywhere they  go, and Sherry gets drawn far too deep into the case when she realizes  Manuel is in love with her.<br /><br />Okay, so far so good. Or would be, if any  of the characters whatsoever were believable. (This is why I think it'd  make a good movie-- Hollywood doesn't care about movtiation.) This is  another in the seeming series of books I've been reading (all first novels,  not surprisingly) where the characters change emotions like underwear,  allow themselves to be convinced that something is correct when it's  obviously not at least once per page, blah blah blah. There wasn't a single  believable, likable character anywhere in this book. (I had some hopes for  one of the police officers, but he blew it in the end.)<br /><br />So why did I  allow myself to finish turning the four hundred fifty-two pages? Because  it's actually a pretty good storyline. Despite the fact that you know where  this is going by the time you hit page 200, Wetlaufer manages to keep  adding niggling little details that keep the reader wondering what's going  on right up until the last chapter. Of course, you can't have two hundred  fifty-two pages of niggling little details, and there's certainly a lot of  filler to get mired in. But they're paced quite well, and the muck never  gets too deep under the shoes before something intereting pops up.<br /><br />If  you think of it as a story being told you by the drunk on the next stool,  who's attractive enough that you're willing to listen, it's kind of  readable.

Why? Because it's [gasp] SEXUALLY EXPLICIT. (One wonders if those same shelves have V. C. Andrews' novels, and whether said fool has ever \\"flipped through\\" those.) A sexually explicit coming-of-age novel from the eighties. Who'd'a thunk it? And when it comes right down to it, if you really think high school kids haven't already thought about this stuff without having read this book... well, let's put it more simply-- if you're the parent of a high school student who HASN'T thought about all this stuff, you may want to consider getting him this one for Christmas. Sheesh.<br /><br />Because, when it comes right down to it, the first half of this book  reads pretty much exactly like the fantasies of many an adolescent. Which  is not necessarily a bad thing, and may even be a good thing, in a novel  aimed at adolescents (unless the perspective belongs to the parent of the  adolescent, who seems to think that sexual thoughts need to be PUT into  someone's head, rather than just growing there on their own as a  consequence of begin an adolescent. But that's a topic of discussion for  the Dr. Laura list. The rest of you, please, just take my word for it). So  I'm willing to allow all the latitude necessary given that I've pretty much  forgotten adolescence.<br /><br />When I start whining about Fade, then, I'm not  whining about the explicitness of it. And I'm not whining about Cormier's  writing style, for the most part; Fade is miles better than his two  overrated teen \\"classics,\\" the wooden The Chocolate War and the  cardboard I Am the Cheese. It really flies, in fact, and ended up being my  first single-day read of the year. So what's the whining about? The  transparent strategy-changing exactly halfway through the book. One could  argue that the plot, as set up at the end of the book, demads the things  that happen in the middle (we suddenly have a storyline from 1938  interrupted by a storyline fifty years later, with absolutely no  foreshadowing at all). This has been done a million times before, of  course. The difference here is that in 99% of those cases, it's been  handled better. Also, and perhaps this is a minor point, Cormier sets up a  rhythm with his headings, and then breaks it towards the end, leaving the  reader somewhat confused and disoriented as to what, exactly, he's trying  to do.<br /><br />The plot is about as complex as a primitive seesaw. Again,  this is not a bad thing, and in fact contributes to what strengths the book  has. It doesn't need a complex plot to get its point across. The plot being  that a certain family, now living in rural Massachusetts (having emigrated  from Canada), has one person in every generation capable of fading--  turning himself invisible. This trait passes from uncle to nephew (a  never-explained oddity that ends up being a plot point), and has for at  least two hundred years (it has been traced back to the mid-1700s). Paul  Moreaux/Paul Roget, the book's protagonist, is thirteen in 1938, when he  finds out he's the most recent family member to get the fade. His uncle, a  drifter, comes back to town to school him in the ways of the fade. Simple,  right? And in the correct hands, this tale and its obvious moral (if you  spy on people, you're going to be let down by what they do in private--  well, duh) would be a killer. Has been a killer in many cases. But Cormier  suddenly felt the need, halfway through his book, to add a number of  subplots and complexities that made me want to rip my hair out. To keep  playing devil's advocate, after I got used to the fact that we were going  to skip around in time, I almost started enjoying the book again. Paul,  once grown, has to continue the chain-- he searches for the nephew who's  gained the power as well, and finds that one of the clumsiest pieces of  foreshadowing ever written has come true. (Believe me, that's not a  spoiler-- you'll know it the minute you read it.) And, through the jarring,  clumsy mechanisms of the last half of the book, the most-improved-author  status still shines, and I kept reading because here's a guy who's writing  a good, fun story-- the work of an inspired but truly talented member of  the X-Files fan fiction newsgroup is comparable.<br /><br />And then comes the  last paragraph.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can give this one to you without  spoilers. Suffice to say that the mechanism Cormier adopts in the last  paragraph has been done by Stephen King a hundred times over a hundred  times better. It's something that needs to be plotted all the way through a  tale, rather than being a clumsy addition halfway through. (Two words:  Springheel Jack.) If I hadn't been on a crowded train when I closed the  back cover on this one, I'd have flung it for the last paragraph, if for  nothing else. And there's enough else to warrant flinging before, even if  there's also enough else to keep one reading up to that horrid last  paragraph.<br /><br />So what does one do with a book like this?

Yet another book trading on the fallacy that horse trainers are capable of fixing races, and that they bet &quot;inside money&quot; using complicated betting schemes that emerge as betting patterns on the tote board. The idea  is that if you watch the odds on every horse, you'll find a few whose odds  fluctuations suggest insider trading, as it were.<br /><br />The fact of the  matter is that it's next to impossible to fix a horse race in the way these  guys are talking about. It's possible to drug an animal, for good or ill,  and it's possible for a jockey to put a choke-hold on a horse that will  cause him to lose. But causing a horse to lose is not going to guarantee  another will win unless you happen to be in a two-horse race, and they've  never carded all that many of those. (Between 1995 and 1999, I've seen  two.) And the idea of a conspiracy containing every trainer on the grounds  of any given horse track (there are usually betwene two and three hundred  trainers working during any given meet) is just plain ludicrous, especially  when you realize that for the vast majority of those trainers, the  difference between first and second-place money in every race they run is  the difference between the family eating a decent meal and the family  having beans for the eighth day in a row. (Would you want to live in that  house? Hope it has lots of windows.)<br /><br />It makes for entertaining  reading, but that's about it.	2000-06-12

But I kept reading anyway. The show's material came, for the most  part, from the first four chapters of the book, which cover a good deal of  history, and ignored the rest, which is more of a personal accounting of  Dalby's time in Kyoto and her research in Tokyo and some of the smaller  towns.<br /><br />Dalby's account is straightforward and precise, though I don't  want to give the impression there's nothing here that would give the reader  a sense of personal experience; far from it. Dalby, an anthropologist by  nature as well as trade, has a knack for being able to translate emotion  into recognizable speech and get it all down on paper in an  easy-to-understand form.<br /><br />The end result is compulsively readable,  half-journal and half-explication, of the widely misunderstood world of  geisha and the cultural context to which it belongs-- as important to an  understanding of what geisha are as a study of the women themselves. Dalby  adresses the paradox that the women considered the most servile in Japan  are also those with the most freedom, and by the time the book is finished  it's no longer a paradox, really. Dalby takes the reader through the world  of geisha, its history, its context, and most importantly the outside  world's misconception of it. All is explained in such a way as to be easily  absorbed, Not in the tradition of &quot;classic&quot; anthropological works  at all.

Such is the case with Family Honor,  which was written for Helen Hunt. (It's already, of course, been optioned.)<br />  Parker is, of course, best known for the Spenser novels, but when he  chooses to get away from them, more often than not his main character is a  recognizably different person than Spenser is. Sure, Spenser and, say,  Jesse Stone share a few characteristics, but you can tell they're different  people. However, the main wisecracking detective in Family Honor might as  well be named Sunny Spenser. The differences between the two (aside from  the obvious) are negligible. Face it, this is a Spenser novel in drag. And  as far as Spenser novels go, it's a pretty good one. Problem is, it's the  attempt to change the character that grates on my nerves. Hopefully, now  that Ms. Hunt has her film role, Parker will dump this line and get back to  Spenser and Stone. ** 1/2	2000-06-12

You've all read A Wrinkle in Time, and you all thought it was cool. Most of you probably went on to read the other three books in the series. (Some of you probably  sought out the other books in the two series that crossed over with the  Time books, and you don't need to read this review, because you've probably  already read this book.)<br /><br />For the rest of you, who wondered what  L'Engle had been doing since then... A Live Coal in the Sea is her  forty-second book, at least the forty-second listed in the &quot;Books by  Madelieine L'Engle&quot; page. A well-stocked bookstore will have books by  L'Engle in fiction, young adult, drama, poetry, religion, and at least two  or three other categories. I know this because while a bookstore manager I  actually attempted to order a couple of everything she'd written. It was  impossible. I exceeded the weekly budget. Nowadays, or at least in 1996  when this book came out, L'Engle is/was the writer in residence at the  Cathedral of St. John the Divine. I'm not sure how one gets such a job, but  I'll bet a good part of it has to do with writing a book that's been  translated into every major (and many minor) language on Earth and has  probably sold almost as many copies as the Bible.<br /><br />So, the main  question should probably be, has she lost any of that power in the last  thirty-odd years since A Wrinkle in Time made its unassuming debut? And if  not, why aren't her books still selling like hotcakes? The answer to the  second question has to do with the changing priorities in the publishing  business far more than it has to do with L'Engle, and the answer ot the  first question is &quot;not really.&quot; _A Live Coal in the Sea_ is a  simple, warmhearted, moving family-type novel that has about as much in  common with most books that fit that description as The Day the Earth Stood  Still has in common with Plan Nine from Outer Space.<br /><br />The book centers  on Camilla Xanthakos, an astronomy professor at a small university in New  York, and her granddaughter Raffi, a freshman at the same institution. One  evening Raffi comes to Camilla's house and asks, &quot;are you or are you  not my grandmother?,&quot; thanks to a comment from her glamorous,  overstressed, childish father. The book slides between Camilla's  reminiscences of the past, and how they affect Camilla, Raffi, and their  family and friends in the present. In other words, it's another heritage  mystery. But it's handled in such a different way than The Quincunx (for  one point, all the prevarication about whether to tell who about what is  handled offstage, which is why this book is only slightly over three  hundred pages) that, despite the fact that I was reading the two in tandem,  I could draw no connections between them other than the most basic plot  point.<br /><br />Another thing that sets L'Engle apart from her contemporaries,  and this is far more true now than it used to be, is her use of  Christianity in her work. Contemporary Christian novels are far more likely  to deal with God-as-concept rather than the human side of the religion;  that's why it's so refreshing to go back and read Mauriac, or L'Engle's  stuff, instead of trying to choke down these &quot;War in Heaven&quot;  style novels that have little, if anything, to do with the human struggle  to reconcile the existence of some kind of supreme being with what humanity  faces on a day-to-day basis. And the Xanthakos family is faced with a whole  bunch of it, from every direction, including inside (you don't have a  scientist in the family without having the family faith questioned), and  yet still everyone is able to reconcile the faith to the fallacy, and in a  logical manner to boot. Questioning faithful types will probably find some  affirmation in here; nonbelievers who have always wondered how thiking  Christians reconcile things (especially those nonbelievers who have never  been able to get good answers to some questions) may find answers in here.  I did.<br /><br />So the plot's good, the characterizations are fine, the theme  is downright excellent, it's gonna get five stars, right? Nope. It doesn't  quite hit lifechanger level, and the ending is something I'm still trying  to figure out; to say more would consitute spoilage. Still, it's certainly  a worthwhile book to pick up, as is anything by Madeleine L'Engle; the  lady's still turning out better material than most of what's out there.able to get good answers to some questions) may find answers in here.

And that's exactly what I got, though I didn't  expect it to be quite so good. Billson is a writer of the  McInerney/Ellis/Janowitz stripe, and must have gotten this MS. in just  before the cutoff for eighties-style fiction guillotined across the  publishing landscape. However, Billson keeps the greed-is-good atmosphere  to just that-- an atmosphere. When she needs to drop names, she makes them  up rather than sounding like an overworked Sharper Image catalog, as most  of her contemporaries do.<br /><br />The story centers around Duncan and Dora, a  not-quite-couple who, thirteen years ago, were part of a love triangle with  a vampire. The vampire was found out, staked, dismembered, and scattered.  Probalem is... she seems to be back, under another name and with a whole  lot more power, as the head of a publishing empire. What's worse, the  publishing empire happens to run a major fashion magazine... and so  everyone starts dressing, looking, sounding, and otherwise behaving like  vampires. It's comedy, but it's black comedy of the blackest stripe.  Billson's publishers were going for the heavy-lit crowd, and so the blurbs  on the jacket are from writers like Salman Rushdie instead of Stpehen King.  And, oddly, despite this being a comedy/horror novel with a decidedly  eighties bent... it might not be too out of place in the heavy-lit world.  Billson's writing is crisp, while of that same easy-to-read stripe that  distinguishes less heavily-marketed horror novels. Her satire, both of the  vampire-novel genre and of the time, is spot-on.<br /><br />If you like  vampires, hey, it's worth a couple of days. ***	2000-06-12

I never even read the synopsis, and promptly forgot I owned it. Turns out I was  about as far off as i could be. I wouldn't exactly call it fantasy, and I  wouldn't exactly call it horror, and I wouldn't exactly call it an  environmental novel (though that's probably closest to the truth, with  shades of such ecodisaster scenarios Prophecy, the Godzilla movies, and  suchlike running through it). It has aspects of all of them, but never  turns into a full-blown anything, preferring to defy categorization like  many of Simmons' best books do.<br />  Byron Trumbo is a billionaire with an  attitude, a pending divorce, two young lovers who don't know about each  other, and a money-pit Hawaiian resort he's trying to palm off on a group  of Japanese investors who want to make it into a golf club. The problem is,  people keep disappearing at Mauna Pele, and pieces of them turn up at the  worst possible times. Add to this two intrepid adventurers who have come to  Mauna Pele for different reasons (spoilers, again...) and who band together  to try and solve the murders, an overly curious treehugger art curator who  was hired after threatening to sue Trumbo for bulldozing over duck ponds, a  crazed, murderous Hawaiian separatist, and a dimwitted pair of security  guards, and the scene is set for a rollicking good time. All of the major  characters are well-done and believable, if a little over the top sometimes  (while I'm not usually one to balk at such things, the seemingly constant  use of profanity in the book threw me for a loop; I could have done with  less of it). Add cuts where we read sections of the main character's  great-great-aunt's diary; the main character, Eleanor, is following in her  aunt's footsteps, recreating a journey Aunt Kidder took with Samuel Clemens  to the volcanoes on the Big Island (back when Americans knew Hawaii as the  Sandwich Islands).<br />  This was one of the conceits that annoyed me in  the book, and it wouldn't have annoyed me if it hadn't been done so many  times: we find ourselves at a cliffhanger and the diary narration takes  over again. The first time, I liked it. The second time, I liked it. The  third time, I liked it a little less. And so on. However, that was the only  real mark against the novel, and I have to say it certainly held my  interest up to the very last page.

Stephen King has done once again something he has only done once before-- he managed to get four books out in sixteen months. Okay, he cheated a little, releasing a screenplay as his first book of 1999, but then one of the books during the 86-87 deluge was the re-release of The Stand, so who's  counting? Not the fans, who were certainly all too happy to pay the  [money] and change for all four books. And were they worth it? Sure,  if you're a Stephen King fan.<br />  But, just as in the last deluge, there  are bound to be some disappointments. I closed the cover on The Eyes of the  Dragon all those years ago saying &quot;huh?&quot; And while that wasn't my  foremost thought after finishing Hearts in Atlantis, it was up there.  First, when it comes right down to it, it's yet another book about Vietnam,  and we don't NEED yet another book about Vietnam, especially not yet  another book of fiction about Vietnam. To play devil's advocate, however,  the amount of time King actually spends in the jungle in this book is at a  blessed minimum, about the same as Rex Miller does in _Slob_ (or, to cross  genres, a little less than the film time the jungle got in _House_). When  Vietnam is used as a stage setting, or an excuse (as it was in the  aforementioned film), it works better than it does as a weapon of  injustice. We've seen it too many times. We've all watched The Deer Hunter,  Platoon, and another hundred thousand movies that tell us we royally  screwed up, in one way or another, and even the most misguided loyalheaded  mindless patriot who still believes the idea was right (read: me) is  willing to admit that some really big screwups happened along the  communication trail. So be it. Now it's a part of history, thankfully, and  as such it makes a good backdrop for novels set in the sixties. A better  backdrop than love-ins and peace-outs, that's for sure.<br />  Point two (is  there a point two?), and this one goes on the plus side: we've seen both  conventions taken in these stories before, but never done in quite this  way. They read like an odd conglomeration of _The Nick Adams Stories_ and  Robert Altman's short-lived TV series _Gun_, but with interesting twists  thrown in. The object that passes from story to story is almost never in  the hands of the person who passes from story to story. The person who does  so is never the main character; the object is almost always completely  incidental. A thing of beauty.<br />  However, a clever way of wrapping a  bunch of stories together is just that, if there's not all that much meat  to these, and despite the five-hundred-plus-page bulk of this, there really  isn't. Not to say there isn't some fun here, and there's the usual round of  &quot;spot the characters form the other books&quot; and the like, and one  of the stories, &quot;Blind Willie,&quot; will send you into the  thousand-yard stare, wondering how King could take such a simple idea and  turn it into something so astoundingly brilliant...In any case, these five stories (actually, we'll call them  two novellas and three short-shorts-- at least, they're short-shorts for  King) cover forty years in the life of one person, as seen by friends,  lovers, etc., in a kind of impressionist way. We're never completely sure  what happens during those times our subject is out of sight, and neither  are the other characters, but that doesn't stop them from going about their  lives in interesting and usually destructive ways. Of course, we are left  at the end with more questions than we'd like to be, but isn't that the way  with most King novels these days? Everything ties into everything else. We  know we'll get the answers somewhere down the line.<br />  I guess I can't  help comparing this to Bag of Bones and Tom Gordon, thanks to the timing.  And given those two, I have to rank this one at the bottom of the batch.  Not that it's a bad book, not at all; I'd still rather read King than much  of what's on the bestseller list at anygiven time. But in the past sixteen  months King has delivered a one-two punch of his best work this decade,  possibly in all of his career; it's hard to imagine anything would stand up  to that. Still, I'm not sure I'd recommend this one to any except those who  need it to follow along in a series (for DT aficionados, as I mentioned,  this is a must-have, and I'm wondering if some of the unanswered questions  won't end up tying into the what-the-hell-was-THAT? thing at the end of Bag  of Bones).t at any given time.

Nine years and four novels after taking the world hostage with _Blood and Water and Other Stories_, one of the most fiercely original collections of short fiction this century, Patrick McGrath has calmed down somewhat. Okay,  he's calmed down a lot. Rather than giving us fly nightclubs and angels  whose bodies are rotting away from the inside, we have a marriage on the  rocks, a psychotic lover, and the analyst always willing to lend a hand.  Max is being groomed to be the asylum's next superintendent. This, of  course, makes him utterly boring. His wife Stella is, of course, bored.  That is, until she meets Edgar Stark, a patient at the hospital whose  attractive powers are almost supernatural. The two of them get locked into  a tumultuous affair, and the predictable chaos ensues. Problem is, it  ensues... rather slowly.<br />  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this  style of book at this particular time, but it seemed to me that McGrath  could have done the same work in about seventy pages less than he did. He  does, as usual, push the envelope about two paces beyond where you think it  can't possibly take anymore without tearing, and there's no denying that  once the story gets off the ground, the adventures of Stella, Edgar, Max,  Peter, and their friends and intimates is as gripping as &quot;The eROTic  Potato&quot; (if not as graphic or disturbing) . It's just that the story  seems to taxi for an awfully long time before getting clearance to fly.  Interestingly, as well, it picks up momentum even after what would seem to  be the climax in any normal tragic novel. McGrath has a few twists left in  store even then, and the pace gets faster and faster until you hit the last  page and the brick wall that comes with it-- &quot;it's OVER?&quot;<br />  Perhaps this was an experiment in form. After turning it over in my head  for hours, that's the best I can come up with. The writing was pure  McGrath, the characters well-drawn, the plot wicked, but the form left a  little something to be desired. All in all, I must say I liked the other  two McGrath novels I've read (I'm still missing Spider) better-- but that's  not to say this isn't still above average given its many strong points.ft a  little something to be desired.

Some of the time, the public picks up on these and turns them, and their authors, into popular figures. Far more often,  however, they are left in obscurity among the masses while achieving  legendary status among the industry insiders. Anne Rivers Siddons' _The  House Next Door_ is a prime example; Lee Smith's _Oral History_ is another.  And there are many other examples, including this tome, which achieved  something close to legendary status even before its publication-- and then  disappeared, despite having the kudos of almost every major horror writer  of the time thrown at it. Twenty-two years later, Farris is dimly  remembered as having authored the novel that was the basis for the very bad  movie _The Fury_ (1976) and nothing else. Which is something of a crime,  because Farris was above average as far as seventies horror novelists went;  of course, most of those have faded into (well-deserved) obscurity, as  well, but a few live on. And Farris, while not on the same level as King  and Koontz, is certainly no more than a shallow notch below either. And he  was miles above, say, Frank de Felitta, whose every book went to #1 on the  NYT chart and smashed publication records.<br />  That being said, I've read  a smattering of Farris over the years. His work is readable, if not  compulsively so, and it goes quick-- if it weren't for the supernatural  elements, I'd call Farris a writer of slick mysteries in the John D.  MacDonald tradition. He has the same sense of pace and timing, and the same  wry, understated sense of irony that, when it works, is as funny as  anything ever penned by Douglas Adams. And this was right along the same  lines. Not as much a travelogue-style book as many of his others-- this one  is set, alternately, in the Blue Ridge Mountains (in a school obviously  supposed to be VMI), in England, and on a plantation in the deep south  known as Dasharoons. The action takes place in WW2, and ties together the  plantation's owners, who seem to be cursed, and the son of a missionary  doctor in the Congo.<br />  Much of what happens here is, if not  predictable, at least understandable to someone with an extra twenty-two  years of scholarly research on various subjects under his belt. But this  book came before a lot of that research, and so some of the details  contained therein are astounding in their accuracy. (Farris stretches the  truth now and again, but one wonders if that wasn't the going wisdom at the  time on some things.) Of course, telling you what all this research went  into would destroy most of the book's sense of disjunction; you kind of  feel you have a sense of what's going on, but you're not really sure. (It's  possible that those unfamiliar with these areas of research will be  completely out of their depth.)<br />  Because of the advances being made in  anthropology and sociology, the book hasn't held up well on that level. But  that's not the book's fault, and I tried to not penalize the book for  what's gone on around it in the world since. Farris does a good job of  capturing the deep south during WW2, everything has a rational explanations  right up to the end, the characters are drawn well enough so that you start  to worry about what happens to them (if not immersed, a la Walker).

This is billed as science fiction. I'd hesitate to call it that. Yes, it's set in 2065, and yes, it's set on Earth with radical changes in place, but these things seem to take a back seat to the main story. All good science  fiction is character- and plot-driven, of course, but much of it still  seems to have that obsessive fascination with technology; Robinson muses on  the properties of a new thing or two, but ultimately, the story is about  something we've all likely seen over the last twenty years: a zoning fight.<br />  Kevin Claiborne is coming of age in the Orange County of 2065, a kind  of leftist tree-hugging utopia that's all about water control. If you  control the water, you have the world in your hands. (Not surprisingly, the  water is controlled by Los Angeles, but that's another story.) Kevin is the  newest member of the city council, replacing his friend, the newly-elected  mayor Alfredo Blair. In his first meeting as mayor, and Kevin's first  meeting as council member, Alfredo tries to get a hill by Kevin's house  rezoned for commercial use. Kevin opposes, as do two or three other council  members, including the town's new attorney. And thus the battle begins.  Things are complicated when Alfredo's longtime lover leaves him, a woman  with whom Kevin's been in love since the two were kids.<br />  Obviously,  there's a lot going on here, and any one of the subplots probably would  have been enough to fill a novel. As Kevin, Oscar (the attorney), and  Kevin's ex-girlfriend Doris dig a little deeper into Alfredo's company,  they start finding the beginnings of something that would have made a  bang-up spy/intrigue novel. The story of the changing relationships between  Ramona/Kevin/Alfredo and Kevin/Doris/Oscar (it's tough being the point of  two triangles at once!) could have made for a good pseudo-romance/comedy.  The story of Kevin's granfather Tom, a retired lawyer who Kevin and Oscar  convince to come out of retirement to join in the investigation, could have  been a story in and of itself. It seems almost as if Robinson had a series  of books planned around Kevin Claiborne and the battle for Rattlesnake  Hill, and he decided at the last moment to condense the whole thing into  one book. Cheaper for the consumer, sure, but ultimately nowhere near as  satisfying. Threads of the investigation get left off, never to be picked  up again; both triangles are dealt with, at the end, in such a short and  artificial manner that one wonders if Robinson didn't just get sick of  writing the book; the burgeoning relationship between Doris and Oscar  deserved at least another fifty pages of air time.<br />  I may end up  trying out another Robinson novel in the coming years, but this one hasn't  made it any higher a priority.tion, could have  been a story in and of itself.

And they're probably  right.<br /><br />Thankfully, I'm a year or so too old to have been assigned  this in school, and I picked up a copy vaguely remembering classmates below  me had had to read it. Perhaps my lack of memory about much of my high  school and college days is a good thing, because I went into this novel  without any preconceptions. I also went into it having read a few books  from Heinemann's African Writers Series over the past few months, so I have  something of a grasp on what African novelists were doing in the late  fifties. (Not a bad idea, actually, since the &quot;storytelling&quot;  nature of such tales can be jarring to someone who's used to modern  American lit-- for example, your typical high school student.) All this  being the case, Things Fall Apart, considered by many western critics to be  the premier work of African literature of this century, may be quite  deserving of its laurels.<br /><br />Okonkwo is a tribal elder in Umuofia, a  large village in southern Nigeria. He's the very essence of a self-made  man, having inherited nothing from his father. Of course, events can't just  go on day to day as we want them to, and a series of stumbling blocks face  Okonkwo after he is given the care of a teenager the village has taken as a  spoil of war.<br /><br />The book is compared to classical Greek tragedy, and  there are certainly elements of it here. However (remembering recent  reading in Abel), to cast this as a true Greek tragedy would force a  reading that says the tribal gods sent Christian missionaries to Umuofia in  order to punish Okonkwo for various transgressions. I'm about halfway to  accepting that this is what Achebe was after, actually. Otherwise, one is  forced to read this in kind of the same way as the old joke whose punchine  is &quot;Job, something about you just sporks me off.&quot;<br /><br />One way  or the other, the writing is fluid, easy, and captivating, and the  storytelling style is one I've always been drawn to (as opposed to the  missionaries-- one white person, at the very end of the book, thinks to  himself that one of the most annoying things about the tribe is their  &quot;superfluity&quot;).

And that might not be  a bad thing. I get the feeling Uyemoto was one of the authors snapped up in  the wake of the success of McInerney, Bret Easton Ellis, and the other  wunderkind (Uyemoto was 19 when Rebel Without a Clue came out), when, as  one pundit put it, &quot;if you hadn't written your first novel by the time  you were twenty-five, you were dogmeat.&quot; And Rebel Without a Clue  suffers from most of the same problems that its more popular big brothers  and sisters did-- it just isn't about all that much.<br />  Granted, Uyemoto  tackles a subject that's weighed down with emotion as it is-- a male model  comes home from New York and tells his best friend, and only his best  friend, that he has AIDS. (Interesting how he seems to have gotten it  without having gotten HIV; in the hands of a more capable author, this  could have been a Duesbergian masterpiece, but it seems as if Uyemoto just  kind of forgot.) And it's possible that most readers will bring their own  well of emotion to the table any time the acronym is mentioned. And  granted, it appeared at a time when very few authors were dealing with the  subject. But that's not an excuse for allowing your charcaters to change  their viewpoints on someone else without knowing the full story. Thomas,  the model, tells Christian, his best friend. He's also told his mother and  stepfather (and the stepfather is one of the only clearly-drawn characters  here, and is thoroughly unlikable). No one else knows, but still, the  perceptions of their circle of kind-of-friends change towards him from a  basic annoyance at &quot;the famous one&quot; to an active dislike as we go  along, and we're never told why. As well, a lot of relationships in the  book are just presented to us, static and without resolution, most notably  Christian's relationship with his sometime-girlfriend Christabel. But I  could probably have forgiven all of that and let the book get away with at  least a ** 1/2 were it not for one thing that I despise (which is probably  what drew the critics to it in the first place)-- Uyemoto's heavy-handed  and liberal use of upper-middle-class/upperclass Northern California late  80s slang. One of the true pleasures of finishing this book is that  hopefully I will never again have to read about someone talking to someone  else on the tele about needing a vaca. I ended up wanting to gut a few of  the less literate characters. Thankfully, Thomas and Christian wander  through a number of different landscapes, most of which don't have annoying  slang-- at least, not in the book-- and so pieces of it are spared.<br />  Ultimately, a completely unsatisfying journey, though I have to give it  credit for compelling me to read to the end to find out if any of the loose  ends get tied up.

And  they all deal with a few months in the life of what must be an enormously  entertaining character; how on earth did this chap get to be the Phantom of  the Opera? This is the question Susan Kay set out to answer when writing  her novel Phantom, and she's done quite an admirable job of it. Sure, she  gets a few minor marks against her for continuing the melodrama, but one  feels, often, that those times when she slips a bit are more in homage to  what has come before her novel than any failing on her part.<br />  Erik,  the person who later becomes the Phantom, is born to a young widow in  France who debates the idea of killing him outright from day one. We cover  the first nine years of Erik's life, until he runs away from home, and the  rest of the book is given to us as impressions, giving us insight as to how  the Phantom came to have the many talents he possesses in Leroux's original  work. Along the way, if you throw out the small melodramas that play out,  what we come up with in the end is a complex, fascinating man shunned by  society due to his monstrous deformities. (And in all honesty, the  deformities don't really sound all that monstrous, what little detail we  get of them.) Once again we find ourselves with a book that probably could  have used a slightly more zealous editor; those first nine years almost had  me dustbunnying the book, which would have been a huge mistake. If you feel  yourself lagging, persevere; give yourself at leats a hundred pages. It  DOES pick up, and is definitely worth the effort. (If you get to Rome and  you still haven't gotten into it, it is safely dustbunnyable.)<br />  I  wouldn't rightfully characterize this as a quick read, but then I may have  just picked it up at the wrong time.

Books	3	8	13	N	N	Face it, the guy's funny	First and foremost: it is worth noting (and it pains an saddens me that this is the case) that the phrase &quot;Youth, Innocence, and a Bad Haircut&quot; is the first time I have seen a three-item list with correct  grammar in a book printed in America after World War II.<br />  Second, and  not quite so foremost: P. J. O'Rourke is a very, very funny guy. He is  completely politically incorrect, in most cases, and is therefore more than  happy to pull out the jokes, puns, and other humorous concepts his more  liberal colleagues have left to the dust.<br />  Third, and not really far  up there on the scale, but still worth mentioning: in most ways, P. J.  O'Rourke is a tremendous boon to the right-wing American. He's not afraid  to take pot-shots at just about anything, including fellow members of the  right (Pat Buchanan is roasted almost as often as Bill Clinton), and he's  not afraid to admit his mistakes, such as endorsing Clinton in 1992.<br />  Combine those, and for most of this book you have a tremendously funny  read, an almost literary roasting of such things as book tours, drinking,  stupid sports, Whitewater, various makes and models of automobile, and the  like. Unfortunately, it's the part that falls outside the realm of  &quot;most&quot; that keeps this from being one of the finest political  collections of the past decade. There are times when O'Rourke, who seems to  be sitting right on the Libertarian partyline, veers far off to the left,  and if he is to be trusted he was stuck out there in at least one case by  the head of the Cato Institute (making me wonder how Libertarian they truly  are), and he also has many of the strange and illogical hang-ups that keep  me from ever wanting to vote Republican. He also, and he is well aware of  it, asks a lot of our indulgence in the book's second section, a collection  of short stories published (well, most of them) in the National Lampoon  during his tenure as editor in chief there. Anyone who still wonders why I  abhor the very idea of self-publishing need only read the section &quot;The  Truth About the Sixties and Other Fictions&quot; in this book. It's  shameless, awful, contorted, constipated prose, and O'Rourke is fully aware  of this, and even says so in a few places.<br />  But if you skip that  section, and immediately stop reading any time you find one of those places  where conservatives suddenly dismiss anything relating to logic (I have  often theorized it's remnants of too many drugs during the sixties), this  is most definitely a worthwhile book. Both the automobile and sports  sections brought forth guffaws.

So what  would happen if a major earthquake hit New York City?<br />  Such is the  subject of the meticulously-researched novel by broadcast journalist Chuck  Scarborough, Aftershock. He posits an earthquake in NYC in 1994 (oops), and  it's obvious from the writings about the earthquake and the structural  damage it is likely to do to various buildings in New York that Scarborough  spent a lot of time talking about this with Ketter. And had the earthquake  and its aftereffects remained the stars of this novel, it really might have  been, as Robert B. Parker blazons on the front, &quot;surely the most  compelling novel of natural disaster...&quot; However, I get the feeling  that, in the actual review, what followed that ellipsis was &quot;...this  week.&quot;<br />  Scarborough is absolutely, completely, thoroughly,  utterly incapable of any kind of characterization whatsoever. His cardboard  cutouts meander around the playing field attempting to show emotion and  failing miserably, even in the wake of a huge natural disaster. As well,  there are more then enough plotlines and subplots here to carry a book  easily three times this one's four-hundred-page length, but many of them  are ended far too abruptly, are forgotten for hundreds of pages and then  picked up again for a paragraph, and other similarly annoying things. Even  the section separators don't work in any consistent way (for about a  hundred pages, the double lines separate different stories in different  parts of the city, but then they stop doing so and are thrown in at random,  it seems). Worst of all is the writing style itself. A representative  sample: &quot;Brendan and Sam could see from the helicopter the Alwyn Court  on fire.&quot; Uh huh. A sentence any more twisted would have debilitating  arthritis.<br />  Still, it managed to keep me reading, and I guess that's  something.

2429595:US	50068216	RJUAYF0S166HF	156858122X	549191476	Extremities (Writers & Readers Documentary Comic)	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Another excellent book from Koja	There can be little doubt anymore that Kathe Koja is America's finest living writer. From the moment her first short story was published close to ten years ago (&quot;Illusions in Relief,&quot; reprinted here), the world  heralded the coming of the first truly original writer since Clive Barker,  and Koja went-- and still goes-- places Barker has never trod. 1991 saw the  publication of more stories and the first novel, _The Cipher_, which still  stands as the single finest surrealist work in the English language. After  a slight slip which shall remain nameless, she returned to publish two of  those rare novels that are perfect in every way, Skin and Strange Angels.  And throughout, every once in a while she'd unleash another story upon the  world in some small, out-of-the-way magazine, or some small-press  collection of cutting-edge horror bought by the few thousand faithful who  are aware of the genius that is the &quot;new horror.&quot; Meanwhile, the  rest of the world has overlooked Koja and her contemporaries... until now.  Four Walls Eight Windows, one of the most prestigious and well-distributed  of the literary presses, has signed both Kathe Koja and Lucius Shepard,  among others. _Extremities_ is the first offering of what I can only  half-jokingly call the new era of Four Walls Eight Windows, and it's a  barnburner, all right.<br /><br />That's not to say it doesn't slip now and  again. When Koja's on, she's on, and when she's off, she's still pretty  close to on, but there's a difference in tone to those stories where she's  off. They don't grab and hold quite as well. It's more allowable in an  eight or ten page story than it is in a two hundred page novel like Bad  Brains (oops, there, I said it), but there's still a change, almost as if  the air around the reader warms a few degrees and becomes more comfortable.<br /><br />So what is it about &quot;the new horror&quot; that makes it markedly  different horror of the Stephen King variety-- and, for that matter,  everything that's come after, such as splatterpunk, cyberhorror, and all  the other neat little catchphrases-- deals in the monster, wheter that  monster is the panther stalking through Central Park, the many-eyed horror  from outer space, or the soul of a psychopath. And whether you show the  panther (as in the 1982 Cat People) or show what may be the shadow (as in  the 1944 Cat People), you're still dealing in the monster. &quot;The new  horror&quot; likes to deal more in the surreal-- the horror is in the  absence of the monster, or perhaps the fear that you'll open the door and  the monster won't be there. Surrealism, defined, is mainly composed of  unrequited longing, something that many of the new surrealists have never  grasped. Perhaps, then, the mantle needs to come down to the (do I need to  say it again?) authors whose fiercely original stories and novels cause far  more shuddering than the new, ponderous tomes by the old masters.<br /><br />And  that's what Koja's done best, since day one. &quot;Illusions in  Relief&quot; is a short, quite deranged story about an artist whose work is  rumored to be, in some odd way, faith-healing. And as the story unfolds,  you see that it's not faith-healing, it's something else entirely; but  _what_ that something else is is never explained. You don't know. And you  don't care, because some part of you doesn't WANT to know, just like you  didn't want to know what was really at the bottom of the funhole in _The  Cipher_ (or whether the funhole even had a bottom). It's never explained,  and it shouldn't be, because what scares humanity most is that very lack of  explanation. Once you know that the monster in the corner is a bathrobe  draped over a chair, it's no longer scary. And horror doesn't have to be  supernatural, either; &quot;The Ballad of the Spanish Civil Guard&quot;  covers the last twenty-four hours of the life of Federico Garcia Lorca, and  a more horrific twnety-four hours may never have been spent by any human  being.<br /><br />Extremities is not yet out of print, but judging by the length  of time it took Borders to order it for me, it's probably pretty close. I'd  suggest you find a copy of this as soon as humanly possible, or it will  become just as hard to find as all of Koja's other books.n spent by any human  being. <br /><br />Extremities is not yet out of print, but judging by the length  of time it took Borders to order it for me, it's probably pretty close.

His dentist quotes Seneca constantly. One of his students is trying to come up with a dramatic protest of the Vietnam war. He has invented (or has he?) a number  of events surrounding a mythical (or is he?) Field Marshal General who  happens to be the uncle of Starusch's ex-fiancee, whom Starusch-- or  someone else-- may or may not have murdered with a bicycle chain.<br />  Such is the platform from which Local Anesthetic takes its course.  Throughout this novel, I was reminded almost constantly of Alain  Robbe-Grillet's style in The Erasers and The Voyeur. Worthy of imitation,  certainly, as those are two of Europe's finest contributions to  twentieth-century literature. but hard to imitate. And, were Grass not a  consummate novelist, this would have come off even worse than it did.<br />  One gets the feeling that, unlike Robbe-Grillet, Grass actually wanted the  reader to be able to figure out what in the world was really happening in  this odd, nightmarish world of late-sixties East Germany. But the only  thing that reader can truly be sure of is the way that Scherbaum, the  protesting student, is going to react to things. And Scherbaum's  predictability, which would be a weakness in most novels, instead anchors  the reader to some semblance of reality as the possibly-mythical Sieglinde  Krings and her uncle weave in and out of the arguments the schoolteacher  (Starusch) has with the dentist (who is never named), the arguments  Scherbaum has with his sometime-girlfriend Vero, the debates Starusch has  with his friend Irmgard Siefert, the wargames Sieglinde and the General  conduct in a huge sandbox... you get the idea.<br />  Grass manages (almost)  to carry this novel off with his trademark combination of wit, silliness,  and political invective against both sides of the utterly stupid post-WW2  and pre-wall-falling German government. But there seem to be too many  places where things wander off and are never really picked up again. Too  many loose threads are left undone at the end of this novel, and there  isn't the kind of evidence one would need to wrap it all up oneself.<br />  I'd recommend this particular Grass novel only to completists; for those  who want to see an excellent example of this style of writing, check out  the aforementioned novels by Alain Robbe-Grillet (the Grove Press editions)  and be utterly blown away.f and are never really picked up again.

The year is never given, but the century is, close to the end of the book, and it is set in Europe in the 1800s. The head of the British Secret Service has uncovered a plot by three of the continent's most powerful figures to overthrow the King of England. The plot has been twenty years in the making, and is about to come to a head. As all this is going on, a scientist in the employ of that same Secret Service has stumbled upon a discovery that will change the face of intrigue forever; he has discovered a way for humans to change their shapes. How better to spy on the conspirators than to send them those things they most obsess over? Three Secret Service agents, one of them a new recruit, are chosen as the main agents on the mission. One is sent to the German conspirator, a collector of fine glass and porcelain, as a crystal goblet of unparalleled delicacy; a second to the French conspirator, a gardener by hobby, as a heretofore-undiscovered breed of rose; a third to the Italian conspirator, a collector of sculpture, as a Milanese Thisbe. Of course, as with any decent spy novel, things start to go wrong just as everyone is settling in.<br /> It's impossible to describe some of the novel's strongest points without giving away pieces of the plot. Polly, the new recruit and the novel's central character (if there is, truly, a central character here), finds herself on a journey that we're never told the nature of; it could be a spiritual journey, it could be an allegorical journey, it could be some physical trip to an alternate universe. We don't know. We couldn't care less. The end result is the same, and we are stunned by it. Similarly, revealing the slightest point of the plot would bring the whole intricate construction of the first hundred fifty or so pages down. In fact, revealing the shape-changing nature of the agents already takes away from the book, but I can't just say &quot;it's the best damn book I've ever read, go get a copy.&quot; You're going to have to hunt high and low for one, I think, unless bookfinder.com happens to have a few lying around. So now you've got an idea of what it's about, kind of. But what is truly amazing about this book is its construction, its writing. It's not only set in the nineteenth century, it sounds as if it were written during the nineteenth century, but with a modern sensibilty. I'm not sure I can describe exactly what I mean, but books written before about WW2 or thereabouts have more of a sense of leisure (for want of a better term) about them. Hawthorne is supposed to be lingered over. Description is as important as plot. You are less following the action than immersed in it.  And that is much of what Walker does here, though we rarely lose sight of what is going on around us. As well, and this is even less able to be imparted without expending a thousand or so words, it becomes obvious while reading that the fifteen years that Walker spent writing this novel were actually spent _writing_ this novel, not stopping and starting over and over again. There is an overwhelming sense of order and construction. There are very, very few places in the four hundred fifty-nine pages that make up this work-- to be precise, I counted two-- where it seems as if Walker slipped into cliche or took the easy way out in writing a passage. And by the time I encountered those, I was so entranced with the book's language that I felt as if those stray sentences were put there on purpose in order to draw the reader's attention to the care that had been taken with the rest of the book.<br /> This book is not, in any way, an easy read. It demands time and concentration. More importantly, it is also a compelling book, a haunting book, one which stays with a reader whenever it is put down, until it is picked up again.<br /> Easily an entry on the All-Time Top Ten list, and perhaps at the top of it.

I've been walking around calling this woman &quot;Tanarive Due&quot; for years.  Oops.<br /><br />My Soul to Keep, whatever else it does, does not suffer from  sophomore-effort slump. If anything, this is better then The Between, her  debut, in that her plot is tighter, easier to follow, and more flowing. The  Between suffered from an attempt to keep what was going on mysterious; no  such problem here. We know from the beginning (well, unless we're REALLY  thickheaded) who killed Rosalie Tillis Banks, and why.<br /><br />The story  centers on Jessica Wolde, an investigative reporter, her husband David, and  their daughter Kira. We open with the death of Miz Banks, and in the next  scene, the death of Princess, the Wolde's great dane. These two events, and  those that follow them, lead the Woldes (Jessica, a human, and David, an  immortal-- but his wife doesn't know it) down a path to forbidden knowledge  and the existential crises that come from sharing said forbidden knowledge.<br /><br />Despite the fact that, put as above, it sounds thoroughly silly, My  Soul to Keep really isn't all that bad a book. Due is good at giving us  easy-to-follow and consistent characters, even when they're in the midst of  figuring out who they really are (which is usually an excuse for an author  to make a character behave inconsistently). She gives us a straightforward  and easy-to-follow plot, though at times it seems the plot is nothing more  than a framework upon which to draw David's character (which is not  necessarily a bad thing). And she gives us just enough jolts in just enough  unfamiliar areas that we're not exactly sure what's going to happen. So  while the prevailing mystery is easy enough to solve, and many of the other  little obvious mysteries that pop up are just as easy, we're distracted  from the real job of figuring out the little details, and those are what  shift underneath the reader and keep the book interesting.<br /><br />It's a fun  little read, quick and easy, worth the couple of days it will take you to  get through it.ut the little details, and those are what  shift underneath the reader and keep the book interesting. <br /><br />It's a fun  little read, quick and easy, worth the couple of days it will take you to  get through it.	2000-06-12

You hit a point where you've just had something  really exciting happen at Point A. You've got a great idea for something  exciting to happen at Point B. And you've got this really big space in  between (Side 3 of Pink Floyd's The Wall, for example). How do you get from  point A to point B without boring the life out of your  reader/listener/viewer/whatever?<br /><br />There are two choices. Choice A is  used by visual artists a whole lot: ignore that span of time. Cut it out.  Make it go away. Deus ex machina: &quot;And then three years passed.&quot;  You get a more impressionist work, and you risk losing some of your fan  base, because they don't have the mental capacity to make the jump.<br /><br />Choice B is used by almost everyone who writes books and/or music,  and that is the transitional piece. Queensryche's fabulous concept album  _Operation Mindcrime_ would be a perfect disc if not for the opening song  on side two. Pink Floyd... well, I've already gone there. Point is, there's  a weak link in every chain. The one book, one song, one whatever that  contains a few useful tidbits but otherwise could have been ten minutes or  four hundred pages shorter. In the present scenario, that book is The Waste  Lands.<br /><br />To be fair, given that this problem seems to be ubiquitous,  King does some good with it, using this five-hundred-plus page monstrosity  to bring back some old faces and acquaint us with some new ones (would it  be a spoiler to tell you we've got a new adversary here whom you know from  another, non-Dark Tower book or two?), drops a few more hints about the war  that caused the world to move on, introduces us to the author of that war,  a man named Fannin/Fanon (mentioned in Drawing of the Three as the leader  of the opposing forces, and here given us as The Ageless Stranger, who we  were told early on will be the final obstacle to Roland gaining the Tower),  and gives us the latter half of the series' equivalent of Walter in the  Tick-Tock Man. Did that last paragraph confuse you? It should have. The  book probably will, too, although King gives all that to us in a lot more  words. He also gets us from point A to... well, about halfway to point B  (and the ending of this book will make you throw it across the room,  guaranteed-- it's such a shocker that King felt the need to reprint the  last eleven pages of The Wastelands as the prologue to Wizard and Glass!).  We get to know the characters we already know a little better. We see more  full-color illustrations (Dameron's just not right for this, Grant should  have stuck with Hale, whose work for DOT was the best in the series to  date).

We hope  for a better book in Wizard and Glass (and, for those of you following this  thing through to the bitter end, let me assure you that we get it).

After just over two months of struggling with this boring, inspsid, uninspiring novel, I finally sent it flying out the window into a convenient rainstorm last week. It's not so much that it's a BAD book,  really (although insipid is probably the best word I can think of to  describe it), it's just that it's been done so much better. Okay, here's  the scenario. Young girl from small town is swept off her feet by  cosmopolitan socialite, gets pregnant, gets married, finds out that life  married to cosmopolitan socialite ain't that great, has kid, leaves  cosmopolitan socialite, cos. so. marries second wife, first wife and  daughter heal rift. Hmmmm. We've never heard THAT one before.<br /><br />Once  again, we have an overused half-baked plot, and we have a convenient piece  of excellent work to hold it up against. If you want a dysfunctional family  circus, it's hard to do better than Michael Cunningham's _Flesh and Blood_.  It's good that people try, because eventually someone _will_ write a  better, funnier, sadder, more intimate novel than Cunningham's, but the  discerning reader will realize, by now, that in order to find the bigger  pearl, one will be reading a whole lot of swine.	2000-06-12

Brian Moore may toddle off into  obscurity as we wander through the next century. As a writer of what I can  only call &quot;literary mysteries,&quot; Moore and his mentor, Greene,  stand with a handful of others, almost all British-- Geoffrey Household and  Stephen Gregory are, in fact, the only two I can think of off the top of my  head, and they, too, are destined for obscurity.<br />  In this, his  eighteenth (and last?) novel, Moore gives us Pierre Brossard, a Vichy  sergeant who was pardoned of his war crimes in 1971, but has since been  re-charged with the international Crime Against Humanity for the murder of  fourteen Jews at Dombey during WW2. Brossard has been hiding with the Roman  Catholic church for forty-four years, moving from abbey to abbey, concealed  both by the Vichy-sympathizing elements in Mother Church and higher-ups in  the French government. But with these new charges come new dispensations  from a new Juge D'instruction and a far more liberal Pope, and he finds the  doors of many of his old hideaways closed to him again, just as a new  terrorist group is sending assassins after him for the murder of the Dombey  Jews.<br />  The synopsis of the book on its jacket doesn't really give much  in the way of hope for this being all too gripping a novel; to continue the  comparisons to Greene, this is more an End of the Affair than it is a Third  Man. But that doesn't mean it's still not a cracking good detective story.  Interestingly, all the major players are given to you within the first few  chapters; it's up to you to figure out who they are and how they tie in (it  is eerily reminiscent of Heinrich Boll's novels in this regard). Beneath  the detective story lies the story of France itself, still struggling to  find a national identity more than forty years after the end of World War  II.<br />  Despite all the heavy-sounding material, it really is a rather  quick read, and it moves along fast enough that you can keep the pages  turning with minimal effort.itself, still struggling to  find a national identity more than forty years after the end of World War  II. <br />   Despite all the heavy-sounding material, it really is a rather  quick read, and it moves along fast enough that you can keep the pages  turning with minimal effort.	2000-06-12

There are some characters who have been around so long and are so consistent that they fit like an old pair of jeans; there are some books that are so easy and go down so smooth that they can be read in one gulp.  The character, of course, is Spenser; the book, Sudden Mischief, the latest  Spenser novel from the typewriter of Robert B. Parker.<br /><br />These books  are designed for one-stop reading. They take three hours, give or take for  your reading speed, and are meant to be devoured by the fire with a bottle  of Jack Daniels for company. The plots are pretty similar, and many of the  same things happen (Spenser cooks. Spenser quotes Spenser. Spenser beats  people up. Spenser and Hawk trade jibes.). Basically, the Spenser novels  are genre fiction, formulaic, pure and simple. But they're GOOD genre  fiction. Spenser is an easy guy to like, as long as you're not on his bad  side. He's intelligent, he makes a mean plate of spaghetti, he's got the  cutest sidekick in the business (Hawk can rough me up any time!), he knows  his medieval literature, and he's pretty good at walking the balance  between solving crimes and committing them. What's not to like?	2000-06-12

I've read this one before, but it's been long enough that I didn't remember whether I liked McDougall all that well, or whether the pack rat in me was holding onto this, so I took  another spin through it. And I was holding onto it because it's good.  McDougall writes short, to-the-point, and oftentimes very funny things that  conceal the usual subjects of poetry-- pain, loss, existential crises. But  it isn't often that they're presented with such good humor:<br /><br />Coming  Back, I Visit Myself<br /><br />I knock twice on the door of the old apartment.  A woman lets me in. My silver toiletries. My plants. My knife and fork and  napkin. I look to see what has died or been given away but everything is  here.<br /><br />I say nothing. I am not supposed to say anything. I poke my  head in the closet looking for the good green dress.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Oftentimes it seems that the best poetry is created with unexpected  juxtaposition, just as the best humor is, and one wonders at times why  humor is not used as a device more often in poetry. And while I'd hesitate  to go so far as to draw a comparison between McDougall, a relatively  understated humorist, and Mel Brooks, it's certainly not out of the  question. This is a fine little book, one which will remain on my shelves  to be read again after enough time has passed that I have let the memory of  the small pleasures contained herein blur, and I'll likely be just as  pleasantly surprised again at how good a book this is.	2000-06-12

I suggest tackling it the same way I did: read The Tin Drum, start Reddick's book at the same time you start Cat and Mouse  (Reddick reads faster than Grass, and you'll get through a lot of Reddick  while tackling Grass), and when you've caught up, read Reddick's section on  Dog Years and the actual novel concurrently.<br /><br />Those of you who feel  the revelation of anything having to do with a book before you get to that  part in the book is a spoiler should probably avoid this technique; Reddick  revelas the major &quot;mystery&quot; in Dog Years towards the end of his  section on Cat and Mouse. However, one cannot really consider Dog Years a  mystery, despite the various things that happen within it; while there are  some elements to it that keep the reader guessing, Dog Years is, more than  anything, a savage satire on Germany during the WW2 years. And as such,  finding out the main mystery-that's-not-a-mystery should not detract at all  from one's appreciation of the book itself.<br /><br />Dog Years can also stand  on its own, without being read as a part of the Danzig Trilogy, but the  reader's appreciation of many facets of this novel-- most notably Edouard  Amsel's character and the satire itself-- are more easily appreciated when  you have The Tin Drum and Cat and Mouse under your belt as comparisons.  Amsel, the main protagonist of Dog Years, stands as a direct comparison to  both Oskar and Mahlke, and his character is more easily understood when  those two have already been assimilated by the reader.<br /><br />The plot of  Dog Years is a simple enough one; it charts, through the use of three  narrators, the frindship of Edouard Amsel and Walter Matern from grade  school through their early thirties. Amsel, the intellectual one, is picked  on constantly by his classmates (including Matern) until one day, for no  apparent reason, Matern befriends Amsel and chases away the others. It's a  typical buddy-relationship in that Amsel is the brains and Matern is the  brawn, but we don't get the bonding we've come to expect from seeing too  many Hollywood buddy films. The relationship between Matern and Amsel is  far more complex than that, and Reddick has done a passable job of  interpreting it, one which I won't attempt to recreate here (it would be  ludicrous to attempt something that complex in such a forum as a review).  In an odd lapse, though-- especially given how much emphasis Reddick has  put on Grass' enmity and stire of the Roman Catholic Church in the previous  two books-- Reddick seems to have overlooked one of the most obvious  interpretations of Amsel's character (and also that of the more minor  protagonist Jenny Brunies), as a christ figure. In the novel's central  scene, both Amsel and Brunies (who are both made out, in the first half of  the novel, to be almost comically fat) undergo a transformation that  transforms Brunies into a ballet sensation and Amsel into another character  entirely, the omnipotent Goldmouth; while there is no physical crucifixion  here, the path taken by Amsel's character through the rest of the novel  certainly implies the path of christ after the resurrection, until his  assumption into, in this case, Berlin. For the next hundred or so pages,  Goldmouth is never actually seen, only referred to in the good deeds he  does for others, and he achieves an almost legendary status among the rank  and file for his goodness, his power (in postwar germany, his power is in  his connections; who he knows), and the fact that no one really sees him  much, but everyone is aware of his presence and his acts. However, Reddick,  in his attempt to (successfully) parallel Amsel's character with that of  Grass himself, never examines this aspect of Amsel.<br /><br />This lack also  leads to Reddick drawing the conclusion that Dog Years is the weakest of  the three books, while still proclaiming that as a whole they rank as the  finest piece of modern German literature extant today. I feel Reddick is  giving Dog Years short shrift here; while the book does, in fact, have its  faults, they are faults shared by the other two novels as well, and I came  away from Dog Years thinking that, to the contrary, it was the strongest  and most absorbing of the three. While it was more difficult than the other  two, it was also more rewarding and more absorbing; it's not often I'll put  in three months on one novel, but at no time did I feel that it ever  stopped moving me along, and at no time did I ever feel that it was time to  put the book down for good.<br /><br />Keeping this seeming oversight of  Reddick's in mind, I still have to recommend his book as a perfect  accompaniment to Grass' most famous three novels, and all four of them  deserve the attention of every serious student of literature.t as a whole they rank as the  finest piece of modern German literature extant today.

Think of him as a depression-era Stephen King. The parallel's not all that odd; _Seven Footprints_ was one of the first books optioned  for film before it actually came out (the film came out in 1929, starred  Creighton Hale as Kirkham and Thelma Todd as Eve, and is probably best  remembered for featuring, in a very very small role, Loretta Young).<br /><br />James Kirkham is a professional adventurer who's caught the eye of,  yes, the diabolic one. Satan puts him to a test: he's got a game rigged up  where there are seven steps from the floor of Satan's chamber to the top of  this ziggurat-like thing. A machine randomly assigns four steps to be good  and three to be bad. The person playing the game steps on any four of those  seven, and depending on how many bad steps he steps on, he pays the piper  (zero: you get to rule the world, one: you owe Satan one service, two: you  owe Satan a year of service, three: you're up the creek). The person  playing can stop, voluntarily, after any number of steps.<br /><br />While in  the custody of the big guy, Kirkham meets, and becomes enchanted with, the  beautiful Eve, and the two of them try to hatch a plot to escape the  clutches of the guy with the big trident, aided by an old friend of  Kirkham's who just happens to have found himself in the same situation.<br /><br />Yup, it's sensational adventure-type stuff, easy reading, G. A. Henty  for adults. Good for escapism, but is kind of like sherbet; it's close to  tasteless, goes down easily, and by the time you're done with the next  course, you've forgotten it.	2000-06-12

Cat and Mouse is the second book in Grass' Danzig Trilogy, three books that look at life in Danzig under the Nazi  regime from three different points of view (the tales are told  concurrently, and time can be fixed by seeing the same event from different  points of view; for example, the picnic taken by the jazz trio and Schmuh  in Book III of The Tin Drum shows up towards the end of Cat and Mouse, and  Matern, one of the main characters of Dog Years, shows up in The Onion  Cellar, where Oskar's jazz band is retained, in The Tin Drum).<br /><br />Cat  and Mouse is actually a novella, originally a part of Dog Years that broke  off and took on a life of its own; on the surface it is the tale of Joachim  Mahlke, a high school student with a protruding adam's apple (the Mouse of  the title), and his fascination with a sunken Polish minesweeper after he  learns to swim at the age of thirteen. It is also the story of Pilenz, the  narrator and Mahlke's best friend. The two spend their high school years in  wartime Poland, reacting to various things, and that's about as much plot  as this little slice of life needs.<br /><br />The interesting thing about Cat  and Mouse is its complete difference in tone from the other two novels.  Both The Tin Drum and (what I've read so far of) Dog Years have the same  high-pitched, almost hysterical humor combined with a profound sense of  teleology (not surprising given the apocalyptic nature of life in Danzig  under the Nazis); Grass attempts to confront the horror with over-the-top  slapstick, because only through that kind of comparison is it possible to  make the reader understand. But while Cat and Mouse has its moments of the  same kind of ribald humor, it is more dignified, in a sense, and closer to  reality; enough so, at least, that when the book reaches its inevitable  climax and denoument, one feels more genuine, or more human, reactions to  the fates of Pilenz and Mahlke than one does to Oskar, the hero of The Tin  Drum. Perhaps that is why it was segmented off from Dog Years; perhaps  there was another reason. Whatever the case, it stands on its own and as an  integral part of Grass' magnum opus.e human, reactions to  the fates of Pilenz and Mahlke than one does to Oskar, the hero of The Tin  Drum.

There's something about horror stories. Everyone has one good one in them, but with the exception of a handful of writers (Ellison, Kathe Koja, a few others) whose work is consistently well above the bar, you're more likely  to come up with a writer whose work is usually medicore, but who every once  in a while lets fly with something so wonderful that the whole world needs  to know about it. And thus the continuing popularity of the horror story  anthology; the quest to try and find all these truly great stories from any  given time period and collect them all into one large volume.<br /><br />I'm sure  you all have short lists of the truly great stories from otherwise mediocre  short story writers, at least as long as you've read enough horror to know  them. King's &quot;Survivor Type.&quot; Barker's &quot;In the Hills, the  Cities.&quot; Morrell's &quot;Orange for Anguish, Blue for Insanity.&quot;  The king of all horror stories, Richard Christian Matheson's stunning  &quot;Red.&quot; Masques IV, while full of stories that are average or  slightly above average at best, manages to add a new story, and a new  author, to the hallowed canon. His name is David T. Connolly, &quot;Julia's  Touch&quot; is his first published short story, and if he's got a drawer  full of this kind of stuff at home he's destined for the kind of greatness  that Stephen King and John Grisham can only dream about. Interestingly,  while trying to write this review last week (this mailing has been held up  by my inability to find this info on the web), I went looking for every  review of Masques IV I could, and the vast majority focus on the medicority  of the stories by the more established authors. Go figure.<br /><br />Yes,  certainly, there's some other good stuff here, most of it from the usual  above-the-bar suspects (Chet Williamson, Lois Tilton, Dan Simmons), but  it's the Connolly story that makes this worth the price of admission, no  matter what that price is. Beg, borrow, or steal a copy of this anthology  to get at that story, for you will walk away from its few, sparse, painful  words a changed person.

It's a decent book, a nice book. And  that's exactly why it doesn't deserve one of the highest honors that can be  conferred on a novel. It's nice. What's so great about nice?<br /><br />When one  thinks of Southern writers and Southern writing, names come to mind--  Faulkner, McCullers, Dickey (from Taylor's generation), Lee Smith, Barry  Hannah (from the generation after). And, whther it's valid and warranted or  not, Southern writing has become a genre in itself, where the gentility of  Southern life is a veneer for the corruption beneath. A few novels have  broken out of this mold successfully, but not many, and they've usually  done it by having the corruption somehwere else. A Summons to Memphis, on  the other hand, just kind of sits there being nice.<br /><br />Phillip Carver  (one breathes a sigh of relief that no one in the family is named Raymond)  is the sixtyish son of a man who plans to remarry. Remarrying, in old  Southern families, is frowned upon, especially when one is in one's  eighties. We careen from present (where the rest of the family attempts to  stop dad from remarrying and Phillip is attempting to hold his own  relationship together) to past (where Phillip gradually reveals things  about the family's past life) and back again, learning the story of the  family's disgrace in Nashville and their subsequent move to Memphis. During  those times, the book takes on a kind of comedy-of-manners quality, and  would probably have worked had it remained so; it might also have worked in  the various places where one member of the family spoils the romantic  efforts of another member of the family (this happens a number of times  throughout the book) as a kind of Shakespearean tragedy; attempting to  combine the two makes them cancel one another out, and the reader is left  with a kind of detached amusement.<br /><br />It's well-written, and Taylor's  writing style is as good as it was when he was the South's most celebrated  short story writer.

Which is good, because of all the types of handicapping out there, Beyer's is the one that the public seized on, and it's since become so popular that Beyer's figures are published in the Daily Racing Form, and are so deadly accurate in most cases that those races which can be unlocked through their application have become unprofitable.  Carroll gives us another way of looking at speed, a new take on velocity that turns the work of Broahmer and Sartin on its head, and in doing so takes the many complex calculations of _Modern Pace Handicapping_ and instead substitutes the kind of one-number handicapping ease that the crowd loves. Does it work? I don't know, I have a whole lot of fact-checking to do before i go endorsing Carroll's methods and theories. But as a book, it's a pretty good one. Carroll doesn't go over the same old racing history as most books, but instead gives us background information that we haven't seen before-- the various schools of handicapping, how the money flows, and most notably conformation, something many handicapping books steer far clear of. Most of it has nothing to do with handicapping speed, but any knowledge a player can get is knowledge he can put to use, if he knows how. A worthwhile addition to the shelf of the horseplayer, and if it works, it becomes the sixth book in the canon.	2000-04-28

One often wonders, when one hears everyone and their brothers spouting superlatives about a poet from a historically repressive country, whether the superlatives are based on the poet's actual work, or whether they're in  some way based on the poet's admirable-- but irrelevant-- ability to  perform within a culture that is repressive to the poet's art. In some  cases, the superlatives are justified, for example Vladimir Holan's  stunning book-length poem _A Night with Hamlet_, written while Holan was  officially a non-person in Hungary in the sixties.<br />Akhmatova has been  called &quot;the greatest Russian woman poet ever, and perhaps the greatest  woman poet ever.&quot; I can't help but think those lauding on these kinds  of laurels are looking more at her life than her work. There are certainly  flashes of great brilliance here, but to put Akhmativa's work up against  that of, say, Elizabeth Bishop, Deborah Allbery, or even the underrated  Dorianne Laux would quickly reveal many of its flaws.<br />This is not to say  that Akhmatova's poetry is completely without merit, and one must be forced  to consider the viability of the work of any translator who would consider  &quot;He, was it, through the packed hall/Sent you (or was it a  dream?)&quot; to be the best way to translate anything, much less poetry.  And thus, perhaps, the original is far more eloquent than what we receive  here. That taken into account, there is still the problem to contend with  that much of Akhmatova's work is, for obvious reasons, overtly political,  and makes no attempt to convey its message artistically; worse yet, a good  deal of that work is imagist, impressionist. The end result is something  that's thick, sludgy, and impossible to read.<br />However, every once in a  while a good line will shine through, and occasionally we find ourselves  staring at a poem that seems to exist well outside the boundaries of this  particular collection:<br />* * *<br />Voronezh<br />And the town is frozen  solid, leaded with ice.<br />Trees, walls, snow, seem to be under glass.  Cautiously I tread on crystals. The painted sleighs can't seem to get a  grip. And over the statue of Peter-in-Voronezh Are crows, and poplars, and  a pale-green dome Washed-out and muddy in the sun-motes. The mighty slopes  of the field of Kulikovo Tremble still with the slaughter of barbarians.  And all at once the poplars, like lifted chalices, Enmesh more boisterously  overhead Like thousands of wedding-guests feasting And drinking toasts to  our happiness. And in the room of the banished poet Fear and the Muse take  turns at the watch, And the night comes When there will be no sunrise.<br />*  * *<br />Unfortunately, there's too little of this and too much of the rest.  Giving the benefit of the doubt where the translation is concerned, I can  still only manage ** 1/2.own is frozen  solid, leaded with ice.<br />Trees, walls, snow, seem to be under glass.

Plant pathology, and the development of modern methods of combating plant diseases, is probably not most peoples' first choice as far as what to read on a rainy night when you have nothing better to do. However, if you ever do get the urge, you could do a lot worse than Large's readable, and even somewhat absorbing, book on the subject. Starting with the first major outbreak of Potato Blight in Ireland in 1845, which resulted in the Irish Potato Famine, Large takes us through 1939 by looking at the ways in which science found ways to combat various diseases of crops throughout the world. Sounds dull, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Large is very good at explaining the things he's talking about, and he never gets above the reader's level of comprehension, while at the same time never talking down to the reader. A fascinating book, worth picking up if you happen across it in a used bookstore.	2000-04-28

According to Lionel Abel, classic tragedy died with Macbeth, and a new kind of pseudo-tragedy rose with Hamlet. Since &quot;pseudo-tragedy&quot; is a mouthful and Abel is a contemporary of those critics whose life's  work, it would seem, was to add &quot;meta-&quot; to everything, Abel  decided to call this new kind of drama &quot;metatheatre.&quot; What is  metatheatre? Simply put, it's the conversion of the tragic (anti-) hero's  firm belief in forces outside his control-- the gods in Sophocles, or the  Weird Sisters (Abel's take on them: a corrpution of the Three Furies, a  view I suspect myself) in Macbeth-- to the (anti-) hero's less firm belief  in the motives of humanity, and more importantly, the (anti-) hero's  ability to put on an act in order to deceive the other players. The layers  of an onion-- the actor acting a part to the audience, and acting a  different part to the other actors.<br />Hamlet, according to Abel, was the  turning point. It not only contained this mechanism-- given free rein by  letting the other actors in the play think Hamlet was mad, leaving Hamlet  to essentially do what he liked-- but was also metaphorized by the  play-within-a-play Hamlet stages to uncover the treachery of his  stepfather. If you believe Abel, Hamlet is, simply, the finest drama in the  history of the form, and I'm not inclined to disagree. After this  explication (a lucid and interesting one-- unlike many) of Hamlet, Abel  whirls us through the next three hundred odd years of paywriting, giving us  examples of metatheatrical works which have been mislabeled as tragedy down  through the ages, both in drama and fiction (he specifically contrasts Don  Quixote with El Cid in one essay), and makes a strong case for metatheatre  as a valid genre on the stage.<br />Unlike most works of theatrical  criticism-- I'm not a big stage fan, so I find most of it way above my  head-- Abel's little work is readable, understandable, and finishable by  the average joe on the street with more than an eighth-grade education. It  may even lead more people to want to experience the theatre (at least, as  long as it stays away from musicals). A fine little achievement that I hope  is still in print.reet with more than an eighth-grade education.

Sotos gives us the goods about the Sensation art exhibit, King Ian and Queen Myra, the back rooms of adult bookstores, prostitution in Chicago, you name it. It's all here, and it's all captured beautifully in its hazy, base, disgusting glory. Sotos writes about a part of society that few people are even aware of, and if they were aware of it, they'd probably wish they weren't. And that's where the power and importance of Sotos' writing lies, in the confrontation of discovering about parts of life you didn't know existed before.	2000-04-28

Which makes sense. Flatland is the story of A. Square, a resident  of the two-dimensional Flatland, and how he comes to understand that there  are universes in every dimension. Previous to this, the idea of any  universe but his own two-dimensional universe was unthinkable; by the end  of the novel, he is positing the existence of a great,  infinitely-dimensional being-- god. This is not surprising; Edwin Abbott  was a theologist first and foremost. What is surprising is how modern eyes  have seen this tale, and it gives us a perspective on the endless debate as  to whether the author's belief about his story is the final and  &quot;right&quot; one.<br />Abbott meant his book as a treatise on  theoretical physics-- if at all-- in only a minor way. According to Abbott  himself, his main goal in the writing of Flatland was to produce a kind of  &quot;satire of manners&quot; on Victorian England. And, given what little  I know of the ways of life in Victorian England, he seems to be right on  the money. But what do I know? Abbott's assertion is backed up by the  structure of the novel, certainly; the first hundred pages of this small  (hundred fifty page) tome are devoted to the customs and mores of Flatland.  How stinging a criticism they are of the values and mores of Victorian  England is not for me to say. Thus, those of us who are not historians are  left with the final fifty pages, and the impact of the first hundred pages  upon them (which, aside form the knowledge gained therein, is minimal);  and, at least as far as the physicists go, the book has metamorphosed into  a trestise on theoretical physics.<br />I'm not a theoretical physicist,  either, but I've always been interested in mathematics in a sort of  hobbylike way, and the math presented in Flatland is good, solid theory  that also happens to be thought-provoking. Seeing how A. Square's  realization of how the third dimension works dawns on him, and seeing how  Lord Sphere explains the mechanics of the third dimension to A. Square, it  is easy to take those arguments and make them to postulate a theoretical  fourth dimension (albeit one that is impossible to visualize, at least  within the narrow scope of my mathematical knowledge) and its supercubes  with sixteen points and eight faces, and the like.<br />The point is,  however, we seem to have taken a minor part of the book's appeal to its  original audience and made that its full appeal today. We still think it's  good (or it wouldn't still be in print a hundred sixteen years after its  release, no?), but we think different aspects of it are good. The opinions  of the artist have passed on, and the work itself remains in a different  perspective.always been interested in mathematics in a sort of  hobbylike way, and the math presented in Flatland is good, solid theory  that also happens to be thought-provoking.

Simple and elegant. Makes  sense, huh? It's actually an idea as old as language.  &quot;Object-oriented&quot; is a good description of any language. While  Oriental writing shows this most clearly, in that a relatively small number  of syllabic characters are written in various ways to make larger words,  it's easily understood in any language when looked at the right way.<br />  This is the basis behind A.-J. Greimas' _Structural Semantics_. However, he  extends the argument not only to language, but to thought as well, and  gives the reader a new way to think about the critical analysis of what he  reads.<br /> Greimas' theory is that humans have a specific and limited  number of possible ideas that can be used in various, still limited but  much closer to infinite, ways to create sentences, and from there to create  stories. Much of the book is spent developing and defending this theory,  and only the last two chapters (devoted, respectively, to analysis of the  body of Russian folktales and the body of work by French author Bernanos)  show how to put the theory into practice. Given this, it should be evident  to the reader that this is going to be a tough book to tackle even for  experienced literary critics. It doesn't help that Greimas spends much of  his time in the stratosphere, and assumes we're spending all that time with  him; he drops references without backing them up constantly (the  translators of the University of Nebraska Press edition identified and  tracked down well over a hundred of these, and endnotes are included), and  his language is so far into the abstract that if you attempt to take up  this book without a pad and pen, you'll be lost early on.<br />  This all  changes, thankfully, as practical application makes itself known. Once we  get down to actually applying everything from the book to the symbolism in  a given author, it all starts to make sense. One wonders why the beginning  part couldn't have been explained in an easier, more concise manner;  perhaps Greimas, so involved in the world of literary theory, didn't know  how any more.<br />  A fascinating read, albeit a long one; while I found it  tremendously enlightening, I have to penalize it heavily for being so  obtuse most of the time.ook without a pad and pen, you'll be lost early on.  <br />  This all  changes, thankfully, as practical application makes itself known.

This was L'Heureux's debut novel, but don't let that put you off; he was already an accomplished short story writer and poet. Oftentimes, short story writers and poets can't make the transition to the novel form, but  that's not the case here. L'Heureux gives us the story of a husband, a  wife, an insane murderess, and her homosexual bodyguard, and more than  anything, underneath the gore and glitz, L'Heureux's real intention is to  examine the relationships between these people.<br />There are few authors, in  these days when the gods no longer have truck with humanity, that attempt  to write tragedy in the classical Greek fashion. L'Heureux takes an  inventive out by using insanity as the &quot;god&quot; whose mechanizations  drive the narrative, and in doing so bring it closer to classical tragedy  than to its modern cousin, metatheatre. It's a risky move, but one carried  off extremely well by one of the American masters of letters.	2000-04-21
