I listened to Alanna: the First Adventure via my subscription with Audible, and I found this story to be pleasantly entertaining (if at a few times) simplistic.<br /><br />Alanna is a young girl with red hair and violet eyes. When her father dictates she must enter a convent, she trades places with her brother Thom who is to become a page and eventually a knight.<br /><br />I read the Alanna series as a teenager and was fascinated by her adventures. Now as an adult some of this story seems a tad predictable. Pierce's writing lacks detail and some of her characters (such as the prince, George etc.) are rather clich&eacute; for the fantasy genre. Still, this is a great series of books that young girls and adults will enjoy... I only wish that Pierce had fleshed out her characters a bit more. Although I liked the characters I never got the sense that they were anything other than stereotypes.	2005-10-13

In preparation for getting in the Christmas mood, I listened to a few of them, found myself wishing I hadn't bought the CD. Why? Most of the songs are quite simply not repeatable. Yes, some are pleasant, but others are downright annoying. I don't know about you, but one time around with the twangy mountain-man rendition of \\"Christmas Time's A-Coming\\" was quite enough for my sanity. Thank You. I also didn't care for the stories. I found \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" (a parody of the original about a puritanical Baptist family), obviously meant to be funny, didn't even provoke a chuckle, and was at times downright creepy.<br /><br />Some songs, such as: \\"The Christmas Song\\" by Sarah Jessica  Parker, \\"December Waltz,\\" by Pat Donohue, and \\"Count Your Blessings\\" by John McDonough were decent. Some songs were great: \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" by Diana Krall being one of them. But others were quite banal. Nothing made me stand up and shout: \\"Wow! That's a great tune, I'm glad I bought this CD!\\"<br /><br />Overall, I think your better off buying a ten-pack of Christmas cd's at your local super store and culling the songs you like, it'd probably cost the same, and you'd get more music that you might enjoy. 3 Stars. Average.	2005-10-03

But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin.<br /><br />Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest.	2005-09-26

Sean King, GQ secret service agent makes a mistake and spends his life regretting it when his right-wing candidate is assassinated by a seemingly harmless professor at a presidential rally. He teams up with ex-olympic athlete turned secret service agent Michelle Maxwell when HER presidential candidate is kidnapped many years later. Are these too incidents combined? Does anyone care?<br /><br />First off, I was very disappointed in Split Second. I thought the plot was really implausible. The villain and mystery were too far-fetched. And I just didn't care for either of the main characters. Sean King, was a self-satisfied, smug martyr and I hated the way he treated his ex-girlfriend Joan. Michelle was a cardboard cutout of a character, and I found the romance between Sean and Michelle tad icky. Not a big fan of May/December romances.<br /><br />As far as the villain/Mystery goes... Who cares? I think in this book I might've gotten more interesting if the villain had actually succeeded in his vile plot. At least then  I might not have to hear Sean whine about how his 'life was over' after the assassination.  2 stars for the first quarter of the book which was actually half decent.	2005-09-21

What I mean is, there is a lot of action pushing the book forward, a lot of adventure, but no resolution, and several pointless subplots which went nowhere.<br /><br />The story opens with Harry returning to Hogwarts, this time approaching manhood. Harry has matured somewhat, but has also become a bit arrogant, greedy and bitter. Harry is so focused on his own personal tragedy (the loss of his parents), that he has become blinded somewhat to the sufferings of others. (For instance how his father treated Snape). Indeed, at times, I felt Harry was becoming a bit of a bully. He bulldozes past those who don't agree with them, blindly alienates people, and cheats using a book with notes written by someone else. He is in effect, on the verge of becoming arrogant and selfish and similar to dad.<br /><br />Other characters, I felt had some significant development: such as Malfoy, Snape and yes, even Moaning Myrtle. But other characters such as Ron and Hermione were just tagalongs with no real development to speak of. While I realize this is a \\"Harry Potter\\" book, I'd like to see a bit more development amongst the supporting cast. They are, at times more interesting than Potter.<br /><br />A good read, but somewhat disappointing considering the previous books. Also I felt Harry is becoming an increasingly unlikable character who may need to be taken down a peg or two- for his own good of course. 4 stars. Good, but not as great as her previous works, and not really a stand-alone book.	2005-09-09

I like books on ancient peoples, particularly, women, so I picked up \\"Uppity Women\\" hoping for a factual and engrossing account of the lives of women in ancient times. Instead I read a collection of seriously silly bios with so much slang, and so much silliness it was difficult to understand WHAT the author was trying to say.<br /><br />The author's 'gossip column' style of writing seems more appropriate for magazines featuring two-headed-alien-babies than a serious work on historical feminism. Sure, this may appeal to teens or people who don't have serious scholarly inclination. But for those looking for true facts on the lives of ancient women might be disappointed in this hodge-podge of history and modern lingo.<br /><br />3 stars. I found the writing poor, and the author's slang-ridden 'voice' irritating, incomprehensible, and distracting.	2005-08-21

Of the many words I might use to describe a Feehan book, boring would not be one of them until I read Dark Melody. Perhaps I've read too many of her novels, or perhaps I've just grown bored of the formula: domineering guy, wimpy girl, a psychic bond 'lifemates' etc. But Dark Melody bored me to tears.<br /><br />The heroine Corrine (6 months pregnant), irritated me. She was way too perfect and saintly. The hero Dayan seemed to be a carbon copy of all the other Carpathian guys: ie, over-the-top, possessive, and while protesting that 'he doesn't like to manipulate and control others using his mental powers' somehow managing to do so anyway. The endless exposition about Carpathian men and Carpathian culture was also quite tedious. And just once, just once, I'd like to see a psychic female refuse to 'mate' with one of these controlling jerks (let alone agree to become an instant baby-factory).<br /><br />1 Star. Worse than the last if such a thing were possible.	2005-08-17

When a troubled patient shows up at her clinic requesting treatment, it dredges up a long-dead trauma from Jane's own past. Can Jane overcome the trauma of her past experience to find happiness with Mike?<br /><br />While at first I enjoyed Plain Jane, I quickly grew bored with some of the 'over the top' elements in this novel. Dogs are heavily featured in this book. Don't get me wrong- I love dogs, but do I really need to know where Olive is staying every chapter? And whats the deal about the vegetarian dog? The author states Olive is \\"vegetarian\\" but then goes on to discuss the dog eating pig ears. Last I heard Pig Ears were meat. What gives?<br /><br />And then there are the ghosts. Jane's house is haunted by a ghost named Billy. Jane and Billy have conversations together while she sleeps. The weird thing is, this is a fairly minor subplot. Its like the author wanted to include a ghost but didn't want to risk offending people, so she kept the ghost in the background. This made the plot really weak. I won't even go there about the crazy godmother with the police car, siren, and surplus pot baggies.<br /><br />Overall, this would've been a decent novel if Michaels' had ditched the weak romance, and focused on either the dog plot or the ghost plot. In the end,  I found Plain Jane to be weak and ineffectual, 2 Stars.	2005-08-15

Lets see, you have the annoying whiningly-superior academic protagonist: check. Obscure government experiment: check. Catholic conspiracy involving the Vatican: check. Someone who can decipher ancient codes and text: check. Someone spouting cryptic religious messages: check. Characters with extremely dysfunctional parents: check. Pyramid and Alien connection: check. All that was missing was a Tielk-like sidekick, and Robert Langdon's obscure preaching about cryptic philosophical points... Oh wait... There's Conrad.<br /><br />Okay, all joking aside, I enjoyed Raising Atlantis, but I found myself gritting my teeth when the ex-nun character was summoned to the Vatican. The story lost a great deal of punch when the character \\"Mother Earth\\" became involved. (Seriously does every action novel these days have to involve the Pope or the Vatican?)<br /><br />Then there's Conrad. Golly, if I have to listen to Conrad whine one more time about how his daddy don't love him as much as he  loves his military career, I wanted to slap the character. Seriously, did anyone like Conrad? He was whiney, irritating and self-centered. I don't blame his dad for wanting to throw him in the brig.<br /><br />I think this book had some great adventure. But I can't help but wonder what it would've been like with protagonists I actually LIKED. 4 stars.	2005-08-03

Who cares you ask? Exactly. This is my first Merci novel, and while I liked parts of  this book other parts I could care less. Namely, Merci's office politics, and the shunning by other officers- boring. Her stay-at-home-mom-dad. Likewise boring. The alcoholic neighbor who manages to provide most of the major evidence? A little too good to be true.<br /><br />Archie? While a good character he lost me about 2/3rd's of the way through the book. Come on, we invested a lot of time in Arch. And this is how you end it? Wings? Silly.  And Gwen? Ohhh...Kay...... I agree with other reviewers about the child character. A little overdone.<br /><br />3 stars. I found Black Water to be an unsatisfying and somewhat depressing read. No good resolution for anyone, and a lackluster cast of characters. I might pick up another if I can find it used but this book left me with a flat feeling.	2005-07-31

The novel starts off mildly enough, but after they are castaway, things begin to go rapidly downhill. As if the gruesome descriptions of scurvy were not enough, the reader is treated to watching characters starve to death slowly, under the iron fist of a stupid, and selfish captain.<br /><br />Frankly, my greatest disappointment was that O'Brian did not show us what happened to the cruel and heavy-handed captain Cheap, who deserved to be eaten by cannibals at the very least.<br /><br />Good, but not great, and not something I would want to read again.	2005-07-31

He is constantly 'wounded' by those around him, starting with his own half-brother and ending with his wife. Saban must be goaded into responding to anything, and is constantly victimized by the wicked and cruel. Sometimes the actions and violence in this book seemed needless and lacked any significant purpose.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel for a brutal taste of bronze age Europe. But I would've enjoyed it more if I'd liked Saban, his wife and their kids a bit more.	2005-07-25

When Lucas's father Benicio contacts Paige for help investigating the murder of a young witch, Paige initially refuses, but eventually becomes sucked in when more teens are attacked. Can Paige and Lucas uncover the murderer before its too late, or are they destined to become the next victims?<br /><br />Okay, I admit, I'm a big fan of Armstrongs. I LOVED the first three books.  But what I liked about her books was the believable way she portrayed her  paranormal races. I found Industrial Magic to be quite over the top. Not only are there witches, vampires, werewolves, dead gods, druids and necromancers and demons. They are all way too colorful and exaggerated to be believed.. Also  there were WAY too many characters making cameos, and doing nothing.  What I liked best about her first two books were that the characters were down to earth, not overpowered. I think she treads on dangerous ground with all the spellcasting, death visitations and mystic mumbo jumbo. A little is cool. A lot is silly.<br /><br />There were scads of things not to like about this book. Paige, the leader made some really dumb mistakes. For instance... When tracking the serial killer, why oh why did she not contact Elena and list the aid of the pack from the get go? Duh. The pack ARE hunters. And are we really supposed to believe an amateur like Paige is suddenly expected to become a detective with ZERO experience?  Also.. Jaime. Oh.. What a total waste of book space. I hate the character hated her ditzyness oh and her crush on Jer was sickening thing to behold.<br /><br />I guess I just didn't care for all the UBER spellcasting and necromancy etc. It Just seemed very unrealistic. I think I prefer her stories where her characters rely more on their wits than on occult mumbo jumbo and the addition of huge sorcerous conglamorates seemed overkill. Also cannot stand Jaime. Yeesh.<br /><br />I found Industrial magic to be an average read, but nothing to shout about./> <br />I found Industrial magic to be an average read, but nothing to shout about.	2005-07-24

Will Paige succeed in retaining custody of Paige and leadership of the coven?<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Armstrong's writing. I particularly like the way she writes male characters. I loved Lucas and his interaction with Paige, (my kind of guy).<br /><br />On the negative side, I don't care all that much for Savannah. She seems way too powerful and preternaturally old.  Savannah is constantly showing up Paige, and never seems to pay the price for her excess. (I.E. She summons demons with impunity, injures people without remorse etc.). I did like the character of Paige.  But she reminds me a bit of a female version of Jeremy (see Bitten and Stolen), which is not a bad thing... Its just I like Jer better LOL, and the whole 23 yr old raising a teenager reminds me a lot of Jer/Clay relationship.<br /><br />Also on the negative side... what is with the cover? Its a cheap Laurell hamilton body parts cover. Yuck. When I first saw it, I thought it was an advert for a new disposable razor! LOL Overall, a great read.	2005-07-19

Elena Michaels, following a lead about a potential werewolf killing is contacted by a secret group of paranormal creatures intent on enlisting the pack's assistance in tracking down a scientific group who is capturing people for an occult menagerie. Initially skeptical, Elena becomes a true believer when she herself is stalked and ultimately captured. Can Elena escape or will she become just another trophy for one man's twisted obsession?<br /><br />Okay, what can I say, I am a big fan of Armstrong's writing. She writes great characters, and I particularly love how she writes Elena and Jer. I loved the scene where Jer and Elena are alone at the cabin at the lake, and I love how supportive the pack is of each other. I found Paige to be a rather irritating character. I disliked how she tried to boss Jer, and I was disappointed at how much Paige dominated most of the scenes when the pack was together. A little Paige goes a LONG way. I also liked how the characters interacted in the 'compound' and I enjoyed the scenes where the characters were enjoying some down time.<br /><br />One of the things I like about Armstrong's books is how she includes little vignettes of day to day life for her characters. Scenes that reflect the mundane things, such as Elena and Clay challenging eachother to the race, Clay's hatred about Jer's SUV, the things the characters like to eat etc. This brings the characters to life in ways 'big fight' scenes do not.<br /><br />Ultimately, Stolen was the best book I've read all year. 5+ stars.

Immature Hero+Irritating Heroine= No Love	As someone who has enjoyed Nora Roberts romances in the past, I found myself unable to finish this latest book. Don't get me wrong... I loved the environment, the gardening, the world building, and even the ghost. But I couldn't abide LOGAN, and the narrator for this audio edition was simply awful.<br /><br />Logan epitomizes most everything I hate in a romance novel hero. He is selfish, abusive, annoying and argumentative. Why romance authors think its 'exciting' and 'romantic' to have two supposedly adult humans quarrel over stupid matters  is beyond me. This novel's hero is straight out of the 80's.  When Logan pulls Stella out of the office and drags her by the arm out in the garden for something as trivial as pots being re-arranged I discovered I loathed him. I just couldn't take this guy seriously at all. Then STELLA apologizes to Roz? Sorry Nora.<br /><br />Its too bad, really, because some of the characters were pretty good. Roz, David, and the kids. But Logan? Yech. This novel would really work for me, if she ditched the romance angle, ditched the irritating hero, and just focused on the women, David, and the house. That alone would make an interesting story.<br /><br />Now for the narrator... She sounds WAY too old to be Stella. There's also a weird staccato element to her voice which I found distracting. Her men also sound a bit like dumb hicks (although I admit she does a good job of the children, and David).<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed with Blue Dahlia.	2005-07-16

Wow, for a series which started off with a strong independent older female character, Miss Julia has really really let herself go. I knew it would be the 'kiss of death' for Julia to get married, (this time to 'too good to be true' Sam Murdoch), and I'm sad to say I was right. Miss Julia's problems in this book are all in her head. Her silly dithering about her marriage, her jealous obsession over Sam and other women and her silly worrying about whether she is  married or not, are so unlike the practical sensible widow, I have to sigh.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say it, but if Miss Ross is to revitalize the series, she'd need to do something drastic. Such as A: Dump Sam (sorry, never liked the character. Miss Julia needs a bad boy, not a saint), B: do something about the Mr. Pickens situation, C: and get something *real* for Miss Julia to worry about rather than herself. When I saw the title of this book, I thought Miss Julia *might* be getting herself a new hobby. Unfortunately, the title is misleading.<br /><br />Might be worth picking up at the library, but definitely the worst in the series. I was *so* disappointed.	2005-06-24

Antonietta lives in a house filled with evil leaching relatives and silly conspiring cousins which would do any soap opera proud, but which seemed a little half-baked and overdone to me. While I've previously enjoyed Feehan's other Carpathian books, I felt this one was a little flat. Byron was your typical grumpy alpha Carpathian, but he lacked the Ooomph of other Carpathian males. Likewise, Antonietta was a little too saintly and a little too forgiving. She seems to have no selfish emotions at all.<br /><br />Worse, I just didn't feel that Antonietta and Byron had any chemistry.  I felt no passion when either of them got together. The love scenes were stale, and Antonietta (and Byron's) relatives were completely over-the-top. Not one of Antonietta's relatives seemed to genuinely like or care about her. And Josef, Byron's nephew was completely silly. He acted more like 13 than 22. (Yes I know that age is different for Carpathian's but didn't Dubrinksy's daughter marry at his age?).<br /><br />I think these characters would work if paired with other mates. Byron needs an adventurous reckless woman to protect, and Antonietta needs a dependant guy she can add to her menagerie of dependant relatives.<br /><br />Things I do like?

The book is divided into fifteen chapter and contains a number of interesting facts.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed, however, that Lesce doesn't go into more detail on the subject of common mistakes made in the entertainment industry and what the fallout in REALITY for an officer who engages in such practices might be.

Don't get me wrong, the writing is good but its far from innovative and a little too sickly sweet for my tastes.<br /><br />Here's the plot: Emily loves John a handsome farmboy, but her evil uncle Clem hates John and does everything he can to keep him apart. John's well-intentioned Aunt does the same to a lesser degree. But through it all, and despite some amazing prospects Emily LOOOOVESSS John and refused to move on. Likewise John LOOVESSSS Emily and never forgets her. (Yawn).<br /><br />Frankly I grew bored with this story. Instead of it being sweet and romantic that Emily loves John and vice versa I kept thinking to myself MOVE ON. You people are way too obsessed. Also the author makes liberal use of the 'big misunderstanding' plot. This plot device rears its ugly head at least twice and it was very annoying.<br /><br />About the time Emily's dad hooks up with John, I began to find my eyeballs rolling in pain at the series of too-good-to-be-true-coincidneces which plague this book.<br /><br />Three stars. It wasn't bad.  But It was far from innovative.	2005-06-06

Julia and friends think up a few wacky schemes to make money, and one of the far-fetched schemes is to sponsor a 'poker run,' a motorcycle racing event. Julia is soon dared by a quirky old miser to participate herself with ensuing mischief and fun.<br /><br />I wanted to like Miss Julia hits the road, but it seemed a little too silly for me. Lucille Ball level of silly. Miss Julia is way too smart and practical to make the kinds of stupid mistakes she does in this book.  For instance, a person of Julia's wealth should have been able to afford a property purchase herself...Why wager the house? She has far more sense than that. Plus, I found myself disappointed that Miss Julia seems to lie a lot to herself and others. Why lie when the truth would be better?<br /><br />Plus, I'm probably one of the only ones who doesn't care for Sam. He's a little too good to be true... I prefer Miss Julia single and sassy. Sam just gets in the way.<br /><br />I have really enjoyed listening to the prior two Miss Julia books. But I absolutely HATE the new narrator. She just sounds far too old to be Miss Julia. 3 stars for an average read.	2005-06-06

I had such a hard time reading it. It reads like a sci-fi convention geek's collaborative writing assignment... \\"Lets call the main character... Dagger... Dagger Chase oh and he's going to have a hot native American teenie bobber sidekick who can turn into animals. How cool is that?!\\"<br /><br />If I can forgive the bad dialogue (and pages and pages of it to boot), I really cannot deal with the protagonists name being \\"Dagger\\" everytime the name was written I had to choke back a snort of derisive laughter. It pulled me out of the story everytime. Plus the writer tells us whats happening too much via dialogue rather than showing us in action. He/she needs to write more descriptively and leave the long pages of dialogue for key points where dialogue is necessary. Plus Chases attraction to the young sidekick really made me wanna hurl.<br /><br />Feh. 1 star. A disappointing read. Goofy-characters, goofy names, goofy book. Waste of time.	2005-06-05

While I enjoyed Paladin of Souls, part of me wonders what this story would be like if I'd actually LIKED Ista. I'm not a big fan of reluctant hero/heroines and Ista takes the prize. She needs to practically be forced to do her duty and help poor lord Illvan with his problem, and then we have to listen to endless boring monologue about herself, the murder, and her desire for atonement. Blech. Boring. Okay already, we get it... Can we move on?<br /><br />What I did like? The plot in this one was pretty good, particularly the mystery regarding Illvan, his brother and his young wife.. Also the romance in this one was kind of sweet. At least the romantic couple is much closer in age! I'm giving this book 4 stars. Bujold's writing was excellent and I LOVED the character of Illvan, even if I felt Ista was boring and maudlin and needed to get over herself.	2005-05-30

After reading the high reviews for this book, I crossed my fingers and ordered a copy. I'm a big fan of vampire novels. Well, I can honestly say I found this book starts off pretty well, but rapidly becomes so divorced from reality it was difficult to take seriously. I can buy vampires. I can buy demons. But Vampires, demons, fairy, Avalon, an immortal King arthur, Lancelot all in one book? It takes a skilled hand to incorporate that all in one novel and frankly...I don't think it worked here.<br /><br />Miss Knight makes a good effort, though. I found some parts compelling. . What I didn't like was how quickly the heroine Erin fell for Champion. Erin has virtually no character development, and is so typecast I had my eyeballs rolling by the third page of reading about her. (If they counted how many law enforcement characters had their partners killed in a tragic manner the ratio has got to be something like 99%).  Anyway. The moment Erin and Champion Reese meet they hop into bed (or in this case onto a comforter by a lake), and get to 'know' each other.. No courtship.. It reads like a porno movie. I don't know about you, but if I thought the guy I was investigating was head of a group of Satanists I wouldn't be jumping onto the beachblanket with him anytime soon.<br /><br />Then there is the dialogue. WAY too much dialogue. Even the villains talk for pages. I also didn't care for Lancelot and the other characters contemporary method of speaking. For some reason it seemed funny and disjointed rather than....realistic.<br /><br />Feh. 2 Stars. The author has talent.... But there was something off-kilter about this book.... Perhaps if she toned down the magic mumbo-jumbo focused on just a couple mythos and worked a bit more on her female lead it would've worked. As it was... I was disappointed.	2005-05-29

Cazaril is an endearing character, in the Tradition of Taita (Wilbur Smith's Warlock series). Cazaril gains magical powers after a brush with death and its up to him to save his employer/s. Can he, save the regency? Or is the kingdom destined to fall under the power of a terrible curse?<br /><br />I liked many elements of Curse of the Chalion. But I felt at times Cazaril was a little 'too good to be true.' There is nothing Caz can't do- from negotiating a marriage contract to out-fighting men half his age. Particularly annoying to me was the romance between Caz and one of his pupils who was nearly half his age. Yech. Talk about an abuse of authority. Especially since Caz is described in such a physically unappealing way throughout the book. Double yech. Not a big fan of older man/younger woman scenarios in my fiction. =-(<br /><br />I also thought the portrayal of the religion in this book was a little too 'perfect.' The religious sects in Chalion all seemed to be filled with dozens of devoted, concerned and altruistic clerics. Way too perfect. Give me a couple corrupt, inefficient, bumbling or stupid religious people 'not in touch with the goddess, or perfect healers.' Overall. This was a high caliber book. But I wish less time had been devoted to the 'romance,' which I found far less appealing than the author intended it to be.<br /><br />5 Stars.	2005-05-23

When his wife asks him to investigate the mysterious crash of a jetliner, Corey reluctantly becomes involved. Soon Corey's investigations get him into trouble. Will he find the truth before he is sacked?<br /><br />I wanted to like Night Fall, but I felt this novel, while starting off quite well, quickly became a bit silly. I found I particularly disliked the character of John who seemed very immature. The time he and the other agent were brawling in the sand made John look like he was an infant and NOT mature man. Plus, I hated how John continuously flaunted the rules and acted superior to every other law enforcement agent.<br /><br />His wife Kate was just a stereotype and seemed to have no personality or interesting traits. She ads nothing to the story. And I won't even go there about the ending.... 3 stars for an average read.	2005-05-08

Is it just me, or is the author Miss Ross determined to pair up each of her major characters? I really enjoyed this novel, even if, for the most part, nothing really happened. Miss Julia is determined to throw a wedding for her boarder Coleman, and the town lawyer Binkie. Meanwhile, her husband's ex-mistress Hazel-Marie is still dating Mr. Pickins and Little Lloyd is still a nervous (but likeable) little boy.<br /><br />There is an escaped criminal, Dixon Hightower to worry about, and new problems associated with the \\"Family Life Center.\\" Miss Julia is being courted by Sam (a prospect I'm lukewarm about), and she's involved with the Preacher's wife and several small incidents.<br /><br />Overall, this was a cute story, but not as good as the first two. Personally, while I enjoy the romantic elements, I'm not very keen on every character getting paired up. Miss Julia is more interesting to me without Sam, and without Mr. Pickins. I guess I like my heroines single-and-sassy.	2005-05-06

From the reviews I expected this novel to be a cozy story about a single couple and their friends. Instead I found a collection of semi-likeable (but at times obnoxious people), with whom I could share no empathy or concern.<br /><br />The primary couple- the tea house owners- especially the husband were irritating individuals who needed serious marital counseling. The girl artist (Brenda Brown), was a borderline stalker who writes Nicholas cage and would rather go on welfare, than get a job and pay her bills. Charming. Then, there's the husband who cheats and his plump wife (the only decent character in the lot!) who complains constantly that his wife is overweight. What, are there no fat people in Belfast? Then there is another cheating husband, and he's in love with a florist... Oh, and the charming twins... The list goes on...<br /><br />Overall, there were too many people involved in too many petty and uninteresting affairs. Perhaps if there had been one or two but 5+ couples AND their acquaintances? And I won't even go there about the ending. Particularly the relationship between the Tea House owner and her husband... Way too sappy.<br /><br />Overall, an average read. 3 stars. Would be better if the author had stuck two perhaps 2 couples and fleshed them out more. Buy this one used.	2005-04-24

The killer has also murdered the client in such a manner that Jace is implicated. Jace has a younger brother he is stubbornly trying to protect, which is why he refuses to go to the authorities or seek help with his problems, and which is why we are treated to many cross-city bike chases and endless self-pitying dialogue about his mistrust of authority figures.<br /><br />I might've liked this story if I could empathize with the characters. But I found Jace to be a real drag. Jace's refusal to go to the cops was just silly. This was a plot device to prolong the (albeit meager) mystery and suspense elements. Jace's kid brother was likewise annoying. If I had to hear again about his IQ, I felt like plunging a pencil into my eye!<br /><br />Other characters were likewise silly. The Police detective with the Armani suits. The Internal affairs woman, and the silly explanation for his mystery bank account. Are we honestly supposed to believe Internal Affairs couldn't figure that one out? Puhleeze. Has anyone heard of the IRS? Income like that is reported.<br /><br />I won't even go there about the ending. The ending was completely unsatisfying.<br /><br />Overall, I found Kill the Messenger an average read with occasional brilliant moments.	2005-04-11

With a bum ticker, Marbleface believes his days are numbered and sets out to reform, landing himself in the town of Piegun where he becomes the town's hero.<br /><br />This was an Excellent book. I really enjoyed Marbleface's character and the way he handled all his problems with outward calm and a friendly manner. In particular, I liked the way he found good in just about everyone (including the weasely old colonel) and the Native American scout Butcher, who no one trusted.<br /><br />The narration of this book is top par, and if I have any complaint at all, this book was WAY too short. 5 stars for an excellent read.	2005-04-03

(His daughter, Nicole ran away several years earlier with the Manson-like leader of an eco-terrorist group).<br /><br />Tim, determined to find his daughter and deliver the news of his wife's death joins forces with a ditzy vegan reporter. Together they cut their ties to society and travel the oceans tracking Nicole.  I really enjoyed Stormchild. I've read quite a few of Cornwell's historical novels and have enjoyed the blend of action and history. This novel was  a refreshing change from his historical works.<br /><br />Two things about this book I didn't care for. Tim's relationship with the reporter bugged me. Not a big fan of older man, younger woman relationships.  Also, I felt the ending was  a little too Rambo-esque for me. Up until the end, Tim had behaved logically and used logic to solve problems. I wish Cornwell had continued this theme through the end. It seemed a little silly for him to suddenly become the Terminator  at the end of the book.<br /><br />I would like to see a sequel to this novel. Tim and his girlfriend were fun protagonists.	2005-04-03

Miss Julia, a proper southern lady and her sidekick Lillian have it all.... Or do they? When her husband's 'legacy' comes back haunt her what is a proper widow woman to do? Miss Julia soon finds herself embroiled in a web of politics, intrigue and dastardly doings, spearheaded by an avaricious preacher,  greedy townsfolk, and the relatives of her husband's mistress.<br /><br />I really liked Miss Julia Speaks her mind. She reminds me of a classy miss Polifax. I like her relationship with her maid, Lillian, Little Lloyd and Deputy Bates. Who wouldn't want to be her living in that house with a hunk like that? My only peeve with this novel is how the townsfolk keep persecuting her because of her age. 60 is far from senile. Gimmee a break! Also the whole thing between the shrink, that preacher and what he accused her of was awful. The author tried to make it funny, but it was a terrible thing to do to a person. I wanted Pastor Ledbetter to be punished a bit for what he did. He betrayed poor Miss Julia when she needed him the most! What a despicable person.<br /><br />This was a great novel. I've ordered the others because this one was so good. Excellent, light reading.	2005-03-20

The two girls run away and have many frightening and exciting adventures on the streets of London, before finding a place they truly belong.<br /><br />I listened to the audio edition of this novel and really enjoyed it. Sarah and Glory are two strong-minded powerful little girls, whose friendship and loving hearts endure many terrible tragedies. Wonderful. 5 stars. Suitable for all ages. Sensitive really young children should read with a parent.	2005-03-07

His wife, a scientist and psychologist appears to be cheating on him.  But is she really, or are things quite what they seem at the Zymos plant?<br /><br />I really enjoyed Prey- I especially found it refreshing that the main character was a stay-at-home dad. This role-reversal was fun and refreshing. I especially LOVED the first 3/4's of this novel. The ending seemed.... Rushed, and I felt that Jack didn't seem to care that much for his wife. Also, I never really understood the 'swarm's motivation.' I would've liked to have understood it better, especially in regards to Julia's involvement with it. How much control did the swarm possess?<br /><br />Overall, this was a superb book that kept me on the edge of my seat! I sincerely hope there is a sequel. We never did find out why the sprinklers didn't work!	2005-02-21

Imaginative, intelligent and lonely, Anne soon wins over her foster parents and becomes the smartest girl in school, and befriends a local girl, Diana.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Anne of Green gables. In particular the 'hometown' feel of the life on Prince Edward Island. The narrator was wonderful and this book left me feeling warm and happy inside. I only wish they described a bit more of the holidays and celebrations celebrated on the island at this time.<br /><br />A must for fiction lovers young and old. A keeper.	2005-02-15

When Jeff manages escape, he finds himself the victim of a nefarious group called the \\"Manhattan Hunt Club.\\" The club uses the tunnels below NYC to hunt convicts as 'game.'<br /><br />I enjoyed The Manhattan Hunt Club immensely, with the exception of the evil \\"Jagger\\" character and Jeff himself. Jagger creeped me out and his crimes were so gruesome I really didn't want to listen to the parts where his back-story was being dealt with. Jeff himself was way too idealistic to be real. His Christ-like forbearance (especially after his trial), seemed so unrealistic. I know of no modern 20 something who wouldn't be railing at the injustice of being falsely accused in such a manner, but Jeff's reaction was so bland. Too good to be real.<br /><br />My favorite character of all was Eve, although I felt they went a bit over-the-top with her character and some of the others towards the end. I also thought the 'trophy' taking was a bit silly. This was a fast-paced audiobook which would probably make an excellent movie.	2005-02-15

The Authors go into depth describing the various looks popular in Japanese Hip-hop culture today.

Initially, I was delighted by the world described in this novel:  a cool pre-Victorian world where magic is the province of scholarly magicians and where fairies and humans co-exist. I liked the Eccentric Mr. Norell and the young upstart, Jon Strange. But over time, I grew bored with the contrived conflict between the magicians, the endless tedious footnotes and the snarkiness of  Norell vs. Strange, neither of whom I ended up liking by the end of the book. (These two male leads remind me of a couple of immature schoolboys rather than the adults they were supposed to be).<br /><br />While I stuck it through to the end to find out what happened in the Norrel vs. Strange conflict, I found the ending to anticlimactic and not very satisfying.  Overall, I would've liked this novel more if I had been able to empathize with Strange and Norell.<br /><br />3 Stars for an average read which could've been better if I'd actually LIKED Norrel and Strange.	2005-02-07

Psychotherapy goes wrong in Koontz's latest thriller: False Memory.<br /><br />Koontz' casts of characters include: A golden Retriever: check, somewhat nerdy male protagonist: check, doughty and tough female/wife figure: check, dependant brother character: check, fatherly doctor character: check, and nerdy sidekick character: check. The villain? Crazed sugar-eating, eyeball-collecting Doctor Aruman the consummate family shrink.<br /><br />If you are a Koontz fan you doubtless know the plot formula by now.  The evil, unfeeling scientific community is experimenting on hapless humans. In this case-Dr. Mark Aruman. The psycho bad guy. Mark is using his cover as a shrink to brainwash helpless victims. Why? Because its all fun for Mark who is nothing more than an evil psychotic overgrown boy.<br /><br />In False Memory, I really didn't find the formula as abrasive as his more recent works. There was less bible-thumping and pulpit pounding. The dog didn't play a large role, and Dusty was less whiney than most Koontz heroes. I liked Fig and Skeet, and even the doctor after a while.<br /><br />Funny scenes? I liked the \\"Normal\\" scenes where Dr. Aruman was trying to do his job. The scenes with the \\"Keanu-Phobic\\" woman were really amusing. The running mental commentary from the Doctor while forced to deal with 'real-life' situations such as his secretary were funny. I liked Fig Newton and Dusty.<br /><br />The narrator deserves a great deal of praise for his fantastic narration of this book. A fine edition to any Koontz fan's library.	2005-02-04

This is an entertaining book, filled with different people's perceptions on race, sexuality and culture. The format is simple: A question is asked and various people answer the question based on their experience. At the end of each question an 'expert' answers the question putting closure on the topic.<br /><br />I was vastly entertained by the subject of sexuality, race and ethnicity. (Although some questions were somewhat silly... ) A reader wonders why \\"White People\\" (a generalization in itself), smell like wet dogs when they get wet. Huh? Anyway myths such as this are quickly debunked. Thank God.<br /><br />Several sections I found less interesting. The section on disabilities, age, and class (a social and not biological  construct) seemed common knowledge or to have so many variables that I found it difficult to be interested. Age is also another widely variable category. Sometimes the questions seemed a little off-kilter such as: \\"How come it seems that Teenagers are afraid to take care of AIDS patients?\\" Huh? I've never heard or thought of this as being a perception of teenagers. Teens come with variable responsibility levels as do adults.<br /><br />Overall an excellent book. Sure to educate one on both our perceived and real differences. This could only be improved with a few more 'widely wondered' questions and an omission of a few of the more obvious ones. High entertainment value.	2005-02-04

And while I enjoyed I found it to be an average read. I knew from Grisham's past works that his despicable protagonist would reform and overcome his problems. And the Broker was no exception. What bothered me most was that very little actually happened. Joel goes to cafes. He hangs out with his tutors. He learns Italian. He eats food I cannot even name. He falls in love with a woman, and avoids bad guys.<br /><br />This was a good book, but its hardly a four star effort. It might be nice if it were labeled a 'cozy' mystery. More time was spent touring italy and drinking cappucino  than pursuing justice or fighting bad guys. Average. But not Great. Three Stars.	2005-01-24

Ludlum rambles on at length about each government, their response, each agent, their response. The Nefarious French. Muslim Fundamentalists. A bomb. Jihad. John smith is captured, manages to escape, is captured again, and the DNA computer is found and moved. Found and Moved.<br /><br />I liked the idea of this book, and I like Marty. But John as a character is rather wooden and lifeless. The other characters are merely stereotypes. Not his best work.	2005-01-19

Good Read	Sharpe's Eagle is an exciting and riveting drama set in the 19th century and follows the story of Richard Sharpe and his doughty band of comrades. I listened to the unabridged audio edition of Sharpes' Eagles, and I really, really liked it. My only issue with Cornwell's writing is that some of his characters are similar to other characters in other series (such as the Starbuck series). Also, I think Cornwell's characters are somewhat shallow. I would like to see him concentrate more on developing characters which are more than just same archetypes. Overall, this was a great book, sure to delight fans of historical action-adventure.	2005-01-10

Annoying Characters	I listened to the Unabridged Audio Version of Angels and Demons and I was rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed DaVinci Code, but this novel read like the exact same book. Lets see: we've got the overly brainy annoying lead character: check. Nubile younger woman: check. Crazed zealot assassin: check. Catholic Conspiracy: check.<br /><br />Add to this long (and pointless) flashbacks by minor characters, and Robert Langdon's endless preaching and I found myself wishing for the novel to end. I really might be able to enjoy this book, if I actually liked a few of the lead characters. No such luck. The only likeable character was the Pope's assistant. But even he was a stereotype, way too saintly. Lets try for a few human characters rather than such extreme sterotypes, next time shall we?<br /><br />Also, I could do without the rather heavy-handed preaching in the middle. Okay, okay we get it. Because of Science we are all drowning in a morass of hopelessness without Mother Church. We get it. Can we get back to the action story now?<br /><br />Eh. 3 stars. This was an okay listen, but I've heard better.	2005-01-04

I liked the first book in this series. The idea of a Fairy Princess as a PI totally hooked me. But this is the last book in the Merry series I can stomach (unless LKH changes her writing style). There's just way too much sex and blood for my taste. I ended up fast-forwarding half the book to get to the parts of any substance. Laurell is a good writer...But I think she needs to take a breather and let her characters do something other than fornicate.<br /><br />I don't consider myself a prude, but I like more mystery and depth in my books. Also, I've begun to think this series is increasingly sexist. Merry's men are treated very shabbily. I don't think I could stomach a novel where females are treated the way Merry's 'men' are. It reminds me a bit of Heinlein's later works... You know the novels where the nerdy male protagonist takes many young nubile women to bed? And amazingly none of these women are jealous or get fed up with the 'relationship.'  Ach du lieber!<br /><br />I'll regret not knowing more of what happens to Rhys, Doyle and Galen, but I'm going to have to give Hamilton's next work a pass... Unless she gets out of her boinking-as-substitution-for-actual-plot rut.<br /><br />2 Stars for some good characterization and excellent descriptions. -3 for the oodles of boring, squiggly, and unneccessary fornication with way too many similar ken-doll-esque men.	2005-01-04

I purchased the unabridged audio version of Bubble's Unbound with the understanding that this novel was supposed to be humorous. Boy, was I disappointed. Bubbles is just another sad Steph Plum knockoff, but worse, Bubbles is even more inept than Plum. If such a thing can be believed.<br /><br />Worse, this novel isn't particularly funny. Bubbles Unbound was like a bad episode of Lucy... But with a silly ex, and a teenage daughter instead of Rickie. I found the humor in this novel cringe inducing. (The scene with the 'jumper,' the long and sad back-story about the main character's lack of education and compulsive community college course-taking).The characters names (Stilleto, Bubbles), were off-putting and too 'cute' for my taste.<br /><br />Overall, I found Bubbles Unbound to be a waste of time. It didn't even produce a chuckle.	2005-01-01

Nate Starbuck is a naive young Northerner who, gets involved with a young actress who persuades him to steal money from their employer and flee South. Once the lovebirds reach the Southern states, Nate discovers that the love of his life has snookered him. Unable to return North to his Puritanical father, Nate decides to join the legion being formed by a wealthy landowner Washington Falconer.<br /><br />Nate's desire to become a soldier allows him to befriend a crew of odd characters like Major Bird, Truslow and Sally Truslow. Nate himself grows from being naive and guiless, to a rather self-sufficient young man. His adventures (and mis-adventures), are entertaining and gratifying.<br /><br />My main and only problem with \\"Rebel\\" is that I found myself not really LIKING Nate Starbuck as much as I wanted to. Nate's a bit selfish in pursuing the things he wants, isn't particularly loyal to his family, and is rather self-indulgent. (Granted, Nate is young and irresponsible), but he seems to lack a moral compass and I wanted Nate to be a tad more heroic. Also, his motivations for fighting for the South, aren't strong. The desire to \\"Spite his father\\" seems immature to me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great series, sure to please fans of historical drama... But I just wish Nate were a bit of a nicer guy. I would've enjoyed the story even more.	2004-12-24

But I found myself quickly growing tired of her anachronistic PC behavior. (Elenora loves the servants, treats them like friends), her attitude (which was downright pushy at times), and the rather predictable plot line. The villain was yet another silly mad scientist (sigh). Boy, I grew tired of that about half way through. The Hero, St. Merrin was alright, but a little crabby, and he comes off as a bit of a know-it-all sometimes, which makes him seem a trifle insecure. The secondary romance was only so much filler because the couple, after being introduced was rarely seen and did not play much of a roll.<br /><br />This was an entertaining read, but by no means brain science. I didn't care for the heroine/hero's anachronistic behaviors, and the silly \\"I'm sooo evilll villain,\\" was boring rather than mysterious.<br /><br />This novel WAS well narrated, however, and entertaining enough to listen to while I commute, especially since it required less than my full attention.	2004-12-21

Michael Crichton's latest is a novel about Eco-Terrorism, and the corruptive influence the media and fear-mongers have on modern America. The plot is fairly boiler plate: idealistic young Americans struggle to fight an evil,  wealthy Attorney and his cadre of dogma spouting celebrities. Along the way, the American trades his ignorance for enlightenment and gains the respect of newfound friends and two (?) beautiful love interests.<br /><br />I liked the first half of 'state of fear'. It was very strong in the beginning... But it never really took off after the first half. For one thing: despite having an assortment of really interesting devices to 'attack' the environment, the terrorists seemed rather goofy and didn't seem to be a huge of a threat. I wanted to see them really do a few awful things, to justify all this globe-trotting. No dice. Second. The characters: Crichton's characters aren't very likeable. The main character Peter, whined more than any character ever created by Anne Rice, and the two female characters were virtually interchangeable.  They seemed more like Bond Girls than real women. But give them some SOUL. And please. Both of these chica's fell for that goofball Peter? In his dreams!<br /><br />The plot had its exciting moments. The scenes in the state park were great, and the assassins manner of killing people was unique.  But many scenes were quite predictable, and the scene with the cannibals was almost comical in its grotesqueness. Finally: the ending...It leaves a lot of loose threads. In fact, I couldn't really believe I'd reached the ending when I did, because there were so many issues left unresolved...<br /><br />Four stars for an entertaining, but rather unsuspensful story.	2004-12-18

I listened to the unabridged audio version of Metro Girl. I found the tape quality to be good but not great. The narrator did well voicing the male characters and the foreign characters but Metro Girls' voice really bugged me. She sounded like Grandma Mazur (from the plum series). Not good. Not good at all.<br /><br />The plot? When Barney's (hate the nickname) brother disappears in Florida, its the selfless big-sister to the rescue! What does she do? Call the Cops? File a missing person's report? NO, she decides to investigate on her own. On the way she picks up a Stephanie-Plumesque cast of wacky stereotypes, and a hormone-driven NASCAR guy.<br /><br />Do you remember the episodes of Lucy you watched as a child? The shows where Lucy (a supposedly intelligent person) came up with some silly scheme that never quite worked out and Ricky needed to rescue her? Well, that's how I found Metro Girl. The parts that weren't deadly dull that is. I just had a hard time caring about her lounge lizard brother she was trying to rescue. He was just such a loser. And Metro Girl herself? I'm beginning to think that Evanovich can't write younger women very well. Metro Girl acts like a fifty-year-old in a thirty-something body. Plus the character, despite being a mechanic was TSTL (Too Stupid to Live).  And some of the things she does to people were way too harsh! Like putting the Date Rape drug in the pizza? People could choke to death and DIE from that man! Not Funny.<br /><br />Barney, like her counterpart Plum is a binge-eater. She has a wacky ethnic side-kick. She has a gay best-friend. She is full of neurotic behaviors such as her \\"Junk-food-eating\\" and \\"Fear of Heights.\\" Despite being in a non-conventional career, she really isn't. She's a total softie who 'hates guns,' and can't seem to tie her shoe laces without a cast of characters to help her out. Yeesh. The only saving grace was NASCAR Guy who was very Funny, and cute besides. Way too good for Barney.<br /><br />Oh, and whatever happened to the Thug they stashed in Judy's closet? I guess we'll never know.<br /><br />Recommended: Only if you're in the mood for a wacky comedy that tries a bit too hard to be funnyh, and whatever happened to the Thug they stashed in Judy's closet?

When Merry and her gang are called upon to speak to an Seelie court exile, Maeve, little do they realize what they're getting into. Maeve holds a terrible secret which could spell death for Merry and friends. Their lives are further complicated when they are called to investigate a gruesome murder....<br /><br />I really enjoyed A caress of Twilight. Merry is an engaging character and her men (with the exception of Kitto and Sage), very hot! I particularly like Rhys, and Hamilton's style of writing. Very descriptive and engaging. This writing syle is greatly enhanced by the narrators command of the English language, and ability to change her voice to match each character! Well done!<br /><br />I did feel the ending was a bit rushed. I'd like to see Hamilton 'tie up the cases' in the actual story. I also am probably one of the few people in the world who find Kitto...A bit annoying. He seems to cower and shiver like Golum from Lord of the Rings. And the dog bed thing only enhances the fact that this character seems more of a pet than a person....Erkk... I much prefer Rhys and Doyle!<br /><br />This was a fun sexy read. Due to mature content, I'd recommend for adults only. Viva la Merry!	2004-11-29

I'm a big fan of 'country' style cookbooks (cookbooks which leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside because of stories, pictures and just plain old good food), and Pioneer Lady's Country Kitchen was quite simply awesome. Its chock full of treasured cooking memories from the authors' life during the depression.  After reading this book, I really got the feel for what life was like for the author growing up on the farm, surrounded by aunts, cousins, and home-cooked food.<br /><br />Most of the recipes appear to be quite easy.

The book is rather slim on writing tips and large on discussion the horror genre in general. If you are a novice to the horror genre, you might appreciate the lengthy background on horror fiction and the author's Freudian interpretations. If you've read more than a few, this background seems like too much filling.<br /><br />The book itself is also rather poor quality. Mine became unglued and fell apart from its binding- which made even re-selling this monster impossible.<br /><br />If this book were marketed as \\"A history of Horror Writing\\" it might be much more accurately titled. As it was, there were few tips and just a lot of expostulation- disappointing.	2004-11-14

It is the only one of it's kind...A squarish library sized Gooseberry Patch book, complete with a dust jacket and more chatty comments by the authors/s.. This book lacks the Gooseberry Patch trademark spiral binding, and the overall Gooseberry Patch 'cuteness' in my opinon. To me, Simple Country Pleasures seems like the authors were trying a bit too hard or trying to go mainstream... .The illustrations are numerous, but aren't quite as fun as the one's in the spiral back books.<br /><br />The verdict? If you like crafts, this book will appeal to you. Pages 1-71 are all crafts, mostly to do with gardening. Recipes are in the second half of the book...And most have a garden 'outdoors' theme. Believe it or not, there is a recipe for \\"Stuffed Tulips\\" (no, I'm not kidding), and a recipe for Rose Petal Tea. If Gardening and Flowers are your thing...Look no further its here.<br /><br />This cookbook is by no means the best monkey in the barrel, but its not the worst either. Its a fun read, but not quite as good as the other 35+ cookbooks. For real fun, check out: Christmas Pantry, Home for the Holidays and Magic of Christmas. They are excellent.	2004-11-13

I'm a big fan of the Gooseberry Patch Cookbook series. Particularly the large spiral bound versions, but the'Christmas' series produced by Leisure Arts is a little hit or miss for me- Mostly because I prefer recipes instead of crafts, and Christmas has over 80+ pages of crafts and about 40+ pages of recipes.<br /><br />There are some great recipes in this one. Seafood Lasagne, Eggnog Cookies, and Christmas Tree pull-apart rolls. The presentation is cute, and the stories and ancedotes nice and heart-warming<br /><br />If there were fewer crafts, and more recipes, I'm sure I'd like this series more. 4 stars, because the crafts dominate the book a little too much.	2004-11-05

In this installment, Elin is left to defend a the city of Chantilon which is besieged by Vikings while her common-law husband Owen (A bishop), seeks help from his family. Can Owen save his city or is it doomed to fall into the hands of Haakon and his band of evil raiders?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the audio narration of Beguiled. Borchardt really made early France come alive in this surprising narration of murder/mystery/and romantic suspense. In particular, I like how she handles such a large cast of characters, and still manages to keep things interesting. There are precisely three main story plots going on in this book. Owen's Quest. Haakon and Elspeth (the pseudo-villains), and Elin and her group. Somehow, Borchardt manages to keep all three stories interesting (although I admit I was less interested in Owen's issues than in the other two). I also thought Borchardt did an excellent job of portraying the redemption of a few of the most evil characters (such as the berserker).<br /><br />My only peeve? I felt that Owen,  was a little boring. Thank god for his Saxon sidekick or I might've fast-forwarded his scenes. He was a good character... But a trifle wooden. I highly recommend the audio version which was quite well narrated. Well worth the price as there are MANY hours of listening.	2004-10-19

I purchased the original Nickel Quilts book and loved it! And so you can imagine my delight when I received \\"More Nickel Quilts\\" in the mail. The concept of Nickel quilts is quite unique- all blocks therein are composed of 5 inch squares. This worked great in the first book, which had quite a few really awesome patterns, but I think in the second book, this concept is stretched a little thin.<br /><br /> With the exception of shoe fly, most of the blocks were just repetitive and eye-numbing. Patterns which are easy to see shrunk down on the page don't necessarily make great quilts for bedspreads. Overall, I found this book disappointing. If you have a chance, pick up Nickel Quilts. This was an awesome book. I think with \\"More Nickel Quilts\\"....The author just ran out of ideas. I'd recommend browsing this book before buying, to make sure you like the blocks.	2004-10-15

Add a few classic soap opera twists, including a blacksheep brother, a cheating spouse and a mystery baby and you have Noble Causes.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story for the most part, although to be honest it was somewhat light. What I didn't like was the art. At times it was well drawn...Other times the art looked like the scrawling of a ten year old. Some characters were hardly recognizable from story to story- you'd think the artist had no reference to work from.<br /><br />Still the story was fun, and the concept cool. Worth reading, but the artwork lacks consistancy which cost this story a star.	2004-10-11

When he's bad he's can be quite predictable and downright banal. The Taking is unfortunately, not one of his better works. I listened to the Unabridged audio version. And what can I say? The narrator was awful. She did an okay job when narrating the female characters. But her male characters all sound like women who smoke twelve packs a day. Not a good choice for an already mediocre novel.<br /><br />Hmmm.. The plot? I liked the idea of an alien invasion, I could've done without the heavy-handed Bible Thumping, and snide commentary on modern times. True, there are corrupt people and corrupt practices in the modern world. But, really is this anything new? There are just as many good-minded well-intentioned people in the world as well. I grew tired of the preaching and the gloomy 'end of the world' propaganda intending to scare people into conversion. (Ala Left Behind).  When I pick up a book, I want to be entertained not sermonized to!<br /><br />Not one of his better works. I dislike novels with an 'agenda.' If you are considering reading \\"The Taking\\" check out the reviews first to avoid disappointment.	2004-09-28

This is the story of Ellen, a pagan princess and her love for the Archbishop Owen. This novel is set in early Medieval France, a time of mysticism, paganism and Viking raids. I particularly loved the gritty realism of the cities, the manner in which Owen was portrayed, and the inclusion of the pictish 'old people.'<br /><br />I agree with some reviewers that the sex scenes were somewhat gratuitous and numerous. Also, I felt the lead characters were somewhat anachronistic and a little PC. (Nobility schmoozing  with the servants, religious tolerance), these elements did not fully detract from the novel.<br /><br />My only dislike? I disliked Ellen's \\"Powers.\\" I thought her 'abilities' were prime examples of deus ex machina, and were used twice to resolve difficult plot points which could've been solved in different manner without the silly mysticism.<br /><br />Overall, though, this book is one of the better historical romance reads I've read in a while. Well worth the effort to pick up in Audio format.	2004-09-20

Included are 6 painting demos and examples of techniques to use when creating your very own masterpiece. I particularly liked it that the author addresses copyright issues and how to make photo collages to create your own graphic aids. This is a must for artists who like to use photos for more photo-realistic paintings and who do not have access to their subjects.<br /><br />If you like this one, make sure to check out the other books in the series: Artist's Photo Reference: Birds, Artist's Photo Reference: Flowers, and Artist Photo REference: Landscapes.	2004-09-09

I purchased Quilting for Dummies when I was first getting into quilting, and I found the instructions easy to follow and quite informative. Each project is well laid out and detailed enough to grasp at the first try.<br /><br />My only disappointment, was that I wish that they could have spent more time on block making, and less on the applique technique. Frankly, I thought the text was spread a little thin on the block creation portion, and they spent a little TOO much time on Applique, which would easily be been worthy of a separate volume. Overall, this peeve aside, this is an excellent and easy-to-follow reference book for quilters of beginning and intermediate skill levels.	2004-09-09

Nickel Quilts has MANY great designs for using 5 inch scraps, or cutting and designing your own quilts from scratch.  I particularly like the Northern Lights quilt but the pinwheel and maple leaf quilts are beautiful to. This is a wonderful reference book! My quilting from this book has been very well recieved.

I am not opposed to children being in romance novels, but, I hate it when the romantic plot is subsumed by other characters. In this case, the \\"Cody attempts to rescue Benjamin\\" subplot got a little old.<br /><br />Still, I liked Zach, and enjoyed his dialogue and the attraction between the heroine and himself seemed genuine. I'm giving this 3 stars. I would've liked to see more of the hero and heroine and less of the children's antics.	2004-09-02

Jack Aubrey and his sidekick Doc Maturin (or is Aubrey the sidekick?), are off to the other side of the world to deliver convicts to the penal colony of Botany Bay. In this segment Aubrey's leadership skills and Doc Maturin's skills at intrigue are put to the test, as the crew of the Leopard must face icebergs and a vengeful Dutch Captain. Maturin is involved in an interesting love triangle, and we get an amusing glimpse into the life of Missus Aubrey, the twins, and Jack's son.<br /><br />What can I say? I love Desolation Island. I listened to the unabridged audio version narrated by Patrick Tull, and found myself enjoying it immensely. Aubrey is such a jolly fellow, one cannot help but love him, and Maturin is such a fun, and at<br /><br />times a very deep character.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that I wish Aubrey had a better relationship with his wife. Sophie is sweet but her relationship with Jack seems unfulfilling to him. (I won't even GO there about Maturin's dismal love life). I trully feel sorry for them both. Also, I never quite get how old Aubrey and Maturin are supposed to be. They are described as being \\"Old\\" but this is never explained. Ohwell. These peeves are minor. This is a great series of books. Especially great in unabridged audio format.<br /><br />Not to be missed. =-)	2004-09-01

When gallery manager Malory is sent an invitation to a creepy old mansion on Warrior's Peak little does she realize she will be receiving a quest from the gods themselves. Mallory and her fellow invitees Kate and Zoë are the chosen champions of the gods...Their quest? To find the keys which will free the souls of three trapped Goddesses.<br /><br />I found Key of light to have an interesting premise, but the book was suffered from some of the most HOKEY plot elements and the most banal characterization I've ever read in a Roberts book.<br /><br />I HATED the two main characters..  Malory was tedious and excessively girly, and I found Flynn to be kind of a manipulative geek.  Their relationship was unconvincing and lacked spark. Roberts tries to overcome the characters lack of chemistry by telling us that there is `heat' between Malory and Flynn, but I've seen more spark in a bottle of antifreeze.  These two didn't `click' for me and the romance seemed forced. Plus, every time they got together they were interrupted by the dog. How romantic is it really to have a big annoying dog slobbering all over you, knocking you down, and sticking its nose in your crotch? felt like I was reading a Stephanie Plum novel. It's just not romantic to date a guy who can't control his mutt. It just seems....Unmanly somehow. I know Roberts intended the dog segments to be funny, but I found them annoying and silly.<br /><br />While Kate (the obvious heroine of the second book), leaves me cold, I'm looking forward to Zoë's story. I prefer her more normal heroines. Women who obsess about their broken nails and fall for geeks like Flynn don't really interest me. Ohwell, maybe book 2 will be better.	2004-08-14

Although her children are uneasy living in the Rockwell, Caroline hopes they will adjust with time. Although initially happy, her son and daughter are plagued by nightmares, and the building inhabitants are both cloying and creepy...Is the Rockwell more than it seems or are Caroline and the children just imagining things?<br /><br />I picked up Midnight Voices only because it is narrated by my favorite narrator Aasne Vigesaa, and I was not disappointed. Aasne manages to capture the voices of Caroline Evans, her new husband Tony, and the creepy residents of the Rockwell apartment building  to a T.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart, however. The residents of the Rockwell are truly terrible. Without giving details away, at times I was forced to fast forward certain scenes where torture was murder were described in detail. Fortunately these scenes were few. I had only a couple of peeves with this book. 1. Its never really clear what the ghoulish people in the Rockwell are doing with their victims. Also. Its never clear how  they themselves got to be the way they are. 2. The key ring which Caroline has from the antique store is just a little too handy. Especially at the end. 3. Social Services never followed up with the Albions about Rebecca Mahew. 4. Finally, the residents of the Rockwell weren't too smart in their choice of victims.<br /><br />Other than that, this was a compelling and gripping audiobook. I truly hope there is a sequel.	2004-08-05

After hearing such great things about the &quot;In Death&quot; series by Roberts AKA Robb, I finally bit the bullet and purchased the unabridged audio version. Well, I guess I was expecting a bit more than her normal romance novels, because I found the 'suspense and mystery' rather lacking. Eve was a nice enough character if a tad predictable... (Hard-boiled tomboyish female cop who can't dress, can't cut her hair and is so messed up she can't sleep at night...Oh... And lets not forget the disdain of doctors and shrinks...Hmmmm... This is probably the most overused cop stereotype around). Enter Roarke, the supposed chief 'suspect.' This is where the novel became hokey. After establishing the fact that Eve is tough, hard-nosed and without mercy, she instantly falls head over heels for an Irish &quot;Bill Gates&quot; despite the fact that he is so pushy arrogant and annoying I wanted to scream... Oh...And lets not forget to have sex, during the middle of a gruesome murder investigation. Yeah right.<br /><br /> While this story started out okay, it quickly got bogged down with a silly romance between Eve and Roarke which should have cost her her badge. I wish Eve at LEAST had the dignity and restraint to refuse involvement with Roarke until this investigation was over. No such luck. Silly.<br /><br /> I found Naked to be an average read with momentary elements of brilliance. What ruined it for me was Roarke, who was too superhuman to be believed, and the 'mystery' which wasn't really much of a mystery at all.	2004-08-04

Mostly because I just didn't like either Della Ward (the heroine), or James Cameron (the hero.) Della was too self-pitying. Cameron also suffered from his share of overblown angst, but was also a bit cold. The whole 'quest' to find Claire (the daughter Della was forced to give up at 17) was very unsatisfying.<br /><br />  I like Osborne best when she sticks to Americana, but also when the subject matter is a little more upbeat. This novel dwelled a bit too much on the past (the fate of Della's late husband Clarence), and the fate of her child (Claire), and not on the relationship or current situation of either of the main two characters. Because Claire and James' pasts were not that upbeat, I found it a trifle maudlin and not very romantic. My advice? Skip Prairie Moon, unless you simply MUST read an author's entire backlist.	2004-07-28

I listened and purchased the unabridged audio version of the Cat Who Talked Turkey, and was quite disappointed. First, the story was far too short. Four cassettes and only four hours of listening? And this is UNABRIDGED?! Second, there was absolutely NO mystery. The supposed 'mystery' was tied up neatly, but was quite implausible. No explanation as for why the villain did what the villain did. Silly.<br /><br /> While I enjoyed seeing Mr. Q in action, I did think him a bit meddlesome to advise the old woman to cut the granddaughter out of her will. How many museums does Moose County really need anyway? The novel was well narrated, but it was too short and lacked suspense and mystery. I'd check this one out at the library before purchasing.	2004-07-24

I eagerly awaited the release of the latest Stephanie Plum novel in audio format, and I was greatly disappointed. Ten Big Ones is just a rehash of the same `ol same `ol, Stephanie's cars blow up, her grandmother obsesses about Stiva's, and Stephanie's love life is just dull dull dull. I'm not a big Joe fan, but having Stephanie shack up with him, has been the kiss of death to this series. The only bright spot was the return of Sally Sweet, the drag queen, whom I really liked.<br />What disappoints me the most is that Stephanie is still incompetent. After ten books, she still hates guns, leaves them in the cookie jar and has her cars blow up, and men rescue her all the time. Please girl. Get some skill or get out of the bounty hunter biz!<br />  I used to be able to take Stephanie with a modicum of seriousness, but the series has degraded into sophomoric humor and slapstick. Not my bag!	2004-07-13

Jack Aubrey, and his sidekick doctor Maturin return for the sequel (book 2), in the delightful Aubrey and Maturin series. In this episode, Aubrey is on the run from debt collection agents and Doctor Maturin receives an interesting commission of his own from the government. Also, jealousy rears its ugly head, as the two comrades fight for the attentions of Cecila, (a cruel hearted vixen who has entranced both Maturin and Aubrey).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this second novel in this exciting nautical series. The book was extremely well narrated, and I found myself staying up late, just to listen to more of it!! I particularly like Jack Aubrey's character he seems so guileless. I like Maturin, but at times he can be rather cold and self-indulgent. I eagerly await listening to more of this exciting series.	2004-07-13

His best-friend is the nerdy doctor Maturan. When Aubrey is assigned to the Sophie he convinces Maturan, a doctor in private practice, to enlist. Together they have many excellent adventures. This is the first in the series.<br />I listened to the unabridged audio version of this novel, and was VERY impressed. The narrator manages to capture Aubrey's good nature and Maturin's cheerful introspection quite well.<br />This series is very detailed. I learned plenty about the life of British sailors and the relationships between the characters is charming and at times sad. In particular, I liked  Aubrey. He has an almost cheerfully optimism that is quite infectious. Doctor Maturan is funny, but at times I wish he were more assertive.<br />Overall, an excellent book. Well narrated. Five Stars.	2004-07-09

Books	3	10	11	N	N	Not Quite Up to Par	I'm a big fan of Gooseberry patch series, and received my copy in the mail with baited breath. Christmas Book 5 was not as good as others in the series. Why? Mostly because I found some of the crafts rather boring and drab, and nothing anyone might actually want to make... Also, there weren't quite as many recipes, and the ones which were included were mostly desserts. While I like desserts, I think there should be a fair mix of entrees and other snacks included to round out a compilation. Overall, an average book. Not quite up to par, and nothing I see myself using using for anything other than shelf weight to round out my collection.	2004-07-09

We've got the goddess-worshipping white-haired 'just say no to meat' healer/vegetarian heroine and the obligatory Saxon brute hero who kidnaps the unwilling heroine. Does this plot sound familiar? It should, it's the plot used over and over in romance novels from J. Lindsey to Clan of the Cave Bear.<br />Okay, you might say...This is romance. But this plot was just silly. How many books can one read where the nasty Viking kidnaps the silly and oh-so-politically correct pagan priestess? While I like Squires writing in previous works, I had hoped this book would be more than just a 'lovespell-esque' book filled with pseudo-history and psychic healer women. I guess I'm just disappointed. A little research into the lifestyle of ancient Brits might have made these characters really shine.	2004-07-04

Jedi Master Taita- oops- the warlock Taita- returns in the third installment of Wilbur Smith's Egypt series. In this book, Taita, now an elderly and influential man, is asked by the spirit of his deceased mistress Lostris to care for and protect her young son Nefer. This proves more difficult than it seems because Nefer is heir to the throne with some powerful (and sadistic) enemies.<br />I really enjoyed the first half of Warlock, even if Smith deviates a bit from his first novel by employing supernatural elements. (Not a problem in itself, but inconsistent with the first story). Taita was lovable as always, Nefer, much like his father and his Nefer's girlfriend much the same as queen Lostris.<br />Negatives: be prepared for some truly gruesome descriptions of rape, torture and mayhem as well as human cruelly which at times was so severe I felt nauseated. Particularly the sacrifices to the Babylonian god Marduk and the fate of the Babylonian women at the hands of the pharaoh Truk.<br />I also thought the 'running the red road' ritual was really unbelievable. How conceivable is it that the a warrior brotherhood would condone killing so many people. just to initiate two boys into the guild? Silly. Especially in a time of war.<br />This was a fine work, but it was marred by senseless violence, and some fantastic elements, not in keeping with the first in the series.	2004-06-30

The visions he had seemed more suitable to a Disney movie (I kept thinking of Belle with the talking broomsticks and teacups), and quite frankly I found Galen's relationship with his wife boring. (Then again, I prefer my fantasy characters to be single at least at the beginning of a story).<br />Perhaps its my fault for listening to the audio version, which only prolonged the first section of this novel -but I found this book tedious and dry. Perhaps the sequel will be better?	2004-06-27

Aiden is a white slave from Ireland and Kai is a black landowner. When Aiden and his mother are sold to Kai's family Aiden must struggle to learn the ways of his new master to help himself- and his family. Lion's blood is set in an alternate 'reality' where white Europeans, ravaged by plague remain technologically unadvanced and Africans dominate.<br />I really enjoyed reading about Lion's blood. In particular I enjoyed the segments about Aiden and his family. While I liked Kai, I found it difficult to relate to his religious beliefs and the manner in which women are treated in the colonies, also at times Kai is a bit shallow.<br />Dislikes? I found some elements unbelievable. I found the 'slave rebellion' and its consequences a little fantastic. Also, I never really cared that much for Sophia, although I liked the character concept her character is undefined, and she seemed to go from tough to co-dependant too quickly and her relationship with Aiden lacked spark.  Finally, the Aztec campaign was a bit rushed and I didn't feel that segment was as well written as the rest of the book.<br />Still, all criticism aside, this is an excellent series, sure to delight any fan of alternate reality fiction.

Brianna is studying to be a healer.  &quot;Sammy&quot; Bergen is a biker. When Sammy begins hearing a mysterious 'singing voice' he thinks he's gone crazy. Instead, he's listening to Brianna, a 9th century Irish maiden.<br />I wanted to like this book. I'm a fan of Sizemore's modern novels. But I just had trouble getting  into this one. The writing seemed amateurish, and I had difficulty taking the hero &quot;Sammy&quot; seriously. His name (Sammy) seemed like the name of a little boy rather than a big tough biker. Also it was a little too 'light' for my tastes. I prefer more depth and historical accuracy in the books I read.<br />This might appeal to those who like light historical romance. But for me, I found it onerous.	2004-06-16

But after that it devolved into sheer Koontz formula.<br />For readers of Koontz, there really are no surprises in this novel. He uses the same formula in numerous other books. Lessee: There is a best friend who is a Hispanic cop. A Saintly single mom character. Quotations from the `book of Counted Sorrow,' a sentient dog, ranting about the apocalypse, mistrust of the psychiatric profession, and a serial killer who collects body parts... *Yawn.* How many Koontz books have elements similar to this?<br />The disappointing thing was I actually enjoyed the first HALF of the book. I liked the characters of Connie and Harry, but the second half contained way too much deus ex machina to be believed. And whatever happened to the first case Harry and Connie were working on? This subplot was dropped entirely. Disappointing. This was average Koontz. It might entertain readers who haven't read his backlist and for whom many plot elements are new...But for Koontz fans it contains no surprises...	2004-06-16

I listened to the audio version of Firstling of Shannara, and while I enjoyed the narration, I found the story a little boring and predictable. For some reason the plot just failed to grab me. In the story there are elves. There is a dwarf. There is a druid muttering some mystic mumbo-jumbo. They are out to find/forge the sword of Shannara, and everyone is reluctant. Reluctant to become involved, reluctant to believe, reluctant to wield the sword properly. Reluctant to fall in love.<br />Relationships are passionless and handled poorly. The three major romantic relationships featured in this book are quite dysfunctional. Tay loves Preia, Preiea loves the king Jerle, the King loves Tay's sister who is married, Merrith loves the ranger who is supposed to be 40+ years old? Ech. The only person I actually really liked was Bremen. I felt sorry for him and the pain/sacrifice he bore at times. But the rest of the characters had as much personality as department store mannequins.<br />Look. If a story is going to have romance in it. Make it ROMANTIC. The romances were hasty and very contrived.<br />Not quite up to par with the rest of the books.  And what's with all the female character's being called 'girl'? The author refers to Preia as 'the elf girl' and Merrith as the 'druid girl' but the male characters are all called 'men' come on now. These characters are WOMEN.  Lets call them such, shall we?	2004-06-13

The problem?<br />Tabitha doesn't WANT to be a witch. All she wants to do is be NORMAL. She is embarrassed by her parents and her own 'witchiness' and wants a normal life. Unfortunately, this state of normalcy is denied her and she hates the world and blames Mommy and Daddy.<br />When a magic accident sends Tabitha back in time she meets a knight in shining armor. Can Tabitha find true love with Colin or are their differences too much to overcome?<br />Well, first, I must say that I detested Tabitha. Her 'poor little rich girl' attitude annoyed me extremely. Her over-studied frumpiness and hatred of her loving and well-intentioned parents made me dislike her. Most of the novel she acted like a spoiled teenager instead of a business executive. Tabitha must be dragged kicking and screaming through each adventure. Ugh. Boring.<br />The hero Colin was nice, tolerant and quite patient, but we didn't get to spend too much time with him. Instead, most of the novel was spent listening to Tabitha shout inane things, act like a spoiled brat, and hand-wring about what an outcast she is.<br />This novel had some cute dialog, especially when Sir Arjon and Colin were involved, but Tabitha was too annoying for words.	2004-06-09

When a little boy disappears residents begin to wonder whether the hero Ben (a  writer who has just moved back into town)  might be involved in some way. Can Ben Mears discover the true killer before the town of Jerusalem's lot is overrun?<br />I listened to the unabridged audio version of Salem's Lot, and I found it a bit cluttered. There were too many characters, each with his/her own back story, and I found it annoying to 'headhop' between them at a moments notice. Dozens of minor characters are written about in this manner, and I found it tedious.  I found the lengthy dedication at the beginning somewhat boring (especially read aloud), and the prologue in my opinion told in flashback form from the main character's point of view was filled with spoilers and was rather pointless. I absolutely HATE hearing how main characters will survive or can survive before an actually takes place. This is a main wall-banger for me. Plus, I didn't care for King's vampires. I prefer the sexy mysterious type not the devil-worshipping I'm soooo evil satanic variety. The vamps were no different from serial killers. Boring.<br />Fans of horror novels will like the references and the evil 'Marston' house. Fans of vampire novels, might find the vampires in this novel unsophisticated and too cheesy for words. I know I did. 3 stars for some good characters and solid worldbuilding.	2004-06-01

We don't find out much about the man for many chapters only that he's decided he wants to marry her.  Cleo is your typical doormat heroine. First sacrificing for her father then for her sisters. The entire first chapter she spends 'needing' and 'wanting.' What does that mean? Also the frequent flashbacks in italics drove me nuts.<br />I cannot recommend this novel. The writing was very banal.  I'm sorely disappointed.	2004-05-26

Author Flynn Connolly takes a stab at feminist SCI FI, in \\"The Rising of the Moon.\\"  Unfortunately, what starts off as an interesting idea: what happens if the Ireland of the future forms a Taliban-like Theocracy? Soon becomes an anti-catholic rant describing the evils of Christianity and the horrors of a society dominated by the Church.<br />Those who know my reading tastes, know I've enjoyed my fair share of feminist fiction and alternate realities but for some reason Rising of the Moon just didn't grip me. Perhaps I prefer books with more action, or perhaps it's just that the characters of R.O.T.M seemed to lecture a bit TOO much on the glories of feminism, that they didn't seem real. I mean, come on, and even little kids seem to be budding feminists.... And everywhere Nuala goes she seems to meet sympathetic activists in the making. What about those who are happy with the Theocracy and the status quo?<br />I wanted to like this book, but I prefer novels where the readers aren't so completely BLUDGEONED with a message. I found it really unbelievable that someone as socially aware as Nuala would have no inkling that Ireland had changed `so drastically' in fifteen years. She's a teacher for goodness sake!  Still, I enjoyed parts of this book, which is why I'm giving it an average rating.	2004-05-26

But Loses Steam halfway through	Jack Sawyer is a precocious 12 year old who, while visiting a Coney-Island like resort town, meets an elderly African American janitor named (Speedy) who tells him of a fictional country called the territories. Speedy informs him that if he drinks a magic wine he can `flip' into the territories, a fictional world where his mother is Queen.<br />Jack believes Speedy, and goes on a quest to save his mother from his father's evil ex-partner and the ravages of cancer.<br />I really enjoyed the first three-quarters of the Talisman. I liked the character of Wolf. But after awhile I found the writing became repetitive. I felt Jack was too mature to be 12. I also found his friend: Richard to be very annoying. Richard whines more than any character ever created by Anne Rice. Plus he was useless.  Also, the ending was too surreal for me to find very interesting. I think the threat of Sloat could've been resolved in a different way.<br />Peeves? What's with all Phallic imagery? It seems like every rock and tree is described as looking like an erect (you know what). This was done WAY too much. Surely the author could come up with some other less Freudian adjective?<br />Overall, while this book started off well, it quickly lost steam. Would recommend for diehard fans.	2004-05-17

Everyone (except the bad guys), seem to love them. They are saintly.They can do no wrong. They never die. Please.<br />Even the Lyon/Raven clan's relationships are all perfect. Each couple is more than happy to settle down to become a Lyon/Raven baby-making machine. When accidental pregnancy occurs the prospective fathers all seem to be happy and thrilled. I don't know about you, but I found this to be too saccharin for words.<br />The only character that really interested me was Laria. But I found her relationship with Kincaid to be implausible and unhealthy. Everyone's reaction to this was very low key. Kincaid is gay; we've seen no indications otherwise in any of the previous books. To have the Mrdini manipulate them to become a couple seemed wrong somehow. Perhaps if Kincaid had bi leanings...But suddenly to get involved in a long term straight relationship? Implausible. Especially when the same character says at some late point: \\"I'll love you as much as my sexual orientation allows...\\" Either he loves Laria, or he doesn't why give us a qualifier?<br />Other than that, there are several loose plot threads and silliness. The whole part with the `Nose' was just ridiculous. The human nose is just not that sensitive. And what about the ethics of manipulating an entire species using biological warfare? This novel seemed like the jumbled collection of several different prospective novels rolled into one. It lacked the cohesion I've come to expect from a McCaffrey novel and left me feeling unsatisfied.	2004-05-14

Have you ever read a book with an interesting plot idea but with characters you just didn't like? That's how I felt about Single White Vampire.<br />Kate C. Leever is the editor for Lucern Argeneau, a popular paranormal fiction writer. When Kate's job demands that she book Argeneau for a publicity tour, she finds Argeneau QUITE uncooperative. When Argeneau continues to resist her demands, Leever travels to Toronto to meet him. Thus begins a rather annoying and banal vampire story which tries to be funny but quite simply wasn't.<br />I wanted to like this story, but I HATED the character of Lucern. I'm not a big fan of 'growly' fuss-bucket heroes to begin with, but Lucern is so cranky he needs to invest in serious Midol. What's so funny about one syllable answers to everything?  Also, I just didn't find this book very romantic.. Lucern was just NOT a nice guy, and Kate's attitude was so unrealistic and perky it was not to be believed. Sure Kate...Stay with an abusive mean man, and hope you'll be able to change him...Righttt.......<br />I found this novel disappointing. Sand's other books were much better.	2004-05-12

Few Caveats	Have you ever read a book with snappy dialog, hot romance and great characters? That fits &quot;I burn for you&quot; to a &quot;T&quot;. In particular I got the feeling that these characters were contemporary people. The author does a great job of making the characters 'modern' (which is something of a failure amongst modern romance writers who seem to write old fogey characters in young bodies). Not so with Susan Sizemore's writing. Her characters have snappy dialog, fun humor, and modern outlook. (And yes they even cuss and talk like modern adults).<br />I particularly thought Alec was a great character. Fun sense of humor, and despite the pain he was going, through he was interesting and controlled.<br />Caveats? There was an 'almost-rape' scene at the beginning that made me a trifle uncomfortable after reading it. I prefer to avoid reading forced seduction if I can possibly help it. Fortunately, these scenes are few and far between in most modern novels. Also, I felt Alec's reasoning for seeking his 'treatment' was not well explained and was focused on a tad too much. Who wants to read about a main character going through a therapy for pages and pages..? I prefer vampires who are 'happy' with their vampiric condition. Second...Enough with the baby-making-turned-vampire heroines. Being a hatchery for Vampire spawn isn't romantic, and has been done to death in Feehan's series. How about some single vampires who are happy that way and don't want kids?<br />Overall, this is a promising start. I enjoyed the dialog, and well written characters. With the exception of what was mentioned under Caveats, this a series to watch.	2004-05-12

Despite a jacket which makes Leesil the elf, look like the Pillsbury Dough Boy, this book was excellent!<br />The plot? This novel is a sequel to Dhampir, and begins pretty much  where the first book left off. I.E. while trying to create a `normal' life for themselves the vampire hunting duo are sucked once more into the action, working hard to uncover a nest of vampires who are preying on the citizens of a prosperous northern town.<br />What makes this series succeed  (at least for me) are the characters. Magiere and Leesil are likeable. Magiere's stiff emotionlessness and Leesil impulsiveness are a good combination. (And an interesting reversal of the typical fantasy gender roles). I like the fact that the author has not rushed the romance between these two characters, but has allowed it to develop naturally. My favorite of the two main leads is Leesil, whose backstory is quite fascinating. I like the fact that he refuses to take anything seriously except Magiere. Now if he could only stay away from the wine flask!<br />Peeves? I am at a loss to criticize anything about TOL except the fact that I'd like to see more books. Soon! (Grin). Second: while I don't need anything graphic as an adult reader, I felt romance scene was rushed. Especially after all that buildup. Surely a LITTLE more romance wouldn't be amiss.  Finally, I am wondering about Magiere's craving for blood and what impact this will have on the couple's relationship in the future.<br />This is a wonderful series with very  likeable characters. A keeper!	2004-05-10

When a former student returns to town on business, he pursues her despite the age difference (she is 4 years older), and the somewhat icky fact that he's had a `crush' on her ever since he was sixteen and she was twenty.<br />I liked the first half of Last Chance, but I didn't find the character of Rachel very believable or likeable. I found it difficult to believe she would `fall instantly' for one of her ex-students, especially a seemingly uneducated immature man like Lane. Further, I found it difficult to believe that a single woman with a son would care so little about her reputation, to cast it to the winds the moment the first hunk bats an eyelash at her. I mean, Lane's back less than a week, and she's hopping into bed with him! Silly.<br />Finally, I found Rachel's in-laws to be extremely irritating. They treat her like dirt but she struggles valiantly to keep the relationship alive: no, not because she likes them or wants to please them, but because it furthers the plot goals. :Groan:<br />Overall, this book started off well, but the relationship between the two characters seemed too rushed and wasn't as well developed as some of her other romantic couples. Subplots such as the evil in-laws and the entire Pinkerton's thing detracted from the main character's romance and made me wish the author had just left them out. I found Last Chance to be an ok read, but not one of her better works.	2004-05-09

When Annie is the victim of a sexual assault, her attackers brother Alex agrees to marry her believing she is mentally disabled. Can Annie and Alex find happiness, or is their relationship doomed to failure?<br />Okay, before I get blasted by Catherine Anderson fans, I found Annie's Song a compelling read. I liked the idea of a deaf heroine, and the issue of deafness being dealt with in a romance novel in a sensitive manner. But I must confess, I didn't find the romance very interesting or... Frankly that compelling. Mostly because, despite her deafness Annie was so very naive. Frankly, I found the fact that she was described as 'child-like' and innocent every other paragraph distasteful.<br />Also, the rape was never really addressed, and I found it really unbelievable that the heroine (many months pregnant), would welcome the advances of the rapists look alike brother. Perhaps AFTER the pregnancy, and after she'd had time to adjust and mature.....But before? Erk....<br />I also felt the relationship between her and Alex was somewhat unhealthy. Alex was more like a father for her, seldom letting Annie make decisions. While at the end, she finally asserts herself its not enough and not for the right reasons.<br />Overall, I found Annie's Song a compelling read, but the disparity in age and emotional development between Annie and Alex was off-putting to this reader. Perhaps if Annie had been portrayed as less naive I could've really enjoyed this novel.	2004-05-01

Leith Campbell is a highlander transported into the future which he believes is actually hell, can these two disparate souls find happiness? Or will the obstacles between them prove too much to overcome?<br />I wanted to like Original Sin, but I found the plot to be  too silly and cluttered.  Okay, I can handle some fantastic elements. But Original Sin had way too many, and the storyline was unclear especially the beginning where there was way too much dialog heavy with Scottish dialect. In particular Leith's dialect was jarring: do we really need dialog like: &quot;Come wi' me lass, so I can protect you from danger&quot; and &quot;God's teeth, woman ye would confuse Saint Peter himself.&quot; The plethora of dinna, canna, verra's just drove me nutty and pulled me out of the story time and time again.<br />A cute idea, but a little too far-fetched for my taste.	2004-04-27

Melanie Corbin is a woman fleeing two men who raped a close friend and committed murder. Fleeing with her are two ex-slaves Ned and Tilde. Melanie hires Kurt Buckner hoping he will protect her and her companions while they travel west to lead a new life.<br />This novel was pretty good. I was impressed with Ballas' ability to write convincing female characters. I also liked the stories of day-to-day life of the wagon train. Oh...And I loved Ned and Tilde.<br />Things I didn't like? Kurt seemed to get injured at least three times in this book. It got old. Also, he seemed to recover very quickly. Second, I found it distasteful that Melanie (the heroine), stood by and did nothing while her friend was assaulted. (This seemed out of character).Third, Kurt's `fear of commitment' issue also dragged about halfway through the book, and I wanted to kick him in the pants to `get on with it,' (those familiar with romance literature would probably roll their eyes at this subplot which is a staple in the romantic genre.<br />Still, Angel Fire was fun, exciting and well written, well worth reading.	2004-04-23

This is a somewhat implausible guardian/ward romance set in the 1783 Yorkshire England.  Our heroine Gillian Ellicott is made a ward (is that even possible at 20 yrs old?) of Calum Marquess of Iolar, when her father unexpectedly dies.<br />I found this romance novel difficult to get into. Gillian was an immature woman, whose 'hijinks' became annoying after a while. Calum Marquess of Iolar speaks like an extra from Braveheart... &quot;Och, weel, we know what that means doona we lassie?&quot;<br />I found myself skimming the second half of the book. I just couldn't get into it, and I found Calum's dialect distracting. Perhaps others might persevere where I have failed.	2004-04-23

Prairie gold is the story of twelve women who travel out west to become mail-order brides. The story focuses primarily on Perrin Waverly who is an intelligent widow with a big secret. Also in the spotlight are the other women who accompany her, including Perrin's nemesis Augusta Boyd.<br />I really enjoyed Prairie Gold. Maggie Osborne is at her absolute best when writing about the frontier days. Perrin and the other women were fascinating creatures and their struggles truly horrific at times.<br />While I liked this book, and give it a five star rating, I didn't find it particularly romantic. Mostly because the romance was rather downplayed, and was rather bland. The hero Cody Snow was rather typical for a romance hero (his wife did him wrong so he hates all women) (bleh). The romance between the character Mem and Webb Coate was more interesting but very unrealistic. The character, who, ironically I liked the most, was Augusta Boyd. Augusta was portrayed as a spoiled princess, but I felt she was the most realistic character as she reflected many of the attitudes and prejudices of the time.<br />PEEVES: The \\"Good\\" characters were quite politically correct. Also parts of this novel did not ring true for the period. Examples: Once discovering Perrin's secret, the women of the camp (and men) would shun her.  I also could've done without the `obsessed stalker' character (how realistic is it that this person would be able to sneak around unseen amongst such a tight knit and close community and wreak havoc? (Besides I felt this subplot was unnecessary and cluttered an already action-packed plot). And last, despite myself, I wished for a happy ending for Augusta, who grew a lot, and deserved more than the author wrote for her.<br />Overall, a great read. Sure to please the most discerning historical fan, but a little light on romance.	2004-04-23

(If there is such a thing), when a mystic prophecy causes her to awaken in the future, she falls in love with the owner of her castle even though she believes him to be the man who killed her brother.  Baird Beauforte (terribly name), is opening a hotel bed and breakfast, and during renovations stumbles across Aurelia's crypt. When he wakens her with a kiss, she becomes his guest at the castle.<br />Despite myself, I liked this book, at least the first part. Aurelia was an endearing character despite the phoney new-age mystic fluff added to pad the plot. I particularly enjoyed her 'exploration' of the outside world, and the character of Julian.<br />Things I didn't like? Aurelia's age isn't mentioned anywhere in the plot. I have difficulty getting into romances if I don't know the basics of the main characters. Also, I liked the character of Marissa. I wished she and Aurelia could have been friends rather than fighting over Baird. Number 1 peeve: Baird! This character had zero personality, and the romance between him and Aurelia was unbelievable. Aurelia was too immature and naive for me to consider the romance with a modern man credible (or satisfying). Finally: Julian. The romance between him and Marissa seemed an afterthought. The author would've given SOME indication these characters were attracted to each other early on.<br />Started off 4 stars, but ended up being merely an average novel with some good points.	2004-04-23

LOL. still if you are a teen in need of guidance you might enjoy this book.<br />Peeves? Like most of the books in this series it deals with drug abuse, alcoholism, and how to seek treatment.

Instead of directing &quot;Bailey&quot; to the nearest medical clinic, he takes the case, determined to help her discover herself. (Rolls eyes).<br />I like Nora Roberts, and think she's an excellent writer, I just didn't care for the silly amnesia subplot. It just seemed a little...Icky. (Romance with someone who doesn't know who she is, seems distasteful somehow), Coupled with that, I found it unethical of Cade to become involved with a client.<br />Overall, I've read better Roberts books.

I'm a fan of Bronwyn Williams, and Slow Surrender starts off well. MacRorah (yes, that's her real name), is a suffragette. When her mother dies of a heart attack, and leaves her woman's shelter in MacRorah's hands, MacRorah vows to never marry.<br />Enter the hero: Courtland Adams thinks MacRorah is a hooker, and is attracted to her from the start despite the fact that she is too young for him...Will MacRorah overcome her aversion to marriage to find true love?<br />I started off really liking Slow Surrender. I loved MacRorah's mother and the work she did at the home for 'retired prostitutes and seamen' but the heroine MacRorah was blisteringly naive (especially given her 'liberated woman status'), and difficult to like.<br />I can't really recommend this book. Although it starts off well, about the time MacRorah decides to go into a popular bar to get herself a man, who will keep her as his 'mistress' I found myself not caring what happened to the silly creature.<br />Two stars for a great premise, and promising start. Unfortunately, for this reader, it fails to deliver the goods.	2004-04-19

Thus begins an Odyssey which takes Shea and the faithful Flick half way across the world to recover a mysterious sword which is to be their salvation.<br />I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book, and all I can say is WOW! The narrator does a masterful job of giving voice to valiant Shea, the mistrustful Flick, and the highlander prince of Leah.<br />The story was as great as I remembered when I read it as a teen. Sure, this work is somewhat derivative of Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I actually preferred Sword of Shannara. (Perhaps it is the lack of hobbits! LOL) My favorite characters were Dale, Duran, Shea and Flick. I also liked how the world Brooks creates is a post apocalyptic earth, and how the races are descended from mutated humans. Also, I think the depth of love and concern shown by the characters for their siblings was heart warming.<br />Peeves? I'm disappointed the distributer has not released the sequels to this novel in unabridged format, the abridged versions aren't worth the effort.	2004-04-19

When Casey's beautiful sister Laura is the victim of a stalker, Casey becomes desperate and appeals to the \\"Guardian\\" (Marcus's crime fighting alter-ego) for help. Can Marcus apprehend the bad guy in time?<br />Okay, first off, I loved the character of Marcus. He was cute, funny, and responsible. But the heroine Casey Jones was just irritating. And lets not forget her limp dishrag sister Laura. These two made \\"Mysterious Texas Brand Man\\" a real drag. (Why oh Why did Laura refuse to confide in her sister? This was just silly! And what happened to them going to the police? Dumb, dumb, dumb!)<br />While I enjoyed the idea of a crime-fighting vigilante as a hero, the author didn't fully explore this idea. Instead this subplot is tossed aside in favor of a stalker/revenge filled hero, and a sappy plain vanilla happy ending.<br />Overall, merely an average read. I've definitely read worse....But expect more from the author. Oh...And why the original guardian didn't invest in a bullet proof vest, I still don't know!	2004-04-18

I often refer to &quot;Police Procedural&quot; during writing involving police office/law enforcement characters.  I think the writing is comprehensive and covers many elements you will need  to write a convincing police character. <br />My only disappointment with this writing reference, is that there is not enough material discussing popular mistakes in fiction made by authors of police procedurals, (such as the police/witness romance), and there is not enough information about initial police training, codes of conduct, or disciplinary action taken towards police officers. (As happens in nearly every police film). What mistakes warrant suspension? What mistakes warrant getting canned? Who decides on what?<br />If there is a re-issue of this material, I'd really like to see: discussion of Internal Affairs, in depth discussion of police vehicles, police conduct, and writer's do's and 'don'ts. Overall Great basic reference, but needs more detail for a 5 star book.	2004-04-16

This  is the first in a new series of books featuring 4 young 20-something men who fight crime in an ancient pseudo-China. The art, for the most part is beautiful, but at times inconsistent. (I'm not a big fan of 'chibi' super-deformed art, and at times the illustrator relies on this in several panels). (I find this art style distracting and ugly).<br />Well, back to the story... There isn't much of one. We are introduced to the four main characters, told a bit of background, and a bit about their fighting styles. Various villains show up and are defeated  by our heroic team.<br />I have to say, I found this book a bit of a disappointment. The writers try to put way too much backstory in the first volume, that it reads like a character biography rather than a story. Also, I found some of the backstories simplistic (the character who drinks all the time, never gets drunk, and  yet whose dad is an alcoholic...)...Er....Right.<br />Finally. The format. The new format half-size comics are just too small. And the art when shrunk down to this size makes the art run together and less appealing. Why Comics One? Why did you do this?<br />Overall, an average book. I would've rated it higher if there had been a more involved plot and if the format wasn't so tiny.	2004-04-16

This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of Fairies from European and Celtic culture. I picked up a copy at the library and found it quite entertaining. I though the text interesting and the pictures and illustrations are well done. While this book isn't particularly large (only 155 pages), its reasonably comprehensive, and accessible to adults and children alike.<br />In particular, I liked the illustration of the Blue Men and the Doonie.

While the beginning starts off great with an amusing introduction to the &quot;Duke of Death,&quot; the story falters about the time the two main characters reached the castle home of the hero.<br />At that point, the whole book began to sag at the seams, and started becoming quite Politically Correct. Hero...A duke mind you...Treats servants like equals and labors in the dirt like a construction worker. The maid hired to see to the heroine's needs, lectures her, and the heroine takes it... Ummm...Right.... Hero tells servants it okay to wander around the castle in casual dress.... Mmmmm.<br />I found myself skimming the love scenes, to find out what happened in the main plot because I didn't feel the two main characters had any chemistry whatsoever.<br />Worth reading for the first half, but I grew tired of the bickering and the modern values in historic characters.	2004-04-10

When Hero's mother marries a man who gambles away the family fortune, Hero makes a desperate bid for freedom by fleeing to the Scottish Highlands and the home of her Aunt Elspeth. When her Scottish guide abandons her on the road, she is taken in by wanted criminal Ciaran MacLoarn, and his sidekick Finlay.<br />I wanted to like Highland Jewel, but I felt the plot was unoriginal and the story seemed uneven. At points it seemed that it was a comedy. At other points it aspired to be a serious historical. It turned out to be a rather goofy blend of both. While I liked the character of Ciaran, I found Hero to be unbelievable. She was alternatively blissfully naive, and other times she is portrayed as being street savvy. Which is it?<br />I DID like Ciarin as a character. He was well written, but I felt the other characters were too...Hmmm....Unrealistic.<br />About the time dear Aunt Elspeth was justifying the mother's abandonment of Hero, as saying her mother thought Hero could fend for herself, destitute on the streets of London -grr- I was ready to throw this book across the room. Hero's mother was cruel to abandon Hero. Aunt Elspeth's justification was supposed to seem wise and 'all knowing' struck me as contrived. Also, I hated how all of the MacLoarn women who were forced to marry against their will, refused to leave their husbands. It just seemed so trite and convenient and made the whole MacLoarn vs. MacDubhair conflict seem silly rather than serious.<br />While this novel starts off with a bang, it quickly became light stereotypical romantic fluff. I've read better, and certainly Wilhelm has written it.	2004-04-08

Okay, I bought this book, thinking it might make an interesting writing resource. Plus, I enjoy reading good pickup lines...They are usually good for a laugh if anything. But this book was not quite as funny as the author and title suggests. Also the book is printed with 3-4 LARGE pickup lines per page. (To make it worth the price, they should have at least included much more...Ahem...Material).

I have to say I enjoyed &quot;By the Light of the Moon.&quot; I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator did a STUPENDOUS job narrating Dylan, Shep and Jilly. The plot? Dylan is staying at a hotel when a wacky and deranged doctor injects Dylan with a mysterious liquid he calls only 'stuff.' The stuff, he says has the ability to change a person into something better...Or destroy him. When Dylan manages to escape the doctor, he is joined by another hotel guest who has also been injected. Together they flee mysterious generic bad guys across the country.<br />I liked this Koontz novel mostly because it had more of a science fiction flair and less of a horror flavor which I rather liked. Also, there were no dogs, and better still, no body-part collecting serial killers. Thank you, Mr. Koontz! I like variety, and this book was both appealing because of its lack of gratuitous gore, and thought provoking, because of the message. The only thing I didn't like? What happened to the doctor at the end....And...Also...At times Shep's repetitiveness got old. Especially in the narrated version, when you couldn't easily skip the words...I think Shep must've said &quot;Ice and Cake&quot; at least two-hundred times.... 5 Star effort. Only surpassed by Fear Nothing.	2004-04-04

But I purchased the audio version of Stranger in a Strange land and found it to be tedious in the extreme. Endless preaching about the glories of \\"Foster,\\" free-love and sex with many, many, available, willing young women (its amazing how these nubile women seem to fall all over the male characters. And the women are all completely unjealous of each other. Where are the harems of men for the female characters?) This novel read like a Gor book. Where is the action? And I don't mean that sort!<br />I also really hated the narration and the monotonous voice the narrator used for Michael Smith. He sounded like a little boy.<br />Overall, some of his other sci-fi is better than this. This book was nothing more than a soapbox for Heinlein to preach his personal life philosophy. I might be able to overlook this, if there was an actual plot as well. Unfortunately, no such luck. Ech.	2004-04-01

Have you ever read a book that you felt started off somewhat decently but ended up having so many unlikable characters that you just wanted to throw it across the room? Well, that's how I felt about Susan Squires' novel Sacrament. The story starts off with our plain Jane heroine Sarah, traveling to London to solve a land dispute. There she meets up with her immoral friend Corina, whose past-times include rape, torture and S&M. Not exactly my cup of tea. The worst part is Sarah has SOME idea of Corina's past times and she ignores it. Not exactly heroine material in my book.<br />Enter the vampire Davinoff. Davinoff is tall dark and dull. He wanders around uttering cryptic comments, and for some reason Sarah's friend Corina becomes obsessed with him. What follows is an endless series of jaunts across the country in a carriage as Corina chases after Davinoff and drags protesting limp Sarah along. Yawn.<br />I just simply did NOT care about the characters and was alternately annoyed and repelled by them. Sarah is spineless, plain and boring, Corina a psychopath and Davinoff seemed more like a caricature. I know he's a vampire, but he had the warmth of cold pudding.<br />This novel became a wallbanger during a very disturbing flashback scene about halfway through. Yech.  If the author spent as much time developing the relationship between the two main characters, as she spent in establishing the fact that the character Corina is eeeevillll, this novel might actually have been halfway decent.	2004-04-01

I must say...The beginning was excellent. (Especially the interaction with the homeless man). But as I listened to it more and more, I began to become annoyed with the protagonist Spencer Grant. This is not the first time a Koontz novel failed for me because of the whiney and spineless male protagonist.. But...Spence whines more than the writings in even the staunchest pre-teen diary! Spence is supposed to be a tough guy police officer and an ex-army ranger, and yet in typical Koontz fashion he 'hates' guns' and would prefer to wallow in self-pity about his sad sad childhood than to be a man, deal with his problems and GET OVER IT.<br />Second, I found his motivation for going after Ellie at the beginning to be weak and borderline stalker behavior. I found Ellie's reaction to Spence to be quite unrealistic. If I found a man following me because of a chance interaction in a bar...Especially a man with Spence's past, I'd give him the boot! Sorry. The 'romance' seemed contrived and forced.<br />The villain: Roy Miro is extraordinarily good. I wish they'd just stuck with him being an 'extraordinarily nice killer' rather than make him yet another psychopathic serial killer. That does get old. The whole 'hand in the Tupperware' was nasty and gross. Other minor characters such as: the police chief were handled quite well. The dog &quot;Rocky&quot; was an annoyance. I usually like Koontz's dogs, but this dog seems very superfluous and as spineless as his owner. Erk. I give this novel three stars. It was average Koontz. Nothing extraordinary.	2004-04-01

Little does she realize that Tynan is not the elderly man she once imagined, but a handsome hunk, whose only experience of women is what he has seen in videos and books!<br />I really enjoyed Rapture's Mist. I especially liked the heroine Amara who is a kick butt career-minded lady who'll let nothing get in the way of achieving her goals- including Tynan. Though at times, I found Tynan to be a bit petulant, he was at heart quite generous and loving. This was a great story, and a keeper for those who like futuristic and enjoy experienced kick-butt heroines.	2004-03-29

Magiere and her half-elf sidekick, Leesil are con artists, fleecing superstitious peasants out of their money by pretending to be vampire hunters. Magiere, however, has begun to grow tired of the scam and has decided to buy an inn and retire. When the companions run into a true vampire, the proverbial excrement hits the fan, and Magiere must decide whether she wants to run or stay in her new home and fight.<br />I really liked the characters of Magiere and Leesil. Magiere is tough without being overbearing. Leesil is just plain /fun/ (although if I were Magiere I would hide his wine skin).  I also really enjoyed the 'evil' vampires, Rashed, Teesha, and yes even Rat Boy. Even though they were killers, they had great personalities, and I enjoyed the romance between Rashed and Teesha.<br />Minor peeves: I did think Magiere and Leesil were great characters but for two adults they didn't seem to be fully developed emotionally. These characters need a little more romance and social contact to be believeable. I also found it hard to believe such two physically attractive people would be wandering around the countryside not attracting admirers. Part of me is refreshed by the fact that Magiere and Leesil aren't a couple. But, then the other part  of me thinks, the idea should have least been mentioned as an issue/non issue.<br />Anyway, peeves aside. This is a great book. Well worth the time to hunt yourself a copy.	2004-03-27

I must say however, Ms. Sands' writing is the bomb. She manages to make the heroine: Jane Spyrus and her boyfriend Able to be quite endearing.<br />Here's the scoop: Jane is a gadget techie working for super-secret spy organization called: &quot;BLISS,&quot; when her best friend Edie is captured Jane and Edie's brother Abel go after the missing girl with funny (and humorous) results.<br />I enjoyed the Loving Daylights. Mostly because I think Lynsay Sands has a gift for good characters, interesting situations, and well written dialogue. I also like the male characters. She doesn't write your typical &quot;Alpha boor&quot; males which (as the name implies)bore me to tears. Instead her men are well-balanced, thoughtful and most of all normal. I also enjoyed Jane's &quot;Inventions&quot; especially the missile launcher and the amazing shrinking condom. LOL. And lets not forget her sidekick &quot;Tinkle&quot; the dog. Too funny.<br />Sands' writing was fun, fast-paced, and had impressive Dialogue. I hope for a sequel with Dirk- or maybe even a serious romance/spy story. Ms. Sands certainly has the talent for it. 5 Stars for a fun, amusing read.	2004-03-19

Having seen these meaty fantasy novels at the store I've bought several of them, hoping for a good lengthy fantasy jaunt. Well, I must admit I was disappointed. Haydon's writing style is dry and unappealing. Her characters lack empathy and I found many characters indistinguishable from one another. Also, the dozens of minor characters didn't sem fully fleshed, and could've easily been left out.<br />Further, the plot meanders around without much hope of finding conclusion and the fantasy world described just didn't seem fully realized. I never got the sense or understanding of Rhapsody's world, or a full understanding of the characters. The author failed to emotionally `hook' me with any of the leads and Rhapsody herself seemed flat D&amp;D character knockoff. \\"Lets roll up a bodacious elf- ex-hooker bard\\" and throw in an assassin and a half-orc and call it a novel.\\"<br />Bleh.<br />Worse, I hated the phony `cockney' accent of Grunthor. His dialogue just seemed silly. Every time he opened his mouth to say something I felt like rolling my eyes. The villain Michael (gotta love that original name), was the \\"I'm so eeeevillll&quot; variety and seems to have graduated from sadism 101.<br />This book might be better with some tighter editing, and a more succinct plotline. Unfortunately, I couldn't muster much interest in doing more than skimming this book.	2004-03-18

The hero \\"Mick\\" started of quite amusing, but I quickly grew bored with the way the author chose to portray his speech patterns (yes I know this was a major plot point, but I still found it grating). The Cornish-Cockney \\"Ye'll be excusing me duck\\" and  \\"Idden me choice to stand `ere with me shirt done up...\\" soon had me roll my eyes in frustration. Plus the first few chapters are filled with almost incomprehensible paragraphs of unattrributed dialogue wherein a mob of characters voice their opinions for pages which grew annoying. Eh.<br />Further, the proposition's attempts at humor fell flat for me. I found nothing `charming' or `cute' about Mick bargaining with the heroine to look at  or touch her legs in exchange for him shaving his mustache. I dunno...It just struck me as silly and vaguely perverted. I still like class in my heroes even if they are supposed to be poor and uneducated.<br />I won't even go there about the amazingly trite ending. This light-hearted novel just fell flat for me. I prefer my historicals  more realistic and with tighter more succinct dialogue.	2004-03-18

I love `post apocalyptical' novels, so when the Library had this book for sale, I eagerly snapped it up. Well...I have to say the first chapter ruined it for me. Number one, I'm not a big fan of novels written in the first person, but this book has a chapter at the beginning, which is written from one of the main characters POV that spoils major, plot points. This is a pet peeve of mine when reading fiction, and it seems to be a trend when writing from first person. I prefer not to read what's going to happen before it does...Ugg.<br />But I persevered, and read more of the book. I found the writing style of this book to be quite dry and stilted. Chapters read like entries into a diary, and characters speak quite unnaturally. There is one paragraph where a main male character speaks in a single huge paragraph without pause! Ech. Every character has a biblical name and the writing style seems stiff and boring to me.<br />I guess \\"A gift upon the Shore\\" is just not my bag. The narrative style was too dry and unappealing and the author tells us whats going on most of the time rather than showing us. I guess I'll just have to give this book a pass.	2004-03-18

The rest of it is divided between Psychological studies of serial killers and the mentally ill. The other third seems to be other shapeshifting creatures which is interesting, but could've been put in another volume.<br />Still, this book offers quite a bit of interesting tidbits for werewolf enthusiasts, and I recommend it for those interested in the lore of the loup garou.<br />One star has been deducted for the sections focusing on modern serial killers and sections on demonology which seem to be filler more than substance.	2004-03-17

Little did I realize this was /not/ a stand alone book. After the first promising chapter staring a 30 yr old virgin (hmmmm), we progressed on to the SF portion of the book with the hero named Dalden.<br />Soon, I was overwhelmed with sci-fi jargon and long interludes featuring characters from other books. This would be fine if kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Since I have never read the other books I have no clue who Challen or his lifemate are...And didn't particularly care, I quickly lost interest. This seemed more like a 'reunion' book than a romance.<br />Perhaps this book might be good for those who've read the others in the series and want to find out what 'happened' to the other characters. For someone new to the series, I just couldn't grasp it, and this quickly became a wall-banger.	2004-03-16

This has been done to death in historical romance, and is an instant 'hook' writers use to make the heroine sympathetic. Wild is no exception. I liked the idea that the heroine was a recluse.

This book is quite awful.<br />&quot;Why you might ask?&quot; Well, Virginia, this book's format is really unhelpful and tries so hard to be cute it might as well be hanging  in a Christmas stocking and tied up with a bow.<br />Each chapter in 'Dialogue' is meant to discuss a different technique for writing dialogue. But the author tries too hard to be cute with an on-going discussion between himself and a fictional persona that the real purpose: illustrating the different dialogue types is obscured. Also, the 'fictional banter' is cute at first but quickly becomes more torturous than nails on a chalkboard.<br />This book fails for me as a writing reference because its neither quick nor either to use. Perhaps if they re-issue this book, the illustrations of each method could be done in a more structured and less obscure way.<br />I give this two stars for its torturous uncomfortable prose....Experienced writiers may be able to glean some tidbits from the long-winded narration.	2004-02-25

His unique talents have helped him get to the bottom of several grizzly murders and strange occurrences in a small town in Southern California. But is it enough to stop a serial killer who draws his powers from the occult?<br />I was prepared to really like Odd Thomas. After all, I like Koontz writing. But Thomas seemed to be a rather flat character, and worse, a Christopher Snow knockoff. Lessee: Christopher has the `drop dead stunningly gorgeous super-unrealistic girlfriend' so does Thomas. Christopher has `cop buddy', so does Thomas. Christopher has an `eccentric animal loving friend'...So does Thomas.... Err...<br />Overall, I thought the plot was rather stereotyped. The villains were the cookie cutter: &quot;I'm so eeeeeevil variety,&quot;  and the character of Thomas while meant to seem young and inexperienced instead suffered from `superman' syndrome. (He can out-sleuth, out-skulldugger, even the smartest professionals in the book), &lt;Yawn&gt;.<br />Overall, while I enjoyed Odd Thomas a lot of it seemed to be rehashed from earlier works... This was solid work...But it din't move me like other works have.	2004-02-05

I picked up &quot;Seize the Night&quot; eagerly after listening to the unabridged audio version of Fear Nothing, and while I liked this new installment(the continuing adventures of Chris, Bobby and Sasha), I ended up getting annoyed with the whole &quot;Mystery Train&quot; sub plot. Personally, I LOVED the first novel with the threat of 'becoming' (isn't that a cool enough idea, do we REALLY need the whole serial-killer-meets-stargate subplot?)<br />I found the lack of reliance on the original material (i.e. the mutant animals/people) a trifle irritating. Plus Chris's girlfriend Sasha got on my nerves. There is a point when a character can become too perfect, and Sasha is just unbelievable. Koontz writes good men, but his female characters need some serious help. Less Sasha is more in my opinion.<br />I of course love Bobby to death, but the cat and the cat-man simply must go. Too many minor characters, no Orson, and too much mysticism for my tastes. I hope the sequel will be better.	2004-01-21

I'm an intermediate quilter who has been struggling to make larger bed-sized quilts for over a year. This book makes it SO much easier to quilt large sized projects! I highly recommend this book! In particular, the method  described for the &quot;Vanilla Ice Cream&quot; quilt is a method I intend to use over and over!<br />I had two peeves with this book which are minor, but worth mentioning. One: the format. Quilt instructions and photos are spread throughout willy-nilly.  I HATE books where I must page through text to find the picture and back again to the instructions. I much prefer the photos of the finished result to be near the instructions. Second,  the quilts aren't photographed well so that you can see the final result. In particular, the vanilla ice cream quilt is photographed draped over a chair, and it is very difficult to see the end result. I prefer quilting instruction books to have photos so that the finished quilt is clearly visible<br />Overall, however, this book is worth ten other books on machine quilting which tell you how 'easy' it is to run a queen-sized quilt sandwich through your sewing machine! The instuctions on how to back your quilt are worth the cost of the book alone!	2004-01-20

Well, you can imagine my disappointment, when, instead of a military-themed story set in space, we get a 'murder mystery' and a 'Christ-like' Ender Wiggin out to redeem everyone whether they like it or not. Ech.<br />The plot centers around the mysterious Piggies, and their strange habit of murdering people in a really gruesome manner.  (I can't imagine how any true anthropologist could find this mystery all that surprising). Ender is called to witness the death of one of the science team, and finds himself embroiled in an almost ridiculously complicated melodrama involving a scientist, her deceased abusive hubbie and her bastard children.<br />While I did enjoy Speaker of the dead, the psychobabble, self-loathing (on most most noticeably Ender and Noviniah), got tiresome. I also disliked that Ender Wiggin's transformed (in between books) into the Doctor Laura of the star waves. This was seriously annoying. Wiggin, the master of 'tough love' decides what's best for everyone, whether they like it or not.<br />Erk. What if Ender is wrong? But of course he NEVER is.<br />A good book, despite the flaws, I've mentioned. However, I personally could have done without the psychobabble and soapboxing.	2004-01-08

Christopher Snow, has a rare skin condition (XP), which makes him extremely sensitive to light. Because of this condition, Chris is isolated from his community. After  Chris' father dies, Chris' visit to the local hospital reveals some unsavory things about his town and leaves Chris wondering just what REALLY happened to his father.<br />Partnered with his dog Orson, Chris and his four-legged companion struggle to understand the implications of a series of strange deaths and murders. Along the way, they gather some allies, and are thwarted by humans and a pack of evil super-smart monkeys.<br />I really enjoyed the scenes with the evil monkeys, and Chris's surfer friend who was funny. I thought the relationship between Chris and his girlfriend was a little unbelievable.  Please. Just HOW did Chris meet this woman?  On the negative side, I could have done without one scene where an evil character was ranting about how he wanted to sexually abuse women and children. I thought this was unnecessarily graphic and quite excessive.<br />Overall though, I found this to be a great book!  Great characters, and wonderful narration by Keith Szarabajka. An easy five stars.	2004-01-05

Atlas of Magical Britain is a fascinating book, which explores in depth the origins and myths surrounding various locations in Britain. The authors divide the atlas into sections such as: \\"Cornwall and Devon,\\" or \\"South Wales,\\" and then discusses the sites of supernatural importance in each section.<br />I was fascinated to learn of the re-occurring theme in British folklore of the large 'black dog,\\" which seems to haunt every county in England! I also enjoyed the fact that this atlas explores both secular and religious myths. It has a little for everyone! Each site is discussed including the modern and (usually) Judeo-Christian myth, what the researcher has been able to dig up, as well as the possible pagan or prehistoric origin. (For instance monoliths inscribed with Christian symbols which may be in fact stone age temples or burial grounds). Also, I found it helpful that under each heading was a brief summary such as: Petrification legend, Ancient custom, Giant, etc. This made it easy to see what each section was going to be about.<br />Highly recommend to those visitors intending to travel to Britain, or those who are interested in folklore. A five star book!	2003-12-19

Storm Rider's volume 12 is the ongoing saga of Bu-Jing-Yun (Cloud), his adopted brother Wind (Nie-Fong), and their struggles against their evil stepfather Lord Conquer.<br />In this issue Jien Chen and Luo Bu-Jing-Yun go to Sword Worship villa to find ultimate sword. Their quest is thwarted by Sword Greedy, Sword Demon and Lady Au. They duel together in a strange and mystical edifice called 'sword pond,' will Cloud survive the encounter?<br />This installment of Storm Riders was not as good as previous volumes, primarily because Nie-Fong was absent most of the time and a new character: Jien-Chen was focused on. As someone who is a fan of the original cast (Wind, Cloud and Frost), I found this somewhat disappointing. Nie-Fong is my favorite character!<br />Even though the plot was a little thin in this issue,  Wing Shing Ma's art is beautiful and fun too look and reading issue 12 is important to understand the events in 13.	2003-12-18

The little house cookbook is a collection of foods and recipes mentioned in Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House novel series. This book is chock full of fantastic recipes, anecdotes, and stories. The author translates the recipes for modern cooks, and includes historical background and information on each recipe's origins.<br />This book will be great for young readers, or for readers interested in learning more about the time period and the foods that Laura Ingalls enjoyed.

One: there was a distinct lack of plot, and two: very little actually happened. Sure, we got a peek into the perfect world of Damia and her Children, but the plot seemed to meander...And the hive 'menace' was not really much of a menace at all.<br />Pet peeves: Personally, I found the parents (and grandparents) meddling and matchmaking to be annoying. I also thought the gifts of the t-1's and how they manipulated the emotions of the lesser talented to be manipulative, and downright scary. Who says the t-1's have a right to mess with people's emotions? It was quite intrusive of Zara, to mess with the mind of Kincaid while he was sleeping, even if her intentions were good. Such powers can quickly become abusive and Damia's children seem to have no boundaries, despite their motivations.<br />Also, I liked the character of Kincaid, but nothing was really resolved with him. We never really found out the details about what happened to him on the deep space mission, and the character seems to be dropped halfway through the book. Other romances seemed flat to me.  Roger's romance with his cousin Asia was tepid. Asia was just too timid, and Roger too self confidant. Plus there was the cousin thing...Errr, sorry, Anne, that didn't work for me.<br />Overall, despite these peeves, I liked Lyon's pride. It just didn't go anywhere;  and the assumptions and liberties the 'talented' made towards those with lesser gifts were supercilious and grating.	2003-12-03

This book really put a human face on the soldiers of Germany who weren't always Nazi sympathizers. I felt the author presented quite a balanced view of both the anti-Nazi prisoners and the pro-Nazi officers and enlisted men.<br />Of particular interest was the discussion of how the camps were run, the photographs of the prisoners and the stories of their escapes. Also, some stories were quite humorous: the story where the Americans tell the Germans to clean their barracks/common rooms and the German POWS refuse. The Americans perform a trick by telling them a high-ranking German officer would be imprisoned there to get them to comply without the use of force. This was quite clever.On the flip-side I found it disturbing that the American army officials preferred to supervise hard-core nazis in prisons because they were easier to manage, rather than anti-nazis. At times these officials encouraged nazism!<br />I recommend this book for a different and balanced look into the past.	2003-12-03

As any historian will tell you, there are many sides to an historic event and the story is told from the viewpoint of the victors. Wright attempts to illustrate unknown facts, and clarify popular misconceptions about historical events in &quot;What They Didn't Teach You about the Wild West.&quot; While I enjoyed Wright's interpretation of history, I found the format to be at times confusing. Facts were jumbled together in large chapters without subheadings which made browsing confusing. Perhaps this book would be better if arranged in chronological order? This complaint was small, however in light of what &quot;What they-&quot; has to offer.<br />The parts I particularly enjoyed were the colonization facts, information about early prostitution and early American 'attitudes' towards women, other races and cultures. Perhaps if there is a reprint, there should be a chapter about gender roles included?<br />Definitely interesting enough to pick up for scholars and writers of western fiction. A good solid work.	2003-12-02

A cute, sleepy private eye story told form the perspective of Precious Ramotswe, and narrated well by Lisette Lecat. In this episode, we find Precious investigating two cases: that of a philandering husband, and that of an older man who once committed a crime and wishes to make amends.<br />What's good about this series is not the mystery. It's the characters and settings. I really got the flavor that I was in a small town in Botswana, and I enjoyed reading about Precious and her cohorts. If I have any criticism about this novel at all, there was a lack of suspense. The investigation was almost a non-event, and there was a bit too much dwelling in the past for my taste. Part of me wanted to tell the client: GET OVER IT ALREADY. The past is over and done with.<br />Still, a cute story, sure to delight readers who want a slice of African life without too much gritty realism.	2003-12-01

That's how I felt about Mistress of Dragons.<br />The plot was a sort of hackneyed: wonder-woman-meets-sleeping beauty, complete with lesbian amazons, a clueless prince, and an all-knowing dragon. The baddy is of the `I'm so eeevil variety.' My main problem with this book is it felt like a prequel, and the characters were not very likeable. The author writes the story with several well-developed relationships already in place. Yawn. I scarcely cared weather Melisande would be true to Belona, or whether the king would prove adulterous. There was not an iota of romantic suspense, (Which I sort of dig in these type of novels), and the ending was depressing and screams: Read the sequel!<br />Overall, I think this novel would work more for me, if the relationships between the main characters were new and we could experience them unfold with the characters, rather than so deeply entrenched.  To surmount this, the author tries to tease us with a potential relationship between two main characters but this was so forced the outcome was easily predictable from the start. Feh.<br />This book left me feeling dismayed rather than entertained. Perhaps the sequel will be better...But, I'll wait until paperback.	2003-12-01

I listened to the Audio version of Damia's children, and found that it was quite well-narrated. And while I liked this book, I would prefer a book which focused on a single character rather than a novel split into three parts. By rights this should be three books.<br />The plot is simple: with a threat of the HIVE upon them, the telepathic 'talented' Lyon children must help their parents defend earth from....The predations of a vicious insect species, but are they so vicious? Only the Lyon children seem capable of figuring this out.<br />I think that the author may fall into a bit of a rut with this series. The Lyon children are 'super' kids, squeaky clean, friendly and well-adjusted. While I understand that they have lots of responsibility, these children are too perfect. They are more competant, more intelligent, and more powerful than anyone else. &lt;Sighs>. No WONDER some Terran's resent them.<br />Two things that skeeved ne out about this book: Number One:  How easily these 'children' are manipulated by the adults. I would hope that in the future they have some form of child labor laws Number Two: The second story about Theon, where he has a relationship with a much older army nurse. Ick. this completely skeeved me out. I guess its just my western mind, but a relationship between a teenager and a much older woman and this person a nurse in a position of authority is pretty gross. No thanks! Ick. Ick. Double Ick!<br />Overall, the second story cost this book two stars. Not as good as some of her earlier works.	2003-11-20

Good, but Stereotypical Plot and Characters	I listened to the Unabridged Audio version of Timeline, and found it to be an okay read. While the initial premise was indeed fascinating, I became tired of the `super-powered' characters, which seemed unbelievable to me. IE: Super-smart, super-intelligent, and 'smarter than the experts' college students. (Anyone who attends a modern-day college , would know the chances of finding college students who a: get good grades and b: can outjoust and out fight medieval French knights are slim to none). Also, while the characters are supposed to be young people, they were written like 40+ adults. Come on now. Do a little more research.<br />Other stereotypes abound. You have the `friendly knowledgeable professor,' (\\"Sliders\\" anyone?), the damsel-in-distress-who-disguises-herself as a boy, (any number of bodice rippers have this plot, AND do it better), the evil-overbearing guardian (straight out of Robin Hood), Ho hum.<br />While the plot was nothing particularly new, Timeline entertained me for the duration. I just wish that new territory had been explored. Instead, you have a plot rehash of any number of historical novels, rolled into a single novel. Fun, but hardly innovative. Also, for some reason the Narrator decided to read Andre's voice with an Austrian accent, which made him sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Very distracting!	2003-11-18

She's also a bio-engineered `enhanced' human, who kills indiscriminately, fights like batman, and has a libido Captain Kirk would be proud of. At first, I had difficulty getting into this audio book. Mostly because the male narrator's voice (what were they thinking? Could it really be that tough to hire a FEMALE narrator?) Was about as emotionless as a computer. Also, I was put off by Friday's character. She... Seems to be a sexual fantasy rather than a person.<br />After I overcome my aversion to Friday's personality, I found myself strangely compelled by Friday's world. While this novel is by NO means Heinlein's best, I was hooked anyway. Friday is a sympathetic character. I loved her relationship with boss, her friends, and comrades in arms. My only disappointment in this book, was I felt that Friday's love interest Percival was not very well developed. I also felt, that Friday failed to grow as a character and there were parts where Friday seemed to wander from relationship to relationship without much point. (I would've much preferred Friday have a few successful relationships rather than the DOZENS, which seemed to be portrayed).<br />Overall, I enjoyed this novel. Friday was a compelling character whose life and story was well worth listening too. Especially after the first few chapters.  Word of caution, however: because of graphic violence, and rampant sexuality I would NOT recommend for sensitive or young readers.	2003-11-18

So, when they announced they would be producing a series of 'new format' cookbooks, you can only imagine how pleased I was.  Simple Joys is the second in this series. While I like the colorful pictures, the covers and the illustrations, I am probably the only one who doesn't care for the 'personal stories' on every other page.<br />Don't get me wrong,I'm sure the stories are quite touching for the individuals involved... But for me its just too much to have a personal story on EVERY other page. Besides, some of the stories are quite sad. These stories deal with friendships old and new...And...Well, I don't want to be depressed when I read a cookbook! Some of the stories are sad....Especially those where/friends have died.<br />While I like the recipes, and would love to see books produced with color illustrations, the personal stories are too mushy and maudlin for me.

I listened to the audio version of blessing in disguise (all 16 hours!), and found myself strangely compelled by the lives of Grace, Cordelia, Jack etc. The story is the tale of Grace Trescott, the daughter of renowned civil rights leader. She is writing a controversial novel about her father. She is also involved in an interfaith relationship with an older man with older children. As if this weren't problematic enough, Grace discovers the truth about her father and his relationship with his secretary and this strains the relationship between her and the rest of her family.<br />While I liked &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot; it was not without flaws. Number 1. I got really really tired of Jack, Grace's boyfriend. He was whiny, &quot;I'm too old for her.....&quot; Yep, agree with him there. He was also too immature, and too focused on his own children. I thought the age difference was icky and did not work for me. The problems with an interfaith marriage weren't even touched upon. Overall, I was really sick of Jack by the end. Grace was better off with the veterinarian.<br />2. Ben. Hated the character. He is an abusive user and gets away with it. I don't buy the 'therapy cure-all' excuse at the end of the book. Ben needed more than just therapy, he needed to be locked up. His &quot;Feel sorry for me, I'm a poor little rich kid&quot; just wore thin... Get over yourself Ben!<br />3. Cordelia: liked her. Liked her relationship with her gardener boyfriend. But what is with Goudge and writing characters who are in relationships with much older people? Seriously, two romances in one book between two people with a large age difference began to skeeve me out...<br />4. Also, while I appreciated hearing about Hannah, Ben and the other minor characters, there was WAY too much time spent on the children. I would've preferred more character development between the main romantic couples and less time spent with the two teenage malcontents. (The scene where Chris ran away had me rolling my eyes in pain.<br />Overall, despite my criticism of this novel, I felt it was extremely well-written. Goudge made you feel for the characters, and is an extremely talented author, making even the most trite stereotypes seem fresh.

I listened to the audio version of this novel, but after a while, had to listen to this in seclusion! LOL, my father HATED the fact that the aliens were called 'Bugger,' and every time this was mentioned rather LOUDLY in the beginning by Peter, he'd strenuously object.<br />Other than the term 'bugger,' I thought this book was really fast paced, and exciting, if at times a little gruesome. Ender is an enjoyable character, 'caught up' by events beyond his control who you can really empathize with. The other characters are quite endearing: with two exceptions: I honestly wish Peter had been done away with. This character was irritating in the extreme... And Valentine? What's with Card making all his genius characters mentally ill? I wish she'd sought help for her pyromania. I won't even go there about Peter's psychotic tendencies.<br />Other than that, LOVED Card's work. Will definitely be looking up the next book in the series!	2003-10-21

When his best friend winds up dead because of mysterious photos discovered on an encrypted disc given to him by a client, Gideon finds himself sucked into a bizarre world of 'information sabotage,' ran by a reclusive genius Malcolm and his beautiful sister.<br />At first I found the beginning WAY too fantastic, especially the 'jailbreak' scene, but I quickly found myself sucked into Carr's world of information sabotage, and enjoyed this audio book immensely. I loved the character of Leon who kept saying EVERYTHING had &quot;Immense Sexuality.&quot; Too funny.<br />Things I didn't like: the author used &quot;Killing Time&quot; to soap-box a bit about social and moral issues. Messages such as: Internet = Evil and  'information is NOT knowledge' made me want to grind my teeth after the third or fourth time I heard it. Also the narration where the author gives us a 'forsight' into future story events was bothersome. The novel is littered with phrases like: &quot;If I had known then what I know now, I would never....&quot; I HATE it when authors tell us in advance something bad will happen. I like to find this out for myself, thank you.<br />Otherwise, loved this tape! Loved the character Leon and Malcolm, and really really hope there is a sequel featuring these characters.	2003-10-02

When the FTE turns up dead, Steph becomes the unwitting target of a serial killer. Can Steph survive, despite the fact that she's the most inept bounty hunter on the planet?<br />I'm a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series. What I like about this series is the character of Stephanie and her relationship to Morelli and Ranger. I'm also a big Ranger fan (sorry Joe), but part of me thinks this love triangle is getting stale. The triangle only really works, when there is some doubt about the outcome. Steph has been with Joe for several books now. Time to end the flirting, or move forward with the relationship. (Although I DO think that settling Steph with either guy will be the 'kiss of death' to this series).<br />The Good:<br />I love Lula. Its great to see more of her. AND I'm SO glad that Evanovich dropped the 'blown up car gag,' that was getting very old. The addition of the bodyguards was rather funny. Getting out of the &quot;Burg&quot; was good as well. I also loved seeing Ranger. Yum.<br />The Bad:<br />Grandma Bella. Who cares? The baby predictions got tiresome after a while. Second: Stephanie's ineptness. Just once, I'd like her to get a bit tougher. For goodness sake, this is book nine and she's still a complete wimp. I'm beginning to think Evanovich cannot write tough heroines. Why is it that only the men are competant and the women helpless ninnies? Please girl, time to choose another profession if you keep your gun in your cookie jar. Finally: I am a bit tired of serial killers. I hate to say it, but the last one was bad enough.  Lets have some sane villains please.<br />Overall, a fun, fast romp but nothing that we haven't seen before.	2003-09-30

You guessed it, photos of people with really, really bad haircuts!  I've kept this book at the office on my desk and its really an ice breaker. Plus, its great for boosting the ego, by perusing the photos of dated 'do's.' Some of the photos aren't even all that bad! LOL.

But I just can't abide poorly written first person narratives. (I'm not a big fan of First Person narratives to begin with), but poorly written ones are worse. Also, there is a large Dedication which takes up prime 'real estate' at the front of the book, followed by another narration about he main character 'looking back on her life.' For me, I just hate, hate, hate, knowing what will happen in advance. And this writing nearly ruined it for me.<br />As I progressed through the book, I found the dialog to be stilted and unrealistic, especially the internal dialog. This book was just NOT my cup of tea.	2003-09-22

When volunteer fireman Taylor saves Denise a struggling single mom from a terrible car accident, little does he realize the new direction his life will soon be taking. Over time, Taylor is comes to appreciate Denise appearence, and her parenting skills, and Denise is impressed with Taylor's loving nature. Can Denise and Taylor overcome their past differences to become a family together? I listened to the audio version of the rescue, and really thought Johnny Heller did an excellent job narrating this book. I especially liked the way he read Denise's character, I've noticed some narrators have difficulty reading characters of the opposite gender. Not so with Heller. Bravo. I also appreciated Spark's tackling a difficult topic: Language Impairment, and especially the fact that the main character was a woman. Excellent.<br />Now, for a few pet peeves:<br />1. Taylor: I grew quickly tired of Taylor's &quot;fear of commitment&quot; issues. This subplot had me rolling my eyes, and asking myself: Why,why, why - the author had to include this cliche character flaw? Taylor's reticence to emotionally commit to Denise cost this book a star because this is the most overused character flaw for male romantic leads in the romance industry. My advice. Use something else. Quickly.<br />2. Denise: The &quot;Saint Mommy&quot; attitude got a little tiring after a while. Does this super mom have any flaws? Also, while I really appreciate Denise's desire to 'go it alone,' without her baby's father's financial support,  I felt it was extremely unrealistic and selfish.  The financial support of the child's father could've benefited her son in many ways. Why do so many authors feel they have to 'show the heroine's independence' by scoffing at child support, or worse, in Denise's case, not even pursuing her child's father for it? Please!<br />While these peeves may seem small, I get a bit tired of reading the same thing over and over in romantic novels. Variety please! Overall, though, if you can ignore some of these cliche's (overused again and again in the industry), this was a satisfying book, sure to delight readers of romance and romantic fiction.ou can ignore some of these cliche's (overused again and again in the industry), this was a satisfying book, sure to delight readers of romance and romantic fiction.	2003-09-22

I was expecting a book about two sophisticated socialites, and what do I get? An episode of the Beverly Hillbillies... I really wish I had been able to read the first few pages of this book, but no dice. I purchased it sight unseen. Boy was I disappointed.<br />First, I just could not abide the dialog. The intro: letters written between the hero/heroine which were supposed to be cute, were just immature and childish. I have trouble imagining two adults would write like that. I just couldn't continue after that. This, book has gone directly into the 'resale' pile without a fight. Disappointing!	2003-09-22

Maudlin subplot	As someone who has enjoyed many of Nora Robert's works in the past, I found myself disappointed with the audio version of Birthright. I found the Narrator's voice to be extremely irritating and  just did NOT work work for this reader. The voice she uses for Callie, sounds like she smokes six packs a day, and the hero (especially Graystone), sounds like a hick with laryngitis. Awful.<br />The plotline, had potential, but it didn't live up to it.  I was quite interested in the archaeological dig, and the community of archaeological workers,  but this plotline got buried quickly  under the subplot over Callie's identity.  For me Callie's long-suffering mother reliving the pain of her baby's abduction over and over was quite maudlin, had me wanting to hit the fast forward button.  I know it is callous of me, but I simply DID NOT CARE about Callie's origins, or what had happened to Callie 30 years ago.  What I wanted to read was romance. NOW.<br /> Callie and Graystone's 'relationship' was  unsuspensful, unless you like 'bedhopping and 'big misunderstanding' subplots.  Graystone had potential, but the constant bickering between this couple left me cold.  (There is nothing sexy or attractive of listening to two people bicker and torture each other). I also felt, that Callie as a major character of supposed intelligence acted rather stupid half the time.  An example: Callie ran into the woods after a bad guy, armed with a can of 'bug spray' *groan*.<br />The other romantic character Lana, I actually liked.  She was oodles more mature than Callie, and handled her affairs in a professional way. Her love interest Doug, however had zero personality. This character could easily been left out. Perhaps this novel would've been more interesting if the romance had been between Lana and Graystone?<br />Overall, I guess I found this book a disappointment. It had potential, but got bogged down with mindless melodrama over Callie's origins, and a senseless secondary romance and endless, endless whining and hand-wringing.<br />Rating: Average, but poor narration loses it a star.s, endless whining and hand-wringing. <br />Rating: Average, but poor narration loses it a star.	2003-09-04

I had to force myself to listen to it all the way through. This is definitely the worst Mrs. P, book I've listened to.. Why? Too many irritating minor characters. Not enough suspense, and, unbelievably stupid villains. Usually I can expect a TAD more realism than this from a Gillman book, but, this book was just plain silly and tried too hard to be cute.<br />Yes, it starts out okay, with Mrs. P, getting involved in the rescue of an old friend, Farrell, who owns an art gallery. We are led to believe that Farrell is some sort of super-agent, and super handsome, but instead he's just super annoying. Mrs. P, teams up with a spunky blonde agent, soon find themselves embroiled in a mystery surrounding an ancient roman scroll, art theft, and murder. Can Mrs. P and her gang of friends save the day?<br />By the end of this novel, I just didn't care. Farrell, was the world's most irritating character.All he does is whine and complain. The spunky blonde agent who was Mrs. P's sidekick would never pass any Intelligence Agency's background check with a family like hers... And Aristotle? This villain was silly, *choke* get real.<br />Overall, I'd give this one a pass. I've listened to much better Gillman books, and this one was beyond disappointing.	2003-09-01

In this book, Bernie has decided to work for Border Patrol, out of frustration with her ex-boss Jim Chee, who has been a bit stand-offish. Instead of being satisfied with her new position, Bernie yearns for the rez and  her friends. Jim Chee, meanwhile, is miserable without Bernie, but helpless as to how to express his growing affection<br />I admit, I was a bit disappointed with the character development of Bernie Maneulito, who is my favorite character. Why must Jim Chee and the other male characters constantly rescue her? Bernie is a well-trained police officer and no longer a rookie! I was disapointed that the author chose to portray such a strong female character as a frail wilting flower, who just needed one of the men to help her out. Feh. It would be nice for Bernie to rescue Jim Chee for a change.<br />Overall, a good book, with an interesting villian. But please, I'm a bit tired of the author selling Bernie short. What's wrong with Bernie being a cop? The book needs a few tough women to balance out the mostly-male cast.	2003-08-26

Can Mrs. Pollifax elude her pursuers and protect Kadi (the college student) from harm?<br />I am a big fan of Mrs. Pollifax, but I found Mrs. Pollifax Pursued to be a bit disjointed, and cluttered with too many annoying minor characters. I liked the circus theme, but I found Kadi very irritating and too helpless for my taste. She acts like an infant, rather than a college age adult. I also wished the author had stuck with the Circus theme. I found the dynamics of the sideshow much more interesting than the farfetched African theme. Overall, while I enjoyed Mrs. Pollifax pursued, I wished it had been a tad more realistic. This novel was too farfetched for me to find it as enjoyable as the other adventures.	2003-08-25

Many of the couples featured in this book became separated or divorced. Sorry, not my idea of true love, or romance either.<br />Plus, I'd prefer more photos than just the single one per couple. The lowercase font used as a title for each bio was really annoying, and the format (one large photo and an essay), tedious. Also, there were few contemporary 'lovers.'<br />Since its publication this book has become obsolete. (As the ill-fated Anne Heche and Ellen deGenerres romance will suggest).<br />Overall, I've seen books which handle this subject much better.

I'm a fan of the television series: Upstairs, Downstairs, I had become intrigued by the dull and sometimes (quite tragic), lives of children, women and men, put into domestic service. The detachment of their aristocratic employers from reality is quite clear as you learn how children are 'bought' from orphanages and poor houses and employed to scrub and work from as early as 5 AM to 11 PM. It was sad to see how the rich employers felt their servants should be 'grateful' for the privilege of working with terrible pay, living in drafty rooms and eating poor quality food. This book describes the hiring process, the workload, the tasks, and the perceptions of Domestic Servants, as well as how Servants themselves perceived themselves.<br />I found it interesting that women were much worse off in domestic service, than men, because their pay was much less and they were required to pay for their own uniforms, whereas, men's pay in most cases was much higher, and their uniforms were provided.<br />Definitely a must for Anthropology students and those interested in exploring the lives of people in domestic service.	2003-08-11

When this happens, Archie believes his death is NO accident and begins to search for the killer. During the course of his investigation, he learns about the existence of another race of beings which has been living amongst us for centuries. Archie's investigations uncover a vast conspiracy of epic proportions... Can Archie save humanity? Or is it already too late?<br />Okay, I am as concerned about the environment as the next person. But when I pick up a horror/thriller novel, I don't like to be bludgeoned over the head repeatedly with paragraphs and paragraphs of environmentalist propaganda. The novel assumes that all humans are idiots, care nothing about the environment and live in an ignorant vacuum. Not so. Some of us are scientist, researchers, anthropologist, or just plain concerned people. Robinson goes a bit too far in my opinion with the sermonizing, and , painting humanity with a broad-brush as possible, while portraying his created race, 'the old people' as being 'good, kind, and saintly.' Please. I mean, we get it already, humanity= evil 'the old people' = good. What I don't get is if the 'old people' are so concerned about the environment.... Why do they drive cars? Don't cars pollute the environment? And what about killing people? Isn't that wrong? I mean, come on. This novel practices an alarming pseudo-science. Humans are mammals of the Primate order. So are Robinson's 'old people.' Primates (especially males), of most species are violent. I find it extremely difficult to believe the 'old people' are somehow SO much superior.<br />While I really liked the characters, and some of the concepts, I got tired with the author's soapboxing.  I also found the ending of this novel to be, extremely irritating. I was unsatisfied with the relationship issue between Archie and his wife, and never quite understood, the author's inference about Mark. While I recommend giving this novel a listen, be prepared for long chapters of thinly-veiled neo-malthusian dialog about eco-issues ad nauseum.ommend giving this novel a listen, be prepared for long chapters of thinly-veiled neo-malthusian dialog about eco-issues ad nauseum.	2003-08-08

The author goes into depth on the roles of woman as 'worker' based on historical and archaeological finds in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and other areas.<br />While I found myself skipping over the preface and personal anecdotes the rest of this book was quite fascinating. Especially the discussion of String Skirts, and the tomb of the Mesopotamian Queen who was buried with 73 attendants.<br />On the negative side, I did wish that this book was more general and not specifically focused on cloth.  Women did more than weave, sew and spin. Women were warriors, seers, dancers, musicians, story-tellers, priestesses and nobility. Also, I felt the cover was a tad misleading. It says Women's Work in very large letters and then in small italic, it mentions this book's emphasis is on Cloth.  I admit, if I had known this, I probably would not have picked it up.<br />Still, I'm glad I did. this was an interesting book, well deserving of a place on any history lover's bookshelf, or for women interested in the history of textiles.	2003-08-08

I'm a big fan of the Creatures Fantastic video series. But I really felt disappointed in Creatures Fantastic: Dragon.  In fact, the fist half seemed to be not about dragons AT ALL but crocodiles. If I wanted a documentary on crocodiles, I would watch the Nature Channel. (Sigh). What I've always liked about the Creatures Fantastic series is that it focuses upon the mythic legends surrounding each creature.  Apparently the researcher had some trouble finding enough to take up a half hour, which is too bad, because there are plenty of dragon myths out there.<br />This video has only one short about St. George and the Dragon, and a few screenshots of China. I guess its frustrating, because I expected so MUCH more.  While I didn't care for CF: Dragon, I can highly recommend Creatures Fantastic: Bird and HORSE.

But I just can't with Runaway Jury.

Are they  grifters? Are they shameless opportunists? Or Sly Anti-Tobacco crusaders? No one can tell, and for me, by the end of the novel, I just didn't particularly care.<br />Marlee: is portrayed as a cold-calculating rich girl. Nichols:  A petty babyish man, who I had difficulty believing could inspire loyalty in anyone. By the end of this book, I kept rooting for the Villain Rankin Fitch.

Mostly because I found the hero, Patrick, to be insufferable for two reasons: #1, he's a thief, and #2, he is quite smug.<br />On Patrick's stealing: I guess, I have difficulty in sympathizing with a hero who steals regardless of whether the money is dirty or not. Patrick did not need the money, he was rich. He could buy whatever he wanted. Frankly, I felt he got what he deserved, when he got caught and tortured by the thugs in Brazil. I mean please, what did he expect them to do when they caught up with him? Give him a group hug?<br />Second, his attitude. SMUG .  Not only is Patrick smug, he's smarter than the police, the FBI, his former attorneys, and everyone else! Patrick manipulates everyone: his girlfriend, the doctor, the judge, his attorney. While these traits are supposed to be 'admirable' and 'intelligent' instead I found them tiresome. Patrick is a user.<br />While I enjoyed the book, I felt Patrick was very irritating.

Bill and his Chinese-American Partner Lydia  (no readers we cannot forget that Lydia is Chinese, this is mentioned at least a  half a dozen times), go on the job to investigate.<br />Employee theft, is just the tip of the iceberg, and as Bill and Lydia investigate, they uncover a sinister web of corruption and betrayal.<br />I really enjoyed the writing style of Ms. Rozan. Her female characters are especially well done. Bill on the other hand, seemed a bit.... Stereotypical. He has no love life, drinks, and smokes (his smoking is described again and again to the point of tedium),  (PLEASE get this guy the patch), and just seems like every other tough-guy detective I've ever read... With one exception. Even though he's tough, he seems a tad.... Feminized. This isn't a bad thing, it just seems strange. Also, I  couldn't understand why Bill was so reticent to admit his feelings for Lydia. It just seemed odd.<br />Overall, a great story. Well worth the read. I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for more Rozan books.	2003-07-10

Is it a history book? an instruction book? A block book? What? For some reason, I thought this book WAS a quilt instruction book, but instead found, as I opened it, that it was 'quilt history' book (with a few minimal instructions and patterns in the back).  As such, It was okay- but I thought there weren't enough photos for a book this size and the quilts spotlighted-with the exception of the Sara Morell Album Quilt- were only okay.<br />I really would've rated this book much higher if patterns and instructions for making all of the blocks (such as the schoolhouse block) were  included. I would recommend viewing this book at the library before picking up a copy. It wasn't bad, it just failed to hold my attention for longer than a few minutes.	2003-07-09

I guess I was looking for something different when I purchased 301 Country Christmas Quilt Blocks. What I was looking for was a quilt block book with Christmas themes. What was included in this book, was a large majority of reworked patterns, that could've suited any time of year except for the coloring. This book relied almost exclusively on appliqu&eacute; to make the blocks look 'Christmasy.' As someone who likes to machine quilt and not appliqu&eacute;, this was disappointing.<br />There were plenty of photos in this book, but the colors of the quilt blocks looked quite drab to me. To achieve the 'country' look they are sewn crookedly. Ughh.. Not my cup of tea. Also, I wanted to see more full-sized items, such as a bedspread or a throw. Most of the quilt examples were of single blocks, with no visual of how they would look in a larger-sized piece. Personally, I don't think they'd look all that great, as anything except a throw pillow. One crooked block is charming... Many crooked blocks = eyestrain.<br />While you might find some fun ideas in this book, I felt a tad let down by the contents. I've wanted to quilt a full-sized christmas quilt for a while, and nothing in this book caught my eye.	2003-07-09

How to teach engineering to a new race of genetically enhanced humans called 'quaddies' who have an extra set of arms instead of legs. But he has other problems as well...The quaddies are being exploited by an evil organization who considers them only 'inventory.'<br />I really enjoyed Falling Free, but I found the progression of the story to be rather typical. We all know Leo is not going to leave things, well enough alone, don't we? So, Leo's meddling is almost inevitable. In my opinion, if Bujold had made the Quaddies exploitation a little more subtle, there might have been a bit more suspense in this department -as it is Leo would have to be a real cad to ignore the Quaddies predicament.<br />My caveat: Personally, I could've done without Leo Romancing one of the Quaddies. I thought it was unethical for a teacher to get involved with one one of his potential students, especially considering she is less than half his age, and as naive as the Quaddies are reputed to be, it struck me as just plain wrong.. ICK.<br />Other than that, this was another great Bujold Audiobook. Listen away. You won't be disappointed.	2003-07-07

I love reviewing the books and planning my next project, this book, claiming to have '336' quilt blocks seemed to be ideal. Well, I was wrong. Dead Wrong.<br />The layout of this book is TERRIBLE. It features six eye-poppingly colorful blocks per page which most of which are not pieced, but are merely DRAWN. There are illustrations which claim to be patterns but there are no actual measurements included. Sure, this looks good....But...The reader is left wondering how to put it all together.<br />I think it is disingenuous NOT to show completed pieced blocks in a quilt block book or measurements. I probably will try to put a couple of the &quot;Tree&quot; blocks together, but I think it will be challenging.<br />Recommended: No. A good 'idea' book, but not for careful piecers, and certainly NOT easy to complete in 10 minutes!	2003-07-04

First, let me say, that I actually enjoyed Conqueror's Pride. I listened to the audio version of this novel, and thought the narrator did an excellent job, and the author's writing was fun and fast-paced. The story: Conqueror's pride is the story of the Cavanaugh family. When Phelan Cavanaugh is captured during an unexpected alien attack, the Cavanaugh family bands together to try to find him.<br />The author deserves credit for writing some fantastic battle scenes &amp; for creating a truly 'different' alien species.<br />Unfortunately, I felt Conqueror's Pride was seriously lacking in emotional depth and that there was a significant dearth of female characters. The male characters are all very similar and almost interchangeable.<br /> Also, all characters are almost non-seuxal, in that, they don't seem to have wives, lovers relationships of any sort. And this doesn't appear to matter. Its almost as if this aspect is scrupulously NOT mentioned. It was very strange. This is the first science fiction novel I've ever read where relationship issues are never discussed and were almost avoided.  I find it hard to imagine that you have thousands of single men in Peace Keeprs and Fleet, who do nothing all day except pine for their chance to go on the next mission. I mean, come on, now. Lets have some character development. And what about the Cavanaugh's? What do we know about these characters at all? No boyfriends, wives, girlfriends etc.<br /><br />Overall, if you can overlook the plastic feel of the Zahn universe's men, and the fact that there is only one female human female character, this is a great action novel which will appeal to just about everyone.	2003-06-30

I recently had the opportunity to examine this book in depth, and I admit this book was rather disappointing. This book only DEFINES phrases such as: &quot;Absence makes the heart grow fonder,&quot; but NEVER explains the ORIGINS of each phrase.  Since most everyone knows the definition of phrases such as &quot;Just what the doctor ordered&quot; defining it is seems almost pointless.  Want to look up a cliche about being sick(for instance)? Think again,  each 'cliche' is listed ONLY alphabetically and can not easily cross-referenced by subject matter giving it ZERO practical application to the modern writer or researcher.<br />For those seeking deeper understanding of cliches, you'd best look elsewhere. This was a superficial effort at best.	2003-06-26

I wanted to like Painted House, but I admit, I found this book way too slow-paced for me. 1/4 way through, I had to give up on it. This book isn't necessarily bad. But it reads like a Steinbeck Americana novel, and having grown up on Steinbeck country, I'm saturated to the gills with novels describing the gritty early days of the 20th century.<br />The protagonist is a young boy who longs to be a baseball star. At the age of 7 he toils in the fields alongside his family and grandparents. Highlights seem to include gossiping about other people in the small town, and listening to the radio. The boy's main interest appear to be a): baseball, and b): curiosity about the laborers his parents hire to harvest cotton.<br />Okay, what I really wanted in the first two hours of listening to this tape, was for something to just HAPPEN. Nothing DOES. The boy just works the farm and dreams of playing baseball. YAWN. (I gather from reading the other reviews, something more serious happens later on, but for me I just could not muster the interest in reading further).<br />Fans of Americana might like Painted House for its gritty depiction of 20th century life. Fans of his legal thrillers might have trouble with the turgid pacing and bland characters, I know I did.	2003-06-21

I've never read a Danielle Steel before and boy, I must say I was UN-impressed. The Heroine Steph is a limp-noodle divorced heroine with poor-self esteem who blames herself for ruining her marriage because she wears flannel night-gowns and doesn't shave her legs. (Please girl, come out to west coast some time)! The hero, Peter is a scientist who works at some vague bionics firm. When Peter goes away he sends his Klone Paul to keep Steph company, little realizing Paul would jump in the sack with Steph.  Predictable antics ensue.<br />Okay, I was prepared to like the Klone and I. But I just couldn't. Steph was whiney, pushed around by her spoiled daughter, who acted like a brat and seemed incapable of taking care of herself (why didn't the older girl babysit the boy, rather than Steph having to hire a sitter all the time?)  Paul was a conservative nothing with no personality. The only interesting character was the Klone, however the author wrote this character to be so 'over the top' that he wasn't enjoyable. Example: Typical Klone outfit:  leopord skin leotard, silver lamee shirt, lime green pants, and high-heeled boots. In fact, the Klone dresses like a drag-queen half the time. Personally, I ended up finding that more interestign that what the heroine/hero were doing. What I couldn't deal with, was the author's attempts at humor, which I thought was quite sophmoric:  Example:the Klone playing charades  at a Christmas party spells out 'fart,'  the neighbor's dog goes to the bathroom on the lawn, again and again, and this is thought to be so horribly hilarious that it must be mentioned several times.. I don't know.... This was just irritating. Very UN-funny. The heroines insecurities reach record-breaking levels with inner dialog singing just one note:  &quot;I loovee Peter....But does Peter....Love me....? I love Paul, but Paul is only a klonnnne.....&quot; I wanted to tear my hair out.<br />Overall, a cute idea which was horribly executed and inflicted on the poor readers.a cute idea which was horribly executed and inflicted on the poor readers.	2003-06-13

I picked up, a copy of Vanity based solely on the cover, (which is quite pretty) and read it cover to cover. While I enjoyed reading this book (I've always been fascinated with anthropology and sociology), this book was rather fluffy, and geared for the most basic reader, (I had to check the spine to make sure this wasn't a children's book) and well, quite frankly... There isn't A LOT to read. Vanity has beautiful pictures and images, accompanied by heavily spaced paragraphs, which give the barest details about each cultural custom, but that's it. Nothing new. Nothing controversial. Nothing anyone has not seen before, and explained in more detail in other books.<br />While the author touches on many of the the most common customs, (foot binding), Ainu tattooing, I felt that each explanation was sanitized and geared for the lowest reader. The sexual aspect of many of these customs isn't mentioned or is downplayed.<br />Writing style, at points, seems to 'talk down' to the reader. At other points it appears that the author is trying to be humorous. There is a distinct lack of scientific or anthropological elements to the text. Footnotes are missing entirely, (what if the reader is interested in learning more about culture x? Or in reading some of the author's source material?)Origins of many customs are not adequately explained or are glossed over.<br />Also, I felt, at times the book misuses the word Vanity. Vanity is defined as: \\"Excessive pride in one's appearance or accomplishments; conceit, Lack of usefulness, worth, or effect; worthlessness.\\" War paint is not vain. To many cultures this was a way to worship the Gods, win success in battle, and impress your enemies? Vanity? No. Just a facet of being a successful warrior or a successful citizen.<br />Overall, while I found Vanity briefly amusing, I felt its contents could be misleading to those interested in the cultural customs described herein. My advice: this makes a great coffee table book, but (for me) has little re-read value.little re-read value.	2003-06-11

My main problem, is I felt a tad preached to. I mean, sure mass tort is bad if handled improperly.  But would half of these people get ANY money if it weren't for the attorneys? Also, the message \\"Crime Doesn't Pay\\" I mean, seriously, it MUST pay occasionally, otherwise there wouldn't be big wigs like Mr. French hanging around.  I don't need to watch the character get deconstructed and brought low to get this message across. I got it loud and clear once Clay started making millions, and his friends started deserting him like rats off a rooster.<br />Personally, I think this would've been much more exciting novel if Clay had spent his time trying to prove that the drug which had been used on Tequila actually existed, rather than becoming the next Joe Millionaire. Also, I felt Clay acted exceedingly out of character by ignoring Tequila's plight, and allowing himself to be swayed by a huckster like Max.<br />Overall, I liked King of Torts. But the message was delivered with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Alright, I get it: Small town = good, big city = bad,  rich people = bad. Tort lawyers = evil. If you can deal with the preachiness, you might like this book. I did.	2003-06-11

But it quickly degraded into a \\"Castle Wolfenstein\\" knock-off, with our 'all-American-boy' hero, outwitting even the master agents with his quick wits, super-stealth and amazing talents of deduction. Too bad in his 'other life' Ben is really a banker. (I still can't figure out WHEN he got his helicopter pilot training).<br />I guess it may be just me, but I'm SO tired of Nazi's as the 'grand uber' villains in modern movies and films/ Can't you just have evil Germans? Do they all have to be Nazi's?<br />This Ludlum was great for the first half of the book, but quickly degraded into a James Bondish level of action which was far from believable. Overall, interesting, but a little drawn-out and farfetched, especially at the end.	2003-06-10

After all, I'm a nerd, and its nice to see one of us get some time in the spotlight at least once and a while....But this book's humor fell flat and seemed  forced at least to this reader, and I disliked the 'hillbilly' humor which I felt was quite corny, and at times embarrassing bad. The heroines says things like: \\"Tarnation Jackson, you're slower than a coon dog with a full belly!\\"  I  don't know... I really cringed. It just wasn't even remotely funny and seemed quite hard for me to believe that a modern heroine would speak like that.<br /><br />Also, I felt the writing especially at the beginning needed some improvement. The writer tells us things and doesn't SHOW us. Do we really need the silly tale about Elvis's underwear, and the whole Beverly Hillbilly thing about coming to Hawaii? Couldn't that have been edited out, in favor of dropping us into some form of juicy office scene illustrating the situation for the characters?<br /><br />What I DID feel the author did well was when she wrote things from the male perspective, in particular Jackson's point of view. These sections and insights into the hero's character were actually really good, and I wish were expanded in favor of dropping some scenes with the secondary romantic couple (a redundant romance involving her mother). Jackson needed more 'air time' and the secondary cast needed a little less.<br /><br />Overall, this author's brand of humor just did NOT appeal to me. I found myself skipping over parts to get to the end to find out what happened... This might appeal to people who can overlook modern people saying things like \\"Tarnation, moonshine, etc.\\" For me, it left me feeling let down.	2003-06-06

I purchased this book to assist me in making better quilt blocks. However, I was very disappointed that block measurements were NOT given. Block patterns were supposed to be transferred to fabric, but did not include the measurements of each section. This was frustrating if you are a careful piecer and want to make sure each block is the correct size and don't like to trace. Instead, the piecer is forced to trace every section, which isn't practical for larger-sized quilts.<br />The lack of block dimensions made this book frustrating for me.  I would recommend it only for people who like to trace, and don't mind the extra chore of photocopying the patterns, adding seam allowances etcetera before getting started.	2003-06-05

I must preface this review by stating that this is my FIRST Miles Vorkosigan audio book, but that I really enjoyed it. The Plot: Miles, a member of an elite security force is sent to a planet where he must act as ambassador. He is chaperoned/accompanied by his amorous cousin Ivan. During the process, Miles makes friends, enemies, and manages to solve a mystery which could damage  relations between Cetaganda and his homeworld.<br />This is a light-hearted comedy, thoroughly enjoyable, and, I found Miles and his cousin Ivan to be quite amusing. Miles himself is a refreshing character who is strengthened by his disabilities and not overcome by them. I particularly enjoyed the scenes in the garden where Miles and Ivan are viewing the Kitten tree, and the intelligent plants. Just too bizarre. Ivan's exploits with the Ghem women was also VERY funny.<br />What I didn't like? Storywise: I was very surprised that Miles didn't take advantage of the Haut ladies superior genetic knowledge to have some of his own physical abilities looked into. Any society which can bio-engineer its own people to the degree the Haut lords and ladies did, certainly could help Miles's strengthen his bones and straighten his spine.<br /> On to the quality of the tape:  While I enjoyed the voice of the male reader, who had quite a range, the female reader read every character in exactly the same voice, which sounded sort of like that of an elderly granny. It was definitely NOT a voice I expected to hear for sexy bombshell Haut women. Also, because the tone of her voice did NOT change, sometimes I was left wondering WHO was speaking half the time.  I found this distracting.  What was the purpose of having a female reader at all if there was no variance? Also, the tape did not have a: \\"Insert tape 2\\" message or \\"this is the end of side 1\\" Message at the end of each section to let the listeners know that they were at the end of each section. This was particularly bad at the END of the book where the story just ends, with no music, no end credits NOTHING, I had to fast forward to make sure that I had listened to it all.  Poor design.<br />Overall, I loved this NOVEL and would LOVE to listen to the rest of the series.  I recommend this to sci-fi fans, looking for something fun to sink their teeth into.tory just ends, with no music, no end credits NOTHING, I had to fast forward to make sure that I had listened to it all.

The first 37 pages are NOT recipes but definitions. Some of which I felt needed no definition. Do we really need a full paragraph description of \\"Granulated sugar\\" or \\"Honey?\\" I mean, come on. this stuff belongs in a cooking theory book, or at least in the a section at the back, but not in the first pages...<br />Once we get to the recipe section, few recipes really caught my attention. I also HATE HATE HATE the cheap publishing trick of putting the photographs of only some of the dishes in the center. This makes work for the cook as he/she looks at the picture then must search out the recipe and who wants to do this? I prefer photos and illustrations to be next to the recipes so the cook can see what the finished product might look like. I also felt the recipes were poorly indexed and seemed to span several pages apiece. For a book this size I expected thousands of recipes instead of the measly few included.<br />Overall: A big beefy book, without a lot of recipes or contents useful to the experienced cook. Beginners might appreciate the length Patent goes to describe basic cooking principals. Lack of photos and poor design did not appeal to this reader.	2003-05-28

I loved the book up to the inclusion of the title character: Nora. Then the book turned into a Nora lovefest. Nora is smarter, sexier, more intelligent and more 'politically correct' than the rest of the other bigoted-narrow minded Anglos in the small southern town, feh.  The other heroine, Peyton is an ungrateful child, who seems to to spend more time pontificating the doings of adults than any teenager alive. Instead of being grateful for the clothes and makeover her aunt gives her she whines and complains about it even to the point of being physically ill... Peyton was way too old to act like that. Errr.<br />Back to the character of Nora. To put it bluntly:  I disliked her.  If her anachronistic behavior (were not bad enough), the author uses Nora as her mouthpiece for an unending soapbox commentary of social issues from morality to racial-issues, and she does it with the weight of a leaden hockey puck. (While I DO agree racial issues and civil rights are big and important factors, I did not want to be bludgeoned every time the character opens her mouth).<br /> I had to give this up about halfway through the book, the character of Nora just rubbed me completely the wrong way. If you want to read a book with racial issues done right, check out \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  I found Nora, Nora a disappointment.	2003-05-28

Tempted is the story of \\"No Account Savage\\" and her Romance with Preacher Mike Perfect (yes those are their REAL names!) I inherited this book from a relative and expected it to be very silly. Instead, I found it amusing, (at least the first half) but after the first half it rapidly deteriorates and becomes bogged down by several silly subplots involving No Account's father, a couple of local yokels, a young prostitute, and an alcoholic doctor.<br />Back to the story....No Account is the daughter of a Hillbilly, who decides to better herself for her and her brother Slow, (groan)  by becoming a mail order bride. When she arrives in a small Californian mining town and meets Preacher Mike, its lust at first sight (at least for No Account) however Preacher Mike has reservations. At first  he mistakes No Account for a boy, (its a wonder to me how these boyish heroines always clean up to be beautiful hotties-!), also, she has horrible table manners, hygiene, cannot read and write, and speaks in broken English.<br />Of course, in the tradition of 'My Fair Lady,' after being dumped in a river, No Account is revealed to be a beauty and Preacher Perfect is severely tempted. However, obstacles must be faced before these two characters can find true happiness... Can Preacher Perfect and No Account come to terms with their disparate backgrounds and lifestyles to find true love?<br />If you like humorous romance and don't mind stereotypical characters and and SEVERAL silly secondary romance, this book is for you - however, be forewarned: the romance and plot seem to peter out halfway through the book, and then it begins to read quite banally.	2003-05-26

In this 'episode,' Amos must confront some ghosts from his past, and make some hard choices.<br />While I like the Amos Walker series, I keep hoping for Amos to have some FURTHER character development. Sometimes his inability to find a woman, and his habits (alcohol and cigarettes), are a little over-done. Must Amos attempt to smoke in every possible unacceptable place? I.E.: The art institute, the library, the massage parlor, and the Green House? And do we really need this to be described /Every/ time?

Each chapter header comes complete with famous 'real people' who are using the names in question. I love it.<br />My only peeve with this book, is the low quality paper it is printed on. This paper is a very low grade, and seems only a few grades above toilet paper. Don't let this deter you, however. This is a great book. A must buy.	2003-05-14
1124947:US	52821302	R1JJZVWNTH3VBZ	157178103X	342188854	No Word for Time: The Way of the Algonquin People	Books	3	11	16	N	Y	Not What I expected	I read and ordered Now Word for time, thinking it might be a  scientific Anthropological study. Perhaps this pre-conception colored my judgement, because what I read seemed to be a philosophy book with which borders on New Age spiritualism.<br />The author describes his experiences study Algonquin traditions and makes several general statements on how the &quot;Elders&quot; act and feel. Many of these statements are so absolute, It makes me wonder... Do all the 'elder's' act/feel this way? What is the origin and purpose of these traditions? Is there a difference between the philosophy of the elders based on Gender? What about Gender rolls in Algonquin society? How do the non-elders feel? I was left curious about this.<br />Second, while I enjoyed some of the stories, I felt the author may leap to some conclusions based on experiences with a small group of people. Saying: &quot;All Algonquin's behave a certain way-,&quot; is like saying: all Anglos eat fried rice on Tuesday...&quot; it just seemed to generalized for me.<br />Third, I didn't really care for the first-person narrative: the author writes throughout the book &quot;I have seen-&quot; or &quot;I-went&quot; Or, &quot;I did this.&quot; It just didn't seem to have the same impact as a third-person narrative.<br />Fourth: there was a distinct absence of footnotes, in the text. Chapters were slurred together with no particular order or purpose. Chapters starting off at the end of the paragraph of a previous chapter. I found this distracting.<br />Fifth: Finally, there is a certain 'pseudo-science' which I think can be misleading in this book. The author starts speculating that early native peoples were Neanderthal-like in appearance is incorrect.  No neanderthals migrated to the American continent at all, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that Native American's appeared any different in their physical aspects than other Early native peoples.<br />Overall, I recommend this book for fans of the metaphysical, who don't mind a 'stream of consciousness' style narration, and a certain lack of scientific perspective.<br />In conclusion, while I enjoyed aspects of &quot;No Word For Time&quot; I would use this book as a reference with caution.hysical, who don't mind a 'stream of consciousness' style narration, and a certain lack of scientific perspective.<br />In conclusion, while I enjoyed aspects of &quot;No Word For Time&quot; I would use this book as a reference with caution.	2003-05-14

I listened to the Audio version of Hades' daughter and admit I found it very disappointing, so much so, that I couldn't finish it. Here's the story: Brutus, an heir to the Trojan empire becomes the unwitting pawn of a power play between an evil sorceress and her deformed incestuous brother. Chaos, mayhem and carnage ensue. If you're like me, this sounds like a typical fantasy/sci-fi plot, and you might enjoy it. Well, I didn't... Here's why:<br />Douglass' writing style is not for everyone. She skips around quite a bit and tells the story from so many different characters perspective at times it becomes tedious, and some plot threads seem to go nowhere. Many of the characters the reader is supposed to sympathize with are so vile it was difficult to for me to care about. An example:  Brutus, the main male character brutally rapes the lead female character  in one scene and is unrepentantly emotionally and sexually abusive to her throughout the story. (And this is the good guy!) Feh.<br />The lead female character, Cornelia spends half the remainder of the novel trying to 'appease' Brutus, when she should be kicking his sorry you-know-what to the curb. The ongoing rivalry between The sister/brother sorcerers, just had me sighing. (I would hope that if I keep getting re-incarnated that it won't be to duke it out with my sister in the next life).<br />I really had to give up on this book halfway through. I couldn't handle the rape/sex scenes, and the constant degradation of the heroine, who kept trying to 'appease' her sicko hubbie. I really would've liked to have cared about one of these characters but I just couldn't. This novel sets historical fantasy back decades.	2003-05-08

This is the story of a plucky (and yet somehow preternaturally old), young woman named Elizabeth, who traveling to Denmark, gets mixed up with an eccentric author and her snarling son, and a mystery involving of all things, a bathrobe.<br />While Elizabeth is a nice enough character, the author fails to write convincing modern young woman. Instead, we get Amelia Peabody with a few colorful swear words. Added to this, she fails to write any emotional hooks which might make me care about the legion of stereotypical characters which haunt the REST of the book.. Christian  (the romantic lead's) snarling and snapping, (come on, surely she can write other types of heroes?)was grossly unattractive to me. His over-the-top eccentric mother had my eyes rolling in pain at points. Surely a modern heroine like Elizabeth, could do better.<br />Perhaps this is my own fault, for prolonging the reading experience by listening to the audio version, but I found myself vastly disappointed with this novel. Perhaps the others are better?	2003-05-03

Dr. Yes is the story of Rachel: a modish nose-beringed heroine, who has become a tour guide in Tibet to escape her life in the states. Rachel is a delightful heroine, whose libido and attitude I found quite refreshing in the era of vapid dumb-girl action heroes, at least until the end.  I was disappointed that the author felt she had to make \\"Rachel's personality modish hair a 'defense mechanism.'\\" Can't a woman just LIKE having pink hair and a nose ring for goodness sake? Why does she have to be 'compensating' for anything? *sigh*  And why can't the hero like her for who/what she is without wanting to change her? I felt a bit let down about that plot device.<br />I DID like the Hero, Harrison, however, but felt he needed to grow a bit. I was disappointed he  was still the same character throughout the novel and was never really developed well. I would be interested in hearing more about his work, considering he was one of the few male members of the all-female organization. The plot about the Yes drug, meandered and wasn't dealt with sufficiently.<br />Overall, this novel had some great characterization, but I felt a bit let down by the weak ending. I would recommend this novel for those who are looking for a funny romance with a non-traditional heroine.	2003-04-18

The Jester is the story of Hugh de Luc, a French peasant/innkeeper who, after deserting from the crusades, returns home to discover his wife has been abducted and a evil lord Baldwin and a villainous gang of thugs on the loose.  I listened to the audio version of this novel, and while I enjoyed it, I thought it was overrated and rather predictable. The material (except for the hero's jesting), was really nothing new. The novel read like a typical romance novel, with long excessively gory and violent parts added for shock value (James Axler eat your heart out). The violence, while objectionable, didn't further the plot more than to make us hate the 'evil bad guys' even more.  (As if we needed the negative reinforcement, after the opening scene.)<br />The characters were stereotypical, the saintly peasants and 'evil sadistic rich men'  and the sociopath \\"I'm so eeeevvvvillllll\\" knights impaling and committing all sorts of hideous crimes, made me wonder when Vlad the Impaler was going to be showing up. Unnecessary. Also, Hugh's transformation from humble peasant to a knight-hunting commando was really far-fetched, and had my eyes rolling.<br />Overall, I felt this was an average read, with some likeable characters, and plenty of superfluous gore. I would have enjoyed it much more if  Hugh remained true to the premise of the book and  relied on his wits and Jester skills to bring about this novel's resolution.	2003-04-06

Susan Fletcher, a cryptographer  and her school teacher boyfriend David's relationship is on rocky ground. David's new promotion and old-fashioned attitude towards being the bread-winner has put a strain on their relationship which Susan doesn't know how to mend, (she's the one with the bigger salary). Their relationship is strained further, when Susan's boss asks David to run an errand for him - in Spain.  Meanwhile, Susan has her own troubles. She's tracking a miraculous new encryption program called &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; which is expected to revolutionize Encryption as we know it.<br />I really enjoyed this thriller, and I particularly liked the character of Susan Fletcher. (It's nice to see more women in lead rolls in thrillers), I was a bit bored with the parts about David, because I found his transformation from simple high school teacher to 'super agent' to be unrealistic. I also disliked the fact that he had difficulty dealing with Susan's salary, I mean the guy's a teacher for goodness sake. I would expect he'd be used to lower wages! I also enjoyed the characterization of the other IT experts such as Jabba.<br /> While the ending held few surprises, I still thought this audiobook was great!	2003-04-01

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this novel, and I really enjoyed it: with two caveats: the narrator read the novel WAY too fast, so that sometimes I felt myself wanting to ask him to SLOW DOWN. The second problem I had with this novel, was the recording. Either I received a flawed version, or there was something wrong with the print run. When it said to reverse to the other side, and adjust the balance control, sometimes, the side which I reversed to would be incorrect. (This appeared to be only on one tape, and the others functioned perfectly, so I was STILL able to enjoy the book, it just was a mite confusing to figure out which side I needed to be on).<br />Onto the plot: This is a typical Amos Walker novel. Amos is a tough-talking, one-liner spewing Private Investigator living in Detroit. He is hired by a blue-eyed stripper to investigate her own disappearance (?). Yes that's right.  What follows is a series of events involving a pair of evil policemen, a Union Boss, and a corrupt ex-judge. In typical Amos form, Amos bulldogs his way through the mystery with some unexpected results.<br />A great addition to your Amos Walker collection... Boy I wish I could have as much imagination as Loren D. The one-liners alone make this story!	2003-03-25

Instead, this is an anachronistic tale of Milisant, a eighteen year old woman who dresses like a boy, fights like a man, and doesn't want to get married to any man. (If this were a Xena novel, I would expect a plot like this and applaud the heroines independence. Since this is supposed to be a serious historical novel, I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes at the anachronistic behavior).<br />Despite this rather typical start, the novel gets worse. Milisant is just not LIKEABLE. Her reasons for disliking Wulfric (she bears a grudge from a childhood play accident), were silly, and could be resolved if the characters would spend 5 minutes together simply TALKING to one another. Milisant's 'love of animals' bordered on the ridiculous, as she travels with cages of wild animals wherever she goes.  (Milisant's love for animals, apparently doesn't include loving them enough to let them go free).<br />Wulfric, the hero, seemed okay, but was rather under-developed and, was completely eclipsed by Milisant's strong, shrewish personality.<br />This book held no surprises. Read it if you must, but I found it disappointing.	2003-03-18

When she learns of a fabulous collection of antique swords is in the private collection of an elderly man in France, she convinces her male chauvinist pig of a boss to allow her the time off to see if she can procure the collection for the museum.<br />Unfortunately, when Val arrives she inadvertently gets involved in a plot involving the Chinese Mafia. Also, she finds the man she's supposed to meet - Jian Shan is far from the elderly man she presumed, but a slender attractive long-haired millionaire (too bad the cover shows a short haired man in silohuette).<br /> I really enjoyed the deepest edge, at least the first part. But towards the second part of the novel I found it difficult to suspend my disbelief. There were far too many minor characters taking up a significant chunk of the lime light (obviously waiting in the wings for their own books) that I lost track of what the main couple were doing. Also, I found it unrealistic that a modern heroine of Val's spunk and initiative would allow her supervisor to speak to her in the manner in which she does. Can we say 'sexual harrassment?' Please.<br />Overall, this novel started out great, but left me wishing for more.	2003-03-14

For those of you who don't know by now, Storm Riders is an epic English-translated Chinese comic drawn by artist Wing Shing Ma. Wind Shing Ma's artistic style is very detailed and less exaggerated than most Japanese manga.  Storm riders follow the story of stepbrothers Wind, Cloud, and Frost and their battles with their evil foster father Conquer. (Although it is not altogether necessary, its advisable to read issues 1-9 to fully appreciate 10).<br />In this issue, Lord Conquer's disciples Wind and Cloud are separated. Wind, suffering a devastating injury (see last issue) inflicted by evil lord Conquer, must cope with with the agony of his wound and a confrontation with an assassin band spearheaded by Immortal Taste (no, I did not make that one up, it really is his name!) Similarly, Cloud, must adjust to the use of his new arm (also last issue), and repay his debt to Red Yu.<br />This book deals with both heroes' loss they come to grips with their physical disabilities. This was a powerful issue, with some great character development for Wind and Cloud. In particular, Wind's devastating injuries and his nobility in the face of certain death were really gripping. Cloud breaks free of his mega jerk bad boy attitude to do a good deed, which had me gawking at the pages in amazement. (I'm not a huge fan of Cloud when he's in a self-pitying snit, which is most of the time, LOL). The scene between the two assassins \\"Harmony between husband and wife\\" was moving. (You'll know what I mean when you get to that part).<br />Another great issue of Storm Riders!  (As usual), because of the violence (lots of death and mayhem), I recommend this for mature readers only.	2003-03-12

Chesapeake Blue is the fourth in Nora Robert's Chesapeake bay trilogy, and, in my opinion, it is the weakest of the series. I will probably received many negative votes for this review, (especially in a forum of so many positive votes), but, here's the deal: Chesapeake Blue was an average read for me. The plot seemed contrived, the characterization forced, and the story suffering from the forced inclusion of too many characters from previous books.<br />Chesapeake Blue is the story of late 'twenty-something' Seth Quinn. Seth has decided to return to the small water front town, this time to stay, and hooks up with rich girl Drusilla Whitecomb. Both Seth and Dru have 'issues' they need to work out before getting together.<br />Seth: I had a great deal of difficulty envisioning Seth as a romantic lead from the way he is written. He still seems to be a little boy running away from his problems. (Personally, I really wish Nora had chosen to write about Aubrey, she was much more interesting as an adult). In Nora tradion Seth is a 'super rich, fantastically talented artistic bachelor', who can't seem to take no for an answer. He seemed to be very immature, and was really pushy with his relationship with Dru. I disliked the way he manipulated Dru to do things she didn't want to do, by using his art and artistic talent as a weapon, and I found his vocabulary and mannerisms.... Somewhat childish. (And I'm not referring to the cussing, that didn't bother me).<br />Dru: Dru was a much more interesting character, but was oodles more mature than Seth. Although her dysfunctional relationship with her parents was touched upon, this was never resolved to my satisfaction, and I failed to see that Dru and Seth had much in common as a couple aside from sexual chemistry.<br />The highlight of this story was NOT Seth and Dru's relationship,  but seeing what had happened to the rest of the Quinns- but even there, Nora takes few risks. She portrays the Quinn extended family, as too perfect, a little too cohesive and a little too good to be true.  I have come to expect a little more realism from Nora. Also, the Quinn's have lost a bit of their 'blue collar feel' which I really liked.<br />So, overall, I felt CB was an average novel with few surprises. Perhaps Aubrey's tale will be better?t, a little too cohesive and a little too good to be true.  I have come to expect a little more realism from Nora.

This was an excellent writer's reference, which explores gender and roles in writing. Is your character a Charmer? Bad Boy? or Free spirit? Each section defines the Character's basic traits, likely occupation, and gives examples of character's which fall into each from television in film. Further, each section goes on to describe how characters interact with each other.<br />My only quibble with this book, is the manner in which it is divided by gender. Some of the archetypes could easily be either male or female: such as Crusader, Nurturer, Free Spirit, Charmer, Warrior etc. But these were carefully slanted towards either feminine or masculine. For instance, I can easily see a male &quot;Crusader&quot; a female &quot;Lost Soul&quot; or a Female &quot;Warrior&quot; and yet this cross-gender archetypes were not explored. Perhaps in a later edition?<br />Overall, an excellent reference, sure to delight!!	2003-02-27

Along the way, Amelia and Evelyn run into the Emerson brothers (Archaeologists) who are excavating the ancient ruin of Amarna, former home/temple of the heretic king Akhenaton<br />I really LOVED Crocodile on the Sandbank, and look forward to reading the rest of these novels, but I had two problems with COTS, which I will detail.<br />First: I'm probably the only one in the world, but I didn't care for the 'gruff, rude, alpha-male' Emerson. I didn't find this character very charming, I didn't like the way Amelia and he bickered, nor did I find him at all romantic. Also, I found the romance between Amelia and Emerson to seem rushed, and quite frankly unbelievable. (Must EVERY single character in this book 'find someone?'

In fact, I found it so obvious that I thought I must be wrong! Overall, though, I enjoyed COTS, with or without its flaws. Can't wait for the sequel.	2003-02-20

Romance Difficult to believe	The Rowan is the tale of an orphan girl, who has grown up on an Alien world in the care of her mentor, a cantankerous older woman named Seglenn. (I have listened to the audio version of this book, so please forgive me if the character names are not spelled exactly right). Both Seglenn and the Rowan are high-capacity telikinetics, capable of moving freight from one sector of the galaxy to another.<br />The Rowan is a difficult child, incredibly independent,  self-centered, and opinionated. She is constantly at loggerheads with her mentor Seglenn, over procedure and protocol. Nevertheless, she is  an altruistic child, who shoulders the burden of her responsibilities quite well, (even though in my opinion she never really treats Seglenn very well).<br />While I enjoyed &quot;The Rowan,&quot; I found several things to be quite unrealistic. First, Rowan's romantic involvements, (Tourian), and second with Jeff Raven. Both romances were 'love at first sight' type situations which seems to work out exactly as SHE intended. I mean Hello? Girl, tell me your secret, because  in real life, things never seem to work out EXACTLY the way you want!  I found it difficult to believe someone as intelligent and as self-centered as The Rowan would fall so IMMEADIATLY and totally in love in a matter of hours. The Rowan went from Fiercely independent to Fiercely co-dependant in a matter of weeks. Hard to believe.<br />Second, I was disappointed that the Rowan, was almost super-human. I found it hard to believe that a girl who was sheltered, sedentary, would be so much better at everything than the other characters. (Prettier, Smarter, Etc.).  And why couldn't these people with such obvious telikinetic abilities use these abilities to make childbirth a heck of a lot easier by just zapping the child out of the womb?  I just couldn't figure this one out. Also, while I am not really opposed to romance in my sci-fi, I could've done without the excessive rhapsodizing about the 'joys of motherhood' towards the end.<br />Overall, a light, entertaining read with a lot of 'fairy-tale' qualities and happily-ever after elements, that will appeal to most readers, even though some more Jaded readers might be rolling their eyes.od' towards the end.<br />Overall, a light, entertaining read with a lot of 'fairy-tale' qualities and happily-ever after elements, that will appeal to most readers, even though some more Jaded readers might be rolling their eyes.	2003-02-10

Nothing particularly original, but some great dialog between these characters. When Akeela is betrothed to the beautiful Cassandra, he mistakenly entrusts her to Lukien's care. As you might expect, Cassandra and bad-boy Lukien fall in love, betray Akeela in true Arthurian fashion, all the while protesting 'how much they love and respect him as a brother' Puhleeeze.  As if this rather stereotypical plot device was bad enough, Akeela conveniently goes mad, adding justification for adultery, and fuel to an Lukien's rather stellar Catholic Guilt meter.<br />Watching the central characters constantly betray and hurt each over and over, was not particularly fun. While the intentions were good, the decisions made by most of these characters were bad.  Can supposedly intelligent characters make consistently stupid mistakes? Apparently so. The only character I particularly liked was Akeela and the author warped him so much you won't recognize this character by part two. He is reduced to a cardboard cutout insane villain of the I'm so eeeeeeeeeeeevilll variety.<br />Tack on some silly plot in the final quarter about a mystical city of outcasts who use spirit guides to compensate for various disabilities (interesting but should belong in an entirely different book, as it had very little to do with the first half) and you have a seven-hundred page downer.  Still, even this might have been excusable, if there had been a better resolution to the Akeela/Lukien/Cassandra relationship, which I felt was the core aspect and heart of this book.<br />Good, but not great. Character development had great potential but left me with a very dissatisfied feeling.	2003-02-04

I purchased the unabridged audio version of &quot;Dancing at the Harvest Moon,&quot;  hoping for a light funny romance.  Instead it was rather maudlin. Heroine Maggie Macintire is experiencing a mid-life crisis after her husband divorces her for a much younger woman, and spends most of the novel moping about responsibility and wringing her hands about her relationship with a much younger man.<br />Okay, its not the age difference, its really not, but I didn't find the romance between Maggie and Robbie's son to be that believable. For one thing, they didn't seem to have a huge amount in common except their mutual love of their father. Second, for a forty-six year old woman Maggie was shockingly immature. She never seemed to know what she wanted, and when she figures it out, she 'denies herself' out of worry about what other's might think. Feh.<br />Robbie's son seemed to be a restless dreamer with no real life, and an almost weirdly obsessive love for Maggie, his father's ex-girlfriend. From my perspective these two characters were just NOT in a healthy relationship. Maggie seemed to be living in the past, and Robbie's son, just didn't seem normal.<br />Overall, I was disappointed in &quot;dancing,&quot; especially the ended abruptly, which left many questions unanswered.	2003-01-27

Eternity Row stars the super-bio-engineered doctor Cherijo, her standoffish husband Duncan Reever, and now the latest addition, Cherijo's daughter Maril.<br />This latest installment was by far the weakest in the series. As we found out in the last four novels, Cherijo was bio-engineered by her demented father/brother to be the perfect wife (erk). Fortunately, this book fortunately gives the demented father/brother character Joe Grey Veil a rest, and concentrates on Cherijo.<br />Cherijo and Duncan have had a child (see Shockball) cliff hanger. The child, Maril  is precocious, gifted, and as annoying as can be, talking in 'baby talk' throughout the book. She manages to be underfoot at every opportunity, taking Eternity Row into new levels of corniness. Duncan Reever, usually cool-headed, becomes a testosterone crazed fiend in this novel, slathering Cherijo with a 'romance novel' level of protectiveness and ordering her about in uncharacteristic fashion.<br />As usual, Cherijo is impervious to harm, as she bludgeons the readers (and the rest of the galaxy) with her own version of doctoring and philosophy. (While I love these books, I think the author may have painted herself into a a corner with this character by making her all-perfect, all-powerful, and just plain TOO superhuman). As it is, there is nothing Cherijo cannot do. From discovering cures for an STD(last novel), to solving interplanetary incidents. Cherijo is not only smarter than everyone, she is tougher, stronger, and knows what's best for everyone too. Please.<br />While I liked Eternity Row, I felt the novel ending was a tad contrived.  I disliked the baby-talk which the author used as a speech device for Cherijo's child.  Scratch that, I also disliked the child as a plot device. Whatever happened to Cherijo's protestations that she 'just wasn't maternal?' And who in their right mind would produce a child with a stalker like Joe Grey Veil loose? I also felt the cast of characters needs to be parred down some,  and some minor plot threads should've been resolved, such as Ilona... Etc. Overall, this was a okay read, but with all the 'pairing up' that goes on in this novel, I began to feel like I was reading a Romance Novel, rather than Sci Fi.<br />I recommend this for readers of the other books, but it definitely was the weakest in the series.n some,  and some minor plot threads should've been resolved, such as Ilona...

Endurance is the third novel in S.L Vieh's fantastic Stardoc Series, featuring the trials of Doctor Cherijo Jorin. This latest installment, sees Cherijo captured on a slave world betrayed by her ex husband, emotionless, cold-hearted Reever. This novel was an emotional roller-coaster ride, as Cherijo, now being forced to minister to the sick and injured, is universally reviled by her captors, the other slaves, and her would-be friends.<br />As per most romance novel heroines, Cherjo goes through a lot in order to make everyone  liker her. Despite this its not enough.  Throughout the book, she is beaten, abused, harassed assaulted and tortured, and almost eaten. The man who loves her remains emotionally detached and (seemingly) distant.<br />While the beatings, torture and maiming were incredibly distasteful, Cherijo's reaction (wise-cracking comments, snappy come-backs, and karate punches), made some of the scenes unrealistically comical instead of serious. I would like to have seen Cherijo use her brain, for once, and THINK before acting. Instead, half the time, Cherijo charges into danger half-cocked  like Don Quixote on his donkey forcing half of the male crew to rescue her. (Please girl! This is a sci-fi, not a bodice ripper!)<br />I know, I'm making some negative comments, but I really did like the book. Viehl writes in a way that makes you overlook the fact that there isn't a /huge/ amount of substance to the middle portion of the novel, and that parts of the plotline are largely repetitive. I recommend this book for fans of the series, although there wasn't a huge amount of character development until the end.<br />This series continues with &quot;Shockball&quot; the latest Stardoc novel.	2003-01-07

(For those who have not read the previous novel),  this continues the adventures of Krinata, a 33 year old human researcher of noble blood, who in the first book assisted Jindigar, an alien outcast, to escape the clutches of the an evil and corrupt Imperial regime. (Is there any other kind?)<br />This time, however, Jindigar and friends have crash-landed on a planet filled with 'hive mentality' aliens, in the process losing most of their equipment and suffering several severe casualties, including the loss of their sentient computer, Arlai.  Do the refugees have what it takes to survive in a hostile alien world?<br />I liked Farfetch a great deal. Jingdigar is such a smart (not to mention handsome) and compelling character, one cannot help but fall in love with him! LOL Krinata is a believable human, 'caught up' in current events.<br />Unlike the first novel, this novel DOES became confusing and unclear in certain sections,  especially when 'psychic' phenomenon is being explained or discussed. Many times I felt /I/ was the one hallucinating as I was trying to interpret one of Krinata's complex dream-experiences! Which got tiresome after a while. Also, At times I grew frustrated with the Dushau for their standoffish-ness and their callousness towards other species, (even if it is explained in the first book that they are hesitant to get involved with short-lived species because they become too attached to them, and grieve for them when they die... Sort of like Immortal Tolkien-esque elves do). And then of course there is the Krinata/Jindigar subtextual relationship are they a couple or aren't they!!!! We haven't had such a mystery since Xena and Gabrielle! Frustrating, but in an fun way! =-)<br />Of course, this novel is great! I wouldn't complain if it weren't!  I  really liked Storm and the rest of his family. He is such an interesting character. I also was sad about Arlai, and some of the other suffering colonist. This is a fantastic work of art, and can't wait to read the third and last Lichtenberg novel 'Outreach.'<br />Viva-la-Lichtenberg!suffering colonist.

Tender Texan is the story of beautiful Anna Meyer, a German settler, and her love for Chance Wyatt a bold Texan. When Anna's abusive husband is killed on the wagon train west, Anna knows she must remarry or risk losing the parcel of and she had been promised. Cleverly, she decides to 'hire' a husband, paying the first man she meets to marry her for a year, with her remaining cash- one-hundred dollars. Chance agrees, for he has fallen for Anna.<br /><br />Once married, however, Anna is haunted by the ghost of her ex-husbands abuse. Can she overcome her fear of intimacy to give Chance a... Chance?<br /><br />I thought Tender Texan had potential, but ended up being merely an average read. Most of the plot was just too sterotypical for me to fully enjoy it. IE: Hero's family was massacred by Indians, anglo hero has an \\"Indian\\" best friend, and the naive heroine must be 'shown' how to live in the frontier, and constantly risks herself by running, screaming, crying out and acting like a ninny at the wrong moments. (And she is from a hard-working German Farming family? Unbelievable! )<br /><br />I also grew tired of the heroines 'fear of intimacy.' This subplot dragged on far too long for my particular tastes. Overall, this book was an average read with potential to be much better.	2002-12-27

Dr. Cherijo is a brilliant doctor, with a problem: she is being stalked by her obsessive father Dr. Joe Grey Veil. To escape her evil Dad, Cherijo arranges a transfer for herself to a remote colony world, where she starts working at an alien trauma ward. Through her work in the ward, she makes friends, (and enemies), develops a relationship, with a blue angel-winged alien, and makes some hard choices. Does Cherijo have what it takes to be a doctor on the 'cutting edge'  of a new alien frontier?<br />I really liked Stardoc. Even if I felt Cherijo was an odd hybrid of Clark Kent and Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, this character worked for me on a number of levels. First,  I liked the romance between this character and her alien fiancee (even if I found the pace of the romance to be rather difficult to believe). Second, I liked the supporting cast of characters. They were interesting and amusing.<br />Things I didn't like: The character of Reever. If her Dad is a stalker, this guy is worse. His attempts to 'force' her to 'mind-meld' with him, despite her being involved with another man were quite abusive. (I'm sorry, but I didn't care about his tragic past, or any other excuses behind his behavior, I expect Science-Fiction to be a tad more enlightened than Stalk-me-until-I-begin-to-enjoy-it behavior that epitomizes romance novels from the eighties).<br />Also, I felt the Terrans being portrayed as 'evil tourists' and 'xenophobic nutjobs' and all aliens are 'good' and 'tolerant' was a little overdone.<br />Besides these two peccadillos, I STILL recommend this book quite highly. There are some creative ideas in Viehl's mind  and its great to see them on paper. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.	2002-12-19

Sarah and Connor (I kept thinking of the character &quot;Sarah Connor from Terminator 2: Judgement Day) are brother and sister, eking out a living on their ranch, when a violent band of criminals- the Culpeppers- begins threatening surrounding farms, Chase, a bounty-hunter arrives to set things right. During the ensuing struggle with the Culpeppers, Sarah and Chase fall in love.  Can Chase overcome his past and admit to loving Sarah?<br />I feel bad, leaving a negative review in a forum of so many positive reviews, (which usually means I will get negged), but here's the deal.... I didn't like Winter Fire...  Mostly because I found the hero Chase to be emotionally abusive.<br />From the moment Chase is introduced, he bullies Sara, orders her around and complains about how she is caring for her younger brother. There was also one 'love scene'' early in the book where he was making love to Sarah while she was asleep, which was a real turn off for me. Eh....Ummm... Hello? Our heroine is SLEEPING. Yuck... Not exactly hero material!<br />Second: The author constantly over-used phrases to describe Sara, that it was almost comic: &quot;Rose-Scented&quot; must have been used at least fifty times in the first six chapters alone.<br />These two factors, greatly reduced my enjoyment of the book.	2002-12-18

This is huge novel which follows the lives of sisters:  Glennin, Sarra and Cailet, and their struggles for power in the barbaric and ruthless Matriarchal world of Lanfell.<br />Lanfell is a world founded by humans long ago, and which has become Matriarchal over time. Men are treated as Chattel, and women hold all the power. When trouble forces the sisters apart, they are raised by different factions causing conflict and hardship.<br />I really enjoyed Exiles,  (even if there are literally hundreds of characters to keep track of).  My favorite character was Sarra, and her romance with Bard Collan.  Sarra's 'old world values' and Collan's 'desire for independence from Women', reminds me of the classic struggle occurring in Women's fiction throughout the globe. This 'role reversal' was quite a hoot.<br />While at times, the multiple-perspective story-telling is confusing, (Part of me, wishes that the author had split this book in separate sections to avoid this problem), I was still able to enjoy this novel.<br />I applaud the author for writing about a matriarchal world, and taking risks to write something different.  If this had been a novel set in a standard patriarchal society it would lose some of its impact.	2002-12-16

Almost perfect	Owlknight is the third and last volume in Lackey's Owl Trilogy. In this novel, Darian is honored for his many accomplishments, works on his problems with his girlfriend Keisha, and goes to look for his missing parents. <br /> <br />Typically, I enjoy all  Lackey novels, but OwlKnight's suffered from a rambling plot line, too many over-powered characters, and 'Local 'Boy Makes Good Syndrome.'  (I.E. black sheep of the family returns home, and the rural rubes are awed and amazed at how witty/charming/saintly our hero has become). Please. What is that saying about never being appreciated in your own village? Apparently untrue in Valdemar.<br /> <br />Also, there were quite a few plot thread's left hanging that I wish Lackey had addressed. First, Darian's resolve to tell Winterfox about the young barmaid Lilly from the first book... He never does. Then,  Winterfox's resolve to counsel Darian and Keisha about their relationship. Nothing happened there either.  And finally, the sub plot about the Herald's Anda's arrival in the veil. He arrives... And Darian goes off on his adventure... And that's it? There is all this build up and suspense about what Anda will be like... What he will do...And... Nothing. Fizzle.  Further, Snowfire, Darian's adopted brother is almost completely absent in the book after playing such a major role in the first book in the series, he's reduced to a cardboard caricature of himself.<br /> <br />Lastly, there is the entire subplot of Keisha and Darian's relationship. (I hesitate to call it a 'romance' because it wasn't). I thought their relationship wasn't a particularly good one. There wasn't really a decent reason for these two characters to care about eachother.  Keisha seems WAY to insecure, and Darian is completely overconfident. (Did anyone else think this relationship was doomed for failure?)  Neither seem particularly happy with eachother... So why the big push to get them together? Is there some unwritten rule that characters at the end of a trilogy must be married?<br /> <br />While this book left me with an 'unsatisfied, there must be more feeling' I found Lackey's writing style compelling as usual, even if there wasn't a lot of action. I hope that there will be a sequel so we can learn just what happens to Darian and his friends. There is certainly a lot of room for further development.must be married?<BR><BR>While this book left me with an 'unsatisfied, there must be more feeling' I found Lackey's writing style compelling as usual, even if there wasn't a lot of action.I hope that there will be a sequel so we can learn just what happens to Darian and his friends.

Krinata, a loyal servant of the empire, is a debriefing officer for the emperor Zinzik, (A position similar to researcher, as far as I can surmise). When the emperor, an evil man, plots to rid the world of the near immortal Dushau who have helped to found their civilization, Krinata becomes involved inadvertently. Soon it becomes a race against time to rescue the Dushau before its too late.<br />This was truly a fascinating read! The Dushau are a fascinating race, of blue, humanoids who are near-immortal. They possess a telepathic gift (although the Dushau really deny this), and they work in something called an 'oliat' which is a group of Dushau who work together, and have a sort of communal mind.<br />The hero, Jindigar, is a Dushau prince and a rebel. His telepathic gifts make him a really sensitive yet pragmatic type which I found appealing. Krinata is a smart capable non-whiny heroine who makes mistakes but knows how to get things done! Minor characters such as Arlai, the ships AI, and Storm, the Ensyvian were also well done. (I would've loved to have a description of the Ensyvian's, I could never quite figure out what they were supposed to look like)!<br /><br />Lichtenberg writes Science Fiction that you can really sink your teeth into. This is an older book, but better than most modern fiction. I recommend this book for fans of character driven drama, or those who like telepathic man characters! Excellent.	2002-12-05

I hate to give negative reviews, especially in a forum of all positive reviews, (this usually means I will be negged with 'unhelpful votes')  But here is the deal... I didn't like Hidden Riches! Mostly, because I HATED the hero, and the writing was dated. I don't know of any modern women who would or should put up with the treatment that Jedidah Skimmerhorn (terrible name) treats her.<br />Here's the story: Jedidiah Skimmerhorn,  millionaire cop (must all Nora's heros be millionaires?!) whose parents didn't love him enough,  tries to rediscover himself and to escape  a past tragedy by renting  a quiet room in a modest downtown apartment owned by our heroine, miss sunshine Dora Conroy. So far so good. Unfortunately, during his first meeting with the heroine, he slams his door in her face.  I know Nora intended for us to find the hero's rude growls, irritable snapping, 'charming' 'exciting' and 'attractive,' instead Jedidiah comes off as a spoiled baby, who needs his diaper changed.<br />The villain is a cardboard cookie Nora villain, on the insane side, who is an avid collector. When a shipment goes awry and is accidentally shipped to Conroy's shop, instead of his penthouse apartment, he sends one of his flunkies to investigate..<br />I really wanted to like Hidden Riches, but I just couldn't get past the Skimmerhorn character. I don't find abusive men attractive, and Skimmerhorn was abusive enough in once scene to leave bruises on Conroy's arms and throw her up against the wall, ripping her bathrobe.  If I were the heroine I'd sue Skimmerhorn for assault, but of course, Conroy being the gullible loving heroine forgives him.... Yuck......  Nexxxtttt......	2002-11-13

Together with his companions, the Hawkbrothers, and his newfound friend, Keisha, he establishes a settlement for his new community right outside the village. Together, with the villagers, and the Heralds of Valdemar, they prepare to fight their greatest challenge - an invading force of barbarians.<br />While I liked Owl Sight, I found the plot a bit rambling. I did not like the 'switching perspectives' between Darian and Keisha, and there wasn't a lot of action. Also, I felt both Keisha and Darian suffered from 'super hero' syndrome. Both characters are way to mature and perfect to be human, and thus were almost boring.. Darian was at times almost insufferably wise and brilliant, doing everything from lecturing elders, to designing his own settlement, all at the ripe age of 18! (I winced when Darian was giving his teachers relationship and teaching advice &lt;groan>).<br />I was also disappointed to see very little of Snowfire, Darian's mentor. He faded into the background to become just another of Darian's spear-carrier in this books, with no voice of his own. >Sigh&lt;. Overall, a good, but somewhat predictable read.	2002-11-12

Entertaining	Pretty Boy Floyd, is somewhat fictionalized account of the true life of Charles Arthur &quot;Chock&quot; Floyd, the son of Oklahoma farmer and notorious gangster.  I listened to the audio version of this book and it was most impressed, despite having reservations about wanting to hear about gangsters. (Not my usual fare).  I was, however, most impressed with this audiobook. McMurtry and Ossana do a great job of bringing Pretty Boy Floyd to life. Even the minor characters have great personalities, and McMurtry  and Ossana really DO manage to get into Pretty Boy's head.<br />The Story: Charles, &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; is a small-town boy, with country charm, who is married to a young half-Native American woman named Ruby Hargove. They have a son named Jack Dempsey Floyd. When money becomes scarce, Charles headed north looking for work. After trying various jobs, Pretty Boy tries to make money the easy way- by robbing an armored car. What follows is the tale of Floyd's life. You see him get further and further embroiled into his life as a gangster, have affairs with his girlfriends, and watch as he tries to outwit the law.<br />Floyd is consistently portrayed as a charming loveable rogue... An'outlaw' with a good heart, a weakness for women, liquor, and a well-cooked meal. (While I doubt many of Floyd's victims found him quite as so charming) the story worked for me. The novel moved at a brisk pace and was overall, greatly entertaining.  I would recommend this novel for those interested in Gangsters or the life of Pretty Boy Floyd.	2002-11-03

Excellent Characters	Owl Flight is the story of Darian, a precocious teenager, unwillingly apprenticed to mage Justyn after his parents (trappers) fail to return from one of their extended hunting trips. Resenting Justyn and believing him to be incompetent senile old man, Darian 'acts out' by running away and slacking off on his daily chores. This causes trouble with the local villagers who believe Darian does not act appropriately 'grateful  for the charity they have given him. The hostile environment makes Darian wish he could run away from his problems and do as he pleases.<br /><br />Punished by his mentor,  Justyn, for slacking off,  he is sent into the woods one day to gather mushrooms, and his village is attacked by raiding barbarians. Darian is befriended by the Hawkbrothers (a tribalesque group of people), and forms a friendship with Snowfire, a Hawkbrother hunter/scout.<br /><br />Together with his newfound friends Darian must find a way to free the village of Errold's Grove from the ruthless clutches  of the Bear Clan barbarians.<br /><br />While Darian's whining and self-pitying attitude can get annoying at times, I found Darian and his mentor  Snowfire believable. I especially liked Snowfire and the other Hawkbrother characters and would like to learn more about him. I admit, I was pleased to read about a character that was not a herald, and it was nice to learn how some of the more provincial characters view things.  I am anxiously looking forward to reading to picking up a copy of the sequel! Great Work MS. Lackey and Mr. Dixon!	2002-10-29

This is the sequel to Island Tribe, and follows the adventures of tribal leader Kori, and her husband the dreamer, Uroh.  Twelve years have passed since Kori lead the survivors of the Island tribe away from their remote island community and the superstitions of her people. Kori now has two children, elder son Feroh and younger daughter Meiri. While she enjoys the respect and esteem of her people, other things in Kori's life are not going so well. Kori's handsome husband Uroh, has become emotionally distant, and her son Feroh, has become a trouble-maker.<br />The sudden arrival of a tall handsome stranger, Werror, exacerbates relations with her husband and son, and causes her question her abilities as chieftainess. Would Werror make a better chief?  Overcome with doubts, Kori becomes victim to a cruel betrayal. Can Kori overcome her enemies to save her people?<br />I really liked Ocean tribe, perhaps even better than Island tribe. Kori is a strong capable woman, and a believable leader.  In the sequel, we see her struggle with the issues power brings. Can she be a leader and a parent to? Will her husband understand the sacrifices leadership demands? I particularly like the character of Uroh, her husband. It is rare to find a pacifistic dreamer hero in this type of genre. I like how he is supportive of Kori, even when times are hard.  This is a great book. Well worth the investment! I look forward to the sequel.	2002-10-29

Full house is the story of Billie Pearce and her romance with handsome playboy Nick Kaharachek. Billie, a single-mom, school-teacher of the bumbling 'Stephanie Plum' vein meets Nick, during a polo lesson. Nick is smitten by Billie, despite her incompetence at Polo. In an effort to 'woo' her, Nick talks Billie into taking on a boarder - his irritatingly rich cousin Dee Dee- in exchange for free riding lessons. Despite the hassle of having Dee Dee third-wheeling their romance, Billie and Nick hit it off and become engaged almost immediately. (Groan) Together they have a series of madcap adventures.<br />I was really looking forward to reading Full House, but for me Full House felt so contrived it was unenjoyable. Billie and Nick had nothing in common, and the presence of Dee Dee didn't help matters. We saw absolutely nothing of Billie's career as a school teacher, the villian seemed pathetic and sad, and 'tacked on' at the end to add a little last minute suspense. But worse, the novel was just boring and predictable. It lacked the spark of other Evanovich work.<br />If you are looking for a light 'fluffy' read, pick up Full House, otherwise, save your money and go for another Plum book.	2002-10-28

My first Sandra Kitt novel, and certainly not my last	First I have to say, I really liked this book!<br />This is the story a Leah Downey and her love for police officer Jason Horn. When Leah first meets Jason, she thinks he is a drunk, a drifter and feels sorry for him, giving him a cup of coffee. Horn returns later to explain himself and their mild conversations turn to friendship and then romance.<br />Leah, who is seeing an attractive popular man, but who finds him emotionally distant is surprisingly attracted to Horn, even though he is... Anglo and a cop. Leah and Jason are beset from all sides as friends and co-workers attitudes change towards them because they are an interracial couple.<br />Can Leah and Jason's love survive the test of a society which seems determined to undermine them at every turn?<br />I really thought this book was great. Leah was a believable character, torn between fear of committing to someone she wasn't sure about, and Jason, no saint, has trouble putting his troubled past behind him.<br />I really liked the book. Can't recommend it enough. (Even if I I did think that Leah was awfully forgiving of her sister towards the end, but heck, she was in love!) Buy yourself a copy!	2002-10-15

I really liked \\"Trust No One.\\" Especially the character Brody Hawke and his brother Elliot. I mean, who hasn't dreamed of having an identical twin? Their conversations were fun and interesting... Brody is intimidated at having such a cosmopolitan brother, Elliot is surprised by having a brother who is a SEAL. Simply fun.<br />Now for what I didn't like: I really did NOT like the romance being between his brother's fianc&eacute;e and Brody. His brother deserved better than to have Brody steal his fianc&eacute;e, even if Tori was going to call it off, likewise Brody was a jerk to betray his brother like that. Bleh. I also thought Tori's character was very undeveloped. I mean she seemed to serve no purpose other than to be an object for Brody and El to fight over. She was a bit on the spineless side.<br />This was a great book, with exciting gripping characters, even if the Heroine irritated me.	2002-10-15

Don't be put off by the hero's name however! This story was excellent, and unusual. Cora , an orphan, married Luther Briggs, her first husband, little realizing he did not love her. After the marriage, Luther abandons her to live with his Cherokee wife. Rather than pine for him, Cora files for divorce, earning a bad reputation in the process.<br />Enter Jedwin. Jedwin, who is an undertaker, is as unlikely a hero as can be. For one thing, he is kind, gentle and shy,  for another thing, his mother has always hated Cora and made her life miserable.<br />Jedwin enters her life, hoping a liaison with her will improve his `straight arrow' reputation. Believing she is a `fallen woman' he proposes to become her lover in exchange for doing chores and a monthly stipend. Cora is insulted and starts to show him the door, when she decides to allow him to court her... At first to spite his mother, but eventually, because she comes to care for him.<br />This was a really unusual book. Jedwin is an unlikely, but loveable hero. Cora is a smart and practical heroine. I even came to like the secondary romance between Jedwin's mother and the undertaker. If I had to say I didn't like anything about this novel it would be, that the hero allowed his mother to dominate him a little too much for my comfort level. My second complaint about this novel is it is way too short! Otherwise an excellent Americana, well worth the investment.	2002-10-14

He rescues Cloud, who has been imprisoned by Sword Saint, and in exchange, Cloud reveals some pertinent information. A Flame Kylin Beast- a beast none knew existed - killed Wind'sfather. (See issue 1).<br />Hurrying back to the castle, Cloud brashly resumes his affair with Kong-Chi, Frost's wife, unaware that he is seen by Wind. Wind confronts Cloud with an ultimatum. End their affair- or -leave the palace as an exile!  Cloud is prepared to do neither, and challenges Wind to a fight to the death!<br />Wing Shing Ma's art is simply lovely. He portrays the kindly Wind and the violent Cloud perfectly. These are characters you both love and hate. This is a Kung Fu book, but the characters display true emotions. Kong-Chi's infidelity and Frost's silent acknowledgement of the betrayal were heart wrenching. Good Work!<br />My only disappointment was that Cloud's violent temper appears to have grown worse. He seems to get crueler by the book which is sad. I hope we learn WHY Cloud has such a terrible temper, and he somehow manages to get it under control.<br />Overall, another excellent read, with some great coloring my Ma' and his team! I recommend this book, highly, although be warned... Like the other books in this series it is quite violent, and might not be appropriate for anyone but mature readers.	2002-10-13

Heroine Shannon Rose is a 'good girl' college kid, with no friends, no life, and no family ties - in essence a cardboard character. When a college acquaintance enlists her help in researching the 'maypole' for the renaissance faire committee, she reluctantly agrees, little realizing that the research will trigger a series of events which will send her back in time to ancient Ireland.<br />Enter the hero Ian. Ian, an aspiring bard is an appallingly lazy man obsessed with womanizing and avoiding his responsibilities. Fed up with his laziness, his father punishes him by sentencing him to herd cattle for one year. Yes. You read it right folks. Herd cattle(!) As if this were not bad enough, he is also forced to marry a widow named Clodagh.<br />Enter Shannon, who has now succeeded in time traveling back to Ireland. Found by Ian, she is brought back to the fort on the night of Beltane, and forced to marry him as his `Beltane Wife,' before Ian begins his yearlong sentence as a cowherd. They frolic in the hills for a while, before Shannon learns the truth... That Ian is already married to Clodagh. Can their love survive the test of time?<br />I really didn't like this book. I thought Ian was a miserable immature user who never seemed to grow up. I never found him particularly romantic or, desirable. Shannon was a typical romance heroine, with no real personality and no backbone. Some of the descriptions were well written, however many of the characters talked and acted like modern people, despite being set in ancient Ireland. The husband's bigamy was a real turn off for me and poorly handled. Overall... I cannot really recommend this novel. It was disappointing on too many levels	2002-10-12

Snowdrops and Scandalbroth is the story of Miss Kathlyn Partland, a destitute noblewoman who must sell her services as a governess to make ends meet (yeah I know, this has been done to death). The hero, Courtney Chase is a retired soldier, in a unique position.<br />Considered 'unmasculine' by the ton, because, heh, he is a virgin, Courtney is desperate to prove himself, a womanizing 'rake' without compromising his unconventional ideals.. He is saving himself for marriage! So, he hires Kitty to masquerade as his 'mistress,' not realizing that their easy frienship would soon become love!<br />Courtney and Kitty make an interesting and unique couple. Kitty is a smart, pragmatic heroine, and Courtney a reasonable hero. Both seem to make a natural couple.<br />There were a scattering of irritating secondary characters which seemed to pop up now and then... But they did not distract to omuch from the overall read. This was a decent read, especially for a Regency (not my normal reading material). Would recommend this book for those who want a fun read with a unique hero.	2002-10-08

Megan's stories are always well-written, the characters well-drawn out and blistering human.  \\"Fall from Grace\\" was no exception, however, the two romantic leads were less appealing than the characters from her other novels, which was disappointing.<br /> <br />Fall from Grace is the story of \\"Lily\\" AKA \\"Lily the Cat.\\" Lily's parents are killed by the Sharpe gang, and so in an act of kindness (?) , they adopt her. This turns out to be two-edged sword, for while Lily shapes up to be a competent outlaw, she hungers for revenge... And succeeds in getting it when she turns 23.....She betrays the gang to the local sheriff.<br />Tex Sharpe, Lily's husband isn't willing to give up on Lily. He pursues her, and convinces her to return to the gang. Lily agrees... But then tries to shoot him! What follows is a tale of betrayal, love, and reconciliation.  <br />Lily's Mae West style 'bad girl' character was refreshing for this genre. She's an outlaw, a killer, and unrepentant. Her husband Tex, is good-hearted, but kind of naive which I found annoying.. Unfortunately, these characters just didn't mesh well. Lily resented Tex throughout the book. Tex misunderstands her, worries about her, and loves her for no discernable reason since all Lily does is belittle him. Even towards the end, these characters never really come to an understanding, which was unsatisfying.<br /> <br />Overall, I liked the book, it was realistic. But I admit, I got tired of the constant fighting between Sharpe and Lily. This couple was a romantic failure, at least for this reader. Ohwell. Perhaps there will be a sequel?	2002-10-07

But here it is in a nutshell: I HATED the ending.  There, I said it. The ending was awful. Ech! Bleh! Argh.  The ending cost the book a star for me.<br />Other than that. A great book. Cute premise, with some excellent writing by Pershing, but a very disappointing ending - at least for this reader, which is to bad... This could have been a keeper.	2002-10-03

Harpooned by her father's flunkie Ralph, Saeger is kept in a tank below decks for eventual study and sale.  Beth, curious about the new 'fish' her father has captured goes to investigate, only to discover the fish is no fish at all, but  a merman!<br />So far, Saeger's tale is the best in this series. I found Saeger to be charming, romantic and funny, and at times a bit tragic (because of his inability to change). The funny parts were amusing. (I particularly liked the scene with the piranha) and  Sandra Paul managed to breath a great deal of life into Saeger making him a sympathetic and interesting romantic lead (despite his 'mer-ness') and it was for this reason that I gave this novel a 4 star rating.<br />Unfortunately, the other character's were fairly weak. Beth, the heroine  is a nice girl with  no discernable occupation and a vocabulary which seems to consist of &quot;Omigosh&quot; and &quot;Darn.&quot;  She seems to have no purpose in life other than to serve as Saeger's girlfriend, and that was disappointing. Her father, a 'befuddled scientist type' was a caricature, as were his inept assistants.  Nothing new there.<br />Even with these obvious problems, I still was impressed with Paul's writing.  If Paul were to write another, perhaps longer &quot;Merperson&quot; book, I would definitely buy it.	2002-10-01

Their fear of 'old ones' (evil ground spirits) has united the tribe in constant 'appeasement' rituals, and virtually eliminated tribal conflict.<br />Kori, 20, has always been different. She has always questioned the will of the \\"Old Ones,\\" (the evil ground spirits who guard and harass her people) and the will of her mother, the tribe's shaman.<br />Unable to secure a mate because of her 'differentness', a conflict with her mother arises which leaves her an outcast.<br />I really liked this story. While the beginning was rather slow and a little dark (Kori's people's fear of the old ones is at times all-consuming),  Kori was a believable heroine, with a likeable personality. Her struggles to be accepted by her tribe, her mother, were at times heart-wrenching. Her eventual romance with a non-tribal male was well-portrayed.<br />I recommend this novel for fans of 'prehistoric fiction.' You won't be disappointed.	2002-09-30

She is hired by investors to accompany Ben on the voyage, Ben objects to a `female' presence in the crew and the `disruptive' influence she has on his men and his three-year-old daughter Madison. This conflict turns into passion when Ben, unexpectedly finds himself attracted to Kayla, even though, he feels she is `a crackpot' and a liability on the trip. Can Ben overcome his prejudice towards Kayla and learn to love again?<br />I really think this book could've had potential if the plot hadn't been so formulaic. Melissa McClone's writing, was quite touching at spots (especially in the Prologue), and the parts where Kayla  is interacting with the crew. Unfortunately, this novel had several flaws that I feel are worth mentioning.<br />First, Ben Mendoza, is a rude `alpha.' He is almost unforgivable to Kayla in the beginning and his attitude towards women is almost 16th century.  By page thirty I didn't give two figs for Mendoza, or his tragic past, and couldn't fathom why Kayla did either.<br />Kayla herself is a barely `fleshed out' nice girl, with hardly any backstory, who spends the majority of the time on the ship scolding crewmen for using `bad language' in front of  Mendoza's three-year old daughter, painting toenails, and joking around in the mess hall YAWN. Kayla is supposed to be a brilliant research analyst, and we see none of those talents displayed here.<br />This novel would've been great if the author had managed to emotionally hook us with Ben and Kayla romance. Unfortunately the sheer `formulaic quality' of this novel kept me from suspending my disbelief long enough to enjoy it, and like its predecessor the 'mermaid' subplot was barely touched upon. Disappointing.	2002-09-29

Can Kevin convince Dr. Jones to go with him to Santa Barbara to meet his employer Loucan?<br />I'm a big fan of Mermaid stories, but \\"More than Meets the Eye\\" was a disappointing and rather formulaic read.

Kevin and Phoebe barely know each other, when suddenly they are `in love.' When? Why?  I felt more of a dynamic between Loucan and Phoebe when they first meet, than in the entire first 100 pages of Kevin and Phoebe. (Sigh).<br />Further, I wanted to read more about the mermaids, and was disappointed that this plot device wasn't explored until nearly the end of the book.

To make matters worse she has an encounter with a psychotic mob boss and a bumbling attorney who has latched onto her like glue. Toss in her angelic sister Valerie, her best friend Lula and a crazed killer in a bunny suit, and you got another week in the life of Stephanie Plum.<br />I really enjoyed this latest installation of Stephanie Plum. Especially the 'hitman' in the bunny suit. The addition of the character of \\"Klowne\\" was really great, although, the character was very under-utilized in the second half of this book.<br />On the negative side, I  DO think that the Steph-Ranger-Morelli romantic triangle is getting old. Especially since Steph herself prefers Morelli. I think a new love interest would recharge Steph's character and put more tension in Steph's life. I would also LOVE to see a return of Sally Sweet, the transvestite singer from a previous books.<br />Overall, another great addition to the Stephanie Plum legacy! Pass the coffee cake!	2002-09-23

But be warned, the author uses several plot devices you might not like.<br />First, the author tells each chapter from different characters perspectives. This can be annoying, especially when you get to the good parts.<br />Second, this book, while romantic, is not specifically a romance. It's more horror novel with romantic elements, and a `coming of age story' for heroine Tessa.<br />Third, the author narrates the story from `present' day as a tale told by an elderly Alexander. This was a bit tiresome, because there are definite plot elements foreshadowed in Alexander's narration that gave away later parts of the story.<br />Fourth, werewolves are portrayed as an overly superior race, to the point of me wishing to see a few ... Redneck werewolves, just to `balance out' the werewolf `master race.' (Whose society reminded me a bit of Anne Rice's vampire society).<br />That being said, this novel is still the best book I've read in several months. Boyd's strength is in writing characters that live and breath... characters you love and want to shout at when they make stupid mistakes. Halfway through this novel, I found myself rooting for Denis, and despising the aristocratic and clueless Alexander.<br />For those familiar with fairy tales, \\"The Passion\\" Reminds me a great deal of Hans Christian Anderson's classic: \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Many elements, including the love of the mermaid for the handsome human price are reflected here.<br />If you like werewolf novels, this one is sure to please, but don't expect any crude, hairy primitive werewolves in this one. Boyd's werewolves all fly first class, drive limos, eat caviar, and wouldn't be caught dead at [local store].... =-)	2002-09-15

Alright, I hate to be a nay-sayer, in a group filled with such wonderful glowing reviews, but I found this book boring! I was so disappointed, I couldn't even finish this book, and (that for me is rare).<br />This is the story of Davy, a con-man, and his love for Tilda, a 'reformed' painting forger.<br />When Tilda's younger sister inadvertently sells a painting once forged by her, Tilda must steal it back. She and Davey run into eachother in the same closet and 'sparks' inevitably fly.<br />This is my first Jennifer Crusie novel, and so far I am not hugely impressed. I guess, mostly because I expected this novel to be somewhat serious and it was clearly meant to be 'light' reading.<br />Even so, the humorous parts that I read... Weren't that funny.<br />Perhaps, I don't care for novels where the heroes and heroines feel compelled to steal for a living... But, I think I really felt the author was trying to hard to write something witty... And the characters just came off as flat and dysfunctional.<br />I would definitely pick this one in the library rather than purchasing it full price. Otherwise, you might be disappointed.	2002-09-03

Wonderful characters	Neptune's Bride:<br />This is the story of Doctor Geneva Kelsey, marine biologist and her love for a mysterious telepath Jase Guardian.<br />When Geneva, discovers a species of sea mammal, long thought to be extinct, Jase, is dispatched from the mystical `sanctuary' wild-life preserve within the Bermuda triangle, to bring them back. As bargaining tool, Jase offers to disclose the whereabouts of Geneva's missing twin brother, Thomas.<br />At first, believing Jase is a well-intentioned nut ball; Geneva tried to get away from him. Eventually, Jase's persistence pays off, and he convinces her that he is a genuine article.<br />I thought this was a cute romance, with some clever dialog, and a great plot. Despite the `environmental' themes Duquette managed to pull it off without being unnecessarily preachy and heavy-handed, (which was a concern in this type of novel).<br />Likes: I love the way telepathy was handled, and the minor characters were portrayed realistically, especially Thomas and the Uber-Guardian. Also, I thought Duquette was particularly good at writing dialog. She truly has a gift.<br />Peeves:<br />I would've preferred a less Anglo looking heroine on the cover, since the heroine in the book was supposed to be Spanish/Inuit, and the cover model looks white.<br />Also, I found it hard to believe the main heroine was a mature woman in her thirties and had established NO life for herself outside of her work. For once, I'd like to see a romance novel about a heroine who is happy and has a successful social life and a career she is not so easily willing to part with.	2002-09-01

Great Characters	Storm Riders 4 is the ongoing adventures of Wind and Cloud, and their relationship to their villainous stepfather Lord Conquer.<br />In this latest issue, Wind is featured more, (which is great for me, since I am a big fan of Wind!), and we learn several secrets about the noble swordsman's past.<br />Driven to excel at martial arts due to his loyalty for Conquer who he views as a father, Wind is nevertheless lonely within the Fighter's association.  In this issue, we learn that Wind has secretly been corresponding with a penpal, (a beautiful woman who once saved his life). In these letters, Wind pours out his love for her, and in this issue, they agree to meet.<br />Unfortunately,  Trouble, as usual, follows Wind and Cloud. Separated because of an argument, Wind and Cloud, are ambushed separately on the way back from Conquer's keep with disastrous consequences.<br />For fans of Wind, this is a great issue. You learn much more about the gentle swordsman and the inner turmoil he suffers.<br />For those of you who haven't read Stormriders: This is an epic tale of good and evil set in a 'alternative fantasy version' of  Imperial China, and follows the Adventures of Wind and Cloud, and the rest of the adopted children of Lord Conquer.<br />A warning: This book is violent, and contains depictions of death, mayhem, and killing, and of course lots and lots of fighting!  If you are squeamish, you might not like this book.<br />For everyone else: I highly recommend this for those who like Kung Fu drama or a graphic novel of epic proportions, with many characters and a romantic subplot. Overall, an excellent, thrilling read sure to delight readers.	2002-08-30

This is the story of Tatiana, a young Soviet girl, and her love for a Soldier name Alex. Alex has been dating, Tatiana's older sister, Dasha. Because of the closeness between Dasha and Tatiana, Tatiana is reluctant to admit the truth about her secret love for Alex. This creates numerous problems for all parties concerned.<br />To make matters worse, the Germans have attacked Russia, and war is about break out.<br />I really enjoyed this novel. It really does live up to its reputation as being one of the most popular books released this year.<br />My only problem with it, is I disliked the fact that Alex and Tatiana were not truthful with Dasha about their relationship. Also, Tatiana, was quite young, and I prefer heroines who are older.<br />Overall, a great book with some amazing descriptions of war and life in Soviet Russia.	2002-08-23

I was really looking forward to this book, after hearing how highly recommended it was.<br />Unfortunately, I made the mistake of thinking this was a 'serious' historical romance novel. Instead, what we get is a.... Adulterous hero, 'tortured' by being the only 'available' bachelor in town. And heroine, Priscilla, so prim and proper she came off as a caricature. This is really a book on the 'lighter side' of reading.<br />While doubtless, this novel will appeal to some, I found the adulterous hero... Well, a bit on the icky side, and the prim heroine, while amusing, grated on my nerves. The dialog, as well, seemed too modern for an &quot;Historical&quot; novel.<br />I would recommend this novel to those who are looking for a light humorous read. Readers looking for serious Historical should look elsewhere...	2002-08-12

She has two cats and a dog which can communicate with each other and are smarter than most humans. This sounds like a cute premise, but is sort of confusing...There really ARE a ton of characters who are alike,and prior knowledge of this series is mandatory.<br />Harry, runs about doing her 'day to day' work, while trying to solve a mystery. Many characters drop in and out, including Harry's ex Fair.<br />Overall, I thought the mystery was fairly predictable, the cats 'omniscience' a little overdone, and Harry's lack of character growth a little numbing. And what was up with the 'chain letter?' That plot thread went nowhere.<br />I will definitely try another sneaky pie brown novel.... but this one seemed average and a little difficult for this 'new reader' to get into. Maybe a 'new romance' would liven up Harry's life?	2002-08-07

And I've liked ALL of feehan's other Carpathian books, including Dark Gold.<br />First, I really wanted to read more about the character's relationship. Instead there was a long convoluted subplot involving the main villain which dominated too much of the book.<br />Second, Jaxxon (hate the name, reminds me of Michael Jackson, or Dax from DS9, and the double xx's just kept leaping out at me on every page),  and Lucien didn't have the same 'spark' as some of the other characters in this series.<br />Third, given how powerful Lucien is, I was really, really surprised he didn't blow the villain out of the water on page three. Instead Lucien procrastinates doing anything about him until three-quarters through the book. Very unrealistic Carpathian behavior if you ask me.<br />Fourth, Where is Gabriel? Lucien's twin was absent during most of the book, and I kept wondering WHY. If Gabriel suspected his brother was having trouble with the villain, he would certainly call Julian, or one of the other Carpathian heavies. Instead... He does nothing. Very out of character. Especially considering how close these two are supposed to be.<br />The good news, is Feehan manages to squeeze several decent romantic scenes in between hunts for the evil stalker. But even these scenes fell flat for me, because I kept expecting Lucien or Jaxx to \\"Do\\" something about the villain.<br />This novel would've been vastly improved with less attention paid to the villain, and more character development between Jaxx and Lucien.  Even at the end of this book, I was never quite sure Jaxx and Lucien had enough commonalities to forge a strong relationship.	2002-07-28

I was disappointed with this latest book \\"Face the Fire\\" By Nora Roberts. I do not know how such an exciting premise, and storyline could fall so flat, but Face manages to do so.<br />Face the fire, was like anticipating drinking a latte... Only to find out the milk had gone sour.<br />Don't get me wrong. I love Nora. But her last two books have lacked her usual spark.<br />Mia Devlin, wiccan guru, is destined to save the island and all she holds dear, if she can only open her heart to love. Sam Logan (how many romance novel heroes are called Logan or Sam? ), business-man-wiccan, returns to the island, to reclaim his birthright.... The magic inn. What follows is a clash of wills, as Logan struggles to convince Mia that he loves her... despite walking out on her ten years ago.<br />Mia, as a character suffers from 'superman' syndrome. She is too powerful, too smart, and too ...... \\"Too Everything..\\" in my opinion.<br />Sam, is the same character as half a dozen Robert's men (Cam from the Chesapeake Bay series for example), except, with the added twist that he is a practicing witch. I would've liked to see Sam be different, perhaps more sensitive because of his witchiness and selkie heritage. Instead, Sam is no more enlightened (and is perhaps more clueless) than the average guy.<br />There were plot threads in this book that went nowhere, and ended abruptly. The part about the book signing and the authoress?  What's up with that?<br />Overall, a good, but not great novel by Nora. If you wish to read a better Wiccan series by Nora, pick up the Donovan Legacy, you won't be disappointed	2002-07-15

Eric the bard is back, with a new tale of his adventures in New York. This time, Eric has taken on an apprentice. Bard, Hosea, and is once again battling his nemesis dark lord Aerune<br />I really liked this book, especially the focus on my two favorite characters' Beth and Kory. I liked the chase scenes in Vegas, the comical parts in the \\"Goblin Market\\" and the cameos from other characters. The authors have such great imaginations!<br />The only quibble I had with this book was the inclusion of the guardians... I don't know why, but the subplot just bored me. I hope to see less of the \\"Guardian\\" and Guardian House, in future works.<br />I'm also not entirely sure I care for the character of Ria, either. Ria seems to dominate almost every scene she's in.... And I prefer the other characters personalities a great deal more! Eric could do better!<br />Overall, another excellent work, a light hearted fantasy, and great summer reading.	2002-06-24

So Wide the Sky, is the tale of Cassie, Morgan, an anglo woman who has spent her life in captivity by the Cheyenne and the Kiowa.<br />Cassie, bartered back to the Whites, because she is barren, has learned to live as an Indian, but now must learn to adapt to Anglo society.<br />I liked this book, because it gave a fairly well-balanced view of Native Americans. Indians are not portrayed as 'noble savages' or as 'vicious killers,' but are believable human characters.<br />Cassie's love for Drew and Hunter for different reasons, was also believable... However, neither of the male leads really grabbed me. Drew was overcome with rage, because of the Indian Attack which killed his parents, Hunter, the preferred lover had virtually no personality, and lacked definition. Cassie, stood out as the most well-defined and believable character.<br />This is another great character-driven 'prairie romance' for those who like to read about what life was like in the old west, but the romantic element was a little weak.<br />Naava	2002-06-19

This story is simple and sweet, graduates to thoughtful, insightful, and ends... On an abrupt note.<br />Michael views the world differently than others, and has the ability to open the eyes of those around him. While others take Nature for granted, Michael views the natural world and creatures within it with respect, wonder and love.<br />This is a wonderful book. I cannot say enough good things about it... But... My only disappointment with this novel is that in the last fifty pages it disintegrates from a serious romance to romantic silliness....<br />The author introduces a fantastic story line, and rushes through some major plot developments, to bring about a rather abrupt 'happy ending,' which hit a sour note with me.<br />I would much preferred a slower ending, without the long drawn out last minute (silly) plot complication.<br />Overall, still, an excellent read...

I was disappointed in this book after reading the great reviews printed here. This is not a &quot;How to Draw&quot; book at all, but focuses much more on the publishing/layout end of the comic book biz. Nothing like its  title suggests:  &quot;How to Draw and Sell Comic Books.&quot; Sigh. What a let down.<br />The art instruction inside is minimal, and most of the art is fully completed and consists of comic panels and pages from comic books. Most of which, are well done - but failed to enlighten me.<br />For those interested in reading about comics, this might be the way to go. For those looking to learn drawing techniques, you'll  probably be disappointed in this book. I know I was.	2002-06-07

Unlike other 'how to draw' animal books, the artist shows the initial sketch and the finished painting. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning to draw Canids.<br />This book is not for beginners though. It definately assumes you know how to draw and does not instruct you in basic drawing technique. That being said, the book is designed to prep you for painting some of nature's most fantastic creatures... wolves.<br />My only quibble with this book, is that I would've like to see more sketches and 'turn around' style pictures of wolves sketched from various angles, and perhaps a sketch started at the beginning and progressing through to its finished stage. I learn a lot from drawing in this manner, and it is a challenge to draw the faces of wolves and place their ears correctly. (my dog is a poor substitute) GRIN.<br />This is a great book.

Its nice to have another strong female lead, especially one who is in Law Enforcement.<br />What I was disappointed with, however, was how this character de-volved make one mistake after another...

Believing himself guilty of murder, Jess leaves Tennessee to carve a name for himself out west.<br />Struggling to find work, Jess meets Joe Bob, a former slave, and the unlikely pair team up, to have several adventures before finally deciding to ranch cattle.<br />I very much liked the relationship between Jess an Anglo, and Joe Bob, and African American. The struggles Joe Bob must face to be accepted, and the friendship between the two leads was heartwarming and at times humorous. Jess is the hardened tough member of the duo and Joe Bob is very much the brains and the heart. Together they make a great team.<br />Towards the end, the novel was a tad too predictable, at least for this reader, but it was still quite entertaining. I recommend this for lovers of western fiction everywhere, and think this would make a great film.	2002-05-26

I half expect Qwill to tackle world hunger next. (LOL).<br />Too many riches, too much idle time, have made Qwill a dull boy.. Or at least a rich eccentric one.<br />Ms. Braun needs to breath some little back into this character by having him tackle some real world adversity.<br />I loved the setting in this book, but the plot went nowhere and Qwill relied overmuch on his cats to solve parts of the mystery for him.

To make matters worse,  over 3/4 of the book is filled with finished drawings. If  you are the sort  of artist who learns by looking at finished illustrations, this book is for you.

I love all of Nora's books, but this was not her best works.<br />Three Fates is the story of a trio of Irish siblings and their American lovers as they fight to reclaim three ancient statues.<br />Nora Roberts has a distinct gift for writing character driven plots, but the Three Fates did not showcase this ability. Instead we get three implausible love stories crammed into a single volume, with not enough attention paid to each couple.<br />Several characters even fall into the 'unlikable' category, (at least for me). Ex-Ballet-dancer-turned-stripper (Cleo's) constant sarcasm and phrases such as 'slick' etc. Grated on my nerves. Gideon, and Mal, the two brothers had no personality and were virtually interchangeable. Jack was a cardboard cutout. Also,I was surprised at how quickly all the characters jumped into bed with their respective partners. There was harldly any romance at all! =-(<br /><br />The best character in the series was Tia. The slightly anxious mythologist. Nora should have written the book about Tia and Mal, and left out the four other characters.<br />Overall, a disappointing read.

What I liked most about this novel, is it is told primarily from the male POV, and is quite hilarious.<br />By no means is this a serious book, it nevertheless amusing, romantic and sweet all in one!<br />Hill manages to make the role-reversal quite believable. Adam is 'smitten' by Tyra, despite the fact that she abducts him from his crumbling castle at swordpoint. Tyra is a tough woman, who scarcely believes Adam may love her or that she is loveable.<br />A great read when you are in the mood for a funny and charming romance with a bit of a twist.

Mostly,  because there was a certain lack of... Dynamic between the two main leads.<br />Phil former gang member, (hard to believe) and advertising agent...is almost... Feminine. He is obsessed with clothes, gucci, armani,mineral water and fine dining almost more than he is with Sybil, his girlfriend. He throws temper tantrums, and refuses to admit his love for Sybil, and picks pointless arguments with his brothers... Errr...Not my idea of hero material...<br />Sybil, emotionally scarred, because here parents 'did not love her' is more sympathetic, but amazingly naive, for someone trained to be a psychologist and sociologist. She makes a few 'stupid mistakes' which she spends the book agonizing and apologizing, and repenting for.<br />Overall, not the best in the Quinn series, but contains a couple really good scenes which makes it an enjoyable read, but not a keeper, at least for this reader.	2002-05-01

Little does she know that Reed knows nothing about the letters, and the letters were truly written by Reed's aging father in an elaborate scheme to get him to finally marry.<br />While this plot is certainly nothing new, Jill manages to breath new life into an otherwise tired plotline, with her clear writing style and attention to historic detail.<br />What I like most about Jill's writing is she manages to portray the predjudices and attitudes of the time without the 'politically correct' glasses worn by many romance authors. She simply states things as they are without making the heroine a radical reformer or an instrument of social change.<br />My only real quibble with this book was I thought the hero Reed was a little to self-pitying as a character. If he isn't running away from his problems... IE, his dominating father, his wife who used him for his money, his son's problems acclimating to Anglo culture. He stands around making frustrating 'noises' and using the heroine. I would've much preferred  the hero to be more mature and responsible.<br />Surprisingly, the story is interesting enough to read, despite the under whelming hero.

Kero chooses to become a warrior.<br />Alienated from her family, and friends, Kero battles evil with the help of her mystical sword Need.<br />I liked this book because Kero is believable and likeable. She is not entirely selfless (She is a mercenary after all) and does not seek to 'change the world,' instead; this is the adventure of a likeable woman in an extraordinary fantasy setting.<br />One of Lackey's best books!	2002-03-31

It follows the story of Elena Michaels, a journalist as she struggles with her personal life, and her secret life as a 'werewolf.'<br />Characterization is Armstrong's strong point. Elena, Jeremy, Nick and Clay are believable characters. They are werewolves without being 'super human.' I particularly like the relationship between Elena and the pack, and how Clay does not patronize her because she is female, (sigh) which occurs in so many other novels.<br />I listened to the audio-version, and the reader is dead on with the voices and characters. Way to go! I can barely wait for the sequel.	2002-03-17

I'm now 30, and think this book is one of the best ever written! =-) This is the story of the Seal tribe King Rad and his best friend Dannoc.<br />Rad is facing a dilemna... Save his newfound friend, accused of murder, or free him and defy the laws of the tribe. To make matters worse, the animals from the forests surrounding their windswept coastal village seem to be mysteriously disappearing.  With game scarce the villagers are growing hungry, and the other tribes are talking of raiding and taking what they want.<br />The friendship between Rad and Dannoc is very moving. Their quest to save their village and the animals has an epic quality. I recommend this novel for people who like books about heart-moving friendships. Springer writes like a dream.<br />Don't forget to read MindBond and Godbond, the sequels.	2002-03-17

Instead we get a lot of 'figure drawing' style sketches accompanied by an occasional full color illo. Not bad, but not what I'm looking for in a drawing instruction book.<br />This book needs more diagram style drawings with art measured in head lengths (muscles) we women have them you know...(Grin). And step-by-step instructions. Regretfully, this book is composed of nearly finished illustrations. The \\"turnarounds\\" that exist are small and amateurly done (page 12 &amp; 13), and should reflect MORE  body types and have better details in the arms and legs.<br />Also the artist seems to have trouble drawing arms. The arms seem disproportionate, and at times are drawn so long, they appear almost ape-like, other times they hang at awkward angles as thought the artist doesn't know quite what to do with them.<br />Additionally, many of the illustrations in this book, look like they were done in figure drawing class, and don't look like comic book women.<br />The sections on faces needed to be expanded and improved. Women are drawn with staring eyes and open snarling expressions, making them look like they are suffering from a bad hangover.<br />What I DID like was the fabulous use of color. Some art is quite good, such as the art used to head each chapter.<br />While this book is not likely to provide you with anything new in the way of art reference, it has some decent artwork overall and may be able to give the beginning artist some insiration.	2002-03-17

This is the second book I've read by Madeline Baker.<br />Kaylynn Summers is a white woman, fleeing an abusive husband. She is captured and enslaved by Cheyenne Indians who treat her better than her husband. She is won in a horse race by Jesse who becomes her new 'owner.' What follows is a typical, `run away until I realize I love you' style romance, with nothing but predictable villains, plot twists and ending.<br />I would really like to see Madeline Baker write a historical novel. Her talent really shines when writing about the Indians and their way of life. What didn't work in this novel, which is ironic, is the romance.<br />I found Kaylynn, a shallow superficial heroine, more concerned about her broken nails than anything else. The hero, Yellow Thunder was more worried about his scarred face than romancing the heroine. Both characters seemed to have a lot of 'growing up' to do. The only, vaguely appealing character was a minor character named Ravenhawk, who was quite a bit more interesting than Yellow Thunder.<br />For me, this book fails and disappoints, mainly because it is very close to what a good novel should be. If Madeline would only concentrate on making her main characters more mature and appealing, I would be an avid fan.	2002-03-01

Alienated by society, church, and mostly other women, these women eked out a living in the only manner they knew how... As prostitutes.<br />Universally reviled, the'soiled doves' often turned to gambling, alcohol and drugs. Few married and those that did, more often than not were pimped by their 'lowlife' husbands. Prostitution was a life that few women could escape and seemed to often end in loneliness and despair.<br />This book explores the lives of prostitutes by telling the stories of several famous prostitutes, madams and the times they lived in.<br />A 'must read' book for the authors of historical fiction, and for those interested in exploring the lives of women in the North West.	2002-02-14

Lakota Love Song is the story of the love between white captive Kaylee Matthews and a wounded Lakota warrior Blue Hawk (why are all American Indians in romance novels called Hawk?)<br />Against the advice of her mother and best friend Randy, naive Kaylee tends to the injured Blue Hawk, and nurses him back to health. In exchange, (surprise) Blue Hawk kidnaps her to fulfill a vision that this \\"White Woman\\" Hold's the \\"Answer\\" for him and his people.<br />What follows is, a somewhat predictable romp through the west with romance being the inevitable result.<br />For me, two things did not click about this novel. First, the author's choice of dialog in several sections was just too stereotypical: Phrases like: \\"The only one whose gonna get hurt is that murderin' redskin\\" and the hero's constant stilted pronunciation of the heroine's name as \\"Kay-Lee\\" jolted me out of the story at several crucial points.<br />Secondly, the heroine Kaylee was just too naive and innocent to be enjoyable. I would've much preferred a freethinking and intelligent heroine. Romantic tension was lacking because Blue Hawk was always MUCH wiser and MUCH more knowledgeable about everything.<br />Overall, a predictable story, with several interesting bits, and some good research and minor characters, but nothing new by any means.	2002-02-12

Nora Roberts is the &quot;Martha Stewart&quot; of Romance Novels... And typically I love everything she writes... (Do you sense a 'but' coming?') If so, read on...<br />The latest installment of the 'three sisters' trilogy features the life of Deputy Ripley Todd. Deputy Todd, a skeptic, with a traumatic magic-related childhood experience, has refused to use her powers ever since. Enter the hero... Mac Booke. Mac is an 'absent-minded professor type' whose investigations into the paranormal has somehow landed him on Three Sister's Island.<br />As usual, Nora has the setting, the characters, and the culture of a small town down pat. Her main and side characters are endearing and engaging.. Particularly, her hero, Mac Booke.<br />But... In my opinion, her heroine, Ripley, just didn't seem to 'fit in' to a novel with a paranormal setting.<br />Ripley (okay, I kept thinking 'believe it or not') seems like she would be more at home in a novel with a small-town murder-mystery theme... Than as the third sister in a coven of witches.<br />While I suspect Nora, wanted us to feel sympathetic towards Rip for her reluctance to practice magick, instead I was frustrated by her pig-headedness. I found it hard to believe that someone like Mia wouldn't have given her a `kick in the pants' or confronting her about her problem /ages/ ago.<br />My second problem with this novel was the villain.  Bringing back the possessed ex-boyfriend from the first book was an unwelcome surprise. With so many challenges the girls might face, do we need to bring a possessed mental patient into the picture? This seemed heavy handed, even for Nora, who is quite notable for creating, exciting and believable villains.<br />Overall, the inclusion of Mac, and the return to `three sisters island' made this book worth reading... But I had to deduct one star for the `evil-ex-husband ' and for the `Ripley' character which I just could noth sympathize with.	2002-01-13

This is the latest in Christine Feehan's amazing Dark Series. The plot revolves around legendary Carpathian hunter, Gabriel and his evil vampiric-turned brother Lucien. The heroine, Francesca, is a carpathian woman who is Gabriels' lifemate. I was very touched by Christine's portrayal of Gabriel grieving for his lost brother, and the memories he had of Lucien. Gabriel and Lucien have an extremely close and relationship, which was heart-warming and unusual in a romance novel. Francesca's independance and self-asuredness, made her a likeable heroine. I really had a sense of these characters as individuals, with needs and desires and not just cardboard cutouts. (Please don't be offended) but, my only quibble at all with this book is that I never got the feel that I was 'in France' even though this book were set there. The characters talked and acted like American's and I would've like to seen a more European flavor to this novel.<br />Otherwise, I give it 5 stars for Gabriel alone! I can't wait for the next books and especially, Lucien's story!!	2002-01-04

While ghost stories aren't my preferred reading material, I usually read anything written by Nora Roberts. Nora has a way of writing male characters that makes them believeable and yet fit the romance archetype. Declan Fitzgerald is no exception! Although I was dubious at first, Nora writes a great reincarnation story. (I won't go into detail, as I don't want to spoil readers with the surprise, but suffice to say it is quite a plot twist, Grin).  My favorite character in the book was Remy who steals the show with his 'southern charm.' If I could suggest improvement, I wish Declan wasn't another 'rich unmarried bachelor.' I'd like to see Nora write more about handsome dynamic men of average means... And leave the trustfund babies for authors who can't write... Overall A_+++ keep 'em coming Nora!!!	2001-12-30

This book was an engaging and lighthearted fantasy romance with several clever twists. It focuses on the romance of Fallon and Ciaran, who the heroine believes is the manifestation of an ancient Irish hero. Although, I enjoyed this novel a great deal, I rated it only four stars because of the heroine Fallon. She came off as a bit too brattish and self-pitying for my tastes. The manner in which she treated her brother got on my nerves after awhile. The hero, Ciaran, and villian Lionel, were quite genuine and endearing however, and worth the price of the book.	2001-12-30

I recently purchased this book, and I found it quite useful, and the artwork and instructions quite good. I  especially found the art of Al Rio quite helpful. For me, Al's art pages (5, 8-23, 25, 52-61, 116) was worth the cost of the book alone. Constructive criticism: I wish they hadn't shrunk the facial diagrams on page 14-15 so small that they were difficult to see. This is useful and beautiful art reference. Also, although I enjoy Chris Hart's writing, his artwork, which dominates the second half, is not as good as the other artists ands is excessively cartoony.  I really wish Al Rio or Grant Miehm did more of the interior drawing. I also would like to see more 'turnarounds' (such as are done on the top of 18-19) for anatomical reference. The ones that are included are small, but good. Overall, though this book is another great in a series, and has many good pictures for artists of all skill levels.

Unfortunately, this novel was a bit weak, even for her.<br />Numerous problem  areas beset this latest edition to the Donovon Legacy. Weak plots.  Characters use magick in fantastic ways without mortal  limits almost to  the point of ridiculousness.<br />Her heroine Rowan was bland, easily led and  had poor self esteem. About the only thing interesting about Rowan was her  name. Even her inner dialog was a touch dull. I was mildly irritated that  in order to get some measure of self esteem she had to learn to use magick.  (I don't have a problem with magick, but I do think its a poor substitute  for normal self empowerment).<br />Liam embodies 'dark brooding alpha' and  spends a lot of time brooding about.  Even when visiting his cousins he  seems a touch on the cold side. Also his powers were a bit overblown.  (Teleporting them both to Monterey etc., without even sweat on his brow) I  would like to have seen Liam a little less self absorbed and controlling or  at least have Liam pitted with a more feisty heroine who could stand up to  him when he starts getting overbearing and domineering.<br />Overall, a two  star rating for a book of Nora's is a four star rating for anyone else's.  While well worth reading, this one was not quite up to her usual standard	1999-10-26

Krinard's writing has a level of detail and characterization that is  uncommon in the romance industry and which I found vastly  appealing.<br />Strengths: Krinard made you really feel for Kieran and his  troubled life. Alex's struggles to overcome self esteem and past trauma  issues were moving. Even the villain's struggles were gripping. I enjoyed  the level of detail revealed in Alex's work as a wolf researcher. The  environmental themes were insightful and not preachy.<br />I particularly  liked the scenes when Alex was Shadow.Very cute.<br />Problems: I really had  no problems with this book. Since it is a romance the main focus was on the  two main characters and their struggles, I couldn't help but find myself  curious about the other sub plot characters and what was going on with  them.. I would like to have seen Kieran explore more of his people's  heritage, preferably in the company of his own kind, as he had barely begun  the rode towards self acceptance and healing at the end of this book.<br />Overall, an excellent read..	1999-10-25

But Misleading	Gilthanas is one of my favorite characters and I loved the idea that we'd finally get to read a novel about his adventures..... Too bad it isn't a NOVEL. What it is a collection of short stories with a Gilthanas theme to  them. I am not much of a fan of a short stories (I read too quickly to  enjoy them), but these tales were well written for the most part, even  though they don't appear to be in any particular order.<br />The novel also  has a fairly large supplement of reference material for a card game in the  back. I would definatly be interested if these folks wrote a traditional  novel with a Gilthanas theme, but this collection of short stories was too  disjointed for me to fully enjoy.	1999-08-15
2813114:US	52821302	R1W3HOEIJ7OQBC	0515124346	438888270	Eternal Sea (Haunting Hearts)	Books	2	2	4	N	Y	Bland and predictable.....	Alice Alfonsi's novel of ghostly romance failed to capture my interest, despite a rather interesting premise. Heroine Miranda Burke (20), heiress is a spoiled rich girl with too much time on her hands and a passion for  sailing. Hero Eric Wolfe (30) is the ghost of a murdered captain doomed to  sail the ocean rescuing drowning sailors and foundering ships.<br />The  writing in Eternal Sea was disjointed and bland. The heroine was silly and  immature and in between quarrels with her aunt,  must deal with the  overtures of Josh, her cousin by marriage and a predictable subplot to  steal her trust fund. I kept wondering why Miranda just didn't leave to go  to California or head east instead moping around the house. Doesn't Miranda  have a job?<br />The romance between Miranda and Wolfe lacked credibility.  Miranda's impulsive spoiled nature and lack of direction made me wonder  what Wolfe sees in her. Wolfe is equally untrue to his character, easily  swayed by Miranda to give up his career<br />The most dissapointing thing  about this novel was the unresolved plot threads. Too many subplots filled  with sterotypical underdeveloped minor characters made me want to ask  &quot;who edited this junk anyow?&quot;<br />I would have liked to see more  character development, a more mature heroine and less goofy &quot;I'm so  eeevvvvillll-&quot; minor characters.	1999-08-09

Main character Abdel was a sociopath whose love of killing and general self-centered and selfish personality  overshadowed any positive  traits he might have. Gorion (Abdel's guardian) is barely dead in the  grave, before Abdel kills a drunk in a bar in an  excessive use of  dimwitted machismo.<br />More dissapointing than the treatment of the hero was  the treatment of the subplot characters. Romantic couple Khalid and Jahiera  were reduced to  a mockery of themselves.  Khalid, instead of being loyal  and diffident was portrayed as a womanizing rake (!) and sarcastic and  agressive Jaheira was  reduced to a simpering ninny slinking around in a  nightgown after Abdel. <br />Battlescenes were gorry and choppy, with Abdel  delighting in killing and mayhem, doing credit to his evil father. I find  it hard to imagine Abdel  survives with such an inhumane attitude...  Wait....Who was the bad guy again?<br />Spare yourself the pain and skip this  book. It couldn't be worse.	1999-08-03

Characterization and snappy dialog are Sandra Hill's strong points. I fall in love with ALL of Sandra's men, they are strong yet vulnerable and  Etienne is no exception.<br />I particularly liked the repartee between  Etienne and Cain and Abel.  (How about a romance using either of these  characters?)<br />The only downside to this novel was Ginny WOULD NOT SHUT UP.  God love Sandra, who is the goddess of dialog... But this is the third  novel where her heroines talk talk talk. I would especially expect a  psychologist to listen more and talk less, but NO Ginny could power a boat  with her constant thoughtless gabbing.<br />Despite the motormouth heroine,  Sandra's book is an excellent-and funny- read. Well worth the cost of the  book.	1999-08-02

Unusual characters, well developed plot, and a fascinating H&amp;H. Theresa Weir is exceptionally gifted with the ability to describe scenes in a way that is  different than others.<br />This is the first Romance Novel I have read where  the Heroine has an eating disorder. Kudos are in order for addressing a  socially relative topic in a sensitive manner.  Overall Excellent.<br />Note:  Personally, I would have preferred a cover that had something to do with  the novel....  If I hadn't heard this novel was so good I would've  completely overlooked it because of the plain cover. Cupid seems completely  out of tune with the  &quot;Psychic Suspense&quot; flavor of this novel.  Perhaps a Key would've been more appropriate.	1999-07-08

For such a cute premise this book was sorely lacking. Parts that were supposed to be humorous were poorly written and lacked spark. The hero was an alpha boor. The only engaging characater  was Ma Recklaw and she wasn't interesting enough for me to finish the book.  I couldn't get past page fifty. If you want to read a humourous book, read  the \\"Reluctant Viking\\" or save your money for other reads. Overall a  dissapointment.	1999-07-02

I enjoyed Jeff Crook's Rose and the Skull, so much I finished it in nearly a day. Jeff managed to keep the novel serious and at times preserve the fantasy flavor of previous Dragonlance titles.<br />Character development is  Jeff's strength.. I sympathized with nearly all the characters for various  reasons. Particularly likeed the Dark Elf Valian.  (Would LOVE to see a  future novel with him or Lady Jessica or Liam.)<br />Glad the novel didn't  revert to cheesy romance or stray too far from the Dragonlance mythos.<br />High Points:<br />Can't critique this novel without mentioning the cover  art. The cover art is great and really attracted me to this book, at least  initially. (Recently Dragonlance novel covers have had really bad art....)  Not so here... No bulbish-nosed-jaundiced looking-dwarfish-humans grace  this cover, thank you. Artist Elmore portrays not one but ten of the books  characters in a poignant scene that was really quite emotional. Quite a  stretch from the usual 'action' or 'posing swords person' scene. The only  bad thing is Valian is on the spine and hard to see! (Sigh).<br />Back to the  Author:<br />Jeff deserves kudos for his excellent work with a multiple  character perspective. I really felt each of the characters had an  individual personality and individual thought patterns.  Jeff handled the  multiple characters without going overboard and getting too hung up on  details. Good Job!<br />The plot was unique and interesting.<br />I liked the  changes in the Solamnics. Sometimes the Knights can be characterized as a  little to stern and preachy and Jeff does this well...<br />Excellent  handling of the bad guys. Really enjoyed their chacterization and charm.  Nothing like a charming villain and Lord Tohr \was\ charming.<br />Pet  Peeves:<br />I only have minor peeves with this novel.<br />Mostly: Ditch the  gully dwarves.<br />Didn't care for the plot thread involving the Gully Dwarf  inheriting the Solamnic Castle, (kind of stupid), or the long extended  scenes with the gully dwarves going to 'Town'.<br /> With Gully Dwarves....  Less is more....  =-)<br />Overall, a rousing good read in the realm of  Dragonlance with a great new author!! I hope to see many more to come.or the long extended  scenes with the gully dwarves going to 'Town'. <br /> With Gully Dwarves....

(Perhaps this is why I am so disappointed by this latest effort). Susan possesses excellent characterization skills and an ability to draw the  reader in with vivid fantasy description and mythic plots.<br />Unfortunately,  The Wind-Witch, suffered from a predictable plot which was weak and  repetitive. Minor characters were stereotypical and unbudgingly  boring.<br />Main characters Druyan and Kellis, although interesting were  predictable and their relationship held no surprises.<br />The Good:<br />Druyan  is a refreshingly bright and restrained heroine with a head on her  shoulders. She is not so utterly willful as to be irritating.<br />The  Bad:<br />More about Valadan... Surely a 80 year old stallion has something  more interesting to do than follow Druyan around like a lost  puppy.<br />Kellis' constant moping and lack of assertiveness was annoying. I  would've liked to see him develop a backbone at least sometime before the  end of the book.<br />Constant thread of &quot;Druyan going to warn the forces  of good about evil raiders&quot; made we half wish the raiders would  succeed in their invasion plans. How many times did she do this anyhow?  Wasn't there anything more proactive to be done, other than to wait around  for Kellis to predict something?<br />Susan Dexter writes best in an epic  'quest' style fantasy when her characters aren't anchored down to a  stationary point.<br />Overall, I'd save your money and read the &quot;Prince  of Ill Luck&quot; So far, the best one in the series.	1999-05-07

I could really empathize with them and had no trouble visualizing them as they struggled in the ups and downs of this predictable plot.<br />THE  BAD:<br />GET OVER IT ALREADY! Raine and Joseph's tragic parting 12 years ago  and the subsequent death of her unborn child was rather heavy handed and  dragged as an underlying sub plot throughout the book was depressing and a  real downer.<br />Also, the heroine was far too self absorbed. Would have  liked to see her more empathetic to others, such as Joseph's brother Benny.  Her 'poor me' attitude made me wonder why Joe wanted her at all. I much  prefer clever heroines who are sensitive to the world around them and the  needs of others.<br />Joe's difficulty in understanding or dealing with his  wastrel brother Benny rang false for me. Joe appeared to me to be smarter  than that. Joes avoidance in confronting Benny and Benny's refusal to grow  up showed a lack of growth in either character which I found unsatisfying.  Would have liked to see the brothers come to terms with each other.<br />The  overall worse part of this book, was the ending....  It was far too  predictable, appeared rushed, and lacked the spark that the book initially  promised.<br />Overall, a predictable formulaic read with a couple good  characters which don't live up to their full potential.	1999-05-02

Too bad they didn't do it here.<br />Good things:<br />The novel was easy to read, the plot developed smoothly and they have a flair for description and  suspense.<br />Criticism:<br />Unfortunately, the plot went nowhere, the  characters were unsympathetic and the constantly switching perspectives did  nothing for me.<br />Who was the hero/heroine? What was their mission? So  much was unclear in the mish mash of multiple-perspective  storytelling.<br />Further there were several disturbingly violent scenes in  this book which I found distasteful and unnecessary except for shock  value.<br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but the most  die-hard shadowrun fan. Its bound to be a disappointment.	1999-04-18

However, the over-reliance on magic and the alternatively  ridiculous/horrific villian made it hard to take seriously at times. Some  parts were vague and lacked direction. The purpose of the cats quest seemed  lost amidst other underlying sub-plots.<br />Book would've been better with a  tighter plot and less reliance on the supernatural..	1999-04-14
