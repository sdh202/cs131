Perhaps this was inevitable, simply a struggle of a powerful and technologically advanced civilization moving aside another, but there were colonists from time to time who showed sympathy and understanding, and even championed the Indian cause.  Among the most important of these was William Johnson, a man with many family connections in Ireland but little money who came here in about 1738 and was for the years before the American Revolution the voice of the Six Nations of Indians.  One of the reasons he was successful was that he became a member of the Iroquois, and in _White Savage: William Johnson and the Invention of America_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), Irish writer Fintan O'Toole makes the claim that Johnson's success in straddling colonial and Indian cultures was because he had already had an \\"amphibian\\" background of conversion to Protestantism and adoption of a British identity.  Whatever the cause, he was a gifted and adaptable fellow, with his adaptability becoming internationally significant, and this biography is a good source of information about pre-Revolutionary times.<br /><br />Johnson was a shrewd businessman and land speculator.  He became adept at trading furs with the Indians, and  always had respect for his partners in trade and dealt fairly with them.  He had an instinctive respect for Mohawk culture, and began to make political alliances as well as commercial.  He became prosperous and influential enough within a decade that he went through the ceremony of becoming a sachem himself, and was given the name Waraghiyagey, meaning \\"a man who undertakes great things,\\" or more pithily, \\"Chief Much Business.\\"  He did not at all give up his own culture.  In fact, he was at pains to make a nostalgic display of being a Gaelic chieftain when he was at home.  He was an untraditional family man, with a common-law European wife, an Iroquois wife, and many mistresses from both worlds.  He sired children from different women, but was responsible in caring for them and remembering them in his will.  He became the most important intermediary between the Indians and the British.  He fought against prejudiced politicians and soldiers who dismissed the Indians as mere savages who had no rights.  One English governor expressed a simple policy toward the Indians: exterminate every one, possibly by smallpox-infected blankets.  Johnson got England to remove him, but this was one victory when there were many setbacks.  Johnson knew how the tribes worked, but time and again London would ignore his advice or break the word he had given to the Indians.  Johnson's efforts to keep Indian goodwill during the wars against the French were crucial.<br /><br />Johnson died just before the American Revolution.  He probably would have sided with the British; although he had sympathy for those who were protesting such impositions as the Stamp Tax, he thought their agitation \\"the clamorous conduct of a few pretended Patriots.\\"  His remaining family, of both cultures, kept the Tory position, and John Adams wrote of them, \\"Rascals!  They deserve Extermination.\\"  Johnson's carefully crafted partnerships with the Iroquois did not have a lasting effect, but O'Toole has found Johnson in James Fenimore Cooper's _The Last of the Mohicans_ and in Robert Louis Stevenson's _The Master Of Ballantrae_, as well as in Benjamin West's famous painting of the dying Wolfe, victorious at Quebec.  Johnson was nowhere near Wolfe at the time, but it doesn't matter.  He early became a frontier ideal, and his presence can be felt in _Dances with Wolves_ or _Little Big Man_.  His archetypal persona is his lasting legacy.uois wife, and many mistresses from both worlds.

There have been those who have taken these stories at face value, most famously the late Harvard psychiatrist John Mack, who said that there was no evidence that such abductees were telling anything but the truth.  Skeptics and most of his fellow academics scoffed.  Now Susan Clancy, a Harvard psychologist, has written about her own researches into participants in the phenomenon.  _Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens_ (Harvard University Press) explains such abductions in a way that skeptics will appreciate.  However, Clancy also shows respect for the abductees she investigated, appreciating their viewpoints and explaining without condescension how such ideas came to be.  The book will convert few abductees from their belief system (and Clancy shows why such a belief system is so satisfying and firmly held), but it goes far to show that they are not stupid or psychotic and they are not just seeking publicity.<br /><br />As far as the physical reality of such abductions, Clancy (unlike Mack) is firmly in the skeptics' corner, and gives reasons to be sure that no such events are happening, and if they are happening, extraordinary evidence is needed make the events credible; no one has come close to producing such evidence.  But she points out, the proper scientific response is not, \\"Why investigate abduction since it is not really happening?\\" but rather \\"What sort of people are reporting being abducted, and why?\\"  And it was this she set out to do; after she got approved by Harvard's Institutional Review Board to do the research, she started running newspaper ads: \\"Have you been abducted by aliens?\\", and giving a number which abductees could call.  She describes the fifty subjects as \\"generally warm, open, trusting, and friendly\\"; they liked fantasy, tarot, and astrology.  But there are plenty of people who have such characteristics.  Why do some become convinced they have actually been abducted?  The startling answer is that they have first hand experiences of abduction that registered in their minds as surely as last night's dinner registered in yours.  In the abductees' cases, the memories seem to come from sleep paralysis, a limbo state between sleeping and waking that is not at all uncommon.  Before flying saucer films, there was sleep paralysis, and those suffering from it reported interacting with Satan, witches, or dragons; nowadays, it's extraterrestrials.<br /><br />But why would someone want to foster memories that are so obviously painful?  \\"The contact these people have had with aliens doesn't just feel real - it feels transformative.\\"  The abductees reported that their abductions were the most traumatic experiences in their lives, but also the most positive.  They felt changed, improved, more at peace, more at one with the universe as they experienced it.  All of them denied they would choose not to be abducted, if they could go back again.  In a provocative final section, Clancy demonstrates that Saint Teresa's account of her encounter with an angel is very close to accounts abductees give of their own encounters.  She shows that abductees get the same benefits of meaning, reassurance, and spirituality that believers in ordinary religions do.  _Abducted_ is a small book, a wonderful primer for those who have never had the abduction experience themselves but are interested in the often strange inner experiences of their fellow humans.  Clancy writes with wit and with genuine sympathy and understanding of her subjects, and readers will find them far less strange than they had initially seemed.they liked fantasy, tarot, and astrology.

22611:US	50895620	R2D438VKJZP8DR	0300106998	610224494	Lost for Words: The Hidden History of the Oxford English Dictionary	Books	5	12	13	N	N	The History of the OED from Its Proofs	It is always a joy to use the _Oxford English Dictionary_.  I haven't looked into my microphotographed version of the first edition in years, since I got access to the _OED_ online, which is a splendidly faster and better way to use the wealth of its words.  By folklore (and by original intent) the _OED_ was supposed to include every English word.  Indeed, looking at the vast accumulation the _OED_ presents, with its lovely objective history of each word and illustrative quotations, it is easy to imagine that they are all there, and that they were accumulated by lexicographical boffins who just kept putting in everything they found, ordered and alphabetized it, and issued it in print.  The near-perfection of the _OED_ does not give much room in itself for researching just how it was made.  Lynda Mugglestone has been able to give a unique history of this unique enterprise in _Lost for Words: The Hidden History of the Oxford English Dictionary_ (Yale University Press) because of what she says was a chance discovery; however, it is easy to understand that since she has edited _The Oxford History of the English Language_ and written _Lexicography and the OED_, it is clear that chance favored her prepared mind.  She \\"chanced\\" upon proof sheets from the first fascicle of the first edition of the _OED_, dating from 1883, a section recording proofs of the words from \\"abandon\\" to \\"Anglo-Saxon\\".  The proofs did not have the cool, immaculate presentation of a final form; they \\"were instead marked by a mass of scrawled annotations and suggested deletions.\\"  And these handwritten additions were often acerbic.  \\"Useless\\" was the remark by the word \\"anencephaloid\\", and \\"Rubbish!  Mere tradesman's make-up\\" adorns \\"anerithmoscope\\".  Clearly, the cool columns of the finished _OED_ were hiding contention, and a tale of all-too-human endeavor.  Mugglestone has brilliantly used the evidence of the proofs to examine just how the monumental work came to be.<br /><br />Much of this book is about the determination of what to leave out of the dictionary.  Mugglestone writes, \\"Version by version the final text was built up, a process of dispute and negotiation, accretion and dissent.\\"  The idealistic goal of including every English word proved to be impossible for many reasons.  The _OED_ could not, because of the Victorian times in which it was born, include all the naughty words, for instance.  But there were much bigger problems that demonstrate the reaches of lexicographical philosophy.  If a famous author (Shakespeare is great for this) invents a nonce word, one used for just one instance, does that get included?  What if the author is not so famous?  What about words that are recently borrowed from other languages but have not made themselves at home?  What about scientific words?  There were so many of them, and some were so obscure; it particularly pained the chief editor, James Murray, to leave them out, as his youthful drive to self-education led him through botany, entomology, and geology.  What about words that just seem too obscure?  Alongside the listing for \\"opossum\\", one critical reader of the proofs wrote, \\"This is the sort of word which one should save on.\\"  Murray disregarded the advice that time, but had to accept many more deletions than he wanted: \\"No one knows as well as I do, how it grieves one to have to do this,\\" he complained.  There is a great deal of pithy humor in the letters between the editors as they try to get the definitions right.  When Murray was first presented with a proposed definition \\"greasy pole: a pole rubbed with grease to make it harder to climb or cling to,\\" he suggested that it be amended with \\"Used as a frequent object of diversion at sport etc.\\" because, he explained, \\"If something of this kind is not added it looks as if people were so keen on climbing poles that they had to be kept at a distance by the use of grease.\\"<br /><br />Murray would have been amazed at the dictionary in its current on-line incarnation.  The process of deciding what words to include still goes on, of course, but without delegates to complain that each new entry takes more space and more time until the dictionary is complete.  While the web-based version still has its pressures and costs, Mugglestone has produced an entertaining picture of how the first version was produced under constraints of column inches that simply do not affect the current version (just throw in a couple more memory chips).  I was thrown to the _OED_ repeatedly by this account of the struggle to get the great book out, and the dutiful men who made it happen by fifty years of close attention to detail; I did so each time with increased admiration for this ultimate in English language tools.ne incarnation.

When I move in my library to my recliner to read, Sammy will get up from wherever he is to jump on the recliner's footstool and nap.  He does not do so to get attention, for I don't thank him or pet him for doing so, and he has not gained in comfort, for he has usually abandoned a comfortable place on the sofa in order to walk over and jump on the footstool which has no more cushioning.  He simply finds it more comfortable to be next to his human; I am complimented by this opinion, and I like him all the more for it, every time he joins me in this fashion.  Sammy's behavior in this instance, and his behavior and that of my other dogs in many other instances, were on my mind as I read _First Friend: A History of Dogs and Humans_ (St. Martin's Press) by Katherine M. Rogers.  Rogers does not include her own anecdotes with the book, but obviously loves dogs (her book is dedicated to her shepherd / retriever mix).  This does not keep her from seeing them clearly; she disdains those who see dogs as equals, though she gives many examples of the impulse.  Eugene O'Neill, for instance, wrote an epitaph for the family Dalmatian which praised \\"the only one of our children who has not disillusioned us.\\"  Without regarding dogs as furry, four-legged humans, however, there is much to admire in them, and much to admire about the mutually satisfying relationship between the two species.<br /><br />Dogs and humans have been closely associated for millennia; the earliest dog fossil dates from 12000 BCE, and there is a grave from 10000 BCE in Israel that contains the skeleton of an elderly woman buried with a pup.  It is clear that humans first found early wolfish dogs helpful, in scavenging and hunting, and humans selected dogs that were obedient and easy to be around.  Samuel Johnson was behind his mid-eighteenth century times when he included only two roles for dogs in his _Dictionary_: \\"The larger sort are used as a guard; the less for sports.\\"  There was disapproval that dogs should take any other role.  The work ethic came partially from Christianity.  St. Thomas Aquinas indicated that since God gave man dominion over animals, man could do what he wanted with them, especially since we could not have true fellowship with creatures that could not reason or attain eternal life.  As late as the mid-nineteenth century, Pope Pius IX would not permit in Rome a society against cruelty to animals because such an organization might suggest that humans had duties toward animals.  Descartes systematized Aquinas to teach that soulless animals were mere machines, and didn't really feel anything; this did nothing for the hapless dogs taken up by the vivisectionists or the bull- or bear-baiters.  Samuel Johnson denounced such treatment, but it took the secular utilitarian Jeremy Bentham to destroy the religious foundations upon which the treatment was founded; a dog is more rational and more able to communicate than a newborn baby, he reasoned, and even if not, \\"the question is not, Can they _reason_?  nor, Can they _talk_?  but Can they _suffer_?\\"<br /><br />Humans cannot do anything perfectly, and mistreatment of dogs in history, and currently through puppy mills, is a theme here, but not a large one, because their partnership with us has been generally happy.  Rogers gives scores of examples of famous people, especially literary ones, who loved their dogs.  For example, Byron ended an epitaph on the marble monument of his dog Boatswain, \\"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise; / I never knew but one, - and here he lies.\\"  She gives many examples of dogs in literature, sometimes used mawkishly, but often with great subtlety.  A classic example is Odysseus returning home to find that only his aging hound Argus remembers him.  Jane Austen didn't concentrate on her characters' dogs, but made them revealing.  Sleek sporting dogs are owned by shallow gentlemen, and the pug of themindless Lady Bertram in _Mansfield Park_ gets more attention from her mistress than do any of her family members.  There are pictures reproduced here of dogs in painting and sculpture, behaving through the centuries as dogs always have, looking pert, pretty, and friendly.  Toward the end of the book is a section on dogs as equals, emphasizing that people have come to recognize explicitly that dogs do have rights; the famous trainer Barbara Woodhouse maintained that dogs were fully family members and \\"should have the same consideration as any other family member... within reason.\\"  But realistically, Rogers writes that we have a partnership between significantly different species, based partly on dependency and self interest on both sides, and no less loving or meaningful for that.  Anyone who loves dogs will find much to enjoy here, and if you are one of the unfortunates that do not love dogs, no book will reform you.f the mindless Lady Bertram in _Mansfield Park_ gets more attention from her mistress than do any of her family members.

He was a poet, explorer, linguist, soldier, and translator, with remarkable accomplishments in each of these fields.  The best biography of this astonishing and energetic man is still _The Devil Drives_ by Fawn Brodie, but in _The Highly Civilized Man: Richard Burton and the Victorian World_ (Harvard), Dane Kennedy has written something else.  His book covers aspects of this multi-faceted man who was busy all his life making his own legend, but who is revealed here as \\"very much a man of his time, a product of nineteenth-century Britain and its imperial encounter with the world.\\"  Kennedy traces the sources of the intellect behind Burton's many efforts, even his famous physical feats such as his pilgrimage in disguise to Mecca or his role in finding the source of the Nile.  Among other things, Burton was, as the chapter headings here classify him, an Orientalist, a relativist, a racist, and a sexologist, and Kennedy has taken a useful look at all these roles.<br /><br />The different chapters with their themes cover Burton's life in a more-or-less chronological way.  Burton had a genius for languages and would eventually become fluent in perhaps a couple of dozen of them.  His first foreign assignment was to the British East India Company, and although Burton sought glory in battle, his contribution was really to increase the knowledge of the land, the language, and the people.  He took his capacity for imitation of other cultures to its most famous exercise in making the hajj in 1853.  As Kennedy points out, there was no reason for any disguise; he could have simply have asserted his belief in Islam (a freethinker, he always did value the societal strengths of Islam, and he considered Christian missionaries to be on a misconceived quest) and joined the flood of foreigners in the pilgrimage.  But this would not serve his purposes.  A convert to Islam (no matter of what degree of sincerity, or how loosely attached to the Church of England) would be outcast from respectable society, preventing him from becoming a national hero and limiting sales of his great _Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah_.  Burton's racism was a product of his time, and of his travels in Africa; he respected African cultures, even if he felt Negroes to be inferior and incapable of improvement.  Kennedy makes the case that Burton had a relativist conception of culture, but such relativism did not encompass any struggle for improvement of political rights.  Burton's value of other cultures included his view of their acceptance of sexuality, an acceptance he found lacking in his own country.  Kennedy explains that with publication of his translations of the _Kama Sutra_, _The Perfumed Garden_, and especially _The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night_, Burton intended to subvert his nation's \\"purity forces.\\"  While Burton wrote that the _Nights_ was not fit for women to read, he filled it with strong and independent female characters who exhibited the sort of sexual desire women were supposed to keep hidden.  Burton wanted to change British sexual morality, and his views would have grated against the current \\"just say no\\" philosophy.  \\"Shall we ever understand,\\" he sighed, \\"that ignorance is not innocence?\\"<br /><br />Kennedy makes the case that not only was Burton remarkable in the many aspects of his efforts, he was eager to \\"advance the larger epistemological quest to understand, explain, and classify difference.\\"  He thus informed Victorian debates on race, religion, and sexuality, debates that are continuing into our own contentious times.

If the name does not ring a bell, it is strongly recommended that you pick up _The Knife Man: The Extraordinary Life and Times of John Hunter, Father of Modern Surgery_ (Broadway Books) by Wendy Moore.  Not just a genius in surgical technique and innovator of scientific experiment to guide surgical choices, he was a brilliant anatomist of other species as well, he was an attentive teacher, and he set up a museum that demonstrated the now accepted views of the origins of life and the age of the Earth.  He was constantly attentive to animal behavior and physiology and his curiosity never stopped.  A mainstay to his friends, he was also willful and irascible, and made enemies easily, one of the reasons he got limited credit during his lifetime for his new ways of thinking.  Moore's book is an exhilarating view of a foolhardy, energetic, innovative, and brilliant man.<br /><br />John Hunter was born in 1728 in Scotland.  He left school at thirteen, and left Oxford after just two months.  He instead followed his older brother William to London to help in William's anatomy school in Covent Garden.  He would dissect thousands of bodies, and was well acquainted with the \\"resurrection men\\", the grave robbers who provided fresh, or maybe not so fresh, specimens.  Hunter's reliance on observation and experiment put him squarely against the medical establishment, which had insisted on relying on Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen, \\"preferring to bleed, blister, and purge their patients to early graves.\\"  He alienated his fellow surgeons by insisting that surgery was always the last step that should be taken, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  His innovations in surgery include teaching (from his days as a naval surgeon) that musket balls entering the body were best left where they were, if possible; digging them out did more damage than the bullet itself.  He knew the value of using a placebo when testing a medicine's powers.  He made the first experimentation (on dogs) to show what the lymphatic system did.  Not only was he not above dealing with the resurrection men, but he tricked the friends of Charles Byrne (\\"The Irish Giant\\") into burying a huge casket of rocks, while the giant's body went to the anatomical table.  He married well, a woman poet who kept salons; they lived in different worlds, and he designed a house that would accommodate society at the front and resurrection men at the back.  (Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have based Jekyll and Hyde on the idea of this structure.)  He was always eager to get to his research rooms instead of socializing, but an observer said of the course-talking Scot that he was not polished or refined, \\"but from originality of thought and earnestness of mind he was extremely agreeable in conversation.\\"  He loved keeping strange animals, and loved dissecting them when they died.  He drove a cart pulled by three zebus, curly-horned Asian buffaloes, and alarmed his neighbors by using it as regular transportation.  He may have been the inspiration for Doctor Dolittle.  Wendy Moore has done a spectacular job of bringing him and his times to us.  _The Knife Man_ has many gruesome patches that are hard to take, from descriptions of surgery without anesthesia, to experiments on hapless dogs, to the business of the cadaver trade.

At a time when his play _The Importance of Being Earnest_ was delivering its initial laughter on the London stage, Oscar was arrested for his homosexuality, imprisoned, and ruined.  In his last years, he never stopped making people laugh, but he never wrote for humor again, and he died at forty-six.  As an outstanding literary figure of his age and a real celebrity, he deserves and has gotten fine biographies, especially that of Richard Ellmann in 1988.  But Oscar was more than an author and celebrity.  Neil McKenna's new book, _The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography_ (Basic Books) looks not only at Oscar's homosexuality, but at his commitment to the cause of the rights of homosexuals.  \\"Gay Rights\\" in our time may still be controversial, but no one is shocked to learn that there is such a movement.  In Oscar's time, homosexuality was criminal, a crime some thought worse than murder, and to have insisted on legal and social rights for homosexuals would have instantly brought on all the ostracism the Victorians could muster.  Nonetheless, along with being unable to repress his own homosexuality, Oscar was unable to refrain from flaunting it, making it at least a subtext within his works, and campaigning in his fictional prose and poems for acceptance of homosexuality as a way of life.  Oscar was a sexual revolutionary, a leader of others in the cause, and this large and well-researched biography concentrates on this aspect of an astonishingly complex, flawed, and lovable figure.<br /><br />Oscar's short life was entirely encompassed within the reign of Queen Victoria, a time when the first homosexuals were coming out, often in the Uranian cause, that being the term by which he (and eventually Oscar's cohorts) would designate themselves.  Toward the end of the 1870s, Aestheticism promoted a new gospel of beauty through art, idealism, and politics, and Oscar and others turned to this cause as well, with the idealism and attention to beauty permanently identified with the Uranian cause.  The movement had nothing like an elected leadership, but since Oscar wrote and was widely quoted, and since he wore his tonsure and clothes in the most exuberantly Aesthetic fashion, he was a beacon followed by many.  Oscar married when he was thirty, and had two sons, but the marriage was a failure.  Like many homosexuals, have been seeking marriage as a \\"cure\\".  He was bored by marriage, but invigorated by the lust, frustration, and irritation that his great love Lord Alfred Douglas (\\"Bosie\\") gave him through the rest of his life.  The two of them shared mountains of fine food, oceans of champagne, and battalions of lovers; McKenna's descriptions of Oscar's sexual appetites (anatomical details are not spared) are positively heroic.  McKenna shows that in his ill-judged counterattacks on Queensbury, Bosie's father, Oscar was acting out \\"both an expression of his love for Bosie and an article of his Uranian faith,\\" making him a martyr for love and for homosexual expression as well.  He had chances to flee before his prosecution, and not only could he not abandon Bosie, but, as he wrote, \\"To have altered my life would have been to have admitted that Uranian love is ignoble.\\"<br /><br />We think of homosexuality in different terms now, but Oscar's battles have been largely won.  There was no overt struggle for gay rights in his time, but even so, Oscar's efforts in the cause have been underestimated until now.  He famously said, \\"I have put my genius into my life but only my talent into my work.\\"  The genius into life led inevitably to tragedy, and this is a great tragic story, the kind Oscar would have appreciated.  He also would have appreciated the book's concentration on how he lived in his unparalleled way, always to excess.  McKenna's is the book to read to bring Oscar the reformer and martyr to our times.thers turned to this cause as well, with the idealism and attention to beauty permanently identified with the Uranian cause.

If you have never seen Grant Wood's famous \\"American Gothic\\" in its original oil on beaverboard incarnation at the Art Institute of Chicago, you have seen it in reproduction, and even more often in parody.  It has inspired praise as art or as satire or as realism or as social commentary, and condemnation for all that, too.  Grant Wood himself was rather tight-lipped about it, but in _American Gothic: A Life of America's Most Famous Painting_ (Norton) Steven Biel has looked at the painting in many different ways.  He has not shown what the painting means; no one could do that.  He has shown what different generations and schools of thought have made of it, and it is clear that the painting has inspired plenty of careful thought as well as raucous takeoffs.  Not bad for a couple of dull old farmers in a frame.<br /><br />Biel first examines the originals the artist used in composing his painting.  The house, with its clapboard siding and gothic window, actually exists.  It is on Route 16 in Eldon, Iowa, and Wood conceived of the painting when he drove by the house in 1930.  Wood used models for his two subjects, neither of whom posed in front of the house, and neither of whom posed together, and neither of whom was a farmer.  The woman was Wood's sister Nan, whose face was too rounded so he lengthened it.  The man was Byron McKeeby, an Eldon dentist.  Wood knew the type of faces he wanted, and he knew the clothes, too, ordering a \\"prim, colonial print\\" apron and overalls from a mail order house in Chicago.  Wood himself never specified that he had composed the picture as a satire, and made conflicting remarks about his intent, but the years of the Depression seemed to reinforce the image of the couple in the painting four-square hard-workers.  It has been endlessly parodied.  Mickey and Minnie Mouse have struck the pose, as have Barbie and Ken and the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.  When Johnny Carson on \\"The Tonight Show\\" held up an image of the couple in swimwear, Wood's sister was not amused, sued, and won a small settlement; larger suits against such outlets as _Hustler_ have been unsuccessful.  Biel reviews some of the laws involved in copyright and parody, and reveals that the copyright of the painting itself is a matter of legal murkiness.<br /><br />Biel's book is great fun, not only as it increases understanding of the painting, but as explanation of parts of American social history in the twentieth century.  The painting is an enigmatic work that either symbolizes or satirizes American rural wholesomeness, and despite the certainty of qualified authorities here quoted on either side of the question, the real meaning of the painting will always be up for debate.  Biel says we can't be certain what Wood intended, but even if we could, \\"The painting's meanings have much more to do with viewers' perceptions than with his intentions.\\"  Those who read this entertaining and often funny book will have their perceptions clarified..

There are worse diseases, more painful ones, more numerous ones, and many more contagious ones, but leprosy was a horror of its own.  This was largely because leprosy was visible; blotchy skin, bloated face, extremities dissolving away.  Lepers had more problems in that they lost their sight, but more particularly they lost their sense of touch, and with it the capacity to feel pain, the blessing in disguise that protects us from the world's blows.  It is a terrible disease, but the horror it inspired in others made it unique.  In _A Disease Apart: Leprosy in the Modern World_ (St. Martin's Press), Tony Gould shows that in the past couple of hundred years, the disease has lost its capacity to shock.  It still exists, but there are good treatments and we know that sufferers need not be objects of fear or horror, and that they are certainly not victims of some sort of curse from gods of any type.  Gould has not pointedly drawn comparisons to AIDS in our own time, but the similar arc of social reaction to the disease is clear.<br /><br />Much of what people know about leprosy comes from the Bible, and it certainly inspired the missionaries in their efforts against the disease, but probably those missionaries were fighting a different one than that known in Old Testament times and locales.  The involvement of Christianity by means of missionaries to sufferers is a theme throughout this book.  One victim himself wrote, \\"There is no mission to the tubercular, no mission to the diabetics, no mission to syphilitics.... there seems to be some special reward for working with 'lepers'.\\"  Such missions are not now fashionable, and we know missionaries are not an unalloyed force for good.  Gould has focused in on one region after another to tell histories that all include the cruel management of sufferers and the eventual freeing of them to more enlightened ways.  Perhaps the most famous is Father Damien, the Belgian priest who ministered to lepers in Hawaii from 1873 to his death from leprosy in 1889.  An American Protestant missionary met him there, and wrote a private posthumous letter critical of Father Damien (\\"He was not a pure man in his relations with women, and the leprosy of which he died should be attributed to his vices and carelessness.\\") which the recipient published.  Damien's cause was taken up by another previous visitor to Molokai, none other than Robert Louis Stevenson.  The controversy only swelled interest in the colony and made Damien a martyr and a figurehead for fundraising.<br /><br />Leper colonies were not only in far away, impoverished places full of people with dark skin.  The American version was in a lovely place, if a little swampy, called Carville, Louisiana.  Huge oaks, songbirds, and gorgeous flowering trees made it a place of inspiring natural beauty.  \\"It should have been a tonic to the soul.  Except that we were fenced in.\\"  So wrote Stanley Stein, a Jewish pharmacist from Texas who edited the patients' publication _The Star_.  He was the bane of the U.S. Public Health Service, always campaigning in a spirited American fashion for more rights.  The campaign worked, as gradually patients were allowed more time on the outside, and the fences that had held them were taken down.  Stein became a star himself, touring the country and hobnobbing with the likes of Tallulah Bankhead.  He died in 1967, but Carville still exists as does his paper.  The facility was formally closed as a leprosarium in 1999, but some with the disease still live there; having been isolated all their lives, they fear trying to live in the outside world, although they could do so with which much less stigma due to Stein's campaign.  Gould shows that this has been the pattern in one locale after another as scientific evaluation of leprosy as a disease has shown that it isn't anything more than a disease, and not a very dangerous one at that, especially now.  There is a contradiction, though, in that sufferers and healers who insist that it is just a disease are taking away its special status.  The special status may have been founded on fear, but take it away and the focus on treatment and rehabilitation may be lost, especially in poor countries with other diseases to fight.  It is one of the many paradoxes in an engaging and moving book.pecially now.

The trials didn't last long; the public quickly turned away from this mistaken view of religion and justice.  The governmental and judicial officers responsible went on to other things, but they did not apologize, except in one instance.  In _Judge Sewall's Apology: The Salem Witch Trials and the Forming of an American Conscience_ (Fourth Estate), Richard Francis has not just told the story of the trials again, but has given a biography of a remarkable man based mostly on Sewall's diary.  In doing so, he has illustrated the period and the styles of thought of the time, bringing colonial Puritanism into intimate focus with details that have previously been unavailable.<br /><br />A respected member of the community, he was appointed to be one of nine judges at the witch trials which resulted in the judicial murder of twenty people.  The witch craze was short-lived.  The public quickly began to doubt that the community was handling Satan's evil in the right way.  Officially, there was a call to ask pardon for the errors of 1692, and in 1696 Cotton Mather himself was called upon to draw up a proclamation for a fast to ask God's pardon.  Mather, who had himself participated in the trials, made a long list of evils and errors, including a little insertion about how \\"Hardships were brought upon Innocent persons\\".  During the next year, inspired by hearing his son read Matthew 12:7 (\\"But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless\\"), Sewall contemplated what he had done.  There had been apologies for the witch trials from other officials, but they tended to seek contrition while blaming others, or to blame ignorance or \\"being under the power of a strong and general Delusion.\\"  Sewall's apology was different.  It would be too much to ask that he took on our modern understanding of delusions; he knew that there was a Devil working among his neighbors, but he refused any longer to accept that Satan was trying to colonize the colonies, admitting only that Satan was whipping up widespread fear.  His confession, written out and read aloud by his minister to their congregation, puts no blame on people, situations, or Satan.  It admitted his own guilt, and that he desired \\"to take the Blame & Shame of it\\" upon himself.<br /><br />Sewall emerges from these pages as a bit of a prig; what puritan wouldn't?  He rejected the celebration of holy days, and was grumpy about such frivolity as April Fool's Day.  It seems that in 1708 he had been a victim of a \\"Your shoes are unbuckled\\" prank (contemporary wits use the \\"shoelace untied\\" version), and wrote to a schoolmaster, \\"If you think it convenient, as I hope you will, Insinuat into your Scholars, the defiling and provoking nature of such a Foolish practice: and take them off from it.\\"  He was led by his religion to reject slavery, although many of his neighbors disagreed.  While there is a chapter here on his anti-slavery campaign, there is also one on his campaign against periwigs, which horrified him.  He railed against others \\"wigg'd and powder'd with pretence.\\"  He wrote a little obituary of a friend which praises his piety and strength, but concludes with the decisive tribute, \\"He abominated periwigs.\\"  There are so many comments in the diary that throw light upon how daily life was lived; one time he returns home  to find that the chimney had caught fire, but this was so common an occurrence, he remarks that it \\"made a great Uproar, as usual.\\"  The final, funny chapters have to do with his becoming a widower and pursuing widows; he may have been a Puritan, but life was to be lived.  This is a welcome portrait, full of quotations from the diary, which excels in demonstrating the Puritan philosophy as manifest in a remarkable individual who is well worth knowing.remarkable individual who is well worth knowing.  <br />	2005-09-06

Often we spice sexual prejudices with the additional understanding that things are getting worse and the behavior of others is getting more extreme.  This is often a form of nostalgia for some sort of \\"good old days\\" when people stayed virgins until they were married and then stuck to their marriage vows afterwards.  Such days are not now, and they never were.  New evidence of this is in _Lascivious Bodies: A Sexual History of the Eighteenth Century_ (Atlantic Books) by Julie Peakman, a saucy and entertaining romp through British sexuality in just another profligate age.  Peakman is a fully qualified scholar who has done prodigious research, and while this is a fine historical reference book, it will also be a fine amusement for those who are interested in styles of sexual behavior or the unchanging peculiarities of their fellow humans.  \\"Sex was pushed as the greatest diversion in town in eighteenth-century London,\\" Peakman writes, \\"seeing it, doing it, or talking about it.\\"  Time and again in this volume one realizes that some things never change.<br /><br />Of course, fashions change in sex, and some of the activities here seem quaint.  Peakman discusses the accepted practice of husbands beating their wives, to be distinguished from erotic beatings, which underwent a vogue at the time, inspired by French pornography, which in turn was sparked by feelings against Catholicism and its flagellants.  Birching was a frequent punishment in schools, and some men seem to have retained a nostalgic enthusiasm for it.  Lt-Gen. Sir Eyre Coote in 1815 \\"was charged with indecent conduct after having been caught in a boys' school with his breeches down, asking the boys to birch him.\\"  He could have avoided the calumny by hiring a prostitute to administer such discipline.  One Susan Brockway related that a client \\"offered her ten shillings if she would get a pennyworth of rods to whip him 'and make him a good boy.'\\"  Patents were even considered for \\"flogging machines\\" which were not devices for delivering mechanical blows, but rather contraptions upon which a naked man could be strapped for the duration of his treatment.  Peakman enjoys enormously writing about the sex societies of the time; there seems to be nothing like them in our own times, or perhaps contemporary ones have better secrecy.  Sir Francis Dashwood set up his Hell-fire Club in an abandoned abbey that he restored, and he and his club members (\\"The Order of the Knights of St. Francis\\") enjoyed lampooning religion, especially Catholicism.  They dressed as monks, and the women dressed as nuns, and they enjoyed eating, drinking and reveling together in licentious manner.  The far stranger Beggar's Benison in Scotland had its merchant members masturbating together upon a silver platter or enjoying the performances of paid strippers.<br /><br />There is wide-ranging activity between these covers.  Peakman discusses male and female homosexuality, the dangerous hobby of asphyxiation for erotic purposes, sexually transmitted diseases and their treatments, cross dressers (including women pirates and soldiers), foot-fetishism, masturbation, erotic toys (for example, disguised as dolls), and much more.  The famous and unknown revelers herein described had their fun, centuries ago, and the reader interested in such fun will find a great store of it in Peakman's delightful history..

The term was coined in 1960 meaning \\"cybernetic organism\\", a living being who was a fusion of biological and computer parts.  If you think we might eventually have cyborgs in the future, you are wrong; cyborgs walk among us now, and one has written an autobiography.  In _Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human_ (Houghton Mifflin), Michael Chorost has described how an implanted computer has taken over his hearing and brought him better back to the world.  It is a strange story; in one sense, it isn't unique because thousands of cochlear implants are in use now, but Chorost has a lifetime of deafness, a longstanding interest in computers, a background in literature, and a fine sense of humor that bring the story forward in a unique way.<br /><br />Chorost had had impaired hearing since childhood, and it gave out entirely in 2001 when he was 36 years old.  Because it was a problem within his inner ear and his auditory nerves themselves were intact, he was a candidate to get a cochlear implant.  It is not a simple amplifier like a hearing aid is, but a direct stimulator of the nerves that go from the cochlea to the brain.  He was distressed when it finally was turned on.  \\"Everything sounds awful,\\" he reports.  There was a roaring sound, and everything else was muddy and incomprehensible.  It got much better, and in strange ways that raise fascinating questions about sensation.  For instance, the electrode array cannot stimulate the cochlea in the way it was used to, and there is a problem of frequency mismatch.  A user perceives that the entire auditory spectrum is shifted into high; that was one reason that Chorost couldn't, that first day, tell a woman's voice from a man's.  His own voice sounded too high, too.  But the problem was resolved in a day.  It was not by any tinkering with the processor or implanted devices.  His own brain very quickly sensed the change, sensed that something was not normal, and unconsciously shifted itself back into the normal direction.  \\"I _knew_ what my own voice was supposed to sound like, and by God, my brain was going to hear it that way; to hell with whatever nerves were actually being stimulated.\\"  He reflects on questions pondered 250 years ago by David Hume; reality may be out there, but the senses do not tell us about real reality, only their interpretations of it.  Chorost is a living experiment that Hume would have loved.<br /><br />Chorost understood that his sensation was provisional; indeed, the implant is designed to be able to take advantage of better processors as they come along.  He feels this made him a better human: \\"The very provisionality of my perception reminded me that my political perspective was provisional also, and that it was my task as a human being to strive to connect ever more complexly and deeply with the people and places of my life.\\"  Rebuilt is not a technical introduction to new auditory gadgetry, or not just that, anyway, although at one point Chorost looked at a print-out of the program that manages the electrodes, and realized with wonder, \\"I was reading my own software.\\"  Chorost also has important reflections from his unique perspective about the resistance to implants (currently decreasing) within the deaf community, and the differences between humans, robots, and cyborgs, especially as the last two are depicted in film and fiction.  More important, it is about how new perceptions of his cyborg self led to new interactions with people, and it is an extraordinarily personal document; there are hilarious remarks, for instance, about what to do with the gadgets and wires if you want to hear what is going on during lovemaking.  It is at its best as a coming-of-age story set within technological innovation, and is fascinating on every page., and unconsciously shifted itself back into the normal direction.  \\"I _knew_ what my own voice was supposed to sound like, and by God, my brain was going to hear it that way; to hell with whatever nerves were actually being stimulated.\\"  He reflects on questions pondered 250 years ago by David Hume; reality may be out there, but the senses do not tell us about real reality, only their interpretations of it.

90599:US	50895620	RIJIR9KRG2B3C	1593720122	913358852	Extraordinary Exhibitions: Broadsides from the Collection of Ricky Jay	Books	5	24	25	N	N	An Extraordinary Exhibition of Showbills	If you ever have a chance for a collector to show his collection, you run the risk of being terribly bored.  Unless you yourself collect stamps, coins, thimbles, Hummel figurines, or Corvettes, you are unlikely to sympathize with the delight the collector takes in his hoard.  Ricky Jay is a fascinating man; he is a master magician, a historian of show business (especially of novelty acts), and an actor in David Mamet's movies.  He collects something few others do: showbills for the jugglers, magicians, animal acts, ventriloquists, and other eccentric and novelty performances through almost four centuries.  Don't worry, it is far from boring.  Around eighty of his specimens are on display in a large format book, _Extraordinary Exhibitions: The Wonderful Remains of an Enormous Head, the Whimsiphusicon & Death to the Savage Unitarians_ (Quantuck Lane Press).  The broadsides are funny and beautiful, and Jay's learned and enthusiastic commentary about each one is on the page facing each specimen.  It is all thoroughly entertaining, and like any show advertising, the posters make you wonder if the acts are really as described.  There is so much verbal and graphic hyperbole on display here that a bit of incredulity is only sensible, but still: who, if confronted by an announcement for Signor Cappelli and his Learned Cats, with assurances that after he introduces his cats to the audience, they will \\"beat a drum, turn a spit, grind knives, strike upon an anvil, roast coffee, ring bells, set a piece of Machinery in motion to grind rice in the Italian manner with many other astonishing exercises\\", who, I say, would let incredulity overcome a wish to get a peek at the show?<br /><br />Let me just take the three displays mentioned in the subtitle.  \\"Wonderful Remains of an Enormous Head\\" were on display in London around 1840, and it was, if the description is to be believed, truly enormous, eighteen by seven feet, and weighing 1,700 pounds.  What the head was, we do not know; one observer said it was likely that of a whale, and another said it was an obviously gigantic bird, fish, or lizard.  The Whimsiphusicon had one of those fanciful names showmen of the 19th century enjoyed.  It is advertised on a playbill for the ventriloquist Christopher Lee Sugg in 1816.  Jay says, \\"Sugg, like a number of early magicians, was a proponent of theatrical neologism used to entice, or more likely confuse, the public.\\"  Indeed, Sugg explained on the playbill that the device was also dubbed \\"The Wandering Melodistical\\" and was a \\"Pill to Banish Melancholy,\\" but it is safe to say he didn't give any secrets away until the performance.  \\"Death to the Savage Unitarians\\" is on an Argentinean bill from 1842, and does not refer to the members of the religious sect, but to the country's Unitarian political group who favored a liberal rule of law and a strong central Argentinean government.  They opposed the dictator Juan Manuel Rosas, and probably the phrase was included by the publicist who had drawn up the bill to ensure it would not offend the dictator.

It was a chemical revolution, an abandonment of ancient ideas about the material around and in us, and an adoption of the products of experiment and rationality.  The greatest of the revolutionaries in chemistry was Antoine Lavoisier, whose story has been told many times before.  It is brightly summarized within W. W. Norton's valuable \\"Great Discoveries\\" series by Madison Smartt Bell in _Lavoisier in the Year One: The Birth of a New Science in an Age of Revolution_ (Atlas Books).  Bell is usually a novelist, not a biographer, and he knows how to tell a good story.  The title is an exaggeration, as it only concentrates on events around \\"Year One\\" of the French Revolutionary Calendar which started at the establishment of the French Republic in 1793.  The important accomplishments of Lavoisier's life, and the stupid blood festival that put an end to it, are thus highlighted in a useful and accessible biography.<br /><br />Lavoisier was born into a prosperous bourgeois family in 1743, and gained his fortune as a private investor working as a tax collector for the government.  His wealth enabled him to practice his passion, science.  Perhaps more than anyone else, Lavoisier pulled scientific chemistry out of the ancient and respected practice of alchemy.  He also dethroned the well-accepted theory that burning represented the release of a peculiar element called phlogiston.  He also quite spectacularly decomposed water into hydrogen and oxygen, and recomposed it again from the two gases.  The importance of such a literally elemental deconstruction cannot be overstated; water was everywhere, and had been thought of since Aristotle as one of the four basic elements.  But deposing the old chemistry did not come only scientifically.  It was a political and rhetorical effort.  Scientists before Lavoisier had isolated \\"eminently breathable air,\\" but Lavoisier called it oxygen and further built a new system of chemical nomenclature.  For instance, calcium nitrate by its very name reveals that it has more oxygen in it than calcium nitrite.  It is the same nomenclature that we use today.  Lavoisier's new chemistry was intensely resisted, with phlogiston fans finding new and convoluted ways that their element accomplished everything.  His new nomenclature, however, was useful and was an irresistible aid to teaching.  Once chemists came to Lavoisier's terms, they had to start accepting his theories.<br /><br />Some of Lavoisier's previous scientific work endangered him after the Revolution.  The Jacobin firebrand Jean-Paul Marat denounced him in 1791 because twelve years before, Lavoisier had discredited Marat as having a charlatan's views of science.  Lavoisier had served on the famous committee (alongside his friend Benjamin Franklin) that showed that Mesmerism was bunk, although it had been supported by Marat and by another future member of the Jacobin government Jacques-Pierre Brissot.  Brissot went on to champion the abolishment of the national academies of the arts and sciences, insisting that they were elitist and tyrannical.  Lavoisier did have a magnificent scientific record, but in gaining it he had made enemies.  It was his involvement in the tax system that was his undoing, even though he had been scrupulously fair and honest in his public responsibilities.  It may be apocryphal that at his kangaroo court someone said, \\"The Revolution has no need for scientists,\\" but the outcome once he had been arrested was never in doubt.  He was guillotined along with 27 other tax assessors in 1794, facing death with good cheer; he wrote, \\"The events in which I find myself enveloped will probably spare me the inconveniences of old age.\\"  Bell's book rightly concentrates on the scientific accomplishments and explains the way that many of Lavoisier's experiments were performed.  It serves well as a reminder of how little we knew of our material world just a couple of centuries ago.  It must make us appreciate anew the famous remark of one of Lavoisier's colleagues: \\"It took them no more than a moment to make that head fall and a hundred years may not be enough to produce another one like it.\\"reminder of how little we knew of our material world just a couple of centuries ago.

If given the chance to conceive by artificial insemination, would you accept a sperm from a healthy but otherwise undistinguished anonymous donor, or would you be more eager to accept the sperm from a healthy Nobel Prize winner?  It's a simple choice, isn't it?  It's a choice that women used to be able to make, and they cannot any more, not because there is no interest in producing genius children, but because what was known as the \\"Nobel Prize Sperm Bank\\" once existed and exists no more.  The story of the bank, funny, bizarre, and sad, is told in _The Genius Factory: The Curious History of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank_ (Random House) by David Plotz.  The bank folded in 1999, and was, according to Plotz, \\"the most radical experiment in human genetic engineering in American history.\\"  However, no one had followed the results that the bank had produced, so no one knew how the experiment turned out.  Plotz determined to do so, breaking through the secrecy and (since he worked for the famous Internet magazine _Slate_) using the Internet's power to make connections and uncover the untold stories.  The result is a fascinating story that undercuts our current devotion to the power of the gene.<br /><br />Robert Graham was a multimillionaire who, several decades after eugenics had become an American fad and then faded, had taken up the crusade.  His was not the dark eugenics of sterilization, but that of ensuring that outstanding males were able to produce lots and lots of outstanding children.  Graham in 1980 encouraged scientists (he had little appreciation for \\"genius\\" in other fields) to donate their seed for the good of their race.  Most of the Nobelists were not at all interested, thinking the idea silly.  One who was interested, and donated, was William Shockley, who had won his Nobel for inventing the transistor, and parlayed the fame it gave him into a bully pulpit for his retrograde racist views.  He drove many donors away.  There were only three Nobel laureates who participated, and none bore fruit; other donors were accomplished in some other, lesser scientific way.  Graham died in 1997, and his brainchild did not long outlive him.  There were 215 babies born from its seed, but their stories were unknown until Plotz started his research.  He adopted the role of Semen Detective, verifying that children were products of the bank and trying to put the evidence together that would indicate just which donor produced which child.  Some donors and children he was able to unite, if both sides wanted it.  The donors, twenty years on, were not generally great specimens; one turned out a failed physician who lied about his IQ on his application.  Some of the meetings produced jubilant new relationships, and some were disappointments.  There is inherent interest in stories of lost children and lost fathers finding each other, and Plotz's stories are beautifully told.<br /><br />So, what were the results of the grand experiment?  There is only a limited amount Plotz can tell us.  He got in touch with thirty of the children, or their parents, and met some face to face.  It isn't a random sample; for instance, they are the ones ready to talk about the sperm bank.  A few of the kids are brilliant, most are good students, some are below average, so there does seem to be a skew toward intelligence.  But like all nurture versus nature questions, there is no good answer.  The mothers of these kids were motivated to get involved with the bank because they themselves were highly motivated, and also undoubtedly because they were at least middle class and thus in prosperous homes.  They had not themselves been interested in any eugenics goals; they just wanted healthy sperm from reliably healthy men.  They wanted successful children, but it wasn't just a matter of hunting up good sperm; their desires to have their children succeed led them to raise their children in ways to make that happen.  Certainly, Graham would not have found that his kids turned out to be a super cadre ready to lead America into new scientific and genetic success.  Playing with genes in this way is too much of an unpredictable crapshoot, but we are still doing the same thing.  The Nobel Prize Sperm Bank is gone, but it is not missed because it has been replaced.  Most sperm banks now test and quiz donors and allow women to make refined choices of whose sperm to take.  As Plotz writes, for better or worse, \\"All sperm banks have become eugenic sperm banks.\\"ir children succeed led them to raise their children in ways to make that happen.

For centuries, millions of people have enjoyed looking at commercial exhibits of the odd and curious.  Joe Nickell is one of those people.  Growing up in Kentucky, he never missed the carnivals and circuses that had human and animal oddities on display as sideshows.  Nickell is well known for investigating frauds and hoaxes for the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, but it doesn't matter to him that many sideshow acts were bogus or at least grossly exaggerated on the banners outside the shows.  He obviously loves the now-disappearing shows, and in _Secrets of the Sideshows_ (University Press of Kentucky), that affection is made plain.  To be sure, he gives plenty of secrets away here, most of them open secrets, but the book works best as a tribute to the imagination of the performers and organizers of the exhibits which were meant to provoke and satisfy that admirable old human characteristic, curiosity.  The book provokes and satisfies in the same way.<br /><br />Nickell notes that \\"sideshow\\" means an adjunct to the main show.  The \\"midway\\" where these shows were located was midway between the entrance and the main attraction.  He briefly recounts early history, and then goes into their heyday starting in the early 1900s.  Sideshows featured magic performances, often with one big trick like sawing the woman in half or the escape from a chained box.  The way these sorts of tricks are done is explained here, but the explanations would not ruin the fun of a good performance.  Fire-eating and sword-swallowing are explained, as is how to eat glass or walk barefoot on it, or how to walk barefoot up a ladder of swords.  The explanations are enough to show how the tricks are done, but few readers are going to be tempted to try them.  There were performers who didn't perform, but just showed themselves.  Dwarves, giants, fatties are all here, all respectively taller, shorter, or lighter than their publicity banners proclaimed.  Giants of such acts, for instance, sometimes had a contract that specified that they would not be measured.  A bearded lady (\\"The Monkey Girl\\") and a man with the skin disease ichthyosis (\\"The Alligator Man\\") eloped in 1938, and were a sideshow feature as \\"The World's Strangest Married Couple\\"; they were happy together for over sixty years.  Not all the displays were real, but as one carny said, \\"Oh, it's _all_ real.  Some of it's really real, some of it's really fake, but it's all really good.\\")  Hilariously, these exhibits which used to go under names like \\"Mother Nature's Mistakes\\" are sometimes now displayed in a \\"Horrors of Drug Abuse!\\" scare show.<br /><br />Nickell closes with analysis of why the sideshows are fading into the past; it isn't because of any attempt to become politically correct, or any triumph of good taste; it comes down to simple economics, as fairs can make more money with, for instance, rides that take up the same space a midway does.  Because it tells secrets of the sideshows, Nickell's book is a miscellany that is full of good humor and bizarre stories, like that of the bank robber who was killed by a sheriff's posse in 1916, and his mummified body passed from carnival to carnival.  Somehow it became part of the \\"Laff-in-the-Dark\\" funhouse in Long Beach about forty years later, but everyone thought it was just a spray-painted mannequin until it broke and showed bones inside.  He finally got laid to rest after a long postmortem career.  There is a description of how to enlist fleas into a flea circus, and how to harness them to their particular tricks.  There is an even more interesting description of the comic flea circus (\\"The Most Minuscule Show on Earth!\\") that has no fleas, only the colorful banter of the proprietor over the tiny apparatus (\\"She's blindfolded herself!... She's walking backward!\\").

After having worked in advertising, he started making films for the British Government during World War II.  After the war he wrote scripts and he began directing.  For the Ealing Studios, he made _Whiskey Galore!_, _The Man in the White Suit_, and _The Ladykillers_.  Then he came to Hollywood, where he made the wonderfully biting _Sweet Smell of Success_.  He could direct fine movies, and he did; but then he slipped into the \\"can't do\\" category, not for any lack of talent, but because he was not much of a deal-maker, and resented having to negotiate details with the studios.  He started teaching, becoming dean of the film school at the California Institute of the Arts in 1969.  He continued teaching until his death in 1993, but now filmmakers and audiences can get a glimpse of what he taught, in _On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director_ (Faber and Faber).  It is a sampling of his lecture handouts, some illustrated by his own sketches, that he delivered to students over the years, and shows the richness of his thinking on the surprising complexities of artistic decisions regarding even simple shoots on tiny films.  Those who enjoy movies, but don't know much about how they are made, will be astonished at how many details of technique the director has to consider before anyone yells \\"Action!\\"  Those who make movies, or want to, could not do better than to study what Mackendrick has to say.<br /><br />Mackendrick emphatically agrees with Truffaut, who in his interview book with Hitchcock wrote, \\"Whatever is _said_ instead of being _shown_ is lost on the viewer.\\"  (One of Mackendrick's many slogans: \\"Movies SHOW... and then TELL.\\")  Always, regard to the audience is paramount: \\"Try to tell the story while always remembering that the audience has somewhere better to go and something better to do.\\"  Like a good storyteller, use curiosity, expectation, and suspense to keep them buttonholed.  The reader of this book will want to be familiar with certain films to which Mackendrick returns again and again, like _The Third Man_ or _On the Waterfront_, but not all the cinema is fine cinema.  In a chapter titled \\"Plausibility and Willing Suspension of Disbelief,\\" he discusses the sci-fi film _Them!_ which he says is a \\"piece of nonsense\\" but shows solid, simple plot mechanisms, and follows the rule that \\"we are allowed only one major Incredible Thing\\" (Giant ants are invading!) while \\"everything else in the story should actually be logical, even over-logical.\\"  There is rich advice about dealing with actors.  A student who asked, \\"How does a director get an actor to do what he wants?\\" took Mackendrick off guard, as he had never asked the question in those terms.

It was issued first in 1757 and continued for almost forty years a bestseller.  It was a bit expensive, two shillings and sixpence, which was about what you could rent a room for.  It was a guide to the prostitutes available around Covent Garden, their attractions, their talents, and, in some cases, their demerits.  The authorship of the _List_ was attributed to \\"Harris\\", of course, but Hallie Rubenhold, a teacher of history, is the first to uncover the full story of the _List_'s production.  In _The Covent Garden Ladies: Pimp General Jack & the Extraordinary Story of Harris's List_ (Tempus Publishing), Rubenhold has not only told the story of the List and given full depictions of the three main characters involved in its production, but has also given a social history of the London of the time.  It is a raucous picture, funny and sad by turns.  If you appreciate the work of Hogarth, many of whose pictures are included here, you will find this a fascinating account.<br /><br />Harris was not the author of the notorious book; he wasn't even Harris.  He was John Harrison, who was a waiter at the Shakespear's Head tavern, a boisterous retreat especially for the theatrical set.  Harris was a clever man who might have been a banker but for his low birth.  He said, \\"I saw great room for an amendment in the profession of pimping,\\" and worked out solutions to such problems of supplying new whores into the system.  He called himself the Pimp General of All England, and few would have disagreed.  He had an army of over 400 prostitutes, and was a well-known figure in the town, so including his name on the _List_ was a perfect selling point for it, but he wasn't the author.  That honor, Rubenhold discovered, goes to a fascinating Irishman, Samuel Derrick.  He ran away to London with aspirations to become a poet and a member of Dr. Johnson's set, and indeed became acquainted with Johnson, Boswell, and the rest.  His real talents lay not in poetry but in whoring and in hack writing.  It was he who produced the lists, and probably paid Harrison for the use of his assumed name in the title.  The profits from the _List_ were the making of him, and he wound up surprisingly respectable.  He was able to bequeath the profits of the _List_ to Charlotte Hayes, with whom he had had a fond relationship as customer, lover, and friend.  She became landed gentry, although she never really left the business.  Inspired by French examples, she became a mistress of high-class brothels mockingly known as nunneries.  Even in comfortable widowhood and retirement, Hayes could not completely leave her background, and was sought out to help arrange assignations.  This is a big story, and Rubenhold has wisely not restricted it to the lists themselves.  She does, of course, include samples of what the _List_ had to say, showing that Derrick's prose was not only a precise, witty, and useful guide, but was material for fantasy that could be enjoyed as anyone can enjoy a catalogue without buying from it.  Here you can find, for example, Miss Loveborn, of Number 32 George Street, who delighted in birching her customers, and it is revealed that the shop from which she bought her birchen brooms was so pleased with her custom, it granted her discounts on tea and coffee as well.  There are scores of others.<br /><br />The three main characters here all fared reasonably well from their trades, but Rubenhold quite rightly describes the less salubrious and cheerful parts of being a prostitute of the times.  There were diseases, and cures for the diseases that were sometimes worse.  There were unwanted pregnancies and distasteful ways of dealing with them.  There was rape, and there was the threat of prison, though this was often for debt rather than moral crimes.  Rubenhold's description of life in the Fleet Prison is unforgettable.After Harris, Derrick, and Hayes bowed off the stage, society became more prudish and the _List_ was legally closed down.  It was great while it lasted, and it was the making of the pimp, the hack, and the whore, chronicled in a vastly entertaining and revealing work of history.After Harris, Derrick, and Hayes bowed off the stage, society became more prudish and the _List_ was legally closed down.

When our telescopes or probes look deeper into space, will we always find something larger?  Is there a limit to the shortness of an instant, or the duration of eternity?  In _The Infinite Book: A Short Guide to the Boundless, Timeless, and Endless_, John D. Barrow has invited us to look at infinities in many ways.  He's competent to do so, as a professor of mathematical sciences at Cambridge, and as the author of previous books which successfully explained such concepts as nothing or impossibility.  Like his previous efforts, this is highly readable stuff, but extraordinarily mysterious.  The topic is something that everyone has pondered in some way; who has not, looking into the stars, wondered how far they go?  It has a universal appeal, and a history within religion, philosophy, mathematics, and physics, all of which Barrow goes into here, in an entertaining summary.  There are answers here, but plenty of mysteries.<br /><br />Consider a universe that is infinite in space; this is a possibility, for no one knows that space is not infinite.  In a universe of infinite size anything that can happen does happen, and does so infinitely often.  In such a universe, not only are you here, but somewhere out there is another you doing exactly what you are doing; in fact, there are an infinite number of you.  There is also somewhere out there another you who has done everything you ever did, but on the day after his sixteenth birthday, wore black socks instead of brown.  This has to be the case in an infinite universe, Barrow shows; it is enough to make us uncomfortable, but discomfort is not an argument that an infinite universe cannot exist.  Mathematicians have had fun and frustration with infinity ever since Zeno, who \\"proved\\" that because to walk a mile, you first had to walk a half mile, and then a quarter mile more, and an eighth mile more after that, and so on forever, that you never were able to finish that mile, and if you are under the impression that you have accomplished a mile journey at some time, you are just deluded.  The world as it perceived by us, with all its journeys, is an illusion.  Georg Cantor solved the problems of dealing with infinities mathematically, but his work was viciously attacked and blocked from publication, but surprisingly, Catholic theologians welcomed his ideas as a way of understanding the infinite, the infinite that included God, of course.  Today, mathematicians take Cantor's work for granted, and its religious implications are not the common stuff of sermons.<br /><br />It is a pleasure to puzzle through these matters with Barrow as a guide, at least partially because this is a general overview which skims through details in order to provide a larger picture.  String theory, for instance, takes a couple of pages, and cosmology not much longer.  If one flavor of infinity is just too much for you to consider, another will soon present itself.  Thus Barrow is able to give an accessible guide to such mathematical chestnuts as the Hotel Infinity, which although it has an infinite number of rooms and they are all occupied, can take on new guests, even an infinite number of guests, even if it has to take occupants when an infinite number of the other inns in the Hotel Infinity chain are closed.  There is an examination of why the sky is dark at night, if the stars are infinite in number and there must be one out there no matter where you look.  Barrow demonstrates that non-zero interest rates are evidence that time travel does not happen.  He speculates about computers which could do an infinite number of tasks in a finite time; such computers might exist, and might be able to calculate the infinite digits of pi - but then how would you print it out?  He shows that although we think of infinity sometimes as the biggest of numbers, infinity is not abig number, but something entirely different, and no big number ever provided such a degree of interest and research in so many fields.  And as in so many of his discussions of aspects of the infinite, paradox always holds sway.  We are still at the beginning of trying to find the answers to much of the material here.  After all, as Barrow points out, \\"You can discover whether the Universe is infinite, but the learning will take an infinite time.\\"ot a big number, but something entirely different, and no big number ever provided such a degree of interest and research in so many fields.

Not so.  The author Susan Casey explains that \\"The Devil's Teeth\\" is one of the names for the Farallon Islands, rocky outcrops of fantastically rugged forms that are a mere thirty-mile boat ride from San Francisco.  The sharks are there, to be sure, especially in shark season of September and November, but there are also seals (one of the reasons the sharks come), birds, bird lice, mice, fleas, bats, and more, most of which make the islands a repulsive place to stay.  But there have been humans on the island, intermittently staying for economic reasons and most recently for research purposes.  The Farallons are the only place people can study great white sharks in the wild.  Anyone who looks at the Discovery Channel knows that sharks fascinate viewers, but Casey profiles two men who have made the obsession into research careers.  Her book is full of details of island life, and of the excitement of getting close to sharks, and understanding them a little more.<br /><br />Casey became interested in the work of Peter Pyle and Scot Anderson, who managed the Farallon Islands White Shark Project, and had been studying the creatures at close range for over a decade and a half.  Pyle is a natural historian and ornithologist who has a distaste for civilization and has made himself comfortable in wilds all over the world to search for birds.  Anderson has been a shark freak since he was a kid.  There were strict restrictions on visitors to the islands, but after a couple of day-passes, in 2003 she was able to spend a few weeks at the islands, anchored in a borrowed sailboat so she was not really \\"on\\" the islands.  It turned out to be a perilous stay, for the islands are forbidding places even without sharks.  Casey always takes a larger view, including the history of the islands and the other creatures on and around them, but naturally the sharks are the stars.  They come to dine on \\"northern elephant seals, harbor seals, fur seals... all barking and bellowing, draped on the rocks like a blubbery carpet.\\"  When a seal in the water is hit by a shark (and it is impossible not to be distressed by the suffering which Casey has to describe, about one hit a day), it is often decapitated, spraying blood into the water.  The shark (or his fellow sharks) returns to finish the meal, but the researchers on the island, having seen the hit or the pool of blood, try to get there as well, to record on video the eating activities.  The researchers know their sharks intimately, the individual coloring, scars, or shape of fin revealing the identity of Tipfin, Gouge, Bitehead, Jerry Garcia, or Cal Ripfin.  The killer might be one of the smaller males who return every year.  Where do they go at other times?  Or it might be one of the huge females, who return only every other year.  Why do they have such a schedule?  Are they going to birthing fields somewhere?  No one knows; the researchers get all the data they can from these limited sightings, and the recording and record-keeping is impressive, but the sharks remain mysterious.<br /><br />The story here, full of human and animal life, comes to a sad end, and it is Casey's intrusion into the island that brings it about.  The trick of having her stick around in an anchored sailboat would have worked, except for the appalling waves and weather that often assault the islands.  Her descriptions of her spells on the anchored, but storm-tossed, boat are among the scariest passages in the book.  She was lucky to have taken illicit refuge on the island when the greatest of the storms hit, for the anchor chain broke and the sailboat was gone.  She eventually paid thousands to search for the borrowed boat, and the owner posted a reward, so that her illegal presence became known.  Pyle lost his job.  In these pages she writes of many disasters  on the islands that she obviously loves, but this one was exceedingly personal: \\"Everything had become unraveled, undone.\\"  All the rest of the book, however, has made sure that we understand the larger view.  Human struggles to control the islands are negligible compared to the primordial drama of wind, sea, rock, seal, and shark.thousands to search for the borrowed boat, and the owner posted a reward, so that her illegal presence became known.

Such purchases now are of course nothing to write home about, and the process of paying on the Internet has become itself a big business.  In _The PayPal Wars: Battles with eBay, the Media, the Mafia, and the Rest of Planet Earth_ (World Ahead Publishing), Eric M. Jackson gives an insider's view of an important part of the growth into the new world of Internet trade.  As the subtitle indicates, there are plenty of battles detailed here, lots of skirmishes with tactics and attempts to guess what the next move of the opponent will be.  The opponent throughout the book was the auction site eBay, but a look at the back of the book's jacket will tell you how the battles turned out: \\"_The PayPal Wars_ is not sponsored or endorsed in any manner by eBay, Inc., or its subsidiary PayPal, Inc.\\"  It would seem as if eBay won, but actually, PayPal had made itself so indispensable that the young company was incorporated into the larger one in 2002, acquired for a cool billion and a half dollars.  It turns out that how PayPal won is a fine story, exciting in parts, and not just for those interested in the modern business world.<br /><br />Jackson begins his story with his recruitment to the startup in 1999.  He had been an analyst for one of the best-reputed firms in the world, Arthur Andersen, and was invited to abandon his staid but reliable job to come to the fledgling PayPal.  He could not find his boss, he had to borrow someone else's computer, and he had no desk.  \\"At least Andersen gave its new hires a place to sit,\\" he grumbled.  Eventually he was given his own place in the ping-pong room, and was given his job in marketing the firm.  It was his hunch to use PayPal on internet auctions, and it was a great fit.  Sellers included mention of PayPal on their sale pages, put the PayPal logo alongside the pictures of the items for sale, and put clickable hyperlinks that would enable a buyer to go to PayPal to set up an initial account.  The main competition came eventually from eBay itself, which started up a similar service of its own, called Billpoint.  Much of the story in Jackson's account, and much of the excitement, comes from the battle between Billpoint and PayPal.  One would think that eBay would have had a huge advantage in being the auction house that ran its own payment service, and eBay certainly tried to push Billpoint upon its captive audience, making rules about how small the PayPal logo had to be, or arranging that a buyer automatically was diverted to Billpoint rather than PayPal.  One time after another, the decentralized and nimble crew at PayPal found ways to change things and win one battle after another.<br /><br />The war with eBay over, and PayPal part of eBay, PayPal executives started leaving the firm they had brought to success.  Part of the reason is that the culture at eBay was different.  Managers were older, they tended to value MBAs, and they had one meeting after another.  Jackson remarks that the meetings were particularly hard to get used to; the eager PayPal executives enjoyed authority and flexibility, and were able to try new things without the need of getting bureaucratic approval.  They had quick responses to whatever eBay threw at them.  Jackson himself left, acknowledging that the firm he was leaving was something more like Arthur Andersen than the PayPal he had helped start.  Being an entrepreneur was more fun than guiding an already-formed company.  And, as this book makes clear, there was a good deal of sheer enjoyment in the hard work, but especially in the thrill of battling with giants.the pictures of the items for sale, and put clickable hyperlinks that would enable a buyer to go to PayPal to set up an initial account.

135887:US	50895620	R3BGDWQGXIGT1O	0520238354	170127092	American Sexual Character: Sex, Gender, and National Identity in the Kinsey Reports	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Character Flaws	With the release of the biographical film _Kinsey_ last year, there were renewed vilifications of Alfred Kinsey and his research, the vehemence of which seemed undimmed after fifty years.  To the rest of the world, this must have looked like an ongoing peculiarity in the American character.  We love sex, we include it in advertising and in books and movies, we wonder what our neighbors and what Hollywood stars and Washington politicians are doing sexually, and yet there are also voices loudly insisting that we ought to go back to a (mythical) past of American chastity and we ought to shut up about sex unless we are going to Just Say No.  The contradictions are closely examined in _American Sexual Character: Sex, Gender, and National Identity in the Kinsey Reports_ (University of California Press) by Miriam G. Reumann.  The book looks at Americans' attitudes about sexual matters from the decade of World War II, and especially in the fifties, with brief discussions of the subsequent decades.  This is an academic work, full of \\"tropes\\", \\"discourses\\", \\"critiques\\", and so on, but it was also (at least for this reader) remarkably funny.  Part of the humor is looking back and seeing how silly were many of the anxieties and objections to Kinsey and to American behavior; such retrospective hilarity, however, must be tempered with the understanding that the silliness is continuing.<br /><br />The American sexual character, which Reumann defines as the sexual patterns and attitudes that were understood as uniquely American, is something that Americans have been quite worried about.  The American character was judged healthy if sexual behavior was quiet, removed from curious probing, and confined to marriage.  Since our sexual behavior has never been like that, the sociologists, historians, and sexologists have had a continuing heyday in telling us how badly our sexual character was or was going to be if we didn't shape up.  In the 1940s, many of the problems were seen as directly connected to World War II itself.  Returning soldiers were lauded as heroes, of course, but it seems that experts could not see them in that merely optimistic light.  Some authors asserted that the war had made the GIs violent and hypersexed, some said they would be passive and effeminate.  The reports by Kinsey (on males in 1948, on females in 1953) were followed by authors who explained what the figures meant.  The authors were generally worried.  Those who insisted that American men were not mere sexual drudges were able to see just how potent and unemasculated men were; unfortunately, many of the men seemed to be messing around with other men, and this was not the way to overcome America's \\"masculinity crisis.\\"  Women were viewed by some as passive and sexually quiescent (\\"It's not as easy as rolling off a log for her.  It is easier.  It is as easy as being the log itself.\\") and by others as being sexually unquenchable (\\"Women can achieve the sex climax up to 100 times as often as a man.\\")  Commentators fretted that merely publishing statistics on sexual behavior, even if the statistics were accurate, would jeopardize the American character and way of life.  A physician wrote that factual discussion of homosexuality could \\"like a removal of quarantine, multiply the infection.\\"  A psychiatrist fretted that women who were free to make sexual demands would insist \\"_that men perform preparatory acts on them before insertion_\\" (italics his).  And such topics were vastly important, because as on sexologist wrote, \\"it is the quality of the relationship between the husband and wife that determines the security of the family, the group, the country.\\"<br /><br />_American Sexual Character_ provides a welcome slice of history to show just what all the fuss was about when Kinsey started reporting.  The horrified prophets quoted here turned out to be almost universally wrong.  Marriage and families are still chugging along, for instance, and even if divorce rates are up,industry and the nation still survive.  Kinsey has failed in half a century to bring it all crashing down.  In a useful epilogue, Reumann shows that even now proposing to administer sexual surveys threatens academics with loss of university funds and certainly of government grants.  There have been calls for a congressional investigation into Kinsey's motives and behavior fifty years after his books came out.  There are still many who think that there are dangers in simply learning about sex, or in transmitting that learning, and that such knowledge undermines the nation.  Government officials are all for sexual instruction, as long as the foundation for the instruction is \\"Just Don't Do It.\\"  If there is a lesson in Reumann's volume, it is that Americans of decades past would have been a lot better off if they would have spent less time fretting about sexual character and spent more time in sexual enjoyment.  Now, too.re up, industry and the nation still survive.  Kinsey has failed in half a century to bring it all crashing down.

The practice of observing, collecting, classifying, and displaying natural specimens was an acceptable hobby for gentlemen and ladies, but Bate pursued it with astonishing passion and effectiveness.  As much of her life as can be reconstructed is happily related in _Discovering Dorothea: The Life of the Pioneering Fossil-Hunter Dorothea Bate_ (HarperCollins) by Karolyn Shindler.  There were more than the usual difficulties of writing the biography of this important woman, and Shindler has made them part of the narrative, as the title implies.  Bate's private effects, personal letters and diaries, and other mementos of her intimate life passed to her sister at Dorothea's death in 1951.  The sister's home burned three years later, along with the remnants of Dorothea's life, leaving only her scientific journals and papers.  It is enough, as she never married and her life consisted of her work.  Shindler has fashioned an admiring narrative of a woman with many traditional feminine characteristics gamely pursuing life in the field and also in the male-dominated scientific world of the time.<br /><br />In 1898 when she was nineteen, Bate marched beyond the public areas of the magnificent Natural History Museum in South Kensington, announced herself, and stated that she wanted to see the Curator of Birds, in charge of the Bird Room.  The room was a male preserve, and \\"that she had aspirations to join them must have been one of the most astonishing ideas that any of the scientists had ever confronted.\\"  She somehow got stationed at a table of bird skins, showing her expertise at sorting them into species.  She was eventually to work for the museum, both for it in the field and within it, for her entire life.  She impressed the geology department the same way two years later with finds from a cave near her home, and her career of collecting took off.  She traveled on her own to Cyprus, Crete, and the Balearic Islands, where her most strenuous efforts were in getting to the remote limestone caves around the islands.  She found Pleistocene remains of pygmy elephants and hippos, as well as much more, and crated them up to the museum.  She became a valuable in-house member of the geology department, working for the museum until her death.<br /><br />Bate's scientific journals were semi-official documents that were ready to be read by others, so Shindler produces fewer actual personal quotations from them than might be expected in a biography such as this.  Nevertheless, in her letters and in the memoirs of those around her, Bate does show as a woman who is \\"witty, acerbic, clever, and courageous.\\"  A woman who knew her at Crete said she was \\"one of the jolliest, most capable, and fearless girls I ever knew.\\"  She was a nurturing guide and consultant, invaluable because of her huge store of knowledge, and one later curator who tried to tally all the papers and books thanking her for her help could not keep up with the huge number.  Sadly, her family never did understand her; after reading Bate's obituary, her sister admitted, \\"I personally never heard about many of these things she did.\\"  Shindler admits that Bate \\"of necessity, is defined by what she did rather than who she was,\\" but what she did makes for a portrait of a woman happily and constructively engaged in intellectual endeavors she exuberantly assigned to herself.nd her career of collecting took off.

If it had gone the other way, and it was a very near thing, we would, for instance, be using a different language now, the descent of royalty in England would have been decidedly altered, and English and European (and therefore world) history would be unrecognizable from where we are now.  The classical depiction of the battle is on a long piece of linen, and the cloth's story is told in _1066: The Hidden History in the Bayeux Tapestry_ (Walker Books) by Andrew Bridgeford.  Everyone who has looked at this extraordinary work of art has tried to see one scene after another, as if it were some epic graphic novel, to tell the story of the invasion.  If you don't know much about the history that has been taught from the tapestry, Bridgeford makes this a fascinating introduction, examining each scene and coordinating it with the written histories of the time.  He is not, however, a professional historian, but a lawyer, and he has a case to argue.  The tapestry has been interpreted the wrong way, he explains, and he means to set the matter straight.  There is a good deal of guesswork and supposition in his explanation, but it is generally well-argued, and will make little difference to those who come to the tapestry without having been drilled in the old interpretations.  Bridgeford does bring the tapestry to life, with its depictions of valor and brutality, and anyone reading his work is going to want to get to France someday to see the real thing.<br /><br />The tapestry is not a tapestry at all, really, but an embroidery; the pattern is not in the weave of the fabric, but stitched into the linen.  The illustrations consist of hundreds of human figures, plus horses, falcons, and dogs, set within forests, churches, castles, and ships.  It is about 75 yards long and one yard wide, and was sewn almost a millennium ago.  The battle depicted in the tapestry was brought about by the death of Edward the Confessor in December 1065, an event depicted about a third of the way along the tapestry.  William of Normandy expected to be made king, but Harold Godwinson was given the nod by the dying Edward.  William set forth to get the throne he thought was his, and of course when Harold fell in the Battle of Hastings, he succeeded.  The view of the tapestry ever since has been that because the Normans won, and because victors get to write the histories, the tapestry is \\"a work of Norman triumphalism,\\" made by Normans who wished to celebrate their just conquest.  Bridgeford has taken scholarly works of the latter twentieth century to demonstrate that the tapestry necessarily tells of the Norman victory, but it gives an English version of events.  For instance, the tapestry never refers to William's claim to the throne, showing Harold's nomination as lawful; Harold is not the usurper whose actions would have justified invasion.  Harold is referred to as King Harold when he is depicted, but he was almost always in other Norman documents referred to by his former title Duke.<br /><br />There is an enormous amount of evidence for this new hypothesis, attractively arranged and argued with legal skill.  Part of the problem is that the tapestry is from so long ago, there are no written documents from its own time that refer to its story or how it was made, and there is an enormous amount of confusing and strange inclusions on the cloth.  It thus has many panels that can be interpreted in various ways.  Bridgeford knows this, and wisely includes many times a phrase like, \\"One further piece of intriguing evidence should be mentioned, though its import is unclear.\\"  The case, full of suppositions about spears that point to particular letters and animals on the cloth's border that illustrate a fable from Aesop that might apply in some way to the goings-on in the main pictures, is an interesting one, but for most people, the new ideas Bridgeford presents will be secondary.  His book primarily serves as an excellent introduction to the tapestry and how mysterious it is, with many large voids of information about and within it.  He also has drawn from other sources to describe a strange and turbulent time, and his descriptions of side issues, like the process of becoming a knight, are useful to the main story.  The book is illustrated with small pictures to show the whole cloth, and enlargements of the panels to which Bridgeford pays particular attention.  As an appreciation of a spectacular work of art, the book is fine guide, particularly in its explanation of symbolism that appealed to the medieval mind.new ideas Bridgeford presents will be secondary.

150839:US	50895620	RQEOXNV43VLC3	1400050448	256699023	Big Bosoms and Square Jaws: The Biography of Russ Meyer, King of the Sex Film	Books	5	34	34	N	N	A Brilliant Biography of a Unique Filmmaker	There's Eisenstein, Hitchcock, Scorsese, and then there's Russ Meyer.  Oh, he's in a completely different category, you say?  Well, sure, but that doesn't keep Jimmy McDonough from making the comparisons to those other directors in his book _Big Bosoms and Square Jaws: The Biography of Russ Meyer, King of the Sex Film_ (Crown).  This is a thoroughly entertaining look at an influential director who possibly more than any other moviemaker did things his own way.  His own way: the title of the book says it all, and note that \\"square jaws\\" comes in a distinct second.  Meyer liked breasts, he liked big ones, and bigger ones, and when silicone came in, he liked monstrous ones, as McDonough says, \\"huge, unbelievable, sometimes scary appendages... female superstructures that defied reality.\\"  That wasn't all there was to it; McDonough admires much else in Meyer's filmmaking.  Sure, he was the one to bring sex into the forefront of movies, but he was keen on photography and editing, and Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, and John Waters claim him as an influence.  He has had serious retrospectives at, say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  He was a severely limited personality and lover, and he put those limitations on the screen, an extraordinarily personal self-portrait.  And he had a damned good time, even if those working with him couldn't stand it.<br /><br />Meyer was born in 1922.  He didn't get further in movies than becoming a theater usher before joining the Army, where he shot newsreels in the 166th Signal Photographic Company.  He documented the advances of Generals Bradley and Patton, and it was the most important experience of his life.  His Army buddies became his family, and often appeared or helped in his movies.  When he eventually started making movies, he had an aggressive style which one assistant said was \\"...like being in the first wave landing in Normandy during World War II, crossed with a weekend in a whorehouse.\\"  After the war, Meyer took his photographic skills to the men's magazines of the time, taking pictures of women that exaggerated their curves.  He made industrial films, learning the basics of cinema..  His first fully entertainment film was _The Immoral Mr. Teas_ in 1959, about a Mittyesque bumbler who had the inner life of imagining the females around him naked.  This quaint storyline allowed Meyer to put in all the shots he wanted of busty women naked from the waste up.  It seems rather old-fashioned now, but the San Diego police confiscated it 20 minutes into its first screening.  Later, Meyer would make films with dialogue and action.  McDonough admires the films, and goes into detail on the making of each one.  Meyer put his breast obsession into them, of course, but he did not make the sort of X-rated movies like _Deep Throat_.  He didn't like regular porn as we have come to know it; he sniffed, \\"There's a difference. I spend 14 months making a film.  Not 30 minutes in a motel room.\\"  Part of the reason he didn't like such films is that he didn't like the activities they depicted.  He regarded anything other than missionary-position sex as some sort of perversion, and perversion was, he said, \\"un-American.\\"  His many wives and lovers confirm that he was no good at foreplay or other such niceties; in his own words he just wanted to get in there and \\"wail away at it.\\"  He did not have a great need to ensure satisfaction in his partners, but he engaged in no perversions - he saved that for his movies.<br /><br />However women feel about Meyer's depiction of them, men can't feel any better about their roles, \\"mere wisps of beings that are about as vague as Meyer's father.\\"  Meyer thought that men were \\"lunch-pail-carrying saps.\\"  Woe to the husbands in his movies: \\"I feel that it's important to really give that husband a bad, bad time,\\" he said, and in one movie after another the husbands are weak, ineffectual, and cuckolded.  It is thus especially sad that Meyer spent his lonely last years handled bya female caretaker as he slipped further into dementia, dying only last year.  McDonough is surprisingly tender about this descent in a book that is sometimes just as crude and vivacious as Meyer's movies, with a slangy prose that sometimes sounds the way Meyer would talk (\\"Everything about this shot is perfecto.\\")  The book is big, stuffed with material from Meyer's own thousand-page autobiography and with interviews of those who worked with him, especially his actresses.  Meyer may not be everyone's idea of a genius, but he made millions on thirty films, only two of which were within the studio system, and he produced, directed, photographed, and edited every one of them.  He took his obsession and made some sort of art out of it, art that millions are still enjoying.

We might push back and concede that the controversy began with Darwin and his famous theory, but this is wrong, too.  The battle between Galileo and the church had been fought centuries before (the church nominally won, to its shame), and then Christianity versus science was stilled, but it wasn't Darwin who reactivated it.  For 200 years before Darwin, scientists and philosophers had faced the difficulties that Enlightenment thinking had brought for those who thought the Bible literally true.  In _Before Darwin: Reconciling God and Nature_ (Yale University Press), Keith Thomson has given the history of the conflict before Darwin's Theory of Evolution was proposed and became the cornerstone of biology.  He examines thinking on both sides of the issue, and is fair to both; after all, science came up with flawed evaluations for, say, the age of the Earth or for heredity, and the clerics came up with explanations that only seem absurd with the hindsight we have the luxury of displaying from the twenty-first century.  It is a great story of a march toward eventual understanding, full of odd personalities and dramatic events.<br /><br />The main figure in this book is William Paley (1743-1805), a \\"somewhat shy, shambling figure, built short and square,\\" who wrote many books on faith, but it is his final book, _Natural Theology_, that made him famous, and its ideas are still used by creationists and those who favor Intelligent Design today.  Even Darwin was impressed by it, before he toured the world and started coming up with his own ideas.  He said it gave him as much delight as Euclid did.  Paley's famous contribution to the argument was that of finding a rock on a heath versus finding a watch; it is all too clear that the watch has a designer.  (In England, indeed, Thomson's book is titled _The Watch on the Heath_.)  Similarly, anything as complex as a living organism must obviously have a designer, and of course the world had a designer, too.  This argument was not original to Paley (it goes back at least as far as Cicero) but he expressed it so forcefully as to make it his forever.  There was more to Paley's book, and he accepted as an intellectual ally Thomas Malthus.  He helped promulgate Malthusian ideas, such as how people showed overproduction of their numbers and that the environmental economy changed in the struggle for existence.  Paradoxically, therefore, Paley was advocating two of the fundamentals that would power Darwin's ideas.  The theme of such connections between those promoting faith and thereby eventually assisting the triumph of science runs throughout Thomson's book.<br /><br />Christians had to reconcile their faith with what scientific evidence demonstrated to them, not only about the age of the earth but about the imperfections within creatures and the amorality of animals in competition for resources.  Thomson shows that the way forward for Christians devoted to their Bibles as well as to natural history was to accept that the sacred texts were not scientific texts, and were metaphorical.  Science and religion would deal with two different realms.  They could always satisfyingly trump science with a \\"That's the way God made it\\" or \\"That proves God's benevolence,\\" but this in itself indicated a basic acceptance of the scientific truths first.  The alternative of rejecting science's findings entirely remains attractive to many, but also rejects the simple fact that over the centuries, science has proved to be a better way of explaining the way the universe works (setting aside such fields of enquiry as ethics or salvation).  Those who make such a rejection loudly insist that there is controversy over Darwin's ideas when actually there is no such scientific controversy, but Thomson's fine book shows that they are merely participating in a long losing battle.  The battle didn't start with Darwin.uch scientific controversy, but Thomson's fine book shows that they are merely participating in a long losing battle.

We think that the guy who forges a signature on someone else's check is a contemptible scoundrel.  But forgers who do such things as paint masterpieces wonderfully well in the style of someone else, or forgers who write diaries of, say, Howard Hughes or Hitler, those we may find to be attractive scoundrels.  They pull a prank and get away with it, or away enough with it that experts are fooled until other experts force the truth upon them.  In _The Scarith of Scornello: A Tale of Renaissance Forgery_ (University of Chicago Press), Ingrid D. Rowland has written about a very peculiar forgery of the seventeenth century.  It is a tiny piece of history, long overlooked, but the forger had his fun, and had a bit of influence for his times.  Rowland's work is a serious piece of erudite scholarship, but the scoundrelism and the reactions to it make for fascinating reading.<br /><br />In November 1634, Curzio Inghirami, nineteen years old, near his family's villa Scornello found a scarith, a capsule of mud containing peculiar documents written on paper in Latin and in Etruscan, the ancient language of the region that had yet to be deciphered.  He eventually found over 200 of these, purporting to be documents from 64 BCE, which among other things, put a Tuscan spin on the Catline revolt against Rome, showed that Noah had founded the nearby ancient city of Volterra, and predicted the arrival of the Messiah.  Curzio's book _Ethruscarum Antiquitatum Fragmenta_ appeared in 1636.  Curzio's family ensured that the book was simply gorgeous, full of woodcuts and copperplate engravings on good quality paper.  The book was designed to convince anyone who merely glimpsed at it of the truth of its contents.  Academics based in Rome who descended upon it showed the forgery to be obvious.  The foremost objection was that the scarith were written on paper, while Etruscans knew nothing about paper; they wrote on linen cloth.  (Long after the controversy had died away, a commercial watermark was even found on them.)  Curzio had indeed arranged the forgery, but it was so strongly criticized and defended, he could not back down.  The battle was on a higher plane as well.  It was only a year before the scarith were discovered that Galileo, a Tuscan, had been forced to recant his model of the universe with the sun at the center.  The Pope was eager to put down this new bid for Tuscan pride, and Florence was just as eager to regain the intellectual reputation besmirched by Galileo's conviction and house arrest.<br /><br />Rowland thinks that Curzio was participating in the practical joke, such an art form in Tuscany that it has its own name, beffa.  His original scarith might be seen as preposterous parodies, but he did have a genuine interest in Etruscan objects and culture, an interest promoted by patriotism for his homeland.  When his fellow citizens and family took up his cause, perhaps there was no way that he could back down.  He was destined for law school by his family, but didn't want to go.  He wanted to be a historian, but by making up history, he could avoid all that laborious studying that historians have to do.  His joke proved to be exceedingly long-lasting.  In 1985, during the Italian \\"Year of the Etruscans,\\" thieves broke into the Palazzo Inghirami and stole the scarith.  They must have thought the scarith were real, but in doing so, they were only members of a long line.controversy had died away, a commercial watermark was even found on them.)

You look inside, and find something valuable.  What do you do?  For almost anyone, this is as clear a case of finders keepers as can be.  But what if you saw the ship on the rocks from which the box came?  What if you rowed out deliberately to take such boxes from the foundering ship?  What if in rescuing boxes you refused to rescue passengers?  What if you had lured the ship upon the rocks deliberately by making a false lighthouse?  The wreckers can tell you the answers to these questions, if you can get any of them to make frank replies.  Wreckers are those who are eager to claim soon-to-be-lost cargo as their own, and the history of British wreckers (frank replies and all) is told in _The Wreckers: A Story of Killing Seas and Plundered Shipwrecks, from the 18th Century to the Present Day_ (Houghton Mifflin) by Bella Bathurst.  The author's previous book, on the lighthouse-building family of Robert Louis Stevenson, was a sort of preparation for the current one, the light as opposed to the dark.  It is full of death, riches, and good and bad luck, and therefore cannot help being fascinating.<br /><br />The complicated legal status of wrecks, wreckers, and wreckage is here covered in detail, but it is fair to say it is not made plain.  No English law has supported \\"finders keepers\\" in any form, but wreckers pretty much depend upon it.  After all, as Bathurst invites us to consider, if a foundering ship has been properly evacuated of all its crew, and it is about to break up with all its goods going to the bottom, what can possibly be wrong with nimble wreckers climbing aboard and plucking whatever they can?  It's a different issue from wreckers luring ships to their doom.  Go to Cornwall now, the setting for _Jamaica Inn_, and they will sell you souvenirs from the age when wreckers deliberately wrecked ships, and they will deny that such things ever occurred.  There is much less malevolence described on most of these pages, although they are full of those who live by the sea and try to profit thereby.  If you don't like the dark of _Jamaica Inn_, which may or may not be based on real history, try the rollicking _Whiskey Galore_, which is really based on the sinking of the _Politician_, with a quarter million barrels of malt whisky, wrecked off parched isles of Scotland in 1941.  The _Cita_ ran aground on the Isles of Scilly in 1997 and gave the islanders tons of toys, car engines, and brand name Nike trainers.  These are fine stories that anyone will enjoy, because wrecks are inherently fascinating.  One man who photographs says anyone will go look at them, \\"Not necessarily to go and pick it over, but just to go and see it.  It seems to create an awful lot of interest in people.\\"<br /><br />Just so this book.  Bathurst has visited the locales described, and most importantly, has actually sailed these dangerous waters, with expert local guides.  Off Scotland, for instance, is the Gulf of Corrievreckan, with monstrous rocks and a subaquatic pit known as \\"the Gateway to Hell\\".  Bathurst is mystified by her scary visit: \\"A couple of hours ago, I though I understood the laws of physics.\\"  Valleys of water, liquid obstructions, and boiling cold water teach her differently.  A captain unaware might be sailing along, only to realize that a great pit of water is opening in front of him and there is nothing his vessel can do.  The Goodwin Sands, near the narrowest part of the English Channel, are islands that can disappear or reappear irregularly, depending upon how the sands shift, and since they are in a busy waterway, they have dragged innumerable ships down.  The wreckers (locally called \\"levellers\\") assist such vessels if they can, but pick up whatever merchandise they can, too.  Even the members of the legendary and fully respected Royal National Lifeboat Institution, one man says, would get to a wreck first and rescue the survivors, and then \\"... if they got some perks of it, well...\\"  This is an engaging tale of the gusto of sea life, of unsure waters, and of uncertain morality.ors, and then \\"... if they got some perks of it, well...\\"  This is an engaging tale of the gusto of sea life, of unsure waters, and of uncertain morality.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-11

Take William Lever.  In each of his houses, his bedroom was left open to the elements.  The only roof, if any, was partial, and if he and his wife spent the night in rain or snow, it was just the timely clime for a good night's sleep.  Sleep well he did, every night, even if he had to brush off a layer of snow upon arising.  He rose very early and took a cold bath.  He dined well and chewed each mouthful 32 times; like his open air sleeping, it was a health practice he recommended to others.  He planned grand schemes, and never backed down on them, never changing his mind.  He didn't like discussing such plans: \\"We won't argue: you're wrong,\\" he would say often to his employees.  An interviewer in 1905 summed him up: \\"Mr. Lever seldom does anything like other people.\\"  This irascible, ridiculous, and yet enlightened man died in 1925, and his company, Lever Brothers', employed 85,000 people around the world and had formed global trade and benevolent employee relations in novel ways.  He deserved a biography before now, but Adam Macqueen has written a jovial and well-researched one in _The King of Sunlight: How William Lever Cleaned Up the World_ (Bantam), a welcome rescue from obscurity of an odd and influential mercantile prince.<br /><br />He was not born to commercial royalty, but to a mere grocer in north England in 1851, one of ten children.  He went into his father's trade, but was a natural salesman and transformed the simple grocery into first a wholesaler and then a soap manufactory.  Sunlight Soap appeared in 1886, cut into one pound blocks ready for sale, in the innovation of a brightly-colored box bearing the firm's colors and Sunlight logo.  Lever advertised in innovative ways.  He liked paintings, and he liked to buy a picture, say of a girl and her dogs, and change it for advertising purposes, inserting a soap bar and bath in the corner, as if the purpose of the artist was to illustrate washday.  Lever felt that if he bought the painting, he need not tell the artist of his intentions to use it as advertising, nor to pay extra for it for that purpose.  His great social experiment was Port Sunlight, a pastoral suburb and soap factory near Liverpool, a planned village for his workers.  \\"It was his village, his creation, paid for by his cash, and here he could indulge his control-freakery to the full.\\"  It must be said that he was an essentially benign dictator, and that his community system worked for decades.  He was far in advance of laws requiring factories to have fresh air, fire alarms, or sprinklers; he was genuinely concerned that employees get well treated, even in the mills which he established in the Congo, with schools and hospitals for the workers, an example of care that was unprecedented in that continent.<br /><br />There are many funny episodes in his life detailed here, including the preposterously blown-up incident of his cutting his head from a portrait of himself which he had commissioned from Augustus John but which he did not like.  He had feuds with the newspapers, most famously with the _Daily Mail_ which turned on him after cancellation of an advertising contract; he won the suit against the paper and gave the damages to Liverpool University.  His world was completely changed by the First World War, and he had a bizarre and expensive scheme for development of Hebridean islands that was a failure late in his life.  Macqueen's account has to include the sad later years, when Lever could not adjust to his inability to control in detail his enormous empire, but his was overall a vastly successful entrepreneurial life, and one that remains influential today.  Macqueen has drawn analogies with British contemporaries that may not be immediately recognizable by Americans, but his book is full of humorous detail that is easily appreciated.  Lever was obsessive and dictatorial, but he was also humane and funny, and both sides are here in full.as also humane and funny, and both sides are here in full.	2005-07-07

They do need finding, sorting, and placing in context.  Mary Hollingsworth is such a historian, and was forced by weather to make a detour to Modena in 1999.  As long as she was there, she started looking through the archives.  A friend had already told her that the story of Ippolito d'Este would be worth looking up, and she started to do so.  There were 2,000 of his letters, letters written to him, and 200 account books.  She had found \\"a unique account of life in sixteenth-century Europe, a detailed record of how a Renaissance prince lived.\\"  Not just a Renaissance prince, but an archbishop who was a climber, aiming for a cardinal's hat and perhaps the papacy.  In _The Cardinal's Hat: Money, Ambition, and Everyday Life in the Court of a Borgia Prince_ (Overlook Press), Hollingsworth has set out her findings in detail.  Ippolito has, of course, been written about before, but mostly as an important patron of the arts; he built the magnificent Villa d'Este at Tivoli and he was a patron of the musician Palestrina.  The life and career have otherwise been ignored, and Hollingsworth here corrects this void through the remarkable documents she found.<br /><br />Ippolito d'Este was born in 1509 in Ferrara, the second son of Alfonso d'Este and Lucretia Borgia.  The firstborn son was fated to be the Duke of Ferrara, and Ippolito was fated to enter the church.  Ippolito was no more pious than his brother; their respective careers were merely a matter of birthright.  Ippolito became Archbishop of Milan at age nine, and his family was thereupon interested in making him a cardinal.  The means for acquiring the cardinal's hat was financial.  The cardinalship was in fact purchased from the corrupt Pope Paul III by the Duke for his brother, although there were many complicated arguments made as all the parties involved attempted to improve their positions in the arrangements.  Ippolito's candidacy was greatly improved by his friendship with  Francis I of France, with whom he seems to have had a sincere friendship.  The two men were interested in the sorts of things young men were interested in, hunting, tennis, gambling, and women.  A great deal of Hollingsworth's research has been into account books, and many of the entries are for elaborate, strange, or funny items.  Ippolito was a dandy, favoring bright colors, especially expensive reds, with elaborate shirts, doublets, coats, breeches, and hose.  One inventory includes 611 shoelaces.  Another lists fifteen pairs of gloves, and while gloves themselves were relatively cheap, glove-wearing was expensive, because they were perfumed with ambergris and musk.  There are relatively few religious items inventoried, evidence that Ippolito liked his pleasures more than his religious duties.  Even his rosaries were filled with musk and ambergris.<br /><br />Much of Hollingsworth's narrative necessarily involves listing of such properties.  This is not really a biography as so many of the details of Ippolito's life are not known, but it is a splendid examination of how rich people of the age spent their time and money.  The idea of a cleric and his family spending in such a way might strike our own sensibilities even as immoral, but Ippolito was a man of his time.  He seems not to have been any sort of tyrant, and he did some modest good in his patronage of artists.  Given his own time and his own goals, he was successful.  He very nearly missed getting to be Pope, and he would probably have been as good a one as there were in his times.  He and his brother did successfully campaign to get him the cardinalship, and after all the expenditures to that end, Ippolito racked in lucrative titles, becoming titular Abbott or Archbishop of Italian or French branches that brought in money.  Francis got what he needed, too, as Ippolito went to Rome as Cardinal-Protector of France.

There are explanations for these differences; a bright star may be an ordinary star but simply closer, or a bright star might be at an ordinary distance but simply bigger.  A big part of the challenge of astronomy is trying to figure out just this sort of problem, because it involves basic measurements of our universe.  One of the greatest breakthroughs on the way to understanding how to measure stellar distances was made by Henrietta Swan Leavitt, and if you have never heard this name, there are many reasons, all of them a little embarrassing.  In _Miss Leavitt's Stars: The Untold Story of the Woman Who Discovered How to Measure the Universe_ (Atlas Books / W. W. Norton), George Johnson has brought Leavitt to us, so that we can consider what she accomplished, and why she remains obscure.  There is not actually much material on Leavitt here; this is a small book to begin with, and few of the pages actually have to do with her life.  Johnson himself says she deserves a proper biography, but unless some heretofore secret material is found, she won't get one.  She didn't leave diaries or memoirs, and there are few letters.  What she left astronomers was a celestial yardstick, and it was used to change fundamentally our knowledge of the size and age of the universe we inhabit.<br /><br />Photography became a great help in astronomy, and eventually Harvard had a half million glass plates that were a precise a record of the night sky.  But this was very raw data.  To analyze the images, the director of the Harvard observatory, Edward Pickering, employed computers.  A computer at that time was not an electronic gadget, but a human, a person who was hired to compute, when computing was monotonous and repetitive work.  Leavitt was merely a computer, paid a minimal wage to do the drudgery of looking at the plates and toting up the brightness, color, and position star by star.  Astronomy certainly was benefited by Leavitt's powers of observation, but she is one of the greats in astronomy because she organized her observations in an exceedingly useful and explicatory way.  She concentrated her thinking on variables known as Cepheids (the first one having been found a hundred years before in the constellation Cepheus).  She tallied up these stars, their brightness, and their rate of variation, and found that rate varied with brightness.  A Cepheid that had a certain rate had a certain brightness, and this was the case whether it was distant or close.  If two stars of the same rate appeared to have different brightness, it was only a matter of their different distances.  Astronomers had a new measuring tool.<br /><br />Johnson's book explains how over the centuries astronomers first were able to measure the size of the Earth, then the distance to the Moon, to the Sun, to more distant stars, and to galaxies.  He shows Leavitt's finding as essential in the later measurements, and his explanations are clear and make good use of imaginative analogies.  He also shows how her work was fundamental in changing our knowledge of the basic structure of the universe.  We had already come to understand that we were not the center of the solar system, but Leavitt's discovery was crucial in our further understanding that the Milky Way was not the entire universe and that there were \\"island universes\\" or other galaxies beyond it.  This book is actually a small history of astronomy.  It is sad that it can contain so little about Leavitt herself.  She never married and she died when she was 53.  The clearest description we get of her personality is a few lines from her obituary: she \\"took life seriously,\\" but \\"was possessed of a nature so full of sunshine that, to her, all of life became beautiful and full of meaning.\\"  Part of the problem, of course, was that as a woman, even though she has every right to be known as an important astronomer, she was assigned to lowly tasks.  Even so, she carried them out with thoroughness and with the clarity of observation and spark of imagination that brings on scientific revolutions.ry right to be known as an important astronomer, she was assigned to lowly tasks.

Eisenhower, and the saber-wielding Major George S. Patton, as well as tanks, machineguns, and teargas bombs.  It was a charge in Washington DC in 1932, and it was against an enemy army of 20,000 US military veterans, and their families, and it was quite serious and even deadly.  Patton urged his troops to use their bayonets: \\"If they resist, they must be killed.\\"  This was despite the presence among the veterans of a former soldier who had saved his life in World War I.  The details of the charge, what lead up to it, and its eventual beneficial aftermath are told in _The Bonus Army: An American Epic_ (Walker Books) by Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen.  The Bonus Army, while not unknown in American history books, is largely forgotten and is greatly misinterpreted as being part of the Red Scare of the time.  There is fine research here and dramatic recollection of events that fully justify the book's subtitle.<br /><br />The bonus, about $600, sought by these veterans had been approved by Congress in 1924, but it could not be paid them until 1945.  The Bonus Expeditionary Force (BEF) were WWI veterans who were jobless in the Depression.  Organized originally in Portland, Oregon, the veterans traveled to Washington, mostly by hopping freight trains, forming a junkyard city of around 15,000 near the Capitol.  The BEF said it was staying until Congress granted the bonus, but with the adjournment of Congress, President Hoover found them especially unwelcome.  The Attorney General began to evict veterans from vacant buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue, resulting in violence and the deaths of two veterans.  President Hoover then called out MacArthur and his troops to attack the Hooverville, bayoneting veterans and their families and setting fire to their makeshift homes.  The veterans did pull up and disperse, but Hoover had made an enormously unpopular mistake.  When audiences all over the country saw the newsreels, they booed MacArthur and the Army.  Hoover's reputation as unconcerned and heartless was only confirmed, and his loss in the 1932 election against Franklin Roosevelt was assured.<br /><br />Roosevelt didn't want the bonus, either, but handled the veterans with more skill when they marched on Washington again the next year.  He sent his wife Eleanor to chat with the vets and pour coffee for them, and he persuaded many of them to sign up for a scheme of new jobs making a roadway to the Florida Keys.  A disastrous hurricane swept many of them and their flimsy barracks away in 1935, but that was also the year that a bonus bill was passed over Roosevelt's veto.  The authors have shown that the eventual victory of the Bonus Army was exceedingly important for our nation, which had even after the Revolutionary War handled badly the problem of returning combatants.  The Bonus Army left an impression that something would have to be done for the vets of World War II, and in 1944 Congress and Roosevelt passed the GI Bill of Rights, which not only helped millions of vets get higher education and loans for homes, but also was a foundation for the forthcoming technological and academic success of the US.

In _Soldiers and Slaves: American POWs Trapped by the Nazis' Final Gamble_ (Knopf), Roger Cohen has brought forth a grueling and difficult story of American soldiers, many but not all Jewish, who were assigned to Berga, a concentration camp in eastern Germany, and worked as slaves, many to their deaths.  Instead of becoming part of the history of infamy by the Nazis, the investigation done at the time was hushed up and the victims who lived did not get to testify against the officials in charge of the camp in the war crimes trials.  Cohen's book represents a late but essential corrective.<br /><br />The Nazis took thousands of American soldiers prisoner in the winter of 1944, and most went on to the more typical POW camps.  Even in the closing days of the war, however, and even against Americans, the Nazis had not lost their particular hatred for Jews.  About 350 of the captives were singled out for special transfer to Berga, as were about 350 others, many of them Jewish soldiers, but also others who had been branded as troublemakers at other camps, or those who just looked Jewish according to the prejudices of whatever goon was making the decision.  The Berga workers included American POWs as well as Jewish prisoners from other camps like Buchenwald.  They were often simply worked to death, digging what was to be, in one of Hitler's last mad plans, an underground facility to make synthetic fuel.  They had to endure vicious guards, starvation, infected wounds from their mining work, and more; much of Cohen's book describing the treatment of the prisoners is heartbreaking to read.  Berga was in operation for just 52 days at the beginning of 1945, and then there was a dreadful death march as the Germans kept losing ground in the war.  Of the 350 prisoners, around a fifth died, a rate far higher than any POW camp in Europe.<br /><br />The trials of the prisoners are in some ways not the saddest part of the book.  The men who endured Berga did not get their story told and did not get to give their evidence in the war crimes trials of their brutal slave-drivers.  Cohen has looked at the documents from an American war-crimes investigation from 1945, and found them thorough, with many official statements from prisoners.  The records, however, became classified and even the existence of the camp was not acknowledged.  Family members writing to an official shortly after the end of the war to find out what happened in Berga got a reply that said \\"... it  has been learned that there was no German prisoner of war camp by that name.\\"  Prisoners who eventually got back to the US found that even the Veterans Administration could not believe that they were concentration camp survivors, and were denied disabilities.  Many of the prisoners had to sign a \\"Security Certificate for Ex-Prisoners of War\\" which said that POW activities had to remain secret for the duration of the war and into peacetime.  A brutal Nazi sergeant remembered as particularly vindictive was imprisoned for less than ten years by the Americans, partially because his victims didn't testify.  An SS officer in charge, in contrast, was captured by the Russians in 1951, tried by them, and hanged.  While the US Army never compensated the prisoners or gave them disability benefits for the time in the camp, a few years ago the survivors did get compensation under slave labor legislation from Germany.  Cohen's dramatic, haunting, and elegantly written book will help ensure that this important storyis not lost.tory is not lost.	2005-06-27

Science works very well, in general; our increase in understanding of everything from galaxies to quarks is really quite admirable.  Nothing humans do is perfect, and the world's scientific effort, for all its successes, has a history that also includes some missteps, prejudices, and erroneous conclusions.  It is somehow not surprising that in investigating sexuality, which is still for some people a controversial endeavor, there have been consequential mistakes.  This is probably because the subject is both vitally important to us all and also private and covert.  Compound this with particular investigation of female sexuality, and all sorts of prejudices might be expected to occur.  In _The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution_ (Harvard University Press), Elisabeth A. Lloyd has examined how scientists have tried to understand how female orgasms evolved.  \\"Female orgasm is a source of fascination for groups ranging from sex researchers to the lay public, and evolutionists are no exception,\\" she writes.  Unfortunately, Lloyd shows that the evolutionists' fascination has borne erroneous explanations.  This is a tiny area of evolutionary science, but it has been explored and written about by many, often in opposing camps, and Lloyd has given a detailed and serious refutation of all explanations but one, the one she championed in a paper twenty years ago.  Others might find this a tempest in a teapot, but Lloyd's serious tone and exhaustive analysis of the flaws in other researchers' ideas, and the causes of those flaws, make this a fascinating book of scientific advocacy.<br /><br />Females don't have to have orgasms to bring forth children, so why do they have orgasms?  Lloyd has tried to find every explanation that evolutionists have proposed, and has come up with twenty-one of them.  Almost all have found the female orgasm to be an adaptation, meaning that it is a trait that has evolved to promote fitness in some way, but over and over again, she shows how the proposals of the \\"adaptationists\\" are flawed.  Lloyd is adamant: \\"There is no plausible evidence that links orgasm to reproductive success.\\"  Her arguments against this proposal are many, among them that the number of women who always orgasm with coitus is a minority, about 20%; one would think that if orgasms were an important adaptation that led to successful reproduction, they would be far more common and far easier to get by coitus, rather than, say, masturbation.  A particularly attractive explanation, one which has even been spotted on the Discovery Channel, is charmingly called \\"The Upsuck Hypothesis\\".  It says that during orgasm, the uterus has a drop in pressure, becoming a sort of vacuum cleaner to suck up any sperm deposited by the male.  This would be a reproductive advantage, but even Masters and Johnson found no evidence that upsuck happens.<br /><br />Lloyd finds plausible one explanation of female orgasm, the one that does not insist that it is an adaptation.  Donald Symons in 1979 proposed the \\"byproduct account\\".  Female orgasm is a potential based on anatomy, a potential activated only in some females of some few species.  The anatomical foundation is similar to the nipple in the male.  Operating female nipples are strongly selected for, since they supply nutrition, and are present in the embryo, even before the embryo differentiates sexually.  Thus, inoperative male nipples are a byproduct of selection operating on the female.  In the same fashion, orgasm and ejaculation are strongly selected for in the male because of sperm delivery.  The hardware involved in such actions is there in the embryo that might turn male or might turn female, and females get the erectile, highly-enervated clitoris because the analogous penis in the male is so important.  (This also offers an explanation for the puzzling fact that the key point of sexual stimulation for females is not in the vagina which receives the sexual organ of the male, but on the connected tissue of the clitoris.)  There are feminist objections to this idea, because a female orgasm is derivative from the male one, but this is putting ideology before science: \\"Its historical genesis does not dictate our cultural attitudes toward female orgasm.\\"  Lloyd has looked widely at this explanation and all the others, and has taken pains to list evidence and arguments pro and con.  She has also given a broader critique to show how androcentrism or illusory concepts of human uniqueness have caused the mistakes in reasoning of the adaptationists.  This is a far from titillating volume; surely there are not even fetishists who could get off on so many pages of deconstruction of one arcane theory after another.  As an account of competing scientific ideas and how preconceptions form them, however, it is a uniquely valuable account.on for females is not in the vagina which receives the sexual organ of the male, but on the connected tissue of the clitoris.)

Beal and his family were driving through the Appalachian Highlands of Maryland when they saw a steel girder framework for an upcoming building, incongruously set in a grassy field.  A large sign said \\"NOAH'S ARK BEING REBUILT HERE!\\"  They drove on by, but Beal, a professor of religion, started keeping a list of roadside religious attractions all around the country, and in the summer of 2002, the family rented a mobile home and hit the highways of the Bible Belt to get to see the Ark in progress and many other religious sites constructed out of piety, inspiration, or enterprise.  In _Roadside Religion: In Search of the Sacred, the Strange, and the Substance of Faith_ (Beacon Press), Beal gives a report on what he saw, and what he thought, and especially how he felt.  Skeptics like myself probably would be happier with a book that conveyed amusement and incredulity at the sights, and Beal's book does have such a tone in many places.  Indeed, Beal started out with a plan of a book of \\"witty and wry observation,\\" but although it is funny in many places, it is altogether more respectful, sympathetic, and understanding of these very odd shrines than he originally expected.<br /><br />Near Mammoth Cave in Kentucky are plenty of roadside attractions, but on Beal's list is Golgotha Fun Park, a miniature golf course which is described in a chapter wittily titled \\"Stations of the Course\\".  Bizarrely, the name comes from the Aramaic for \\"the skull\\" and is the name of the place where the gospels say the crucifixion happened.  Some fun.  There are some ceramic skulls on the sixteenth hole: \\"Although they don't pose much of a putting challenge, they _are_ rather creepy and distracting.\\"  The eighteen holes tell the story from creation to Resurrection.  At hole four, Moses parts the Red Sea to let your ball pass, and on the back nine, representing the New Testament, Mary and Martha kneel prayerfully on either side of the putting green assigned to them.  The eighteenth hole has a statue of the risen Christ, encouragingly looking on as golfers take their final shot, and it is the easiest hole on the course.  \\"It's not easy to venture a theological interpretation of Golgotha Fun Park,\\" Beal assures us, but he is compelled to try anyway, interpreting the obstacles (any good miniature golf course needs obstacles) as not only athletic, but theological - believers conquer smaller ones on the way to the big one, the belief in the risen God.  Beal is content to be instructed by these roadside visions, but he is not uncritical.  At the Fields of the Wood near Murphy, North Carolina, is the world's largest Ten Commandments, concrete letters five feet high on a hillside.  The intent here, Beal says, is to inspire religious awe \\"in the face of a sacred law that is overwhelmingly, _ineffably huge_ in a most literal way.\\"  It's not what the words say, but how big they are.  This is, Beal concludes, \\"the Word of God as image, and I dare say idol.\\"  The commandments, including the proscription against graven images has been turned into the \\"World's Largest\\" graven image.<br /><br />There are plenty of others; the worldly Beal is surprisingly affected by the cutesy Precious Moments Inspiration Park in Missouri, or dismayed by the End Times ideology of The Holy Land Experience in Florida, where there is a daily crucifixion, weather permitting.  Anyone who has driven America's highways has seen billboards for this sort of attraction, and many will be amused by the descriptions of what Beal has found; he has actually paid his money and gone so that the rest of us don't have to.  More importantly, this is a personal book, a religious book by an intelligent thinker who has picked some seemingly unpromising subjects to describe and learn from.  As he openly shares his learning and self-reflections with us, it's just the sort of generosity he admires in the makers of these strange visions..

It is so fine-tuned a system that it is not hard to find chemicals that will make it all go wrong.  Some of these chemicals are so basic as to be the very elements of the universe around us, and in _The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison_ (Oxford University Press), John Emsley has given us a chemistry text dressed in the entertaining garb of famous poisoning cases in history and in popular culture.  Chemistry is often presented as neither exciting nor fun, but Emsley (whose most recent book was an entertaining history of phosphorus) knows that even a big book on the big five elements (arsenic, antimony, lead, mercury, and thallium) is going to be attractive reading for many of us, if the elements are connected with lethality.  The publisher, staid old Oxford, knows it, too, and has dressed the book with a lurid picture of a fearsome bearded man holding a small bottle with a skull and crossbones on it.  Students of the physical sciences: prepare for a bit of morbid fun.<br /><br />The alchemists developed poisons, but mostly set about poisoning themselves.  Newton's hair, for instance, has been analyzed, and it had greatly elevated levels of mercury, lead, arsenic, and antimony; he often tried to volatilize compounds of these, and could not help breathing them in.  He did live to be 84, and was certainly productive, but he was an unpleasant and paranoid man; to what extent the poisons (especially mercury) addled his brain we will never know.  Hatters (as in \\"mad as a hatter\\") were famously subject to the derangement mercury brought since they used mercury nitrate to make felt.  Another career field that had a surprising danger from mercury: detective work.  The dusting powder that used to be used for finding fingerprints would be breathed in by the one doing the dusting; it was only in the 1940s that the elemental culprit for the tremors, irritability, and other symptoms in detectives was identified and the powder formula changed.  Emsley gives many anecdotes of deliberate poisonings, often by serial killers like H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Jegado, who poisoned an unknown number of people during her career, using arsenic.  She was a pious and intelligent servant, who was distressed at each of the funerals she had to attend.  \\"My masters die wherever I go,\\" she sobbed at one funeral, and many sympathized with her bad luck.  Her last poisoning occurred in 1851, a time when forensic arsenic levels could be obtained from the stomach contents of her last victim, fingering her positively.  She didn't get any financial gain from the deaths, but arsenic was used so consistently that in France it was known as _poudre de succession_ (inheritance powder).<br /><br />Emsley's history covers his elements well, and not just their histories in poisoning.  Much of the book is an examination of the history of chemistry itself, from pre-scientific days to the current ones when poisoners are much more at risk of discovery than ever before.  There are welcome side trips, like the one about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome being blamed on the release of antimony from infant mattresses.  The antimony had been used as a fire retardant, but after much scientific hand-wringing, was found not to be an issue in SIDS.  There is good humor in the ghoulishness; Emsley writes that thallium used to be \\"... sold in over-the-counter products for removing unwanted hair.  It was also used to remove unwanted relatives.\\"  There is plenty of well-explained chemistry here, for those who need it as justification for enjoying lurid stories of poisoners; the stories may be morbidly fascinating, but fascinating nonetheless.rs, irritability, and other symptoms in detectives was identified and the powder formula changed.

When cartoons were just starting to become standards of entertainment, however, Disney had one real competitor, whose name is not as well known to the public but is well regarded by cartoon fans: Max Fleischer.  The creator of Betty Boop and the animator of Popeye the Sailor and Superman, Fleischer also invented gadgets that made animation easier and more realistic.  In _Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution_ (University Press of Kentucky), Fleischer's son, Richard, has given us a short memoir and biography of an amazing artist and technician.  It is appropriately full of filial admiration, as Max Fleischer seems to have been a genuinely admirable man and a loving father.  His son even starts his book by contradicting the saw that it is difficult to be the son of a famous man.  \\"I grew up as a famous man's son, and I didn't find it difficult at all.  In fact, it was great.\\"  The animator was famous enough, for instance, that just by mentioning his name, his son could get into the movies free.  Fleischer never had a Fleischerland theme park, or the entertainment connections that Disney had, but his place in animation is secure, and this fond biography allows us to appreciate his contributions to the art.<br /><br />Animated cartoons by 1915 were very primitive; they moved, but in a jerky and unrealistic way.  In a combination of his love of drawing and gadgetry, Fleischer realized that a motion picture camera could be rigged to take pictures that could be traced in ink.  It wasn't easy; the process involved tracing sixteen pictures for a second of film, and then photographing each drawing onto motion picture film.  It seems obvious now, but no one had ever thought of it before, and Fleischer took out a patent for the Rotoscope.  Eventually Paramount produced a series of his \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" cartoons consisting of Ko-Ko the clown, coming to life on the animation board in front of Fleischer, interacting with him in live action, and then being captured into the ink bottle again.  No one had ever seen anything like it, and it was a worldwide hit.  Disney was the spur for Fleischer's most enduring creation.  Mickey Mouse pushed Ko-Ko off center stage, so Fleischer responded by giving Ko-Ko a new dog, tough, cigar-chewing, and piano-playing.  It didn't work, so the dog was replaced by a half-dog, half-human love interest for Ko-Ko.  She was ugly, with saucer eyes an enormous bouncy behind, but Paramount thought she was great.  Fleischer refined her, took away her dog's snout and ears, gave her a sexy figure, and a new name: Betty Boop.  She was a sensation; Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong played for her cartoons, there were tie-in dolls and dishes and fan clubs, and a daily comic strip.  Betty made over a hundred pictures, with her initial career winding down at the end of the thirties.  The Motion Picture Production Code killed her; her harmless sexual image was stripped of its garter and plunging neckline, and her hemline dropped.  She became less fun, and audiences less enthusiastic, and the series ended so that America could be safe from Betty's smut.<br /><br />Fleischer had other notable successes, like the original Superman cartoons, and the first animated Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer.  It did not ensure him financial success; the author tries to clarify the murky funny-business by which Paramount summarily canceled their contract and asserted rights to all of Fleischer's creations.  By the sixties he was broke, but his family arranged for him and his wife to be cared for in the Motion Picture Country House, set up for Hollywood figures that needed a place for retirement.  The King Features Syndicate brought out a new line of Betty Boop products in 1972, and it seems as if she will live forever.  1972 was the year, though, that Fleischer died, and he didn't get to experience her reappearance in pop culture.  Richard Fleischer hasbrought a loving tribute to his dad, and a reminder, in times where computer animation seems so effortless, of just how much work it took for the pioneers in the field to make the drawings dance.has brought a loving tribute to his dad, and a reminder, in times where computer animation seems so effortless, of just how much work it took for the pioneers in the field to make the drawings dance. <br />	2005-06-15

It was as thick with meaning and style as any play or novel; the enormous numbers of books and articles devoted to it since that time, and its continuous inclusion on any list of great films, confirm how important a work it is.  Orson Welles, new to Hollywood, young, brash, and brilliant, had delivered a masterpiece in his very first try.  He had made the system work in ways it never had before.  He would bring further new and innovative works from Hollywood, it seemed certain.  But Welles never again had the freedom that he was able to use on _Kane_, and only made five further movies within the Hollywood system.  How did this happen?  In _Despite the System: Orson Welles Versus the Hollywood Studios_ (Chicago Review Press), Clinton Heylin has given a useful and informed summary of the troubled give-and-take that resulted in the studios taking all his films except _Kane_ away from Welles at the vital editing stage.  \\"I believe that the only good work I can do is my own particular thing,\\" Welles once said, looking back and using the idiom of the sixties. \\"I don't think I'm very good at doing their thing.\\"<br /><br />Heylin comments extensively on other commentators on the Welles productions, because he has set out to redress what he sees as a misinformed analysis that has laid blame on the inner demons of Welles himself for his shocking failure to follow up _Kane_.  For instance, Charles Higham wrote twenty-five years ago that Welles blamed others for wrecking his work, but that the real culprit was Welles's own fear of completion.  This was, according to Heylin, \\"a neat little box in which to wrap any enigmas the work itself threw up.\\"  It was simple, and attracted many other commentators, and even cost Welles an investor for one of his later projects.  However, Heylin shows that Welles was eager to get his films done, finishing them against the odds and against the shortsightedness of studio heads.  Welles was not undone by his own inner failings, but \\"by real people, with real motives.\\"  In the stories about each of the six films here, Heylin shows that after _Kane_, Welles directed some fascinating films whose flaws are not due to his own inability to complete them, but to his inability to complete them in his fashion.  _The Magnificent Ambersons_, _The Stranger_, _The Lady from Shanghai_, _Macbeth_, and finally _Touch of Evil_ are all covered here in fine detail, and their individual problems laid out.<br /><br />One of the sound ideas that Heylin stresses is that not all the complaints the studios had against Welles ought to have been based on their financial worries.  It is true that Welles didn't care much about making money, nor did he take pains to get the money men on his side in his endeavors.  Welles could, when he wanted, work fast and inexpensively; _Kane_, for instance, was not a particularly expensive movie, and its glorious effects are all the more wonderful for being, on the whole, simple and cheap.  Welles could film many pages of script in a single take, using combinations of shots that could compress ideas in an economic model any studio would embrace.  He was certainly difficult to work with, self-indulgent and not only flouting Hollywood rules but disappearing from the studios at just the time when he should have been there to support his own versions of his films.  Heylin takes the stance, however, that Welles was over and over again a victim, and _Despite the System_ marshals an impressive collection of facts (shooting scripts, rewrites, memos, and of course, other authors' books of interpretation) to support such a view.  Against the system, Welles had considerable triumphs, but the subject here is his defeats, and they are told with sympathy; his admirers will read this book with a heartbreaking sense of loss.of loss.	2005-06-13

Famous apparitions have included the one that asked Bernadette Soubirous in 1858 to dig into the grotto at Lourdes, from which spouted a spring, from which sprang all sorts of miraculous healings.  There were Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Fatima.  There was a decline in such sightings in the mid-twentieth century, especially around the secularization of the sixties.  But Laura Zink of Vermont hears and sees Mary and Jesus daily, and gets messages from them, and has put up a website so that anyone could read the words of the day.  And she is far from the only one doing so; people are responding to visits of Mary more than ever before, and at least part of the reason for this is that the internet is making it acceptable (or trendy) for them to do so.  In a wonderful anthropological tour of one specific aspect of the internet, _The Internet and the Madonna: Religious Visionary Experience on the Web_ (University of Chicago Press), Paolo Apolito explains that the other reason for the boom in Virgin-sighting was her appearance starting in 1981 at Medjugorje in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but even that visit has so many citations and pages on the Web that it has become far more influential that it ever could have in pre-internet days.  Is the proliferation of this aspect of religion on the web changing the way people practice religion or think about miracles?<br /><br />Apolito explains that technologizing the visionary and the signs and wonders that have an ancient tradition has indeed weakened the institution of the church.  It is very seldom that priests and authorities of the church have a personal presence on the web or in chat rooms, for instance.  There is no way of controlling visionaries, of course, and the visionary can set up a web page, it gets linked to other Marianist pages, and it is a world story advanced by those of similar beliefs and untouched by the church hierarchy.  What is more, web sites may be set up to promote visionaries and visions while criticizing church officials who are not sufficiently enthusiastic about them.  Such niceties of prior eras as parish life or the involvement of the local church in helping out its neighbors are seldom mentioned.  Sometimes the visions reinforce each other, but often they contradict, undercut, or even debunk each other.  This sort of immediate interaction between particular visions, their visionaries, and their fans was never possible before, and those navigating such sites will look in vain for firm points of reference.  Believers can further be inspired by digital representations not only of light effects, but of statues that cry, paintings that come to life, a photograph that has an actual heartbeat, and other remarkable manifestations.  Apolito has found significant problems in web navigation that would frustrate or endanger what he calls \\"the worshipful surfer,\\" and he gives advice on surfing safely.  He gives many examples of how those seeking devout sites might, by a few mere clicks, be taken to anti-Catholic or even pornographic sites.<br /><br />Apolito has written an academic tome that is often dense and scholarly, but considering the liveliness and immediacy of its subject, is never dull.  The original was written in Italian, and the translator (Antony Shugaar) has taken pains to try to preserve the wit in the original.  Most of the websites Apolito has visited are American, since the US is has had the biggest burst anywhere of visionary phenomena.  \\"If  the Virgin Mary now speaks English, she speaks it with a decidedly American accent,\\" he writes.  Though much of the book, especially the descriptions of some of the web pages, is funny, Apolito is an anthropologist who has written before on apparitions and is not at all condescending about them.  He has fulfilled his charge of documenting the activities of this part of the Internet, and says little about the validity of the beliefs of those involved.  It is clear from his documentation, though, that the Internet itself is limiting the power and the influence of the formal church as the visionaries become more influential; the visionaries continue to increase in number as the Internet attracts more followers to them and more copy-cats.  There will be an increase in the number of people viewing the world the mystic's way; this will not please skeptics, of course, but it should not please the church, either.olved.

In World War II, the largest and the longest court martial was one dealing with prisoner abuse.  The prisoners were surely abused in the riot that sparked the court martial; one was hung.  But the judgement in the trial, now largely forgotten, was an unfair one tainted by the racial prejudice of the time.  In _On American Soil: How Justice Became a Casualty of World War II_ (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill), Jack Hamann has revised his original story, a one-hour documentary about the murder and court martial, described the event as the court martial had discovered it.  The description was not true.  Fifteen years after his first report, he found the records of the abandoned Fort Lawton, near Seattle; all military installations keep lots of paperwork, but the orphaned files of the defunct installation were only to be found in the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, and only recently had some of the documents been declassified.<br /><br />Strangely, the incident may have happened because of the way the Americans were bending over backwards to treat the Italian POWs fairly.  Those at Ft. Lawton had cool weather, good food, comfortable quarters, and privileges of visiting in downtown Seattle.  Many Americans resented that Italian prisoners were mollycoddled while those who had defeated them had to fight on.  Near the POW barracks were those for \\"Negro troops\\" who required their own segregated quarters for eating and sleeping.  On 14 August 1944, black soldiers rioted, probably at least partially as a result of comparisons to the POWs' lot contrasted to their own.  Several POWs were wounded, and the body of Private Guglielmo Olivotto was found hanging from a tree the next morning.  The point of the court martial was to assign punishment for those who had rioted and committed the murder, but Brigadier General Elliot Cooke, a troubleshooter assigned to look into the event immediately afterwards, had come to some conclusions beforehand.  His eventual report castigated inept leadership at the fort, and especially criticized how evidence had been lost.  Cooke's voluminous report showed that it was unlikely that Olivotto had been hung by blacks in the frenzy of the riot, but it did not deter the Army prosecutor brought from Texas, Lieutenant Colonel Leon Jaworski (more famous for winning the Supreme Court decision that ultimately led to Nixon's resignation).<br /><br />Though the defense attorneys demanded to see Cooke's report, the report that Jaworski was using for prosecution, this was never allowed, crippling the defense's efforts.  Some of the defendants were found innocent, but three were found guilty of the lynching; their sentences were eventually reduced to three or five years as a result of post-war clemency.  In 1948, President Truman signed the order that all races would be equally treated in the armed services.  The Ft. Lawton riot and subsequent trial were a step on the road leading from a Jim Crow society.  Hamann cannot finger a particular culprit in the hanging; neither could Cooke or Jaworski, and the evidence just isn't there, but he indicates that a white military policeman who found the body in the morning may well have done the murder and depended upon the Army to blame the rioters.  There can be nothing but speculation on the matter, but it is no matter of speculation that the trial reflected the unfairness of its times.  Hamann's text is good as a court drama, but it is especially useful in describing the era's POW issues and treatment of black soldiers.rioted and committed the murder, but Brigadier General Elliot Cooke, a troubleshooter assigned to look into the event immediately afterwards, had come to some conclusions beforehand.

For most people, there is only one name that comes to mind, Stradivarius (or in non-Latin form, Stradivari).  It is not so surprising that the name lives on: \\"More than 250 years after his death, Stradivari's violins and cellos remain the best in the world.\\"  So writes Tony Faber in _Stradivari's Genius: Five Violins, One Cello, and Three Centuries of Enduring Perfection_ (Random House).  The master made more than a thousand instruments and six hundred are documented as still surviving.  Faber has chosen six Strads upon which to fasten a story of art, history, and science.  He admits they aren't the most celebrated instruments, nor are they all now used by famous players (in fact, only two are being played at all).  But in examining them, we get an idea of what makes the brand so special, and why they are so fervently beloved by listeners and players, and sometimes so firmly locked up by museums and collectors that they cannot come out and play.<br /><br />Stradivari was born in 1644, in or near the Amati family home, Cremona, Italy.  He lived to be 93, working all his years, and fathered eleven children, but not a family dynasty of instrument makers.  His instruments, mainly violins and cellos, but also a few violas and a single harp, were valued in his own lifetime, and he was wealthy.  The instruments were eventually perfect for playing in large halls because of their ability to project their sound.  It was as if Stradivari predicted that larger halls and a romantic sound were going to come into permanent fashion.  At least partially because of Stradivari, violins have a prominence as the chief instrument of the orchestra.  Faber follows the fortunes of five of Stradivari's violins - the _Lipinski_, the _Viotti_, the _Messiah_, the _Paganini_ and the _Khevenhuller_ - and of one cello, the _Davidov_ (now played by Yo Yo Ma).  Stradivari didn't name his instruments; they acquired names usually from famous owners.  Not the Messiah!  The way it got its name is typical of anecdotes in this book.  The instruments have all been sold and handed down many times (some of them have holes in their provenance, periods of time when no one knows where they were).  The yet-to-be-named _Messiah_ was in possession of a certain dealer, one Luigi Tarisio, a carpenter and violinist who loved instruments from Cremona.  He made trips to Paris to sell off parts of his collection (sometimes with \\"a little judicious forgery,\\" as he was a bit of a trickster), but he teased potential Parisian purchasers by not bringing along what he told them was a perfect 1716 Stradivarius.  During one such visit, the violinist Delphin Alard exclaimed in exasperation, \\"So, your violin is like the Messiah, always expected and it never appears.\\"  The name stuck, and the _Messiah_ eventually appeared, of course, but it almost never made a sound.  More than any other Strad, its lifetime has included being owned without being played.<br /><br />That controversy was settled by science, but there has been surprisingly little scientific capacity to answer the big question: What makes these instruments so good?  There are lots and lots of theories, and it is worth speculating about, because if there is a secret, it can be followed and instruments of this quality can be made again.  Perhaps it is the varnish; no other part of the violin, and of Stradivari's violins in particular, has been argued about so much.  Yes, a bad varnish can deaden a violin's sound; but can good varnish actually enhance the tone?  And what varnish did Stradivari use?  We don't know.  Electron microscopy has revealed that there is Pozzolana earth, a volcanic ash, between the wood and the varnish; is it the key?  Perhaps it was that the spruce was floated down the river for transportation, a soaking that road transportation subsequently eliminated.  Or maybe it was deliberately soaked in salt water.  There are, Faber shows, just too many variables to test.  Even if test violins could be made to test all variables, they would still have to be played for long enough by good enough players to bring out their tone, and they would have to age fifty or a hundred years.  Such requirements mock the capacity of the scientific method.  The career of one violin here, the _Lipinski_, demonstrates the need for an answer, though; it was played for two hundred years, and restored, and revarnished, and internally patched.  Perhaps all the work was necessary, but the sound understandably diminished, and since its last sale in 1962, it has not been heard from.  Violins are machines for making sounds, and like all machines, they wear out, even the finest ones.  It is thus fascinating and sad that our technological capacities have not been able to unlock Stradivari's secrets.  Centuries later, no one is building instruments better than these, the ones that shaped the world's musical history.t violins could be made to test all variables, they would still have to be played for long enough by good enough players to bring out their tone, and they would have to age fifty or a hundred years.

The movies of his only real competitor for silent film clown, Charlie Chaplin, are usually marred by sentimentality, but Keaton was having none of that.  As Edward McPherson writes, in _Buster Keaton: Tempest in a Flat Hat_ (Newmarket Press), \\"Keaton's films are witty, beautiful, unsentimental, moving, and - most of all - funny.\\"  McPherson writes that his book is \\"merely a fan's notes,\\" a celebration of Keaton's work.  As such, almost all its pages are lovingly devoted to Keaton's films of the twenties.  There was a Keaton after the silent film days were over, and he did make a triumph over various adversities, but his silent shorts and full-length films are wonderful, and are still being mined as examples of timing and technical wizardry.  This is not a full biography, but a celebration, and it is all the better for that.<br /><br />Young Keaton joined his parents in vaudeville performances.  He literally joined them by wandering onstage; the parents tried tying him offstage or putting him into a trunk, but it turned out that the best way to keep an eye on him was to bring him into the act.  The usual skit involved Joe's helter-skelter efforts to discipline his son, and Keaton simply was tossed around on the stage, thrown into the orchestra pit, or used as a mop.  It sounds rough, but Keaton was a ham and loved it, and always denied that he had anything to complain about.  Fatty Arbuckle was a fan of the Keatons' act, and had already \\"borrowed\\" some of their gags for celluloid. When Keaton wandered into Arbuckle's studio in New York in 1917, he was invited to take part in a scene involving a mess of gooey molasses and being knocked for a backwards summersault from a store out into the street.  Arbuckle recognized a movie natural immediately, and Buster signed on to the company.  Arbuckle's collaborative and freeform way of making gags was just what Keaton wanted, and what he instituted when he started making his own movies in Hollywood.  McPherson describes all of the great films here, with descriptions of how the stunts and the accomplished trick photography were done.  It all ground down when Keaton lost his independent studio and went to work for MGM, which wanted scripts, budgets, and shooting schedules; the jolly, funny atmosphere of a team intoxicated by making comic movies evaporated.  The other great impediment to Keaton's way of working was sound.  The days of hooking the camera to a boat, car, or train and letting it go were over.  Keaton was shoe-horned into drawing-room, all-talking productions.<br /><br />McPherson describes but does not detail the years thereafter, when Keaton had embarrassing journeyman jobs as his only outlet, and then cameos in such films as _Sunset Boulevard_, and even in beach blanket movies.  His troubles with alcoholism (eventually conquered) and two difficult marriages (the third one was charmed) are here.  Here also, however, is mention of his lucrative career making guest spots and commercials on television, a medium that many moviemakers hated or dreaded but which he appreciated as the latest technology.  Collectors ensured that his films were seen again in the fifties and sixties, and he got lifetime honors from the Academy and other appreciative organizations, so that when he died in 1966, he knew that his astonishing output from the twenties was going to be appreciated by every subsequent generation.  As a appreciation of Keaton's work, McPherson's book is sweet and generous, and will send readers out to the video store to do their own appreciating.d what he instituted when he started making his own movies in Hollywood.

It was painted in the fifteenth century by Paolo Uccello, as a measure of respect to a Florentine fighter.  Oddly, the figure is that of an Englishman, not an Italian, and one who fought for Florence simply because it was paying better than any of the many other sides during his tumultuous times.  Sir John Hawkwood died in 1394, and in _The Devil's Broker: Seeking Gold, God, and Glory in Fourteenth-Century Italy_ (Fourth Estate), Frances Stonor Saunders tells what she can of his life.  It must have been a tough task to get this history together.  Hawkwood was a military leader in a turbulent continent, and \\"long cultivated an aura of inscrutability.\\"  There are two brief letters he wrote in 1394, which happen to be the oldest extant letters in English, but he was, as Saunders admits, a man of few words.  This is necessarily an incomplete portrait; we can't tell too much about his relationships with his family nor with those (sometimes on opposing sides) who hired him.  Saunders has, however, thoroughly steeped herself in details of the history of an extraordinary time, and delights in laying them out at length.  She mentions several times the famous work covering the same period in another fashion, Barbara Tuchman's _A Distant Mirror_, and anyone who enjoyed one will enjoy the other.<br /><br />Hawkwood was born in Essex in 1320, and by the time he was forty, he was poor and unnoteworthy, and had a criminal record.  Perhaps he had no other options than to become a mercenary soldier, a freebooter, and by luck or skill, he became the best there was.  He was ready to be hired to the side that had the best offer for him, and to go over to the opposite side if it beat the first offer.  He was amoral and greedy.  When a pair of friars greeted him with \\"God give you peace,\\" he snarled back at them, \\"God take away your alms.\\"  In peace, a soldier for hire has no trade.  During Hawkwood's thirty year career, \\"...popes and princes would cringe before his approach, denounce him as the Devil incarnate, and rush to hire him nonetheless.\\"  As the head of his White Company, he had a reputation as the ablest military commander of the middle ages.  The climax of his ruthlessness and cruelty came in the destruction of the Italian town Cesena in 1377.  He happened at the time to be working for Pope Gregory XI.  Gregory had been in France, and was returning the papacy to Italy, the subjugation of which was his obsession.  Gregory took no steps to distance himself from Hawkwood's slaughter of 8,000 civilians who had given up their weapons because their cardinal told them to.  Hawkwood was particularly fortunate in his final battle, where his troops had to retreat back to Padua.  His army had been defeated, but he managed the \\"swift and precipitous flight\\" of the retreat so adroitly that it won him more fame than his greatest victories.  It was greeted as a miracle, but it wasn't his first one.  In combat against Verona in 1386, he had confronted the problem of poisoned wells by dipping into them the unicorn's horn he happened to have, and the water was purified.<br /><br />These are the sorts of detail that Saunders obviously loves, and her book is enriched by digressions that examine the ways of life during this part of the middle ages.  One of the players in the political and religious warfare was Saint Catherine of Siena, an anorexic who had frankly disgusting habits of pious degradation, but used them to become the only woman of power described here.  Mystically married to Jesus, she was given by him his foreskin to wear as a wedding ring.  Among the many engines of war described here was the stone-throwing trebuchet which had a throwing arm of fifty feet; it was called the _cacciapreti_ or \\"priest breaker\\".  Rotting animal carcasses were often used instead of stones, and pigs were deemed to be of the best aerodynamics.  In discussing Hawkwood's marriage, we learn about advice given to wives on the art of catching flies to keep a vermin-free home, and the religious proscriptions on sex for married people, which would have reduced couplings to less than once a week, in the approved male-dominant position only.  It is a strange, confusing, and distant time, but the wealth of detail Saunders has given reminds us it was a time of greed, warfare, starvation, religious orthodoxy and controversy, and cleverness without wisdom.  As Dickens said, of two other periods, the times were very like our own.out advice given to wives on the art of catching flies to keep a vermin-free home, and the religious proscriptions on sex for married people, which would have reduced couplings to less than once a week, in the approved male-dominant position only.

The Abbasid Caliphate held sway afterwards for almost two hundred years.  It included the reign of Harun al-Rashid, who became famous within the legends of the Arabian Nights.  In _When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World: The Rise and Fall of Islam's Greatest Dynasty_ (Da Capo Press), Hugh Kennedy has described his share of eunuchs, harems, slave girls, viziers (both sycophantic and traitorous), and lavish palaces, so although those knowing the legends will find few djinns or flying carpets, there is plenty of Arabic exoticism.  There is also, as Kennedy says, a \\"fair share of, to put it bluntly, booze and sex.\\"  Kennedy, who has superb academic credentials in Arabic Studies, almost apologizes to pious Muslims, who may find this an irreverent account of glorious years of their history, and to his colleagues, who may think the book frivolous.  He has deliberately concentrated on \\"dramatic events, striking personalities, and the trivia of everyday life.\\"  He says that he can do so because \\"... the writers of the ninth and tenth centuries knew that their rulers had their fair share of human frailties and they were quite happy to describe them.\\"<br /><br />Besides booze and sex, there is plenty of blood here, shed in sometimes imaginative and cruel ways.  The account of conflicts largely concerns the transfer of power from one caliph to another.  Although some caliphs were more patrons of the arts than others, the period was rich in historic writing (from which Kennedy has directly drawn) and in poetry.  Poems might be sung on intimate evenings between the caliph and his musicians, but there was no means of musical notation, so while we have the poems, we can never know what the music sounded like.  Similarly, we have lost the architecture of the time.  There are no ancient temples like those at Karnak: \\"The remains of Ur and Babylon are little more than piles of mud, comprehensible only to the specialists.\\"  The problem is that the region around Baghdad was terrific for agricultural production (and resultant wealth) but there was no good building stone.  Nonetheless, the palaces were gargantuan, sprawling structures, encompassing gardens, courtyards, baths, mosques, and more.  The women were not all slaves, and being taken into the harem was a blessing for many, a career choice for girls with few other options.  There were moralists at the time that complained about the activities of the harem, and its expense, and they have blamed it for the eventual fall of the caliphate.  Kennedy shows, however, that the harem was a politically stabilizing influence, with mistresses helping viziers who had fallen from grace; there was financial stabilizing, too, from the richness of the harem as a source of stock valuables which could be cashed in, useful in a society where borrowing was impossible.<br /><br />The number of major and minor players within these pages is daunting, and battle scenes are often confusing.  Kennedy relates that in the heat of one battle, a defender \\"... became confused about which caliph he was supposed to be supporting, and called out for Muctazz rather than Mustacin by mistake.\\"  He lost his head figuratively, and then lost it literally because of his mistake, killed on the spot with his head turned into a trophy.  Kennedy jokes that this poor man's confusion is something with which readers of this book may well sympathize.  However, as confusing as the battles may be, there is a richness to the descriptions of the culture and atmosphere that is quite valuable.  After all, readers will find here lively and even aggressive disputants about such things that seemed vital to them as whether the Koran was created or had existed since the beginning of time; heresies involving both positions were passionately denounced.  Here, too, are the beginnings of the fight between the Sunnis and the Shiites, a conflict which still affects the world.  The legacy of the Abbasid court, Kennedy maintains, remains enormously powerful, even so many centuries ago.  Its celebrated power and unity provide not only nostalgia, but inspiration, and it deserves to be understood.  After all, it inspires Osama bin Laden, who aims to re-establish the caliphate.Shiites, a conflict which still affects the world.

Or at least that is a purpose, and it was the main purpose before such talents as the Impressionists insisted that artistic expression was best displayed in dazzling colors and blurred shapes.  The depiction in a painting was usually at some remove from reality; if you saw a painting of a landscape, for instance, you did not usually get the impression that the landscape was right there within the rectangular frame.  Throughout the history of painting, however, there have been those who have gone for a higher level of realism, and paradoxically, a higher degree of deception, fooling the eye into thinking that what is painted is what is real.  In _A Trick of the Eye: Trompe l'Oeil Masterpieces_ (Prestel), Eckhard Hollmann and J&uuml;rgen Tesch have collected fifty paintings (and sculptures) that demonstrate tricky artistry.  It is a large format book, with twenty-four small reproductions to illustrate a useful essay on the history and range of the subject, and seventy pages of large reproductions of specific works with commentary.  The covers of the book are particularly attractive.  The front is entirely taken up with \\"Escape from Criticism,\\" an 1874 painting of a picture in a frame; the frame is exactly the size of the book, and emerging from it is a boy, with a surprised look as if he is coming to life out of his oil painting.  The back of the book is \\"Reversed Painting\\" of 1670, showing the wooden frame of a canvas, with tacks and even an auction number on it.  My wife had already seen the book, but last night it was sitting on a table with the back up, and she was surprised to see that it was a book face down, not a painting face down.  While I was writing this review, a friend came in and saw a lizard in the corner of an otherwise blank page, and was startled until she realized it was only printed there, a reproduction of a detail of an oil painting of 1660.  Trompe l'oeil works.<br /><br />The tradition of trompe l'oeil goes back at least to ancient Greece.  Hollmann and Tesch start their essay by retelling the legend of the painting competition between Zeuxis and Parrhasios.  The judges were impressed that the grapes painted by Zeuxis were so real that birds flew down to peck at them.  However, they found that Parrhasios had draped his entry in a curtain; when Zeuxis attempted to pull the curtain back, he only got fresh paint on his fingers.  Guess who won the competition.  Some of the paintings reproduced here have the same trick.  \\"Still Life with Flowers\\" of 1658 is actually the work of two different artists, one an expert in painting flowers and the other an expert in painting fabric.  There is a painting of an array of flowers in the main body of the painting, but there is also a painted rod at the top (held by painted hooks) from which a painted curtain is suspended, having been pulled to the right to reveal the \\"real\\" painting of the flowers.  Frequent here are pictures of quodlibets; a quodlibet is like a bulletin board, upon which familiar objects are tacked or suspended on ribbons.  Reproduced here is \\"Quodlibet\\" of 1666 by Samuel Van Hoogstraten, showing a chain, medallion, comb, feather, scissors and more, in an orderly jumble.  Murals are included on many pages here.  A real shocker is the side of a bank in Columbia, South Carolina, which has been painted so as to dissolve the solidity of the wall (would this decrease patrons' trust in the bank?) into a roadway tunnel; the painting is called \\"Tunnel Vision\\", and it looks as if you could just drive into the tunnel and into the sunset beyond.<br /><br />There are pictures here of the works of Duane Hansen, who for decades has been making polyester resin casts of frumpy human beings; his \\"Security Guard\\" (1990) is sometimes asked for directions.  There are Warhol Brillo boxes that look like, well, Brillo boxes.  And the final photo in this delightful book shows a three-dimensional, life sized Superman sitting on a Brillo box and posed within the gallery in just the posture of Rodin's \\"The Thinker\\".  It looks entirely convincing, and indeed, it is an actual person sitting motionless, as part of an exhibition \\"The Living Museum\\".

It may be that red is a special color, with associations of blood or anger or desire, but as a mere pigment, it isn't anything unusual.  That was not the case in past centuries.  In fact, red bankrolled the Spanish empire and prompted the growth of science at the expense of belief in an all-explaining Bible.  It is surprising that a history can be written about a color, but in _A Perfect Red: Empire, Espionage, and the Quest for the Color of Desire_ (HarperCollins), Amy Butler Greenfield has opened up an extraordinary story, and one that still touches us today.  It is the history of our interaction with Dactylopius coccus, an insect that parasitizes a particular cactus in tropical America, an insect better known as cochineal.  It turns out to be one of the most important insects in history.<br /><br />There were reds before the New World was discovered.  Dyers and artists were able to make plants and minerals yield russets and orange-reds fairly easily, but real red cloth was hard to manufacture.  A more vivid red could be made from insects, like oak-kermes, that could be killed with vinegar and steam, and packed up to sell to dyers the world over.  The dyers didn't know it, but these insects contain what is now known as carminic acid, a powerful red dye.  It is this dye that the cochineal insect has, too, but it is far more powerful and less fastened to troublesome lipids.  The conquistadors saw the colors that were produced in cloth in the new world, and brought back the dye to Spain starting in 1519.  By 1580, kermes reds were out and cochineal reds were in.  Spain profited from many New World finds, but the new dye was a chief one.  Even pirates were glad to rob Spanish galleons for it.  Commercial espionage was involved in trying to transplant it to other colonies.  Cochineal provided naturalists with a problem in classification.  As they did with other New World novelties, Europeans tried to find categorical guidance from the Bible, but the book did not help settle the question of whether the little pellets from which the dye was made came from plants, animals, or even something in between (a \\"wormberry\\").  Classic writers didn't help, either.  Greenfield discusses the microscopy of Leeuwenhoek and others which eventually helped settle the issue in a scientific way.<br /><br />The cutthroat competition in cochineal ended when William Perkin invented his famous mauve dye from coal tar products in 1856, leading to a revolution in dye chemistry.  The market for the insects collapsed, but never vanished.  There are those who favor \\"natural dyes\\" (although this group has a subcategory of people who would not countenance killing even insects for them).  Bakers used to use cochineal \\"to make the apple and the gooseberry outblush the cherry and the plum,\\" and it still is used in candy, ice cream, lipstick, and much more.  (Perhaps we are only squeamish about eating insects if they are whole.)  The main supplier these days is Peru, but there is competition from other countries, among them the ones where the cloak-and-dagger operations had transplanted the cactus and insects centuries ago.  Greenfield's detailed study casts a welcome rubicund light on in biology, history, fashion, chemistry, and world economics.assification.

You would be wrong twice.  That flag never was the national flag of the Confederacy and never flew over the governmental buildings of Confederacy.  It also never was the Stars and Bars, which was a very different looking flag that was indeed the initial (and only the initial) national flag of the Confederacy, but which came to be detested by many southerners who thought it too much like the Stars and Stripes.  The familiar star-studded diagonal blue cross on a red background is properly named in the title of John M. Coski's book, _The Confederate Battle Flag: America's Most Embattled Emblem_ (Belknap Press), a full account of the flag's history and current status.  The problem with symbols, as any English major will tell you, is that they can mean too many things, so that anyone deploying a symbol may intend a different meaning from everyone who sees it, while the viewers will differ among themselves.  The ambiguity of this particular symbol has led to anguish and bitterness, but Coski, the Historian at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia, has written a beautifully even-handed account that examines the foundations of the bitterness (many of them far more recent than the Civil War) and even extends hope that the symbol \\"... might generate genuine insights into the complex issues of race and states' rights in the American past, present, and future.\\"<br /><br />The actual Stars and Bars, the real national flag of the Confederacy, was approved by its Provisional Congress in 1861, but was too similar to the Stars and Stripes.  General P. G. T. Beauregard himself at the first major battle of the Civil War, Manassas, could not figure out whether the flag of an approaching force was friend or foe.  He resolved to adopt a battle flag, so that there would be a war flag and a peace flag.  Individual battle units in the Confederate forces had idiosyncratic flags, but the battle flag quickly caught on, and has been the symbol of the Confederacy ever since, although it usually is spread from the actual square into the rectangular version in popular reproductions.  The Confederate Constitution guaranteed that the institution of slavery would continue.  It is clear that slavery is one of the things the South was fighting to preserve, but not the one thing.  Their battle flag is rightly associated with the fight to preserve slavery, but as Coski points out, the flag also stood for Southerners' defense of their own view of constitutional liberties and southern customs.  What may be surprising to modern readers is that the battle flag was not a popular icon until the 1940s.  It really made a political debut with the 1948 Dixiecrat Party and the run for the presidency by Strom Thurmond.  It is thus legitimately associated with political resistance to segregation.  The Ku Klux Klan also started featuring it in the 1940s, and the Klan's advocacy of the flag has been an embarrassment to sensible southerners ever since.<br /><br />The flag has become a universal symbol of protest; the Sons of Confederate Veterans got requests for it from citizens of former Eastern bloc countries, and it was present at student protests in Yugoslavia.  Since it is so easily taken up as a symbol for causes in the spectrum from states' rights to racism to race hatred, the NAACP turned to the flag issue in the 1980s, and was successful in some campaigns to have its use restricted from governmental endorsement.  Coski has given specific chapters on its use in state flags, public schools, and colleges.  It is only proper to understand that the flag does have a checkered past, it has been used by those with vile agendas, and that it is also viewed with affection by those Southerners who say \\"you can't erase history.\\"  Detractors and defenders willresolve this conflict only by intelligent compromise, and fortunately, some of the history Coski has given includes shared mutual understanding both that the flag has an important place in American history and political thought and that it has stood for causes that now even most Southerners understand are reprehensible.  This useful and balanced history ought to help both sides of the controversy see the issues more clearly and generously.s will resolve this conflict only by intelligent compromise, and fortunately, some of the history Coski has given includes shared mutual understanding both that the flag has an important place in American history and political thought and that it has stood for causes that now even most Southerners understand are reprehensible.

The problem was one that has become familiar; our capacity to ship species from one continent to another has meant that we can have much more variety in our plants and animals, but it also endangers the homebodies that have to meet the newcomers.  In _The Botanist and the Vintner: How Wine Was Saved for the World_ (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill), Christy Campbell writes that in the 1840s, trade in grape vines proceeded with \\"no barriers, no inspectorate, no concept of biological quarantine.\\"  The result was that tiny aphids with an extraordinary life cycle made their entry from America into France, and found the sap of the French grape vines exactly to their liking.  Campbell has told the story of this disaster much like a mystery, and indeed, the vintners who saw their vines rapidly wither had no idea what was happening.  A voracious caterpillar had threatened their plants two decades before, and a fungus had come shortly afterwards, but no one had seen a pattern of vine death like this one, with the leaves rapidly drying and curling up.  There were only guesses about what was going on; too much rain, smoke in the air or iron in the soil from locomotives, and even emanations from telegraph lines were held to be responsible.  Perhaps it was as simple as soil erosion or bad weather.  No one knew.<br /><br />The problem was an aphid usually called phylloxera.  It took a long time to finger this particular culprit for many reasons, among which was that the tiny insect was not found on the dead vines.  The simple explanation was that the aphids sucked all the sap they could out of the roots of the plant, and with nothing further to eat, moved on.  Eventually, entomologists worked out the confusing life cycle of the aphid, which included several different forms of adults, some laying eggs on leaves, some laying eggs on the roots, and others having flying sexual forms.  The aphids had been brought to France from America.  The aphids and the American vines had long ago drawn a truce; aphids still infested the plants, but the plant developed mechanisms to keep alive through the assault, and the aphids settled in to feeding steadily off the living rather than killing the plants outright.  The French vines had no such protection, so the aphids sucked them dry and moved on.  Before finding an elegant solution to the problem, vintners simply had to pull up the dead vines and start growing something else, but that did not keep them from trying fanciful remedies, especially when the government offered a reward.  Some proposed setting vials of holy water from Lourdes among the withering vines.  Putting potatoes or frogs into the soil to draw away the poison had equal effect.  Snail slime was championed, as were marching bands and a \\"beating wheelbarrow.\\"  Insecticides were useless.  The problem had come from America, and the solution was from America as well.  The solution was to use the root stocks of the American vines (vines which bore grapes the French considered vastly inferior), but to graft upon them the French vines which had been cultivated for centuries.<br /><br />Campbell has told an enthralling story of science at work.  It is a true success story, but attempts to control  nature seldom result in total or permanent success.  The final section of his book reveals that outbreaks continue to occur and that the insects can develop new strains to which the old solution does not apply.  Perhaps the rootstocks can be immunized.  Perhaps, in these days of genetic modification, the genes from American vines that co-evolved with the phylloxera could be somehow inserted into the French varieties.  GM wines are probably inevitable.  The wine world used its wits to battle one pest successfully a century ago, but there will be others, and the story is not all told yet.g flying sexual forms.

He also was a prime mover in a social change that has affected the nation and the world ever since.  He is forgotten now, but ought to be remembered, and Mim Eichler Rivas tells his story in _Beautiful Jim Key: The Lost History of A Horse and a Man Who Changed the World_ (William Morrow).  It is a great story of an extraordinarily close association between a horse and his owner (to say nothing of the dog), and a mystifying account of the horse's capacity seemingly to perform at human intellectual levels.  It also involves a shift of thinking for a nation that had regarded horses as beasts of burden to be used and used up, but eventually came to understand that they were more than muscle and that they benefited from their interactions with humans if handled with patience and kindness.<br /><br />The human hero of the book is Doctor William Key, who was born a slave in Tennessee in 1833.  As he was growing up in Shelbyville, people realized he had a special way with animals and was able to train dogs and roosters in ways that would amaze his friends.  He eventually became a self-taught veterinarian, and also accompanied his young masters into the Civil War, fighting for the confederacy.  Though his war exploits involve tall tales of being a spy, surgeon, and veterinarian for both sides, it was clear he was skillfully playing those around him to save his own life and those of his masters.  Born to a mare Doc owned was a foal in 1889, which Doc called Jim, and gave him the family name, but Jim Key was a sad disappointment.  \\"For almost a year I had no hope for him.  He was the most spindled, shank-legged animal I ever did see.\\"  But Jim had personality; he liked to open doors and learned to act on command easily.  He loved performing before an audience.  He loved Doc, and could not bear to be without him at night; Doc set up a cot for himself in Jim's stall, and that is how they always slept.  In their travels, Jim was adopted by a mongrel dog Monk who never formally performed in their act, but who slept on Jim's back every night, and spent much of the day there as well, expressing a bias against reporters.  With the help of a promoter, the mercurial Albert Rogers, Doc and Jim moved into the big time.  Doc spent an enormous amount of time working with the horse, and the descriptions of tricks accomplished here defies simple explanation.  Jim was famous for being able to spell; an audience member would tell Jim a name, and Jim would pick out letter cards, placing them to spell out the name.  He did long division.  He cited Bible quotations by chapter and verse.  He could make change, and the National Cash Register Company sponsored him and made him a special large-sized register with leather pulls instead of keys to push.<br /><br />However Jim and Doc managed his performances, thousands of people came away convinced that the horse was educated, perhaps at the level of a twelve-year-old child.  The act was a sensation; they played at state fairs, at the largest halls in big cities at which they reliably broke attendance records, and at national expositions where they were the biggest draw.  Rogers the promoter arranged for the exposure, but he also arranged for Jim to be a figurehead for the emerging American Humane Association.  Thousands of schoolchildren signed the Jim Key Pledge: \\"I promise always to be kind to animals.\\"  The philosophy of such kindness was born in elite drawing rooms, but Jim and Doc brought it to everyone.  Perhaps not every animal was the intellectual equivalent of Jim Key, everyone realized, but it became not so radical to think that animals had some capacity to think and feel, and that they deserved kind treatment.  This was a significant shift in our thinking and in our humanity.  Rivas has told a charming, inspiring story of a horse, who through a devoted and original trainer, made us better humans.iring story of a horse, who through a devoted and original trainer, made us better humans. <br />	2005-05-10

Barrie and the Lost Boys: The Real Story Behind Peter Pan	Books	5	40	42	N	Y	The Many Origins of Peter Pan	With the release of the film _Neverland_ to critical and popular acclaim, most people got their first introduction to the life of the creator of Peter Pan, James Matthew Barrie.  Film biographies are notorious for their additions and deletions for dramatic or commercial purposes, and while _Neverland_ did fairly well in its telling of a limited part of the story, those who are interested in a larger and fuller picture will love reading _J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys: The Real Story behind Peter Pan_ (Yale University Press) by Andrew Birkin, in a recent new edition.  Birkin's work first came out in 1979, after his trilogy of television plays on the theme.  He says he is interested in filming an authentic Peter Pan, and he could be trusted to do so, when the original has already been turned into pantomime, cartoon, and the update by Robin Williams and Stephen Spielberg.  His loving, sad, and wonderfully illustrated biography shows him to be our leading authority on the story of Peter Pan and how it came to be told.<br /><br />Barrie was born in 1861 in the weaving village of Kirriemuir in Scotland.  When he was six, his older brother died, and Barrie realized that for their mother, the idealized elder brother would always be a boy of thirteen.  The theme of the boy who never grew up was to be a constant in Barrie's novels and plays.  He was notoriously quiet and shy, as he would be all his life, attracting little observation by others, but observing others constantly.  He became a journalist and then a tremendously successful novelist and playwright.  He married, but his real love was for children, and he and his wife (who left him for a lover fifteen years later) never had any.  The \\"lost boys\\" of the title, and the originals of those in Peter Pan, were the five sons of Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, whom he befriended within nearby Kensington Gardens.  The senior Davies were a model couple devoted to each other, but Barrie insinuated himself into the family by his overpowering sense of juvenile fun and by fostering the imaginations of the sons.  He became a staple of the family, discomforting the boys' father and causing lifelong resentment in their nursemaid.  The fantasy life he led with the boys in Kensington Gardens included dressing up in costume, and the many photographs reproduced here (frequently by Barrie himself) show the boys happily engaged in outdoor amateur theatricals.  They sharpened his memory and preoccupation for childhood and were the inspiration for his literary output.<br /><br />Boys do grow up, of course; George was killed in World War I, and the twenty-year-old Michael drowned with a fellow Oxford undergraduate in an accident or suicide pact.  Barrie was devastated; Peter observed that the Davies family had in the end brought him \\"so much more sorrow than happiness.\\"  Birkin's work is not a full biography, but an examination of his relationship with his five boys, and ends quickly after Michael's death.  Jack and Nico had prosperous lives, but Peter was troubled by his association with Barrie's masterpiece.  He was ragged at Eton for being \\"the real Peter Pan,\\" and that turned out to be his one link to fame.  He became a well known publisher, but when he threw himself under a train at the age of 63, the press noted the death of Peter Pan; he had  called _Peter Pan_ \\"that terrible masterpiece.\\"  Peter did amass a six-volume family history, upon which Birkin draws.  Birkin's other great sources are Barrie's published works, and his notebooks, which are available on Birkin's fine website, and the wonderful, touching pictures of some very photogenic boys often in costume.  Birkin is obviously devoted to his subject, and anyone interested in Peter Pan and Barrie's other writings, will love them more deeply after reading this penetrating portrait.y his overpowering sense of juvenile fun and by fostering the imaginations of the sons.

Lowry.  Surely, I thought, this little book can't be a serious evaluation of the conjunction of two never-to-be united subjects.  I was completely wrong.  Dr. Lowry, a retired psychiatrist and a historian of aspects of the Civil War, has thrown light on his two subjects, both of which are fascinating looked at in the light of the other.  Lowry points out that the subject of sex has been broached by historians of the famous expedition, but having been broached, it is mentioned in passing, as if to say, \\"Sure, they had syphilis, but on to our real story.\\"  This has meant that not all of the history of the expedition could be written, because: \\"The role of sex and venereal disease on the expedition has been trivialized, marginalized, downplayed.\\"  Venereal disease was not downplayed by the explorers themselves, who anticipated it realistically and treated it as best they could.  It was their way of facing a danger to their corps, \\"one that was in many ways as dangerous as grizzly bears, snakes, warfare, and slippery trails.\\"  They wrote about sex and venereal disease frequently in their journals, but their remarks are often not included in the many books about them.  This is especially ironic in that venereal disease may have played a role in Meriwether Lewis's ultimate sad deterioration and death.<br /><br />Lowry gives a brief history of gonorrhea and syphilis, especially of the latter, and says that they were most likely given to the Indians by the French, British, and Spanish adventurers that had visited the area.  Lewis and Clark knew this, and they took pains to be prepared.  They were professional soldiers, but as leaders of the expedition, they were expected to be physicians and pharmacists, too, although they had no training in the medical arts.  By the time of the expedition, the standard treatment was mercury in some form, which we now know as a poison.  It had side effects that were horrible, but it did seem to subdue the symptoms of syphilis which were more horrible still.  Lewis and Clark had to be prepared for all medical eventualities, as they would not find drugs or doctors on the way.  But a full fifteen percent of the drugs they brought with them were for gonorrhea or syphilis.  They were realists, who knew that the Indians had a far different view of sexuality than members of their expedition had, that there were many young men traveling with them, and that they would be gone for years.  The Indians continuously surprised them with open sexuality meant for barter or for ceremony.  A chief pleased with medical assistance, for instance, might offer the nighttime companionship of his wife or daughter.  Such companionship might simply be offered as hospitality to the newcomers.  The Indians were fascinated by York, Clark's slave, and on one occasion York was invited to a native home to convey his magic to the wife, while the husband stood guard outside to make sure the magic went on uninterrupted.<br /><br /> The historical evaluation of the medical condition of the men is complicated, in that although there were voluminous notes and memoirs of the expedition, not all symptoms or medical problems are documented.  Also, of course, exact diagnosis (with, say, blood tests) could not be done then and cannot be done retrospectively.  Lowry has tried to run down the medical fates of all the participants, some of whom certainly got venereal disease and were treated for it.  He can only speculate about what happened to Meriwether Lewis, but the intrepid hero did live only a few years after the expedition's return, years that were complicated by mood problems and confusion.  He was governor of Missouri during some of the time, but he was often absent from office, possibly taking a secret mercury cure.  He was seen by others as having a derangement, and toward the end suffered from psychotic delusions.  Lowry speculates that there may have been other causes, such as a mood disorder or alcoholism, but makes a reasonable case for neurosyphilis playing a role in Lewis's tragic early death.  Such a conclusion can only increase a reader's admiration for the courage these men showed in the service of their country, braving so many dangers that have long been acknowledged, and also the heretofore unacknowledged danger of the microorganisms they tried to fight as best they could.angement, and toward the end suffered from psychotic delusions.

Of course, in a perfect world there would be no need for medicine or doctors, much less the representatives of the big pharmacy companies whose job it is to influence doctors to prescribe their particular medications.  As a physician, I myself don't look at drug reps as a necessary evil.  Each does, after all, have detailed knowledge of one or two drugs that I am responsible for prescribing.  More importantly, reps provide samples, and for my patients, who are generally indigent, the samples represent a lifeline for those not yet on, say, Medicaid.  I got lots of insights from Reidy's rollicking book, one of which is that other doctors find samples important as well, not for the poor but rather as starters for patients who will buy their own prescriptions if the supply of samples works.  The larger revelations in Reidy's hugely entertaining book are not really complimentary to him or to Pfizer, the company about which he writes, or to drug reps in general, or to the medical profession.  I know what drug reps do from my role in the system, but for other readers, there will be even more revelations of secrets here than there were for me.  In the capitalist economy, we have not figured out the paradoxes of buying and selling health, and Reidy's book gives a small, detailed picture of some of the problems, with no suggestions for answers.<br /><br />Reidy graduated from Notre Dame, with a degree in English, not pharmacology or even any other science.  He did a spell in the military, and then he slacked.  He was eventually invited to consider working in pharmaceutical sales, and went to Pfizer's  \\"boot camp,\\" learning that Pfizer's drugs were far better than those of any competing manufacturer.  He was posted to a sales territory in Indiana, and began to make his rounds, using free food as a way of getting into the doctor's office behind the office staff.  He learned which doctors like to be chatted up on sports, Pfizer's stock values, or his dating experiences.  Reidy was simply good at his job.  He also learned to be good at faking being good at his job.  He learned how to fudge his visit books and sample signatures to make it seem he was making far more calls than he really was.

The rest of the book is just too weird to be believed; this means that Ronson is in his element, as he showed in his last book _Them_, a study of paranoid conspiracy addicts.  Those suspicious folks were laughable, and indeed there are many, many laughs to be enjoyed in reading this new work.  But each laugh is a sad one now, for Ronson details goony beliefs among those in power, those whom the government is paying to do our will.  They feel that \\"America, the great superpower, needed to be defended by people who actually had superpowers.\\"  Ronson has met with many of these warriors, found some who wanted to tell their stories and even brag about them, and with wonderful reportorial detachment has laid out the results.  If you have an ounce of common sense, you will be dismayed to learn that our taxes are going to military and intelligence officials who are making sincere attempts to walk through walls, turn invisible, stop an animal's heart by just staring at it, warp brains by subliminal stimulation, and more.  The waste is stupid enough, but Ronson shows how the doctrines have been part of the reason for the debacles at Waco and Abu Ghraib.  Laugh through this book, but see if each laugh does not make you a little more indignant over this stupidity.<br /><br />It was that bane of skeptics, Uri Geller, who put Ronson onto the scent in 2001.  Geller had claimed that he had been a consultant \\"psychic spy\\" working for U.S. intelligence.  In fact, he claimed that he still was.  From Geller, the trail goes to Major General Albert Stubblebine, who is quite serious about his own attempts to walk through walls.  Unfortunately, he has failed so far.  He attempted to convince Special Forces at Fort Bragg of the need for psychic healing, bending metal through merely thinking about it (&aacute; la Geller), or bursting the hearts of animals without physical contact.  Special Forces receives his ideas in silence, and say they don't even have access to animals on which he might try that last experiment.  But they lie.  They actually thought his ideas were excellent, and they had access to plenty of goats that had been deliberately de-bleated so that they would not cry out when such things as psychic heart-stopping were attempted on them.  Ronson talks with a guy who killed a goat, but he is distraught because he recently killed his guinea pig, too.  Other psychic spies were busy doing remote viewing, looking in on what General Manuel Noriega was up to in Panama.  It was a tough assignment, perhaps because Noriega took to wearing black ribbons on his ankles and placing the names of his enemies in his shoes so that they could not harm him.  One of the remote viewers named Major Ed Dames spent his off hours psychically spying on Loch Ness, and determined that the fabulous creature was nothing other than the ghost of a dinosaur.<br /><br />There is diverse madness here, tied together by Ronson's dry wit and his obvious incredulity about what government officials are revealing to him.  His investigation, as funny as it is, branches out into areas of sheer malevolence.  Someone desperately needs to tell all the would-be psychic warriors here to come back to Earth.  All of you: if you can do what you say, please, please get in touch with James Randi.  He will work with you on scientific tests of your abilities, and if you have real abilities, he will had you a million bucks, and you will have the thanks of a grateful nation.

Those of a more spiritual turn, however, take things further.  In _The Spirituality of Mazes and Labyrinths_ (Northstone), Gailand MacQueen has looked at his subjects from the view of a professor of Religious Studies and one who has held workshops featuring the lessons that can be learned from the labyrinth.  He features a historical evaluation of both mazes and labyrinths, and many interpretations of what they might mean for different cultures and times.  It is a book of only 128 pages, and as befits a subject of such visual interest, there pictures on almost every page.  There are also plenty of labyrinths to trace and mazes to solve.  This is a lovely book to spend some hours with.<br /><br />What is the difference between a labyrinth and a maze?  MacQueen tells the working definition difference.  A labyrinth is has one course, a convoluted path that once you start, if you simply continue following, you will get to the end, a goal in the center.  A maze has choices, alternate paths, with some leading to the goal and some leading elsewhere or to dead ends.  The simplicity of this distinction belies a complicated history.  Labyrinths came first, are found in many cultures, and are over 3,500 years old.  Many cathedrals have retained their labyrinths.  It is fascinating that the labyrinth is part of the borrowings of Christianity from pagan sources.  There are more and more labyrinths appearing, in stone, tile, weaving, and other media.  There is even one in the yard of the jail at Brockville, Ontario, for the use of the inmates only.  Mazes are much later developments, and come from garden mazes which started in the sixteenth century.  Labyrinths had strictly religious (though diverse) origins, while mazes are secular; the change from labyrinths to mazes thus is just another reflection of how over the centuries strict religious order has given way to secular thinking.  A labyrinth reflects trust and simplicity in following a set path; a maze, however, indicates complexity, confusion, and choices.<br /><br />The beautiful illustrations here include photographs of many of the famous labyrinths and mazes mentioned, as well as diagrams that anyone interested will want to trace.  There are useful citations to the many websites devoted to labyrinths and mazes, and there are even instructions on how to make your own walkable, transportable labyrinth.  There are some tough mazes to solve here, including one that encompasses four pages of the book.  In fact, the book itself is a \\"page maze\\" that will have you following directions to flip to different pages in order to get to the end page.

Most people have forgotten a worse series of earthquakes that struck in three months starting in 1811.  The New Madrid earthquakes not only were stronger, but they covered a much wider area.  Now when we get real-time coverage of earthquake disasters, we have lost the history of this one.  In _When the Mississippi Ran Backwards: Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes_ (The Free Press), Jay Feldman has told the story of the earthquakes themselves, but they occupy only a fraction of the book.  Much of his work is an examination of how the earthquakes changed American history.  There are some characters within it who were simply affected by the earthquakes in peculiar ways, and some of the connections Feldman draws to larger events are tenuous, but this is an entertaining look at a particular event that did befall the young nation.<br /><br />The earthquakes that rocked the Midwest began on 16 December 1811, and were completely unexpected.  They were calamitous for the people in the region, but one of the reasons that they are so little remembered is that there were few people there to be shaken.  The chief story here is about, of all things, the war between the American government and the Indians.  The main character in the story is the Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who threatened to stomp his feet from a distance and shake down the houses of Indians who opposed him.  The earthquake was timed to do so, increasing his prestige and allowing him to lead the tribes as a unified force.  The town of New Madrid itself was the brainchild of Revolutionary War veteran George Morgan, who wanted to make his fortune on land.  All his planning went for naught, for the town was destroyed by the earthquakes.  The brothers Lilburne and Isham Lewis were nephews of Thomas Jefferson, but were failing on their farm in western Kentucky.  One night in drunken anger at their slave George who had broken a pitcher, they killed him with an ax in front of their other slaves to teach them all a lesson.  Eventually justice was done, but only because the earthquake uncovered evidence of the crime.  Inventor and engine-builder Nicholas Roosevelt and his intrepid wife Lydia took his steamship, the _New Orleans_, from Pittsburgh with the goal of making steam the transportation of the Mississippi.  Against all predictions, they succeeded.  The boat was on the Mississippi River when the first earthquake hit, and proved its mettle.  It was big and strong enough to withstand the raging water, while smaller boats were lost.  The long and colorful reign of the Mississippi steamboats had begun.<br /><br />Feldman has told these stories well, and has attempted to make the geology of the area plain.  He goes into detail on general seismology, a useful summary of how earthquakes happen.  At the time, no one had any idea, ascribing them to electrical forces or volcanoes.  Though the physics was mysterious, that did not keep some from being sure what had caused the earthquakes: the hand of God.  Preachers and revivalists swarmed to the area to harvest souls, and succeeded, temporarily.  One preacher noted that when the danger was passed, the newcomers to his church left it and resumed their previous sinful ways.  In 1990, much was made of the prediction of a new New Madrid quake, foretold by a non-seismologist who somehow got lots of media attention.  The real seismologists were embarrassed, but were certain nothing was going to happen on that particular day, and nothing did, at least seismologically.  The devout did get to show signs like \\"NEW MADRID SAVE YOUR CITY FAST AND REPENT\\" and the commercially astute sold tee shirts.  The prediction was wrong for that particular day, but it won't be wrong forever.  The same forces that caused the disaster almost two hundred years ago are continuing to build, and the next quake will not have a sparsely-populated, economically backward region to work upon.ot have a sparsely-populated, economically backward region to work upon. <br />	2005-04-22
271043:US	50895620	R380A8B8ZWJOSV	156858315X	953301322	John the Painter: Terrorist of the American Revolution	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Our American Terrorist	Any Americans who pay attention to history take pride in the Revolution that brought the nation its freedom, and all Americans have been shocked by recent attacks by terrorists.  What if during the Revolution, there had been a terrorist operating in England on behalf of American freedom?  It seems an impossible anachronism, but the strange truth is that there was such a man.  He is a historical footnote now, but at the end of his brief life he was one of the most notorious men in England because of his crimes of arson performed against naval targets in furtherance of the American cause against England.  This bizarre story is told in _John the Painter: Terrorist of the American Revolution_ (Thunder's Mouth Press) by Jessica Warner, which fetches its subject back from obscurity.  The saying \\"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\\" does not really apply to John the Painter, whose real name was James Aitken.  Shifting through the often obscure vestiges of fact, Warner is not able to document that Aitken was inspired by any patriotic fervor or love of liberty.  His motivations remain mysterious, and his crimes ineffectual, at least as far as affecting the American Revolution, so his obscurity is deserved; but this is a lively and welcome examination of a tiny and surprising patch of history.<br /><br />Aitken was born in 1752, in an impoverished section of Edinburgh.  He became a painter, and got an introduction into some basic chemistry and had easy access to flammables, but had small success in his trade.  He opted to try his luck in the New World.  He arrived in Jamestown in 1773 as an indentured servant.  He ran away from his master, and was in different areas of the eastern seaboard for two years.  He did not get imbued with the love of liberty while he was there; in fact, he was part of an exodus of Scots back to England in 1775.  He heard a conversation in a pub in Oxford to the effect that if the naval dockyards were lost, the navy would be lost, and thus the war would be lost.  He then formed the plan of torching Britain's docks.  He may have thought that in doing so he could have returned to America as a hero, and become (his great goal) a military officer, but any clear explanation of what he was thinking is impossible.  He met with the American representative in Paris, got a small amount of money, and thought he was doing American duty as he torched a few warehouses and docks, with the aim of crippling Britain's navy.  He had houses as well as naval buildings as targets, and although no one died, he did (as terrorists do) inflict psychological damage.  He was not particularly careful about his work and keeping from suspicion, but policing at the time was primitive.  Eventually, someone recognized him, others realized that a housepainter always seemed to be around town before a blaze, and a hunt was begun.  It quickly succeeded when a large reward was offered for his capture.<br /><br />Aitken's efforts terrified Britons, but had none of the effects he had planned.  Americans had been suspected of setting the fires (Aitken's incendiary devices had convinced authorities that there was more than one arsonist about) and those who had sympathy for the American cause had reason to be less enthusiastic.  He was put on trial for the offence of arson in a naval dockyard, one of the many crimes punishable by death.  Warner explains how limited justice was for those accused at the time, and how an informer was hired to befriend the unsuspecting Aitken in jail, in order to get details of his activities.  He was found guilty, and sentenced to be hung.  There was a customary, but unseemly, race to get his life into print, with different authors vying to be the one responsible for his true final confession.  None of them turned out to be very reliable.  The prison chaplain refused to give Aitken final communion until he gave a final confession that might be published on its own (with profits to the chaplain).  Aitken washung on high, specifically from a ship's 60-foot mast especially erected in Portsmouth for the occasion.  His body was tarred and gibbeted, hanging for years in an iron cage to serve as a warning to others, and pieces of him were taken away for souvenirs.  A finger was turned into a tobacco stopper, and was destroyed, as luck would have it, in an incendiary raid on Portsmouth by the Germans in World War II.  John the Painter's life was not useful to the Americans, who forgot him entirely, and serves only as a historical anomaly.  Warner's telling of a sad tale, however, is full of sympathy for a flawed protagonist and good humor for his peculiar style of making himself famous.  He was a failure; his biography is a vigorous, ironic success.was hung on high, specifically from a ship's 60-foot mast especially erected in Portsmouth for the occasion.

In the eighteenth century, however, the options were quite a bit less, and so an enterprising fellow with a rhinoceros might be able to make an impression.  In the case of Douwemout Van der Meer, and his rhinoceros Clara, he not only made an impression all over Europe, he substantially changed the science and art of the time, and he made a fortune.  A curious book, _Clara's Grand Tour: Travels with a Rhinoceros in Eighteenth Century Europe_ (Atlantic Monthly Press) by Glynis Ridley now tells the story, an odd one about a strange and distant time, and about a strange endeavor.  There are gaps in the story, because Van der Meer did not keep a journal, but Ridley has also included diverting details about the cities Clara visits and the people she meets.  The result is an engaging history, and one more valuable look at how humans get along with animals.<br /><br />Clara's mother was shot when Clara was but a few months old in India, and the sea captain Van der Meer purchased her, thinking that she would make his fortune.  He sailed with her back to his home in Holland, and with Clara safely transported, he left the Dutch East India Company to get on with what would be his real career.  He was an ingenious showman, who used many techniques that would be familiar in modern spectacles.  He had posters printed up beforehand to announce Clara's arrival, and would sell copies of the poster to anyone who paid to see her.  There were also more elaborate or detailed pictures for the better-off to buy, ranging from woodcuts to engravings to commemorative medals in tin or silver.  Clara seems to have been cared for with genuine affection.  She lived on hay and grass (150 pounds a day), with bread and beer being special treats.  She was attracted to the smell of tobacco, and could be easily led by the temptation of an orange.<br /><br />Clara toured throughout Europe starting in 1741, with various home visits to Leiden, and died on tour in London in 1758.  At her death, she probably became the subject of anatomists, and Van der Meer went back home.  Significantly, there are no written records of him after Clara's death.  It is to be assumed that he retired on his profits.  He and Clara had accomplished a good deal more than just making money, however, as this happy and enthralling narrative make clear.  They were making an appeal to popular curiosity, which is an amiable enough trait, and they satisfied it, but they also satisfied the artists and naturalists who came to check her out.  They had expanded human knowledge, making the rhinoceros so well known that Boswell could report in agreement that someone had said that Dr. Johnson \\"laughs like a rhinoceros,\\" and could count on people being amused at the simile.

Most people can.  Can you crack your toes?  That's a little rarer, but still not an extraordinary ability.  Can you crack your toes and thereby enrich your family and start a new form of religion?  That would be extraordinary, and the extraordinary story of the woman who did it is in The Reluctant Spiritualist: The Life of Maggie Fox (Harcourt) by Nancy Rubin Stuart.  Maggie Fox, and her sisters, were good enough at toe snapping (and the equivalent of ventriloquism, making people think the noises were coming from elsewhere) that they harnessed the snaps to spooky effect.  They convinced first their mother and then much of the American public that the raps were simply the manner of telegraph that dead people use to contact those of us left behind here.  It seems preposterous that the spirits, with all the resources of The World Beyond, would have to resort to such a system of communication, and indeed, after the Fox sisters got started, they and their imitators were able to show how spirits helped in such useful feats as tipping tables, writing in trances, producing yucky ectoplasm, or many other peculiar manifestations.  Stuart acknowledges the eagerness to believe that is the great engine that powers such performances.  Most religions teach that there is some sort of life after death, but many seek direct evidence of it.  The spiritualists provided what passed as evidence, and what passed as comfort for the bereaved, and if Maggie Fox could crack her toes and say it was confirmation of life on \\"the other side\\", then there was a public eager to believe her.<br /><br />She didn't set out on a career of spiritualism.  She was fourteen years old in 1848, living in Hydesville, New York, when she and her sister started playing tricks on their mom.  The agitated response of Mrs. Fox to their tricks and rappings convinced her that a spirit haunted the house.  The word about the \\"spook house\\" spread, and  when strangers, including journalists and clergymen, converged upon the farmhouse, Maggie was locked into a role.  Her celebrity was taken over by her 34-year-old sister Leah, who learned the secret of how the \\"spirits\\" were being produced, and essentially blackmailed Maggie into performing for money (this is why Maggie can be referred to as \\"reluctant\\").  Leah organized s&eacute;ances in homes and eventually in larger venues like theaters in Rochester and then Manhattan.  The pretty Maggie was wooed from spiritualism by the Arctic explorer Elisha Kent Kane, who secretly married her shortly before his death overseas.  Maggie attempted to gain her legacy from him, but Kane's duplicitous family succeeded in keeping it from her.  Impoverished, and prone to alcoholism, Maggie eventually exposed herself in 1888, either because of guilt or because of need of money.  She appeared on stage in New York to tell 3,000 listeners, \\"I have been mainly instrumental in perpetrating the fraud of Spiritualism upon a too confiding public.\\"  She then took off her shoes and demonstrated the tricks of her toes.  The demonstration was a sensation in the hall, but it failed to translate into sales for her book The Death-Blow to Spiritualism or into a lucrative tour.  Spiritualists were, of course, outraged, and Maggie didn't mollify them when she retracted her confession a year latter.  She never regained her previous fame before she died in 1893.<br /><br />Stuart's book, the first full biography of Maggie Fox, is an important history of the founding of spiritualism.  Her descendants, like John Edward and James Van Praagh, are still making money by contacting the dead, and it is useful to be reminded how the origin of spiritualism, fired by the hopes of bereaved families, was founded upon fraud.  (Stuart tries for balance, and maintains, even against the evidence presented here, that the questions of authenticity among spiritualists remain \\"just beyond our grasp.\\")  The book also is a reflection on women in nineteenth century America, as Maggie and her sisters had acquaintances who were in the women's suffrage movement; they themselves, however, used their fame as spiritualists to at least partially break out of the role of dependency and docility.  For the most part, Maggie was trapped by her family into playing the role of fraud, which is sad enough, and she changed the history of humbuggery, which is sadder still.ca, as Maggie and her sisters had acquaintances who were in the women's suffrage movement; they themselves, however, used their fame as spiritualists to at least partially break out of the role of dependency and docility.

In _Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time_ (Shoemaker & Hoard), Michael Downing has given a sprightly history of a peculiarity in timekeeping that has pleased and bothered people ever since it was first seriously proposed for action.  You might think that the only confusion that DST causes is for people who forget on the appointed night to change their clocks, or our surprise in the first week over how high the sun seems compared to the nights before the change.  The truth is that there is much more confusion to go around on an issue that you probably thought was simple.<br /><br />The US adopted DST in 1918, but repealed it just a year later; the repeal was sparked by protests by farmers, who were among the first, though certainly not the last, to insist on a return to what they viewed as \\"God's time.\\"  How God came to divide the day into twenty-four hours, however, they did not clarify.  The influence of farmers, however, could not compete with that of Wall Street, which liked the idea since it meant that there would be a one hour window in the morning when both the New York Exchange and the London Exchange were open simultaneously, permitting exploitation of prices during those sixty minutes.  In fact, the New York Exchange so missed the lucrative hour when DST was repealed that it put itself on DST just for trading hours.  Exchanges in Boston and Philadelphia did not want to lose out, so they followed suit, small islands of anomalous time within the nation.  The patchwork coverage of DST and the attempted legal patches to make it all sensible resulted in timely confusion.  If you drove the 35 miles from Steubenville, Ohio, to Moundsville, West Virginia, and wanted your watch to keep the local time, you would have to change it seven times on the route.  In St. Paul, Minnesota, there was an eighteen-story office building with nine floors on DST and nine floors not.<br /><br />From time to time, like during wars, DST was promoted as the patriotic thing to do, since it saved energy, but this has not conclusively been shown.  Some think there are good scientific reasons for DST, but there is no science behind it.  What powers DST in a small way is emotion; most people simply like the long summer evenings (and Downing admits that he is one of these).  I like it because it shows the arbitrary nature of timekeeping; we can shift hours just as we can (or could, if we wanted to) shift from feet to meters.  The biggest force, though, is economic.  Wall Street likes it, and that's important, but there were significant gains for specific industries.  Sales of golf equipment and course fees go up in DST, and so do sales of barbecue equipment, and seeds and gardening supplies.  Farmers still don't like it, but there are fewer and fewer of them to complain.  Nonetheless, there are still plenty of people (and businesses like movie studios) that don't like it, and although we have relative standardization in its implementation now, there are still attempts to tinker with it.  Falsifying clock time in America has become \\"the most sustained political controversy of the last 100 years,\\" says Downing.  His often hilarious book shows that the controversy isn't going to go away any time soon.DST was repealed that it put itself on DST just for trading hours.

In Washington now, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay is accused of various instances of taking gifts and bonuses to which he was not entitled.  Along with political power at any level comes the ability to use it for one's own financial benefit, always with the hope that no investigative reporter will come asking questions and upsetting the comfortable situation.  There are hundreds of instances of financial corruption by politicians, and then there is William Magear \\"Boss\\" Tweed, whose name is synonymous with being on the take.  In _Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York_ (Carroll & Graf), Kenneth D. Ackerman has given an entertaining account of the life of a rascal.  Tweed was, in his way, brilliant.  He liked people, and he knew how to get them what they wanted if they would just play his game.  He had a superb organizational memory, for favors done and for amounts given.  As Ackerman writes, \\"except for his stealing, he would have been a great man; but then had he been honest, he wouldn't have been Tweed and would not have left nearly so great a mark.\\"  He did leave his mark on New York, in structures like the Tweed Courthouse, and even the Brooklyn Bridge (or at least he said he had handed out bribes to approve a bond for it).  He is remembered for none of what he did, though, except for his stealing, which was for decades more successful and exuberant than any American politician ever, or any that has so far been caught.<br /><br />Tweed practiced local politics in Tammany Hall, the political organization for the powerful Manhattan Democratic Party.  Tammany corruption was an open secret.  Tweed got things done within the city, but took his fee for doing so; he and his circle would skim 15% from city contracts, and contractors would agree to pay 35% on all bills in order to have the city's business.  Tweed himself was welcomed into the boards of many corporations.  He didn't mind his constituents (many of whom were poor Irish immigrants) seeing how well he was doing.  He had two yachts, a race horse, a Greenwich estate, a grand Fifth Avenue mansion, and an immense ten and a half carat diamond stickpin that clearly informed any onlooker who was Boss.  The stickpin was one of the visual hooks (Tweed's 300 pound frame was another) that Thomas Nast used in his many political cartoons critical of the Boss.  Nast and _Harper's_ had no hard evidence that the Boss was stealing; they just harnessed the universal conviction that Tammany was corrupt.  The articles exposing Tweed came from the _New-York Times_, which was eager for any facts against the Boss.  A bookkeeper in the comptroller's office painstakingly copied one dry financial document after another, and brought the newspaper incontestable evidence of fraud.  The problem with the _Times_ stories was that obviously millions had been taken, but there was no one culprit; a Nast cartoon showed a circle of suspects all pointing to the guy on the right.<br /><br />The \\"audit trail\\" was eventually puzzled out by Samuel Tilden, who rode his reform record to nomination for president in 1876.  Tweed was arrested, and all the weight of his circle's crimes landed on him, as everyone else went free, not of obloquy but of prison sentences.  While Tweed was in jail, he was able to buy favors, and while on a visit home, he disappeared, taking a jaunt to New Jersey, Florida, Cuba, and Spain, where a Nast cartoon was used to help identify him for arrest.  He was returned to his New York jail.  Tweed knew he had the press to blame for his capture, but was grudgingly admiring of them: \\"If I could have bought newspapermen as easily as I did members of the Legislature, I wouldn't be in the fix I am now.\\"  He made a deal that he would confess everything in order to regain his freedom.  He did make a full confession (perhaps too full, taking credit for thefts he had nothing to do with), and was double-crossed, dying in jail in 1878.  He had lost his fortune, his wife, and his family, but New York had grown because of him, and even the poor were faring better because of his machinations.  Hundreds of workers showed up for his funeral, and thought he had been merely the victim of political malice.  This sort of ambiguity shoots through Ackerman's fine book; if we must have selfish scoundrels in our current politics, let us vote in the colorful ones like Boss Tweed.n (perhaps too full, taking credit for thefts he had nothing to do with), and was double-crossed, dying in jail in 1878.

Confederate forces under Albert Sidney Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard were successful on the first day of the battle, forcing Ulysses S. Grant's larger forces back to the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing.  The following day, the Union, having gotten reinforcements from Lew Wallace and Don Carlos Buell, reversed the Confederate gains.  The famously bitter and bloody battle at Shiloh was an effort by the Union to take possession of the vital railroad junction at Corinth, Mississippi, which was shortly thereafter taken almost bloodlessly.  _This Great Battlefield of Shiloh: History, Memory, and the Establishment of a Civil War National Military Park_ (University of Tennessee Press) by Timothy B. Smith is not the story of the battle, but about the park that grew up to commemorate it.  From a battlefield of legendary carnage, Shiloh (along with other similar military parks) became a focus for nationalism and reconciliation.  Smith himself is on the staff of Shiloh National Military Park, and his book might be particularly interesting for those many who visit the park, but it also tells of the national attitudes since the Civil War that allowed the park to come into existence and grow into its current form.<br /><br />Any visitor to the park will find it a very isolated place, and now tranquil; the isolation helped keep the area of the park from development.  In 1866, Congress authorized its military cemetery, but for  thirty years, the cemetery was the only memorial to the battle, and it was the site of many reunions of veterans from both sides, especially on the anniversaries of the battle.  Veterans were shocked to find the battlefield neglected, and in 1893 determined that their particular scene of valor would be saved from change.  At their influence, Congress eventually authorized the park and the War Department was to organize and operate it.  The most important appointment was that of David W. Reed, the park's first secretary and historian.  Reed had served in the 12th Iowa Infantry, and saw combat at Shiloh in the positions known as Sunken Road and the Hornet's Nest.  Smith admits that Reed's \\"subjectivity and desire to create tangible points of interest for visitors caused him to create myths\\" about the battle, based on his own participation in it.  The Hornet's Nest, for instance, Reed cited as the most important site of the battle, but it seems to have been the scene of only light fighting.  Every visitor to the park now goes to see Bloody Pond, but contemporary accounts do not even mention it.  Nonetheless, Reed formed the history of the battle and wrote it large in the Shiloh landscape, positioning markers on the fields to interpret the battle for visitors.  When it came time for state commissions to erect monuments on the field, he was embroiled in some bitter battles as he defended his version of history.<br /><br />\\"As the monuments went up, the proverbial smoke cleared,\\" writes Smith, and eventually almost everyone agreed with Reed's interpretation, however subjective it might have been, and everyone loved the beauty of the park and the monuments within.  When it was completed as a park around 1908, Shiloh was a monument not only to the battle but to the veterans who had formed the park and to the ideas of the time.  For instance, none of the monuments call attention to the larger war, or to questions of succession or slavery, and none refer to the correctness of either side.  They certainly do not reflect that Jim Crow segregation, if not slavery, was bedeviling the nation.  They are devoted strictly to looking inward, to the battle and the battlefield itself, and the heroes of both sides lodged therein.  The memorialization can be seen, therefore, as a process of reconciliation and limitation of controversy over the war, a process fueled by nationalism.  Shiloh and the other parks may be viewed as tools tohelp remake the American people into one.  Smith's book is thus a valuable history not of a battle, but of a battlefield and of the ideas Americans have imposed on and derived from it.to help remake the American people into one.

289994:US	50895620	R1PMMHWVSFXZ3Y	0805076824	926765114	102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Chaos Complicated by Error	Everyone is familiar with the pictures of the World Trade Center from 11 September 2001.  The views from the outside as the planes strike the towers, and then the collapse of one and then the other, with dust and chaos everywhere, possess a grim fascination that even repeated viewings do not dim.  But what was going on inside?  There were thousands of people already at work in the buildings in that morning.  Many had gone through the attack on the basement of the towers eight years before (and sadly may have had false confidence in the buildings' structural integrity because of that first attack).  We can imagine what some of them must have gone through, but how can we know?  While many of those in the towers that day will never be able to tell their stories, even some of those who perished were able to get through on computers, radios, and cell phones.  The interactions of firemen, policemen, and heroic victims did leave electronically recorded trails and memories that can be examined.  Two reporters, Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn, have undertaken to reveal the hidden, human aspects of the disaster in _102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers_ (Times Books).  Everyone knows how it all turned out, but this is a superbly suspenseful account, mostly of ordinary humans confronting an extraordinary disaster, combined with an analysis of sad error and inefficiency.  It could have been worse, certainly, but it could have gone far better.<br /><br />The fate of the buildings is repeatedly tied to their initial design; the authors explain that the most important actions taken in a skyscraper disaster are those that were laid out in the blueprints.  Because engineering of the time was thought to be so much better than in previous skyscrapers, the rules about stairways had been relaxed; there were fewer of them, and they were clustered within the building so that if one got physically damaged, the others were close enough to suffer the same damage.  The authors never confuse the real cause of the disaster, the suicidal hijackers and their masters, with mistakes that led to a worsening of the disaster, but for many of the dead, they write, \\"Their fate was sealed nearly four decades earlier,\\" when the buildings were designed to give maximum rental space often at the cost of safety space.  The stories of the individuals who worked in the towers, or happened to be visiting that day, are uppermost throughout the book, however.  After the north tower was hit, those in the south tower were rightly concerned that they were at risk, but were reassured that the building was secure.  Stanley Praimnath, for instance, went back up to his job at a Japanese bank on the 81st floor of the south tower once a guard told him the building was secure and under no danger.  He was on the phone, assuring a colleague in Chicago that he was fine, when he looked out to see an airplane headed toward his window.  The caller in Chicago watched  the TV in horror, as Praimnath dived under his desk screaming as his ceiling collapsed.  There are so many stories here, and so many characters, that it is often confusing to keep them all straight, but in recounting such extraordinary chaos, the confusion is nothing but realistic.<br /><br />There are plenty of stories of heroism here, and it is good that the book concentrates, at least at first, on the tales of ordinary people who showed it.  Such stories were not the center of the initial coverage of the event, which concentrated on the stories of the rescuers.  Naturally, the firefighters and police had plenty of opportunity to show heroism, too, and this as well is fully documented, but with the sad understanding that many of their sacrifices were not necessary.  Dwyer and Flynn give the history of radio communications for firemen and policemen, how new equipment had been available, and how bureaucratic inertia caused the old to continue to be used.  There were also significant problems incommunication between the police and the firemen, who had often been at odds.  (A couple of cops at the scene joked as they worked with a fireman, wondering if this is what it took to get cops and firemen working together.)  The authors frequently compare this disaster with that of the _Titanic_.  A few months after the ship went down, George Bernard Shaw commented that the disaster had led to \\"an explosion of outrageous romantic lying.\\"  In hearings after the event, Mayor Giuliani spoke with pride of the heroic firefighters in the remaining north tower who stayed at their posts, rescuing others even though the order had been given to leave.  The truth is that communications were so badly confused that many of them never heard the order and did not even know that the south tower had fallen and that theirs was expected to do so, too.  Many were taking rest breaks (certainly needed after climbing floor after floor with sixty pounds of equipment) because almost everyone below the strike zone had left the building.  No amount of good planning would have completely overcome the chaos those two planes caused, but the bad planning revealed here made it worse.  There are lessons here for those who will heed them, but _102 Minutes_ deserves to be read especially for its exciting stories of heroism and sacrifice by ordinary people.in communication between the police and the firemen, who had often been at odds.

If there was ever a need to fill, as in \\"Find a need and fill it,\\" medical treatment holds enormous potential for enriching practitioners.  This has always been true, and has been true before medicine was on a strong scientific basis, and is true for \\"alternative\\" treatments that have no scientific basis.  These days, there is standard medical practice, the usual thing that graduates of medical schools are engaged in, and there are many alternatives: acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal remedies, naturopathy, aromatherapy, and many more.  Alternative medicine, to the disgust of many doctors and skeptics, has gotten some official level of approval; there's the Office of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health, and financial approval shown by coverage from many insurance companies.  Among the most famous of such therapies is homeopathy, so it is timely to read _Copeland's Cure: Homeopathy and the War between Conventional and Alternative Medicine_ (Knopf) by Natalie Robins.  It is mostly a biography of Royal Samuel Copeland, a homeopath, conventional doctor, eye surgeon, Health Commissioner of New York City, and U.S. Senator, but Copeland's constant efforts for his beloved homeopathy encompassed the practice's heyday.  The controversies he battled are the same ones that alternative medicines are experiencing today, making Robins's detailed look at Copeland's life useful background for current clashes.<br /><br />Robins starts with a history of homeopathy, which was invented in 1796 by the German doctor Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, who was horrified by the high doses of medicine that doctors used at the time.  He developed a system of curing by giving highly dilute solutions of medicines, so that only the tiniest amount, or even no amount, of the original drug remained in solution.  Copeland, born in 1868, took up homeopathy, was president of the American Institute for Homeopathy, and translated his leadership into the civic arena, always promoting homeopathic treatments without shouting that he was doing so.  He was busy promoting homeopathy during the time when medicine really did become scientific and really made cures such as those with penicillin, while homeopathic schools folded.  He had frequent battles with the American Medical Association.  Copeland died in 1938; he probably simply worked himself to death.<br /><br />Robins says that she has tried to give both sides of the argument about homeopathy, but admits that \\"scientific proof is only a distant possibility.\\"  Homeopathic claims include that water not only has a memory for teensy amounts of solutes, but that such a memory can be captured, digitized, and sent over the internet to be instilled into another water sample.  The claims cannot make logical, scientific sense; if such tiny (even to the point of nonexistence) amounts of chemicals change the water somehow, then think how much even distilled water must change as soon as it touches glass or is exposed to air.  Nonetheless, Robins profiles two modern homeopaths at the end of her book, each of whom are convinced not only that homeopathy works but that science will show it to do so.  Even so, they have to speak warily of scientific investigations; one admits, for instance, that there was a study for homeopathy for premenstrual symptoms, showing homeopathy improved them, \\"...but the number of patients was small and the methodological quality was poor.\\"  Another says that a cure that is \\"more spiritual\\" will work better.  Homeopathy does have at least one thing to teach conventional doctors: patients report that they are happy with the amount of time the homeopathic provider spends with them.  This is surely no small matter in producing the sort of satisfaction in patients that homeopaths prize.  If the homeopaths are going to make extraordinary claims, like memory in water, they can only expect that conventional doctors would like to see some extraordinary evidence that this is so, or at least robust and replicable studies showing real cures.  Homeopathy either makes a difference or it doesn't, and clinical tests will show one way or the other, unless excuses are made that they cannot test such things as the \\"spirituality\\" of the treatment.  Even one of the modern homeopaths profiled here agrees with the editors of the _New England Journal of Medicine_ \\"...who wrote that there is not alternative and conventional medicine, there is just good and bad medicine.\\"  The bustling, energetic, platitudinous, and self-serving Royal Copeland revealed in these entertaining pages would certainly agree; but evidence that homeopathy goes into the \\"good medicine\\" category is lacking.prize.

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Tea, Cakes, and the First Business Computer	I was in a gift stop a couple of weeks ago, and made a purchase, for which the clerk took a form book, wrote down what I was buying and the price (she added tax mentally and did not need a calculator), and having finished, she gave me a carbon copy and I was on my way.  It has been years since I had such a pen and paper transaction.  There is almost always an electronic cash register now, and it is usually hooked up to the big store computer, which also does the inventory, pay slips, and many other accounting and management functions.  There was a time when computers were not a part of businesses, and now there is a time that they are almost universal.  What was the first business computer, and what company put it to work?  The surprising answer is in _A Computer Called LEO: Lyons Teashops and the World's First Office Computer_ (Harper Perennial) by Georgina Ferry.  It is an enchanting book about times long ago, even if it is about industrial history and computer development.  The boffins who made and used their hand-built computer were well ahead of their times, and at least partially because of that, we know IBM and we don't know LEO, but LEO is worth knowing about.<br /><br />Lyons was a firm one would not have predicted to be in the vanguard of business technology.  Its famous stores throughout Britain served tea and cakes.  As Ferry says, \\"A background in catering is not normally seen as an obvious qualification for hi-tech startup companies.\\"  But the Lyons shops had a progressive management, interested in contemporary scientific management principles, and took on a Cambridge graduate in mathematics, who realized that the primitive computers being developed in the US could be used for business.  Much of the book involves the details of building the computer when computers consisted of a room full of electronic tubes (anachronistically termed \\"valves\\" because of the way they could turn off and on a stream of current).  There were over 3,000 such valves, and cables all over the room to connect them, and of course, the resultant machine had far less computing power than the chip inside Tickle-Me-Elmo.  Eventually, it worked.  In 1951, LEO (for Lyons Electronic Office) took responsibility for bakery operations, and eventually took over such jobs as managing the payroll.  At the time, there was no comparable machine anywhere in the world, and no commercial market for them.<br /><br />So in 1954, Lyons the teashops created Leo Computers Ltd.  After that, LEO's story becomes a sad one.  They did produce machines, and the machines worked.  The initial LEO computer did its jobs for fourteen years, before finally being turned off in a little ceremony in 1965.  Another installed in 1958 at a steelworks was in continuous use until it was retired in 1971.  \\"I don't suppose we shall ever again keep a computer in service as long as this one,\\" said one manager.  Some LEOs worked for the post office, coming out of service only in 1981.  The man in charge of them said, \\"We were very fond of LEOs.  They just worked.  There was no reason to change them.\\"  The post office at one point actually wanted to buy more of them, but Leo Computers could not generate needed capital and had had to merge with other firms.  Eventually LEO could not compete with the billions invested by firms like IBM.  The American government, too, had backed American computers, while no comparable support came from the British government.  Thus LEO is a footnote, not an ancestor, to current business computing, but the men who built it succeeded in a momentous and prescient project.  Along the way, Ferry's wonderfully researched and entertaining book is able to summarize a lot of computing history, taking in such subjects as Alan Turing's work at Bletchley Park and John von Neumann's prophetic design of computer architecture.  She also tells of the mechanical computers designed by the Victorian visionary Charles Babbage, who felt his inventions were slighted by his own government and admired by the Americans.

The book is partly a travelogue, as she visits different continents and describes their particular honeys, and a partly a review of bee literature, as well as an account of biology and natural history affecting human history.  It is thus a wide-ranging tale, but anyone reading it will understand that bees and humans have had an intimate connection that surpasses in complexity any other we have made to domesticated animals.<br /><br />Ellis's book begins with the evolution of the bee; the oldest known bee was found in New Jersey, preserved in amber from around a hundred million years ago.  Cave paintings going back some 8,000 years show honey-hunters, climbing trees with ancient vessels to bring back sweet treasure.  When humans left hunter-gathering and settled on agriculture, they also made pots and baskets; probably some bees took advantage of such containers for their hives, and thus the venerable partnership was born.  The Egyptians were the first farmers to keep bees, and many of their practices from over 4,000 years ago are still used by beekeepers.  Honeybees are part of the old world, not native elsewhere, but they have been carried all over the world.  Transporting them was difficult, for they would be two months at sea to reach America, or six months to Australia.  Among the most interesting of chapters here is the one having to do with urban bees and beekeepers.  Urban honey has its advantages, among which are that the bees forage on a varied horticultural diet, the flowers of which are untouched by pesticides and chemicals of agriculture.  Ellis interviews a beekeeper who has seventeen hives on rooftops in New York, and shuttles by subway to tend them.  He got the use of the rooftops by advertising, and giving a percentage of the honey to the owners of the buildings.<br /><br />Ellis tells over and over incidents that recount a particular closeness to our one domesticated insect.  There is folklore devoted to bees that has no equivalent in, say, the raising of cattle.  Bees were often thought of as part of the family, and \\"telling the bees\\" is an ancient, and still current, ritual to keep them in the family circle.  Family news, like an upcoming wedding, is whispered to a hive, and some wedding cake eventually left for the bees to consume.  The bees certainly had to be told of deaths, and perhaps a bit of food from the obsequies left for them.  If the beekeeper died, the hives, perhaps with black crepe on them, were turned away from the procession.  Such traditions make a modicum of sense; if a beekeeper dies, the intimate connection between keeper and bees is broken, and the importance of a connection to the new keeper is reinforced.  One beekeeper after another relates that not only is there a particular affection for one's hives, the bees can sense the keeper's emotional state.  Bad language and quarreling, the legend goes, offend the bees and cause the moral insects to deliver a reproof by stinging; but keepers do say that to work with bees, you need to have a patience and be in a good mood.  One keeper says, \\"Whatever tension or anger you have from the rest of the world, you just have to let go.\\"  It is one of the pleasant lessons bees have for us, and Ellis has written a book full of similar sweet stories and enlightening facts.y subway to tend them.

Today, few have heard of him.  It is no surprise that fame is fickle, and that a latter generation forgets the heroes of the former, but Beebe's is an extreme example.  In _The Remarkable Life of William Beebe, Explorer and Naturalist_ (Island Press), Carol Grant Gould has given a full, big biography of one of the most amazing men who ever lived.  Beebe worked in zoos.  He took expeditions to identify and capture specimens from Indonesia, South America, and China.  He broke records in deep sea diving in the bathysphere that was designed for him.  He wrote two dozen books that were best sellers, widely appreciated by the public and by professional scientists who shared his realm of study.  He was so famous that in the original play of _The Man Who Came to Dinner_, the hot-tempered protagonist receives an octopus shipped from Beebe, and audiences immediately understood the joke, as they do not, now, when they see the play in revival.  If time has passed Beebe by, his influence is still substantial, and Gould has performed a useful service in bringing him back for us to wonder at.<br /><br />Beebe was born in Brooklyn in 1877, when his neighborhood had wild woods that he could explore.  He was a prodigy.  Many kids set out to collect things, but the young Beebe kept snakes, learned taxidermy to keep snake and bird specimens, bought or traded for exotic specimens, and camped and hiked to get more.  School was a breeze for him, but he loved being out in the field.  In a final entry in an 1893 journal, he wrote, \\"To be a Naturalist is better than to be a King.\\"  The exuberance which this youthful manifesto exemplifies never left him.  He became Assistant Curator of Birds at the new Bronx Zoological Park, but his career of exploring for the sake of discoveries in natural history took off when he left with his wife for an official exploit to Mexico.  The press and public were enthusiastic about his account of the trip, the first of his bestsellers.  Sometimes being a popularizer detracted from appreciation of his scientific work, but there was plenty of both.  His voyages made him fascinated with sea life, and he became an adept diver, applying the same principles of studying a broad, three dimensional swath rather than individual inhabitants.  In 1930, he and his engineer were \\"sealed in a spherical steel coffin and thrown into the ocean.\\"  Especially on initial dives, as the readings approached 800 feet, he had to be scared; he wrote, \\"Only dead men have sunk below this.\\"  Eventually, he was to broadcast his observations live from such a descent, a radio event that caused a sensation.<br /><br />Beebe died in 1962, always grabbing as much of life and learning as he could.  He was an entertaining friend, and among the visitors to these pages are Noël Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Rebecca West, and especially Teddy Roosevelt.  More important, he inspired biologists such as Rachel Carson, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson.  His emphasis on studying an ecosystem as a whole was original and vastly influential.  Gould obviously admires his popular writings, many of which are quoted here, but shows that his scientific work is monumental.  Calling his a remarkable life is indeed an understatement.out his account of the trip, the first of his bestsellers.

They may shrug it off as silly, but they continue to think that the day has some special portent, and most people think that the tradition goes back centuries.  One of the many surprises in _13: The Story of the World's Most Popular Superstition_ (Thunder's Mouth Press) by Nathaniel Lachenmeyer is that although the superstition that the number 13 is unlucky has a substantial history, superstition attached specifically to Friday the thirteenth is no older than the twentieth century.  Lachenmeyer's book is an enjoyable tour looking at the different 13 superstitions (there are many of them), trying to make historic sense of why people have adopted this number as some sort of portentous sign.  Lachenmeyer came to the subject by chance, reading an article in an old scrapbook about the Thirteen Club, but has never had any particular feeling toward the number: \\"To me, 13 has always been just a number. I have never believed that 13 is unlucky or been tempted to thumb my nose at fate and make it my lucky number (I don't have one).\\"  He is not a triskaidekaphobe (13 fearer) or triskaidekaphile (13 lover), but there are plenty of both, especially the former, in these pages.  In some ways, they have formed parts of the world as we now know it.<br /><br />Friday the thirteenth is just the most popular, and modern, manifestation of superstitions connected to thirteen, but there is no evidence that thirteen was considered unlucky before the seventeenth century.  It first was written about in 1695, in a story involving a dinner at which thirteen were seated around the table.  The superstition that one of the thirteen diners would die within the year became strongest during the nineteenth century.  It may have had its roots in the idea that thirteen at the table at the Last Supper proved to be bad luck for two of them.  There is a hero in Lachenmeyer's book, Captain William Fowler, a Civil War veteran who had fought in thirteen battles in the war, and in a clubbable age, belonged to thirteen social clubs.  He aimed to tempt fate if fate there be; in 1881 in New York, he started a new club which would meet on the thirteenth of each month and sit thirteen to a table.  This was not enough for Fowler; members had to walk under ladders, face spilled portions of salt, and so on.  No one dining at tables of thirteen had any particular ill-luck, and it is quite probably that Fowler helped do away with this version of the superstition.  A new version emerged after the publication of a book _Friday, the Thirteenth_, in 1907; unlucky Fridays and unlucky thirteen had not previously been linked, but they were almost immediately after this bestseller, and in 1971, a horror film originally titled _Long Night at Camp Blood_, was renamed _Friday the 13th_ to imitate the calendrically popular _Halloween_.  The franchise has spawned ten sequels so far, and the Friday version of the thirteen superstition may have a longer life than the dinner version.<br /><br />In this entertaining examination of a particular superstition, Lachenmeyer shows that the 13 superstition has come and gone in different versions in the past, and undoubtedly will stay with us, and in newer forms.  It is a scary world out there, and for many of us, there are forces at work that we cannot feel or see or understand, but we can feel we are taking some control against the chaos by taking out a small insurance policy.  Avoiding thirteens is relatively easy, and those who practice it can always maintain that it is better to be safe than sorry.  As Lachenmeyer writes, \\"Reason governs a much smaller domain in the world of ideas than we are accustomed to acknowledging.\\"  This may be so, but his clear-eyed examination of this small aspect of human behavior can only make the domain larger.lliam Fowler, a Civil War veteran who had fought in thirteen battles in the war, and in a clubbable age, belonged to thirteen social clubs.

Any such competition was a redundancy, for it should have been retired upon the death of Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, the 7th Marquess of Londonderry.  He had more than enough trappings of his descent from one of Britain's grandest families, he was a pillar of the Conservative Party, the King called him \\"Charley,\\" his house in London was the center for grand parties, he was cousin to Winston Churchill, and he was appointed Air Minister in 1931.  However, he was instinctively pro-German.  In _Making Friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry, The Nazis, and the Road to War_ (The Penguin Press), Ian Kershaw writes that Londonderry, \\"having attracted much obloquy in his lifetime, has passed into near historical oblivion.\\"  This is, of course, because Londonderry was a minor character and favored the wrong policy until World War II started.  Kershaw, who has written a well-regarded and massive biography of Hitler, has turned to the topic of an infamous but minor character from the years when the rest of Europe was trying to understand Hitler and what to do with him.  An objection could be made that Londonderry simply was not worth a biography of this length, depth, and obviously careful research, but Kershaw draws a full picture of the times and demonstrates that we see Londonderry as out of step only through hindsight; for years he represented a view held by many Britons, including members of the peerage.  He was wrong, and was a silly little man, but his views were not a complete anomaly, and Kershaw's useful biography is fine at describing the confusion of the years before the war.<br /><br />Like  aristocrats of the time, Londonderry felt himself entitled to political power, and to his credit he had an eagerness to serve.  He was a pilot, and was glad to be appointed Air Minister in 1931.  He was not enough of a fighter, however, to muster financial resources for his ministry, and was sacked in 1935. Still, he insisted on having a role to play afterwards, as an activist private citizen.  Unfortunately, he was impressed by the strides Mussolini was making in Italy and was even more impressed by how Hitler had achieved and held power.  He went on to hobnob with Goering, Hess, and Hitler, and had Ribbentrop come to a hunting party at his place near Ulster.  He wrote a book in 1938, _Ourselves and Germany_, which he hoped would influence the opinions of the British public and politicians, but he mailed it out also to his German pals.  The one he sent to Hitler, he inscribed: \\"To the Fuhrer with my best wishes and my earnest hopes for a better and lasting understanding between our two countries.\\"  Eventually, when they realized that Londonderry really had no power, the Nazis stopped writing him back.  Kershaw bends over backward to be fair to this gullible and flawed subject.  He was no Nazi.  He had the garden-variety anti-Semitic prejudice that was endemic to Britain's conservatives and aristocrats, but he was baffled by the Nazis making race a central part of their creed, and he knew that the brutal treatment of Jews could do nothing to help the German cause and his own.  There were fascists like Oswald Mosley within Britain, but Londonderry had nothing to do with them.  Kershaw writes that he was an anachronism, that even in dealing with Nazis, Londonderry was so idealistic as to presume that politics \\"were determined by goodwill, moral objectives, the gentleman's code of honour, the preservation of legal order\\".<br /><br />Hitler's appetite for conquest eventually made clear, however, even to Londonderry that Hitler did not want peace.  Once the war began, Londonderry showed impeccable patriotism, although he never stopped trying to vindicate himself as one whose views, if they had been followed, would have prevented the war.  He had little insight about why he became a political pariah.  It was even rumored that the government of Churchill (who at one point referred to his cousin as \\"that half-wit Charlie Londonderry\\") had locked him up for the duration of the war, a rumor that made Londonderry furious.  Londonderry died in 1949, realizing that \\"I had backed the wrong horse,\\" but also sure that he would be fully vindicated, even if the vindication was posthumous.  There is little vindication in this volume.  Kershaw does show that Londonderry's views drew from what was conventional political wisdom, and the details here put them in a useful and illuminating context.e government of Churchill (who at one point referred to his cousin as \\"that half-wit Charlie Londonderry\\") had locked him up for the duration of the war, a rumor that made Londonderry furious.

It is even stranger that some have taken grips on mysteries that are artificial, imaginary, or delusional.  You can read the astrology column in today's paper, for instance; millions do, and of those millions, many feel it is instructive and that the stars and planets affect our lives.  There are those who insist that they can bend spoons not as a magic trick but by using mental powers that physicists cannot yet measure.  Psychic detectives claim they have used extrasensory powers to catch criminals.  Into the Bermuda Triangle vanish untold numbers of ships and airplanes.  The letters in your name, or the numbers in your birth date, reveal your personality and fate.  Aliens are picking us up to do gastrointestinal tests and impregnations.  People seem sincere in advancing such beliefs.  They can't all be lying, can they?  What's the rational way to examine such ideas?  Lynne Kelly knows.  In _The Skeptic's Guide to the Paranormal_ (Thunder's Mouth Press), she devotes one chapter to all of them, and many more.  The aim of her book is that it \\"gives a rational explanation for some of the most widely known claims of the paranormal.\\"  Kelly takes tangible claims and examines any applicable tangible evidence.  She knows that there are book-length refutations of most of the paranormal phenomena that people believe in, but the beauty of her book is that each is pithily examined, and although not all evidence pro and con is given, there is advice on how to look at the evidence that will make each case clear.<br /><br />Skeptics have some sensible rules to go by, like extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence, or for the acceptance of the simplest explanation that covers all the evidence.  Kelly is a teacher of physics and mathematics who for thirty years has employed such tools on paranormal claims.  \\"Not cynicism, but a healthy skepticism,\\" is her motto.  \\"Not disbelief, but a reluctance to believe without substance.\\"  In each chapter, Kelly takes one phenomenon and examines evidence pro and con.  She repeatedly confronts the human eagerness to believe in fun and fanciful explanations; it is more delightful, for instance, to conceive of aliens mystically bending crops rather than a couple of guys doing it with ropes and planks and stomping.  Desire for fanciful explanations does not, however, trump the need for good evidence.  She has acted as a psychic, using cold readings and impressing the credulous with her psychic powers.  She insightfully reports how easy it would be in cold readings to fool herself into thinking she was getting her hits from some psychic source, just as she explains that when she has used a dowsing rod, she has been astounded by how real is the feeling that the rod is actually being pulled down.  She'd like for such an indicator to really mean something, just as she'd love to be around when aliens do drop in for a visit, or she would enjoy having veridical prognostications via dreams.  It's sometimes tough to be a skeptic.<br /><br />Other topics here include the Shroud of Turin, spontaneous human combustion, ESP, levitation, Bigfoot, reincarnation, and many more.  Kelly has repeatedly confronted those who are eager to believe in paranormal explanations for such things, and she admits, \\"Some believers accuse skeptics of having nothing left but a dull, cold, scientific world.\\"  She shows, however, that rigorously trying to examine the way the world works by our best investigative method, that of science, is anything but dull, and that anyway, our world presents plenty of enchanting realms like music, sex, love, and imagination that call upon no explanations, scientific or paranormal, to enjoy in full.

It was so taken for granted that even the Church of England owned a sugar plantation in the West Indies, and there is no indication that the plantation was at all enlightened.  Slaves were worked to death as they were elsewhere.  It was no paradox that Edward Colston got a statue erected in his honor for his philanthropy, and he boasted of how he was eager to help every widow, every orphan; but the huge sums with which he could boast of being generous came from trading slaves.  The famous triangular trade, sugar or rum from the West Indies to England, manufactured goods to Africa, and slaves to the West Indies, was so prosperous that it was easy to overlook the obvious fatal unfairness to the third side of the triangle.  Few saw the unfairness, and even fewer thought it could ever be any different.  But the world did eventually get this evil behind it, and in _Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves_ (Houghton Mifflin), Adam Hochschild has given a welcome history of how this happened.  As Hochschild points out, Americans are brought up on the history of the efforts of northern abolitionists, the underground railroad, and the eventual Civil War, but this is the vital story of the pioneering British campaign that was the start of the end of slavery.  Remarkably, the campaign had many characteristics and tools that would be part of the effort of civic campaigns ever afterwards.<br /><br />England was the richest and most powerful nation on Earth, and it was thought to be the most civilized as well.  Most Britons accepted that Africans were something less than human, and that in bringing them under the control of whites, Britons were making blacks not only useful and lucrative, but also happier, as civilized as their degraded state would allow, and they were being made into Christians as well.  The benefits to the slaves may have been illusory, but profits prevented any loss of the illusions.  There were a few who saw that slavery was morally wrong, and though they would certainly have been thought crackpots at the time, on 22 May 1787, twelve of them met in a London print shop to attempt to make the world change.  These were oddballs; anyone who bucked the slave system at the time was going to be.  They had many peevish and peculiar traits, and Hochschild's book is at its most entertaining in describing their foibles and eventual unity and success.  It was a diverse crew of characters that had only one thing they all agreed upon, that the slave trade must end.<br /><br />The campaign was for the long term.  It was not until 1807 that Parliament abolished the slave trade, and then in 1833 granted full emancipation.  As a business compromise, slave owners were paid compensation, but as was pointed out at the time, the ones that really deserved compensation were the former slaves themselves.  There are connections with this first great moral movement to the granting of equal rights to women, for the many women who became involved in it at the grassroots level began to examine their own servitude.  There are still slaves in our world (although they are not bought and sold overtly as part of the main foundation of commerce), but the effort described here represents an astonishing reversal of what was accepted as the status quo.  The British abolitionists took a world that considered slavery fully normal and turned such opinions completely around.  Hochschild's book, although it contains many harrowing and sorrowful passages, is thus one of optimism.  He reminds us that as we face evils such as the widening gap between rich and poor, the spread of nuclear weapons, terrorism, and environmental assaults, it may seem that our own status quo cannot be significantly changed.  Before the meeting in 1787, however, most of the world's people were slaves or serfs.  The abolitionists \\"placed their hope not in sacred texts but in human empathy,\\" and they saw the problem as both outrageous and solvable, inspiring us to remember that committed individuals in a right cause can make all the difference in the world.e problem as both outrageous and solvable, inspiring us to remember that committed individuals in a right cause can make all the difference in the world.  <br />	2005-03-15

A woman with that combination would be worth reading about, and in _Callgirl_ (The Permanent Press) Jeannette Angell introduces us to one: herself.  Her book is a chatty, extremely readable account of her three years in prostitution.  She is careful to make sure that readers know that this is a memoir, and her story, and not generalizable to the story or the plight of anyone else.  Angell made an informed choice to enter the profession, and an informed choice to leave it, and had the luxury of choice in both situations, as many women do not have.  She has plenty of stories to tell, and is unsparingly critical of herself at times, so her book is funny, raunchy, and sad page by page, but engrossing throughout.<br /><br />Angell finished her Ph.D. in social anthropology in 1995, and while waiting for a position of tenure, she took a series of positions as lecturer.  She was just barely getting by, and then suffered an emotional and financial disaster: her boyfriend not only dumped her but emptied her checking account before doing so.  She needed money just to get by from month to month, more than her limited lecturing could get her.  She signed on for a good one, paying $140 an hour, with $60 going to management.  Angell liked sex, she liked being around people, and she really needed the money.  Any ethical dilemmas over the job lessened when she thought that in her sphere, having casual sex with a man from a singles bar was acceptable but sex as a business proposition wasn't.  Which is really less ethical?  She forces the reader to examine plenty of ethical issues.  She was expecting a lot of kink initially, but \\"What I got instead was the sort of unmemorable sex that invariably characterizes first encounters.\\"  Clumsy and awkward.  As she reflects, \\"It happens in real life all the time.\\"  There was a scary encounter with a cop, and although \\"Most of the fetishes and unusual activities that I encountered were fairly benign, essentially harmless...\\"  a couple of them described here are chilling, though; an argument could be made that prostitutes are providing a larger social function in keeping such activities within the pay-for-play realm.<br /><br />She left the business for reasons she can't be sure of, but it had given her financial security, and a chance to have her desirability confirmed \\"just at the point in my life when Madison Avenue was telling me that I was over the hill.\\"  She admits that she was lucky; Peach cared about her workers.  Even when Angell dipped into cocaine, she was lucky enough not to have whatever it is that makes people addicted.  She writes full time now and has a husband and children.  Her husband had some difficulty initially accepting her past.

The humble fiber here has a grand history, from its first domestication over five thousand years ago to its current genetic modifications.  Cotton may not actually be historically as all-powerful as Yafa makes it seem; like any book that casts an intense regard on a limited subject, _Big Cotton_ can make it seem as if cotton is really more important than, say, coal or sugar, which have in their turn inspired innovation and greed.  Nonetheless, this is an excellent world-wide history, and by the end, Yafa has fully justified his subtitle.<br /><br />First domesticated independently on different continents around 5,500 years ago, the family _Gossypium malavaceae_ bears protective lint around its seeds, fibers that can be spun into fabrics.  The original cotton introduced to Europe came from India in the seventeenth century.  What made chintz an irresistible fad was that the Indians had found ways to die the cotton with brilliant colors that were slow to fade as the cloth was used or washed.  Consumers so prized chintz that they ignored import bans, and eventually English inventors built factories to take production to an industrial scale.  The resulting mill system was enormously lucrative, and also famously cruel, employing children as young as eight for thirteen hour days in hot, dangerous factories in which they constantly inhaled cotton fibers, producing what was eventually known as byssinosis, or brown lung disease.  The American version, begun by Francis Cabot Lowell, who used his photographic memory to steal details of the British machines, was more paternalistic, but economics ensured that American mills, too, became hellish sweatshops.  The aftereffects of the Civil War caused the large plantations to be divided into smaller units that were toiled upon by sharecroppers.  It was a shameful system that impoverished white farmers and black; cotton production, however, did not flag until the boll weevil crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico in 1892 and proceeded inexorably to all the acreage that cotton had claimed.<br /><br />The weevil's entrance enables Yafa to embark on numerous branches of this story, from the use of pesticides to the influence of the weevil, and cotton farming in general, on the music of the blues.  Cotton is a huge topic, and Yafa's often discursive style suits it well, as he discusses entertainingly the rise of denim and of blue jeans (blue because cotton has a particular molecular affinity for dye from the indigo plant); the rise of the current biggest cotton producer, China; Gandhi's use of cotton spinning as a tool against oppression; the modern use of pesticides on the crop (second in tonnage only to those used on corn), which is now forty billion pounds a year worldwide; and the subsidies for American cotton farmers which are disastrous for millions of poor farmers around the world (and may increase their poverty and acceptance of terrorism, Yafa argues).  Yafa explains how a world that is sometimes resistant to genetic modification has embraced GM cotton mostly because you wear cotton and don't eat it.  Such logic is false; you do eat cotton, in cottonseed oil, and in the short fibers go in cheap ice cream to thicken it.  In fact, as Yafa shows, you and almost everyone else in the planet will be using cotton somehow today.  It's a good reason to learn about the plant, and this brightly-written and detailed history does the job nicely.effects of the Civil War caused the large plantations to be divided into smaller units that were toiled upon by sharecroppers.

330711:US	50895620	R1LDKESAQIPMA	0801874343	987101137	Cogwheels of the Mind: The Story of Venn Diagrams	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Venn Adventures	Some animals are birds.  Some animals are black.  Some birds are black.  Draw the Venn diagram for these propositions.  Most high school students have done Venn diagrams; if you can do this picture, you might have drawn a big rectangle, representing animals, containing two overlapping circles, each representing respectively birds and black, and the overlap representing birds that are black.  You may be able to do the diagram, but probably you don't know who Venn was, and you probably don't know what strange reaches of mathematics can be achieved simply by the study of the diagrams.  _Cogwheels of the Mind: The Story of Venn Diagrams_ (Johns Hopkins University Press) by A. W. F. Edwards was written to bring light on these aspects of the subject, and very well succeeds.  A short book, with a fittingly large number of illustrations, it summarizes a wealth of logical and geometric ideas.  Some of the math that springs from these initially simple diagrams will be daunting for those who want to read through quickly, but much is basic and well explained, and the lovely diagrams will repay anyone's study.<br /><br />It is a book that leads in surprising directions, and as befits such a work, Edwards was drawn to the subject almost by chance.  He wanted to put a memorial window up to Venn at the University of Cambridge, and the familiar diagram of three overlapping circles suggested itself.  In doing research for the simple window, Edwards began to wonder about drawing a Venn Diagram for more than three sets.  John Venn had thought about it, too, and found that circles would do for three, not four.  Venn did draw a pretty solution using four ellipses, and realized that any number of sets could be diagrammed, but that the shapes would have to be increasingly convoluted and thus decreasingly explicatory.  Much of the book covers Edwards's own research and discovery in producing symmetrical seven-set Venn diagrams.  There are a total of six versions of such diagrams, and in the color illustrations they look rather like mandalas, with each of the seven regions of exactly the same curvy shape (one looks rather like a fat footprint), rotated around the circle in seven equidistant steps.  Another chapter tells about the author's own method of using spherical surfaces on which to plot the diagrams, and then turning them into Mercator projections.  The attractive seam of a tennis ball looms large in his investigations.<br /><br />This is a very personal book about the subject.  It is written in the first person, and tells of the author's attempts to hit different problems he had proposed to himself.  It is not without humor; at one point in his account of hunting down a symmetrical seven-set diagram (an account which \\"conveys some of the excitement of the chase\\"), he says that in 1992 he had drawn a hopeful initial diagram but that \\"On Monday evening, 16 November, I was bitten by a dog, so on the Tuesday I stayed in [college] in the morning.\\"  Thus do worldly concerns impede intellectual pursuits.  Those familiar with themes frequently found in recreational mathematics will find friends here, with connections between Venn diagrams and Boolean algebra and Grey codes and hypercubes.  It will be no surprise to find Lewis Carroll doing diagrams in his own way, but it might be a surprise to find the diagram, reproduced here, that Winston Churchill drew in 1948 at Hever Castle to show the relations of the sets of the British Empire, United Europe, and the English-Speaking World.  It is a vivid illustration of how universal Venn diagrams are, and Edwards's book is a lively description of one researcher's route of enthusiastic discovery.he color illustrations they look rather like mandalas, with each of the seven regions of exactly the same curvy shape (one looks rather like a fat footprint), rotated around the circle in seven equidistant steps.

In 1961 it was awesome, and in 1956 it was sexy.  In 1948 it was cool but in 1926 it was kitsch.  In 1904 it was hip.  These are in a list of buzzwords for each of the last hundred years, each of which showed up for the first time in that year, or was used for the first time in a special context, like \\"sexy\\" used for \\"interesting\\".  The year-by-year listing, admittedly subjective because there are so many new words being formed every year, appears in _Larpers and Shroomers: The Language Report_ (Oxford University Press) by Susie Dent, a snapshot of our vivaciously growing English language.  While there are those who would favor some sort of language police and a recall to some mythical golden age when grammar was universally used, words were not fads, and meaning was unvarying, Dent's book shows that this never will happen and never has.  A funny volume, with chapters on the newest language of business, food, politics, sport, and more, the book will please anyone interested in words, and increase any reader's vocabulary, but perhaps only with ephemerally useful phrases.  After all, not all the words here are quite tiddly-om-pom-pom (1909).<br /><br />New words are largely reinventions, like \\"sexy\\" for \\"interesting.\\"  In the _Oxford English Dictionary_, which is of course referred to here often, one percent of the words are completely new, the rest being adaptations of some older form, or blends.  There are some new coinages that are borrowings of a fashion anyone would recognize, like adding \\"chic\\" to a word (as in \\"shabby-chic\\").  The snapshot of language here reflects that because of completely new interests (like computer role-playing games), new media for language spread, and the adaptation of English in other countries and cultures, this is a particularly colorful time for word changes.  If you like computer games or role-playing games, you may be a \\"gamer\\", for instance, but if you prefer your role-playing to be in the flesh, you are a \\"larper,\\" one who enjoys Live Action Role Playing games.  (The other word in the book's title, shroomer, means one who uses hallucinogenic mushrooms, or more innocently, one who gathers wild mushrooms for the table.)  As shown in many chapters, the new words are not at all slang, but there is a chapter specifically about slang, with a whole page devoted to the noun, adjective, and verb \\"bling\\".  Even \\"post-bling\\" is now being used.<br /><br />American readers should know that _Larpers and Shroomers_ concentrates some of its pages on new British terms with which not even the hippest American will be familiar.  Most of the book, however, reflects new forms of the language with which the world is doing most of its business and writing most of its web pages.  It is thus a useful work for anyone who uses the language.  Browsers are apt to pick up some lively new words, but also learn about some that are not so new; \\"Generation X\\" actually dates from 1952, for instance.  Here you can learn about \\"dord\\", the infamous \\"ghost word\\" that was in the 1934 Webster's but wasn't a word at all; it had been on an index card that said \\"D or d\\" as the abbreviation for density, and \\"dord\\" was given the meaning \\"density\\".  It had a short life of its own, appearing in other dictionaries that used Webster's as a source.  It's a curious story in an entertaining book about a curious language that is always newer than anyone knows.laying to be in the flesh, you are a \\"larper,\\" one who enjoys Live Action Role Playing games.

Such functions of memory are important, but they are not what we think of as real, personal memory, the subjective recall of what has gone on in our lives, the family reunions, childhood joys and traumas, successive homes, and so on.  These stored personal experiences form our \\"autobiographical memory.\\"  It has only been known as such for about twenty years, basically because the other types of memory (like digit recall) have been more easily subject to psychological testing.  The autobiographical memory is the main subject of essays in _Why Life Speeds Up as You Get Older: How Memory Shapes Our Past_ (Cambridge University Press) by Douwe Draaisma (translated from the Dutch by Arnold and Erica Pomerans).  There are surprisingly few hard answers in this book.  In writing about the near-death experience, for instance, Draaisma says that examining the hypotheses that might explain it makes clear that \\"... all they amount to is a handful of conjectures, a few statistical links and suggestive analogies.\\"  Nonetheless, our autobiographical memories are such an integral part of ourselves that it is fascinating to learn how scientists have been trying to explain just how this vital part of personality operates, and how much of the memory capacity that we take for granted is still mysterious and beyond even initial probes.<br /><br />To start with, despite the book's title which is taken from just one of its chapters, there is not a fully accepted reason for older people to think that life is going faster for them than it did when they were younger.  William James himself in 1890 explained that in youth, there were novel experiences, something new every day, but every passing year brought routine which smoothed the days, weeks, and years into a collapse of time.  A period full of memories, viewed in retrospect, seems to expand and be fuller and longer.  There is a chapter to examine the universal phenomenon that that none of us remember our earliest year or two, not at all.  \\"We shall have to wait and see if our life ends with memory loss,\\" Draaisma writes, \\"what is certain is that it starts with it.\\"  We did have working memories at the time; we were adding buckets of words to our vocabularies, and we had a daily capacity of remembering our relatives, our pets, our routines.  A possible explanation for the veil drawn over the first years of memory is that the child has yet to develop full consciousness; if there is no \\"I\\" within, there can be no autobiographical memory.<br /><br />As befits an expert writing for laymen, Draaisma writes powerfully using comparisons.  In discussing the \\"tip of the tongue\\" phenomenon, where you remember you know something but cannot remember the thing itself, he writes that there is something that has stayed back in the memory, \\"something like the discoloured patch on the wall whose outlines tell you what used to hang there for years.\\"  There is a good range of chapters here to cover aspects of an appealing subject, including the memory and calculating power of so-called idiot savants, the \\"flashbulb memory\\" that enables us to tell exactly (or maybe not) what we were doing when we heard of an earth-shattering event like the 9/11 attacks, the scientific evaluation of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, the examination of why smells can produce such evocative memories, a checkers grandmaster explaining (or being unable to explain) how he plays multiple blindfold games simultaneously, and why we remember humiliating memories so clearly and permanently.  It is fascinating that with such tools as brain scans, we are getting closer to understanding how the mind works, but the memory we take for granted every day has barely begun to yield its secrets..

That was the opinion of no other than George Washington.  The story, recounted in _Bees in America: How the Honey Bee Shaped a Nation_ (University Press of Kentucky) by Tammy Horn, is only one aspect of bee folklore, science, and history recounted in a delightful book full of anecdotes and facts which will spark admiration for this sometimes overlooked part of our nation's agriculture.  The way the bees won the American Revolution is that a Quaker girl was given a message to deliver to Washington concerning an imminent attack by Cornwallis.  The resourceful messenger realized she was being pursued by Redcoats, but as she galloped, she was able to overturn beehives in her path.  The bees went after the Redcoats, Washington got his intelligence, and, well, the rest is history.  Americans have always loved the honey bee not only for its delicious product (and the wax), but also because the hive is a symbol for a perfectly run society.  Paradoxically, it is not a good symbol for our society.  We are loosely organized, everyone joins in the pursuit of happiness in an idiosyncratic way, and we have no official religion, political party, or even family structure.  Bees are little robots, and their regimented roles are fine for them, but not an example for our human ways.  Their industry, however, we like; it is an admirable trait to be \\"as busy as a bee.\\"  We like that the bees make a home for themselves, and that they work hard to ensure that the home will be able to last the winter; they are thrifty, efficient animals.  Americans are quite likely to think that if someone is poor, he ought to take a lesson from the bee.<br /><br />Bees were transported, with great difficulty and much bee mortality, to the earliest of American colonies.  They took to the new land as readily as the human immigrants, going wild and providing sustenance and employment for bee hunters (as opposed to beekeepers).  Many Indians learned to value bees and their products, but one settler wrote that the Osage Indians in 1836 had held a day of mourning because they had found a swarm of bees; it was a sign that the Osage ways were doomed.  Railroad men were horrified at the initial idea of hauling bees, and the man who convinced them to do so in 1907 had to ride along with his hives.  _The American Bee Journal_ editorialized in 1903 that automobiles had a distinct advantage compared to horse-drawn wagons for carrying bees, because autos \\"...will never get frightened, run away and break things by being attacked by cross bees.\\"  The benefits to agriculture from bee pollination are so great that in California, especially with its almond orchards, beekeepers make more money by renting out bees for pollination than they do selling honey or wax.<br /><br />Horn examines such topics as the rehabilitation of returning shell-shocked veterans by beekeeping, the tall tales that surround bees and bee hunters, the use of the bee example by sex educators (who used birds as well), the military use of bees to detect chemicals and explosives, bees in American literature and (disastrously) in movies like _The Swarm_, and the use of electronic tags on hives to deter bee rustlers.  In an up-to-date discussion of current bee problems, ranging from bacteria to mites, beetles, El Ninõ, and cheap imported honey, Horn (a beekeeper herself) reflects that the American beekeeping community is decreasing and bees are dying in record numbers.  There are scientists working on solutions, like breeding hives of bees that will take punctilious and timely care to keep infections low before they can spread; there may also be genetic studies that will lead to more resistant bees.  Horn winds up with the classic reflection that by trying to control bees all these centuries, we have learned many valuable lessons, but none so important as that bees (and nature in general) will never be completely controlled.nd their products, but one settler wrote that the Osage Indians in 1836 had held a day of mourning because they had found a swarm of bees; it was a sign that the Osage ways were doomed.

We bemoan these changes, and according to Steven Mintz in _Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood_, we are merely taking part in a tradition that has gone on for over three hundred years.  (Mintz doesn't mention it, but the same complaints can be found among the ancient Romans, and probably further back.)  You could go back to the Puritans, who believed that children, even infants, were full of the corruption bequeathed to all by Adam and Eve.  The Reverend Benjamin Wadsworth sermonized that babies were \\"filthy, guilty, odious, abominable... both by nature and practice.\\"  So, in the beginning there was no \\"Golden Age of Childhood,\\" the sort of adventure in Eden that the raft supposedly provided to Huckleberry Finn.  Mintz points out, for instance, that idealizing childhood in such a way glosses over that Huck was an abused child fleeing his father.  Mintz examines fully the myths and nostalgia that have made the longing for an idealized childhood, and the criticism of youth for spoiling it, part of our national character.<br /><br />The Puritans regarded child's play as frivolous and trifling; children were imperfect adults who needed to be subjected to intense moral, religious, and vocational training.  For all that, the young people were still addicted to Sabbath-breaking, blasphemy, maypole dancing, and fornication.  Mintz explains that the elders' combination of hope and fear about the next generation is a lasting legacy even for us today.  Girls and boys took part in roles within the American Revolution, making \\"sons and daughters of liberty\\" not just an accidental phrase.  With the Revolution over, parental citizens desired to produce good progeny citizens, and at least in the middle class, education was emphasized.  At the same time, there was a romantic vision of childhood that insisted that fragile, innocent children had to be sheltered from harsh adult realities.  There was no way that the poor, or slaves, could participate in the new romantic view, and Mintz takes care to present their plights, as well as the more general tendency of child-rearing in the nation.  During the nineteenth century, children's labor in mills, sweatshops, and mines was the rule.  These evils were eventually legislated away because of the pressures from reformers, but child labor laws did not intrude into agriculture.  The Depression changed for good the notion that the federal government should stay out of promoting children's welfare (which had been left to families, charities, and local governments).  The New Deal included provisions for free school lunches and federal aid to education, as well as the seminal Aid to Dependent Children.  Mintz reflects that the universality of high school has made the schools important as placement agencies and leisure organizers.  In the nineteenth century, self-improvement clubs organized by and for young people were the fashion, but the adults that ran the high schools began to run such activities as well.<br /><br />There certainly are problems of stress and disconnection faced by young people today, but as Mintz shows, the efforts to insulate children into some nostalgic vision of innocence by means of V-chips or Internet filters will not keep contemporary culture from influencing them.  It is better to prepare them for dealing responsibly with the real world.  He argues that government should be more involved in providing children mentoring relationships and opportunities to serve the community, but his suggestions that government take the necessary steps obvious to him, of ensuring better nutrition, clothing, schooling, and health care, may not be at all realistic in the current economic or political environment.

Grave robbing is part of archeological history, and continues today.  The lesson in Roger Atwood's book, _Stealing History: Tomb Raiders, Smugglers, and the Looting of the Ancient World_ (St. Martin's Press) is that starting in the twentieth century, grave robbing became much more efficient, and is effectively robbing not just graves, but robbing civilizations of their history.  Atwood has concentrated on one particular site, the royal tombs at Sip&aacute;n in Peru, and has given its sad modern history in great detail, but that has not stopped him from taking a larger historical view.  Throughout the book are the contrasting digging techniques and aims of the robber and the archeologist, with the practical realization that often the two must at least informally work together, particularly in the case of looters finding valuable sites with the archeologist ideally showing up very soon afterwards before the good stuff is gone.  Atwood's sobering book shows that there is no reason to assume that the archeologists are winning, and that the treasures of the world may simply be dug out soon, with little learned from the spoils and no more left to learn from.<br /><br />The problem, of course, is that treasures ripped out of context lose their meaning; one archeologist said that looted objects are pretty but dumb.  The problem is accelerated by faster shipping, with traders able to bring looted goods to international markets with an efficiency that was previously unimaginable.  Atwood has gone out with the diggers; he gives a scary account of accompanying them on what was for them just an evening's work.  He is able to do this in good conscience because the robbers themselves are not the villains of the book.  They often have no other means of survival, and are using their land for its best possible production.  The bad guys are the dealers, private collectors, and even museum officials who power the digging engine by means of huge payments further up the delivery chain.  The main hero of the book is the famous Peruvian archeologist Walter Alva.  He had dug up tombs, and run a provincial museum, a quiet and obscure professional life, until looters struck a Sip&aacute;n tomb in 1987, emerging with riches in gold of a type that had never been seen before or documented.  The dealers moved fast to close in on the find, and the smooth robbing of the territory was only stopped when one of the looters felt cheated of his fair pay, and alerted police.  When the police found a looter's hoard, they called Alva, who got his first glimpse of the treasures which would make his<br /><br />name in archeology.<br /><br />Atwood has described many aspects of the world trade in archeological loot, and how it damages all of us.  There is a description of steps here that might cure the problem, like a moratorium on trade in antiquities that have no accurate record of provenance.  He admits that there are no magic bullets in his recommendations, and that there will always be loopholes.  Museums would have to change their bureaucratic ways, dealers would have to give up part of a lucrative business, and governments would have to enact legislation without succumbing to pressure from the antiquities lobbies.  Significantly, he gives examples of locals on other archeological sites who have seen the advantage of preserving their past rather than exploiting it.  It will all be a tough sell at all levels, but Atwood's book is clear documentation that unless changes come, the current system will deprive \\"everyone who ever will live of part of the collective memory that makes us human.\\"ate collectors, and even museum officials who power the digging engine by means of huge payments further up the delivery chain.

You may have seen the classic magical trick of sawing a woman in half.  And perhaps you have seen the Indian rope trick: the conjurer, standing in an open field, throws one end of a rope into the air, where defying gravity, it stays, and a boy comes to climb up the rope, reaches the top, and disappears.  No, you have not seen that one, perhaps, but it is as famous as the others and has caused a century of wonder, perhaps not from audiences but from those who have tried to see the illusion and tried to learn how it was done.  In _The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick: How a Spectacular Hoax Became History_ (Thunder's Mouth Press), Peter Lamont, a magician and an academic researcher on the performance of magic, has written a hugely entertaining book about the most legendary and exotic of magic tricks.  \\"A legend is very much like an illusion,\\" he writes, \\"more interesting and invariably more attractive than reality.\\"  We need legends, and this one is so colorful and mysterious, Lamont's careful probing and deflating make it even more attractive.<br /><br />The amazing truth is that there never was any Indian rope trick, and it has almost nothing to do with India.  It was the invention of a loyal American, a journalist who later went on to become the head of the US Secret Service.  John Elbert Wilkie was a reporter for the _Chicago Tribune_, and in 1890 he published an anonymous article describing the rope trick as seen in India, and how it was done.  He made it all up.  There were those who spoke up, certain that people were seeing the rope trick before 1890, but there are no accounts of the trick before that time.  A few weeks later, the _Tribune_ published a confession that the story was a hoax, but newspapers across America and Europe were spreading the story, while the retraction got nowhere.  As Lamont writes, \\"A legend does not survive on accuracy.\\"  The community of magicians, and those fascinated by their effects, became split between those who were convinced that the rope trick was a real illusion and those who thought it an illusory illusion.  The efforts of those who believed the trick to be real have been extensive.  A photograph was finally produced of the trick in 1919, but it turned out to be the far more prosaic trick of a boy balancing on a pole.  People had seen the trick in India, but they turned out to be people who were reported as seeing it by other people, the familiar \\"friend of a friend\\" basis of countless urban legends.  There were those who claim to have seen the trick themselves.  Many of them took decades to speak up and say that they had actually seen the trick performed, but a psychologist has found that the memories get elaborated, with fancier versions being recalled the more distant the memory is.<br /><br />One particular elaboration has outdone Wilkie's conception, and has had its own life, supporters, and detractors.  This is the version in which the boy climbs the rope and the magician climbs up after him, only to chop the boy up and throw his separated pieces down, whereupon they are magically reunited and the boy brought back to life.  As in the original, there are those who claim to know just how this trick is done, but of course it is never done.  Throughout this book is documented the human eagerness to believe; skeptics may assure the public with factual assertions about how the trick never existed, but as Lamont writes, the people who keep Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster going are the same types that will keep the Indian rope trick in existence, even though it never had an existence to begin with.  With his book, full of arcane facts and documentation presented by a humorous and entertaining guide, Lamont knows that he is only going to strengthen the legend.  In fact, in a jaunty epilogue, he tells us he has, indeed, seen the trick himself, and any reader will agree, he tells a good story.those fascinated by their effects, became split between those who were convinced that the rope trick was a real illusion and those who thought it an illusory illusion.

No one would think it right to punish a child, for instance, for something the child could not conceive as wrong, and it should be the same for criminals who lack such judgement.  There have been many laws concerning such matters, starting with the famous McNaughton rule, formed in England in 1843, which ruled that one could not be found guilty if there was no capacity to know an action was against the law.  It is surprising that society may have been dealing with insane criminals with more sensibility and sensitivity before McNaughton than after.  That is one of the lessons in _Mad Mary Lamb: Lunacy and Murder in Literary London_ (Norton) by Susan Tyler Hitchcock.  Mary Lamb probably had a bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, starting around 1796, and it had to be treated intermittently for the rest of her life.  This did not preclude her producing, with her brother, the classic _Tales from Shakespeare_.  Hitchcock has brought light to this forgotten instance of madness, and examined Mary Lamb's case from literary, social, legal, and psychiatric sides, to tell a remarkable story of madness and redemption.<br /><br />On 22 September 1796, Mary Lamb, 31 years old, was at her parents' home above a wig shop in London, when she took her knife and stabbed her mother in the chest, killing her, and she threw a fork that cut her father's forehead.  The gruesome crime is at the very start of Hitchcock's book, and it made a sensation at the time.  She was not tried for murder, and she was not put into prison.  She was put under the care of her younger brother Charles, a renowned essayist, and remained in Charles's care for the rest of his life.  Many of their years together were spent in fruitful literary collaboration between brother and sister.  Mary was lucky; Charles was a clerk, not well off, but he was able to get her into private asylums rather than the public ones like Bedlam.  Once Mary had emerged from her initial confinement, she and Charles set up house together, and were to do so for life.  Neither married.  They held in common close friends, many of whom had literary connections.  They held salons, at which might be found such lights as Samuel Coleridge, William Hazlitt, Mary Wollstonecraft, or William Wordsworth.<br /><br />Originally, Mary helped Charles merely as a copyist, making manuscripts of his essays or plays to be delivered to others.  But gradually, she began writing on her own, not just copying, but making her own poems and essays.  Through the book, her writing grows in competence along with her confidence in herself, first stilted and halting letters and then poems.  Her printed work was often written in tandem with Charles, and it is difficult to tease who wrote what in their joint productions.  In the most famous of them, _Tales from Shakespeare_, she gave the bulk of the stories, according to Charles, but his name, not hers, was on the title page.  Hitchcock gives an excellent summary of how the Lambs changed the plays into stories, often difficult changes that were accomplished with such success that the book has remained in print ever since, and is still a useful guide to each play.  She wrote other books for children, innovative for their time.  For a woman and a mental patient she achieved a great deal in the literary world to which she and her brother were devoted.  Hitchcock's book is a welcome reminder that she is not just a footnote to her brother's life.ublic ones like Bedlam.

It was only when scientists had an understanding of what atoms were that they began to realize that there were huge spaces between atoms.  Later they got to understand that an atom itself consisted mostly of empty space, a big outer shell where electrons whizzed around, containing only a tiny nucleus.  The image of the big shell and the tiny nucleus was given by comparison, a comparison that gives the title to _The Fly in the Cathedral: How a Group of Cambridge Scientists Won the International Race to Split the Atom_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) by Brian Cathcart.  Actually, the atom had been split long before, if the atom, which had been considered indivisible, is split by chipping electrons off that outer cathedral-like shell.  But \\"splitting the atom\\" has long had the real meaning of splitting the nucleus, and this is the intriguing story of the stolid, energetic and gentlemanly scientists at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge who in 1932 brought forth the birth of nuclear physics.<br /><br />The commanding presence in the book, just as he was as he oversaw the lab, is Sir Earnest Rutherford, a \\"barreling, thundering, penetrating presence in the world of physics, a great rowdy boy full of ideas and energy.\\"  He was thrilled by the ardor of the chase in scientific exploration, and he was an ingenious experimenter, although he was often clumsy with apparatus.  In 1927, Rutherford as its president addressed the Royal Society, proposing a new way forward for solving the problem of the composition of the nucleus.  If it were possible to accelerate particles artificially, he said, by huge voltages of electricity, they could be slammed against the nucleus and the scattered wreckage analyzed.  This sounds completely sensible now, but there was no equipment that could produce such accelerations.  The two heroes of this book, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, worked in Rutherford's lab, and were easily persuaded to join the chase.  Cockcroft was so quiet that his children eventually made the rule that \\"Daddy could not leave the dinner table until he had uttered two whole sentences.\\"  He was superb at designing and making experimental equipment that no one else had thought of before, but was not the experimenter that Rutherford would have liked.  Walton was.  Another quiet man, he was the son of a minister and a devout Methodist who shunned any activity that might be called frivolous.  He came up with the idea of accelerating particles electrically on his own, and when he proposed such work to his boss, Rutherford was of course delighted.  In 1932, after almost four years of patient, frustrating, exhausting, and inspiring work, protons bombarded a strip of lithium, and the lithium nucleus cracked open into two helium nuclei.<br /><br />Part of the charm of this book is that it describes work done in a scientific atmosphere that was like none found today.  Rutherford, even though a hard taskmaster, insisted that at six at night, everyone had to go home.  He would not have his researchers overextend themselves, and at that time, all circuits were switched off, no matter what experiment was in progress.  He did, however, allow this strict curfew to be waived once Walton and Cockcroft had made their initial findings, so that they could confirm them and rush into print ahead of the other experimenters in other nations that were trying to break down the nucleus as well.  The two experimenters did not exactly become household names, like, say, Watson and Crick, but there was some (often misdirected) praise from the press, and they got plenty of recognition from their peers.  Albert Einstein visited the lab and was thrilled with what he saw; incidentally, the experiment was the first laboratory verification of his famous equation E = mc^2.  It took almost twenty years, but Walton and Cockcroft were awarded Nobel prizes, which also failed to make them famous.  Modest, quiet, grayscientists, they probably were happy to have it that way., gray scientists, they probably were happy to have it that way.  <br />	2005-02-04

Full of fanciful characters, unlikely stories of origins, and tall tales, the world of the stripper has not been seriously documented, and yet the career of stripping is one full of questions about the place of women in society, exploitation of workers, and the old fascination of watching women take their clothes off.  In _Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show_ (from the less-than-salacious Oxford University Press), Rachel Shteir, a professor of theater, has produced a big, thorough book for which she has dug into newspaper and legal records all over the country, and also into such resources as the Sally Rand Archives in Chicago and the Gypsy Rose Lee papers in New York.  There are illustrations here, some of them pretty, none of them scandalous, and Shteir's tone throughout is a serious one, although there is plenty of bounce in the subject and much good humor quoted from many of the people profiled here.  It is an authoritative tome on what many would consider a frivolous or even offensive topic, and has much to tell us about the relationships between the sexes.<br /><br />Much of this history has to do with the Minsky family in their Lower East Side theater, who parodied Ziegfeld and brought the girls to working class audiences.  The Minskys were responsible for many innovations in burlesque.  They introduced many comic and slapstick acts, and boosted ticket prices.  They didn't mind offending the censorious, and they were willing to break the law for publicity purposes.  They introduced the runway, the extension of the stage that enabled a performer to remain onstage but to penetrate into the eager and enthusiastic audience; the runway was named by an appreciative wit the \\"Bridge of Thighs\\".  The Minskys enjoyed titling their productions in jubilantly obscene ways, as they brought out _The Sway of All Flesh_, _Panties Inferno_, and _Dress Takes a Holiday_.  debuted Gypsy Rose Lee in 1931, and she graduated into Ziegfeld a few years later.  She was the most famous stripper in history, and gets a full and fascinating chapter here.  Because she had more than just her looks going for her, she stretched her career into a third decade and wrote best-selling mysteries and stories for _The New Yorker_.  Her memoirs were turned into the Broadway musical _Gypsy_ in 1959.  Shteir works on the premise that stripping enabled women to work in a particular field, to develop themselves artistically, and to harness a sexuality that men would pay for.  Maybe stripping was a blow for feminine power, but sometimes it was just survival.  Carrie Finnell, whose \\"Educated Bosom\\" premiered the twirling of tassels, said, \\"I ain't in it for glory, I want to eat.\\"<br /><br />Stripping is not dead, but it has well passed its heyday.  Among the many reasons which Shteir cites for its decline is urban renewal, which took away many of even the most famous burlesque houses.  Others became adult film venues, first showing films of famous strippers in their routines, to go along with the on-stage acts, and then just showing regular adult fare.  The visibility of broader expanses of skin in routine situations has made a difference; the Frenchman who invented the bikini had to hire a stripper to model his invention, since no professional model would do so, but of course bikinis (and less) can be seen on beaches the world over now.  Most importantly, performances featuring nudity became just women without clothes, simply appearing topless in go-go bars.  The fun, parody, and eroticism of the tease was gone.  Striptease was an influential movement, and Shteir quotes such authors as Jean Cocteau and e. e. cummings who had much to say on the stripper's art.  (At one point, however, she muses, \\"Perhaps it is absurd to bring Samuel Beckett into a discussion of striptease at all.  And yet.... )  Shteir's book is therefore a memorial, a fine documentation ofa way of entertainment that has had its day.of a way of entertainment that has had its day. <br />	2005-02-01

As children grow up, their brains obviously change; not only do the neurons get charged with all the information the children acquire, but the brains physically change as well.  It should be no surprise that children who have physical problems in upbringing, like, say, a bad diet, have brains that don't properly grow.  It is also no surprise that children who are brought up in emotionally distressing situations have trouble getting along with others into adulthood.  It was a surprise to find out, however, that children who are brought up under stress actually have brains that are physically different, and operate differently, from those who are well cared for.  In the ambitiously-titled _Why Love Matters: How Affection Shapes a Baby's Brain_ (Brunner-Routledge), Sue Gerhardt has summarized current findings in neuroscience about the developing brains of infants and how that development is influenced by the infants' early attachment experiences.  Her work will be tough in parts for those unfamiliar with the neurological territory, but she presents many appealing examples, illustrations, and case studies, so that anyone might enjoy here learning about the inchoate findings of the links between attachment experiences and brain development.<br /><br />The idea that experiences change brains physically, beyond the mere instillation of learning, is fully accepted.  Gerhardt concentrates on the orbitofrontal cortex and on the effects of cortisol, a stress hormone which is required for development of the cortex and other brain regions, but which causes such development to be thwarted if the levels are too high.  Babies who are stressed, who do not get proper attention and do not have confidence in being cared for, are likely to have high cortisol levels with resultant malformation of the orbitofrontal cortex.  Early experience and patterns of attachment do change brain chemistry and structure in ways that cannot be changed back after a circumscribed period of development.  It used to be that studying how babies would respond to their caregivers could only be done by sitting behind a two-way mirror and doing limited, uncruel experiments and watching the behavioral results.  It could be observed, for instance, that an inconsistent parent could tend to produce an anxious child.  This is the sort of \\"soft\\" science that is a target for being woolly-headed liberal supposition, but it can now begin to be supplemented with the hard facts of neuroscience.<br /><br />How we are treated as babies influences how our brains develop and determines how we get along with others.  As Gerhardt says, this is one of the strange things about research in this field: \\"After developing ingenious experiments and rigorous controls, the fruits of its labours tend to be blindingly obvious.\\"  It is, however, important that we now are getting a scientific basis to show that what is self-evident actually can be shown by evidence.  The evidence compellingly argues for a responsive style of care, continuously available, as the best environment for a baby, and Gerhardt's own work as a psychotherapist has taken on cases of parents and babies who need assistance in arranging such an environment.  Her case illustrations are excellent and readable, and the simple lesson, now backed by hard science, that babies need and deserve responsive care for proper emotional development, cannot be overstressed.emistry and structure in ways that cannot be changed back after a circumscribed period of development.

The Swift and Terrible Beauty of Air	Books	5	1	1	N	N	How We Got To Understand Air, And To Ruin It	Among the big problems with air is that it is invisible (with luck) and that we don't have to pay for it.  We get to regard with specific attention the food we buy, and if you don't like the tap water you pay for, you can always spring for bottled.  Air, on the other hand, is taken for granted, and you usually don't even think of even one of the 19,000 breaths you take every day.  Like any other big subject we don't think about, air is hugely complicated, but in _Gasp! The Swift and Terrible Beauty of Air_ (Shoemaker & Hoard), Joe Sherman has covered the topic fully in many different ways.  He writes, \\"Understanding air, which is both big and amorphous, and small and right in front of you, demands a few mental oscillations.\\"  He makes the oscillations fun, from basic principles of gas exchange within your lungs to the different gods of the sky people have believed in to the evolution of our planet's atmosphere to the current worries about pollution and global warming.  As if the subject isn't big enough, he has taken many discursive asides; he just has so many facts he has to disclose to the reader, but his grasp of his subject is sure and his ability to convey complexities in understandable terms is excellent.<br /><br />Much of the book is devoted to the history of our understanding about the air and the thinkers who have tried to break down the invisible to see what it was made of.  For instance, in 1648, the mathematician Blaise Pascal repeated the experiments of Torricelli with the new invention, the barometer.  Not only did he check air pressure at the bottom of a tower stairs and at the top, he went to the mountains to try the effect.  Pascal reasoned that air would weigh less and less the further one ascended, eventually winding up in a void.  This sounds sensible to us, but it was anathema to the church; if there was a vacuum way up there, there was no Aristotelian scheme of higher spheres, especially the one that was where God lived.  Pascal's ideas were attacked by the Jesuits.  Lavoisier and Priestley eventually helped do away with the concept of phlogiston when they discovered oxygen, but the air explorers were not just at work in their labs.  There is Other chemists took to the air in hot-air balloons and later hydrogen balloons.  In 1862, Henry Coxwell and James Glaisher rode their basket gondola beneath a hot-air balloon to become the first to reach the stratosphere.  Their altimeter indicated that they had reached 35,000 feet, but like most of the equipment and procedures of the flight, it went wildly wrong.  They had a truly heroic battle against cold and a new malaise, altitude sickness, that imperiled their judgement and their lives.<br /><br />The universe has spent a long time producing our atmosphere, and Sherman starts from the Big Bang to the Cambrian explosion of half a billion years ago, when oxygen was boosted to current atmospheric levels by plants, enabling the eventual takeover of the land by animals.  The final third of _Gasp!_ is devoted to our very recent destruction of the atmosphere that was so long in coming.  He has lived in Los Angeles, and he has written before about American car culture, and he is disdainful of how little attention governments in general, and our government in particular, are paying to air's problems.  The phasing out of Freon and other such chemicals because of their destruction of the ozone layer that protects us from the ultraviolet is actually an environmental success story.  Sherman shows, however, that just as in the current debate over global warming, such anti-regulation politicians as Tom DeLay insisted in 1995 that banning chemicals that destroy the ozone layer was all based on dubious science.  The current administration is eager to relax rules that might bother business, and has wanted to relax pro-ozone rules as well, despite the documented reaccumulation of ozone since the rules were enforced.  Profit-making corporations, Sherman shows, have a good historyof making profits, and a bad one of serving public health.  We have industrial (especially automotive) pollutants and the potential for weather changes that are going to reshape civilization; but he reminds us that \\"Clean air is about as public a concern as it is possible to imagine.\\"  It might be that corporations will get eager to forego profits for health, and it might be that government will get eager to draw up rules to make this happen; but don't hold your breath.istory of making profits, and a bad one of serving public health.

The letters between them, written in twelfth century France, are flirtatious, intellectual, dramatic, tragic, and erotic.  The world for centuries has been fascinated by the eight letters exchanged by them when they were forced to be apart, but then a few years ago emerged a cache of letters they sent each other while they were also having passionate physical and intellectual exchanges.  James Burge has drawn upon the letters old and new to produce _Heloise & Abelard: A New Biography: (HarperSanFrancisco) which is a genial guide to the classic story, a thoughtful and affecting work that explains the times, religion, and politics of a vastly different age.  No American reader, however, will come away without thinking about the current influence of conservative or restrictive religious ideals, or of the continued desire of those in power to impose moral values.<br /><br />In 1115 Abelard was 36 years old, a teacher of logic and master of the Cathedral School at Notre Dame in Paris.  Heloise was fifteen years younger when they met.  She was the niece of a local Parisian canon named Fulbert, and she came to the attention of Abelard because of her learning and her desire to learn.  She became Abelard's pupil, and then his mistress.  Even though they spent a lot of time in personal tutorials, they wrote letters to each other.  Abelard wrote, \\"Our desires left no stage of lovemaking untried, and if love could devise something new we welcomed it.\\"  Heloise was consumed as well; this couple enjoyed their intellectual exchanges, enjoyed romance, but they really enjoyed sex.  At least one time they made love in the refectory of a church.  Years later, looking back on the torrid year and a half of their affair, Heloise wrote even as an abbess, \\"The lovers' pleasures that we enjoyed together were so sweet to me that they can never displease me.\\"  When Fulbert found out about the affair, he threw Abelard out, and when Heloise became pregnant, he forced them to get married.  It would seem that Fulbert would have been satisfied with the outcome he had engineered, but he was still enraged at the loss of his family's honor, and perhaps at the loss of Heloise as well.  He sent his henchmen out to Abelard's house one night, and they castrated him.  Abelard became a monk and made Heloise become a nun.<br /><br />He preceded her in death, when his body was taken back to the crypt of the little church of Heloise's abbey, and she was eventually buried there as well.  The Paraclete did not survive the French Revolution, but the lovers' remains were brought back to Paris and became initial celebrity occupants of the newly formed P&eacute;re Lachaise cemetery.  It may be that the graves of Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison get more visits there now, but the Gothic Revival monument of Abelard and Heloise does not lack for flowers brought by those captivated by a romantic and frankly sexual story.  Burge has been careful to set quotations from the letters in the circumstances of their times.  There are, sadly, huge gaps in the story, years we do not know about and thoughts that even these prolific pen-pals kept to themselves; Burge has always indicated when he is making suppositions.  He is particularly strong on church history and thought, especially contrasted with the words of Heloise who joined a religious to a sexual rapture.  There can be no doubt that these two were serious thinkers and soundly Christian, but theirs was a strikingly modern faith that could accommodate desire and eroticism.can never displease me.\\"  When Fulbert found out about the affair, he threw Abelard out, and when Heloise became pregnant, he forced them to get married.

382634:US	50895620	R1G0YAFP2X5OIS	0262033240	776802122	The Pan Am Building and the Shattering of the Modernist Dream	Books	5	17	18	N	N	A Behemoth Bad Example	In 1987, _New York_ magazine ran a poll to determine the buildings that New Yorkers hate the most.  The results were plain on a cover of the magazine, which showed a gigantic wrecking ball taking its first swipe at the Pan Am Building.  The building is not only on New Yorkers' most hated list; though it has had a few defenders, it has since its inception drawn criticism from a worldwide public, from architects, and from professional architecture critics.  How could such an unloved mass ever have been plonked on Park Avenue?  There are plenty of reasons for the failure, and plenty of repercussions from it, and all is told in _The Pan Am Building and the Shattering of the Modernist Dream_ (MIT Press) by Meredith L. Clausen.  Professor Clausen teaches architectural history, and she has produced a big, well-illustrated, and weighty volume that covers the history of the building and the history of much of twentieth century urban architecture.  There are plenty of books devoted to particular building that are considered architectural successes; Clausen shows that one devoted to a failure can be just as interesting, though perhaps not as inspiring.<br /><br />The Pan Am Building was conceived in 1958.  It was to be part of the complex of the Beaux Arts masterpiece, the Grand Central Station, which had been completed in 1913.  The economic force behind the construction was Erwin Wolfson, a highly respected and successful real estate developer who had a quiet manner, broad interests, and remarkable erudition.  Wolfson was unable to accept the proposal of Richard Roth, whose firm was prolifically designing efficient and economic buildings for businesses, and wanted a well known architect with a name, one that would provide the building with prestige and enable it more readily to be rented to moneyed clients.  He didn't get one architect with a name, but two.  Walter Gropius had an established worldwide reputation as an architect and an academic spokesman for the Modern Movement, the glass and steel functionalism produced by the famous Bauhaus school.  He was joined by Pietro Belluschi, who had previously worked with him, an architect who had experience as a design consultant and architect for corporations, and who had previously designed tall office buildings, as Gropius had not.  The resulting design was released to the public in February 1959.  It was the largest office tower in the world, 59 stories tall, of faceted glass and concrete exterior, in a shape of a broad octagonal prism.  It spanned the full width of Park Avenue, looming over the Grand Central Terminal.  Where the terminal had above it the less soaring but more delicate New York General Building and then simply sky, the new building would block any vista and would dwarf adjacent buildings due to its immensity.  Observers found the building a betrayal of the civic principles that Gropius and Belluschi had espoused.  Just as the public could not stop the construction, it could not stop Pan Am's installation of a heliport on the roof, for express trips to and from the surrounding airports.  It was too noisy and too dangerous, people said, and they were eventually proved right; the heliport was closed after a fatal crash in 1977, and one of the five fatalities was a pedestrian on the street below.<br /><br />The accident sullied the reputation of Pan American Airways, which was under financial difficulties and went bankrupt in 1979.  The building now bears a MetLife sign, but has had no change in the professional and amateur dislike directed toward it.  Paris's Eiffel Tower was disliked when it was built, and is now beloved; nothing like that is going to happen to the Pan Am Building.  The debacle has had its upside.  The next development of the area was to have been a huge rectangular block constructed over the station, but the preposterous addition was so vilified that the Landmarks Preservation Commission's refusal to allow it was upheld by the Supreme Court.  The Pan Am Building had disillusioned architectural professionals and the public, and served best in the capacity of a bad example, something the city should never allow again.  Clausen's wonderful, detailed look at the failure is also a cautionary tale on hubris and the risks of letting money do just what it wants to make more of itself.Am Building had disillusioned architectural professionals and the public, and served best in the capacity of a bad example, something the city should never allow again.

It's an instrument of war for attack and defense against the enemy.\\"  So said Pablo Picasso, as World War II was ending.  He must have reflected at the time that even the most famous painting-as-weapon had not really made a difference in a previous war or the current one.  Still, his _Guernica_ had made an impression, and it still does.  When war against Iraq was being considered, the United Nations's huge tapestry reproduction of the painting (originally made for Nelson Rockefeller, and donated by him to the UN) was covered up.  A plain blue background was needed for the broadcasters in the building, said a UN spokesman; you won't be able to pull a cover on the upcoming carnage in Iraq, said an Australian delegate.  In _Guernica: The Biography of a Twentieth-Century Icon_ (Bloomsbury) Gijs van Hensbergen has given a readable summary of both the art and the politics of the painting, from the history of the Spanish Civil War and the heinous bombing that it depicts to its eventual return to the Spanish republic.  There is thus plenty of twentieth century history here, and art theory, and biography of the most influential painter of the century.  It is all wonderfully well integrated and fascinating.<br /><br />In 1937, Picasso was in Paris when he heard of the atrocity of the firebombing of Gernika (Basque spelling), far behind the lines and without military connections, arranged by Franco and carried out by the Nazis as an initial experiment in what we have come to know as \\"total war.\\"  He had procrastinated on a commission for the Paris Expo, but in a frenzy of inspiration, he drew his first sketches and five weeks later had completed the painting.  After the Expo, the painting began its extensive travels, with the aim of giving support to the anti-fascists in Spain.  Picasso refused to let it go anywhere in Spain until \\"a genuine Spanish republic had been restored.\\"  Picasso was satisfied with _Guernica_ settling in New York: \\"By means of _Guernica_ I have the pleasure of making a political statement every day in the middle of New York.\\"  But as a communist, his work was suspect, and the references to Franco and the Spanish Civil War were dropped from the label at the Museum of Modern Art.  J. Edgar Hoover asked specifically that the US Embassy in Paris send any info on Picasso, even though the FBI had no business trying to get dirt on foreigners.  The file on Picasso included asinine whoppers such as the accusation that he was a Russian spy.  A congressman from Michigan state seems to have assumed a Rush Limbaugh-like role as radio commentator, railing against Picasso as \\"the hero of all the crackpots in so-called modern art\\" and that \\"critics who support modern art should be attended to.\\"<br /><br />Picasso died in 1973, and Franco in 1975.  Franco had been increasingly ill and distant from actual power, and Picasso's work had gradually been allowed to be shown within Spain.  Poster reproductions of _Guernica_ were popular.  Picasso had not lost his bite, and gallery owners had to worry about vandalism, some of the worries proving to be entirely justified.  The final section of the book deals with the difficult and labyrinthine negotiations to bring the painting back to the home it had never known.  Politicians, lawyers, Basques, city boosters, and heirs all had to have their say, but eventually under extreme security, the massive canvass made a triumphal entry into Madrid in 1981, originally installed in a huge, guarded box of bullet-proof glass.  One commentator observed, \\"Today the last exile has returned to Spain.\\"  That is the sort of tribute and the degree of importance attributed to _Guernica_ repeatedly through the book.  Its detractors, frequently quoted here, may be many, and its influence in actually stopping war may be nil.  It will forever haunt us, though, like a conscience that insists that someday war ought to be no more.in New York: \\"By means of _Guernica_ I have the pleasure of making a political statement every day in the middle of New York.\\"  But as a communist, his work was suspect, and the references to Franco and the Spanish Civil War were dropped from the label at the Museum of Modern Art.

The most famous participant was Wyatt Earp, who has been portrayed in at least thirty movies, and you can imagine with what degree of realism.  For instance, who remembers that because of the shootout, Wyatt and his sidekick Doc Holliday were actually brought to court for murder?  In the lawless West, the law took its course, and in _Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp_ (Yale University Press), Steven Lubet has looked at the legend and the legal outcome.  This particular gunfight is still argued about by experts and western fans, and it is certainly the case that important parts of the event itself are never going to be completely understood.  However, the subsequent trial was well documented, and Lubet's is the first book to tell the often surprising story of the court fight after the gun fight.  Lubet is a lawyer himself, and brings much legal insight to a story that is usually only told as western legend.<br /><br />Tombstone was a town that had sprung up in response to silver mining, and in true boomtown fashion it would fold only a few years after the shootout (it has come back as a tourist site since then).  Around the town were cowboys, not at this time the respectable ranch-hands who managed cattle production, but small time ranchers who raided herds in Mexico to replenish stock, and robbed stagecoaches as a sideline.  Virgil Earp came to town as a US marshal and Wyatt followed as a deputy county sheriff; they were professional lawmen, and would have been immediately marked as enemies of the cowboys.  Youngest brother Morgan was there as well, and following Wyatt was the disreputable Doc Holliday he had inexplicably befriended.  Among the cowboys were Ike and Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury.  Ike got into a shouting match with Doc in the Alhambra Saloon, in which Virgil had to intervene.  Ike spent the night drinking and cursing the Earps, and on 26 October 1881 enlisted the McLaurys and his brother Billy to arm themselves and prepare to meet the lawmen.  Three of the cowboys died, and public sympathy turned from the lawmen to those they had killed.  Five days later there was a preliminary hearing which was to determine if the accused men ought to be bound over for a trial.  It is this hearing that forms the mass of the book, with an examination of the legal procedures of the time compared to those now.<br /><br />The hearing lasted a month, with thirty different witnesses, some of them surprise witnesses called by the defense.  As a lawyer, Lubet is very good at alerting readers to mistakes the lawyers on both sides made.  \\"As desperate lawyers often do...\\" he explains when a lawyer stalls for time after a witness has given a surprisingly unfavorable response, or \\"Then the cross examiner blundered in a manner still all too familiar to trial lawyers, by asking one question too many.\\"  Spicer found that although Virgil had acted \\"incautiously and without due circumspection,\\" the defendants had committed only \\"a necessary act, done in the discharge of official duty.\\"  There is a short epilogue after the trial; Virgil was ambushed in revenge and crippled for life, Morgan was shot and killed while playing billiards, and Wyatt conducted a \\"vendetta ride\\" to kill those responsible for attacking his brothers.  This all sounds more like western history as depicted in the cinema.

They involved human error, and they all happened when the humans ought, by biological fiat, to have been sleeping.  We are ruled by our clocks now, but even in the unnatural world we have made for ourselves, we cannot get away from the natural clocks that our cells expect us to follow.  Like almost all living things in the planet, from plants to bacteria to birds, we have \\"a biological clock that was first set ticking more than three billion years ago.\\"  In _Rhythms of Life: The Biological Clocks that Control the Daily Lives of Every Living Thing_ (Yale University Press), Russell G. Foster, a professor of molecular neuroscience, and Leon Kreitzman, a writer and broadcaster, have examined the investigations of a relatively new science, chronobiology, to show just how much sway natural time has over us and other organisms.  It isn't just a tale of sleepy people in control making bad judgments, although cognition and prudence do have their daily cycles.  We tend to have babies (natural birthing) in the early mornings, and heart attacks in the later morning, and lovemaking around 10 p.m.  Physical coordination, liver metabolism, body temperature, heart rate, kidney function, and much more all are paying attention to the biological clock, and when we jump time zones or do shift work, we do so at our peril.<br /><br />Many of these cycles are specifically examined here, along with the historical hunt for the biological roots of the rhythmicity.  A couple of the chapters dealing with the dance of molecules will be daunting for those uninitiated into the basics of cellular biology, but they do well to show the intricacies of the molecular mechanisms and the depth of work that has been done in this field.  There are not just daily rhythms, but annual ones.  Migratory birds the whole world over know when to start their travels north or south; they do so not by counting the days or paying attention to when the weather changes, but by regulation from the annual changes of lengths of day and night.  Plants cannot migrate, but they are regulated by day length, too; wheat flowers, for instance, when the days get long enough, and barley does so when the days start to shorten.  The almost universal attention that species pay to daily or annual changes indicates that success comes from being able to predict when winter, or summer, or nightfall, or other events, are coming, and from timing leaf drop, coitus, or swimming upstream to meet the optimum times and conditions.  Evolution has selected the species that are best able to predict the future.<br /><br />In the famous experiments where humans lived in caves or other light-deprived environments, with no capacity to tell time, they eventually locked into their own cycles of a little more than 24 hours.  Like most creatures, we have an internal daily rhythm which is not exact, but only approximate; the day night cycle (or for us, such cues as an alarm clock) \\"entrain\\" the internal cycle and keep it synchronous with the rest of the creatures on Earth.  There are mutant rats and flies who have cycles that are too long or too short, and researchers have productively transplanted brain parts to find out where the actual clocks are.  Chronobiologists (a term that even some chronobiologists think of as pompous) are not just doing ivory tower investigations.  There are many practical implications of this sort of work.  Breast cancers, for example, have an annual pattern of increased and decreased growths, and so searching for the cancer would be more productive at certain times of the year.  Chemotherapy for cancers involves poisoning the cancer cells with drugs that are also poisons for regular cells, but cancer cells, with their out-of-control growth, lose their rhythm of growth and division that normal cells retain.  Thus it is possible that administering anti-cancer drugs at the time of day when they will interfere the least with the normal cells could reduce the worrisome side effects of the drugs.  Asthma is most prevalent at night; medicine for it would be best taken in higher doses at nighttime, rather than every eight hours.  The timing of doses in some cases may be as important as what the doses contain.  The authors have given a detailed but readable introduction into a new science that will have increasing importance for human health as more is learned.at administering anti-cancer drugs at the time of day when they will interfere the least with the normal cells could reduce the worrisome side effects of the drugs.

Probability theory helps us do this; it is \\"humanity's attempt to use pure mathematics to understand the un-understandable.\\"  So writes Amir D. Aczel in _Chance: A Guide to Gambling, Love, the Stock Market, & Just About Everything Else_ (Thunder's Mouth Press).  It is a book of mathematics, but it is not intimidating.  It is accessible and small, readable in an evening (but readers may spend much more time working on the sample problems), and may present few surprises to those familiar with the subject.  The presentation, however, is brisk and clear, and serves very well as a primer to this branch of mathematics.<br /><br />The pretty red and white cover of the book simulates the back of a playing card, and games of chance are a big part of the subject.  Not only do the games themselves get examined, but dice and cards give good examples of how probability may be calculated.  But more complex life examples are given.  As the title insists, probability theory can help you find love (or, for that matter, a good apartment or a companionable puppy).  Let's say you are entering a computer dating service, and you expect as many as a hundred relationships, each of which you will experience and then keep that mate or move on.  If you just stop at the first prospect, there is a one in a hundred chance that it is the best match for you; similarly, if you get through all 99, the hundredth prospect has a one in a hundred chance of being the best match for you.  Neither of those odds is very good.  The mathematically best strategy is to date the first 37 matches, and settle on none of them.  This enables you to learn about what you are doing and how well the population measures up to what you want.  And then, starting with the 38th one, take the candidate that is better than any so far.  There's a chance you won't find any such candidate, because the best match was in the first 37 you sampled; but as firm as the mathematics is, nothing in love is certain.  As Aczel jokes, \\"Now, don't you wish your mother would give you advice like that?\\"<br /><br />There is gambling advice.  If you wish to avoid losing money at the casinos, don't gamble.  Don't make the mistake that if the die just rolled a two, it is less likely to roll a two next time; dice, or roulette wheels, or all the rest, have no memory.  If you have to gamble, and you have a big wad of money to blow, play it all on one big play; if you apportion the money in a series of bets, the money will only be chipped away by the odds that always favor the house.  You can get advice on shuffling; a deck riffle shuffled five times still has pockets of order, but seven times will produce randomness.  But mostly, this smart little book shows how probability makes a difference in our lives and in the way we think about things.  Here you will find the answer to the problem about whether those monkeys on typewriters would ever really produce _Hamlet_, why it always seems as if you get to the bus stop just after the bus has already gone rather than just before it comes, why good things seem to come in threes, and why you should expect in a room of 23 people that two of them ought to have the same birthday.  It's an entertaining brief overview of a classic subject.and how well the population measures up to what you want.

Don't make the mistake that if the die just rolled a two, it is less likely to roll a two next time; dice, or roulette wheels, or all the rest, have no memory.  If you have to gamble, and you have a big wad of money to blow, play it all on one big play; if you apportion the money in a series of bets, the money will only be chipped away by the odds that always favor the house.  You can get advice on shuffling; a deck riffle shuffled five times still has pockets of order, but seven times will produce randomness.  But mostly, this smart little book shows how probability makes a difference in our lives and in the way we think about things.  Here you will find the answer to the problem about whether those monkeys on typewriters would ever really produce _Hamlet_, why it always seems as if you get to the bus stop just after the bus has already gone rather than just before it comes, why good things seem to come in threes, and why you should expect in a room of 23 people that two of them ought to have the same birthday.  It's an entertaining brief overview of a classic subject.  <br />	2005-01-06

Washington may have intended to remain so.  In _His Excellency: George Washington_ (Knopf), Ellis has continued a string of fine biographies of characters from the American Revolution, and has made the man somewhat less puzzling.  Washington is a hard subject, not only because he has been elevated to the status of national god with all the mythology attending such status, but also because he took pains not to reveal himself.  His diary entries, even on the days we now consider the most vital in our history, might have contained only comments on the weather or where he dined.  In social situations, he had \\"a natural dignity (or was it aloofness?)\\" that kept others away, and he was comfortable keeping silent while others squirmed for something to say.  His correspondence during his presidential years was mostly about the management of his farms at Mount Vernon.  He destroyed much of his personal correspondence, and his wife burned all but three of his letters to her.  But Ellis demonstrates that \\"Washington's legendary calmness and statuelike stolidity masked truly volcanic energies and emotions.\\"  There have been plenty of other biographies of this astonishing man, but Ellis's has not just given the basic details of the life, but also tried to explain the inner life, despite the subject's reticence.<br /><br />Ellis's Washington is not the idealized Father of Our Country, full only of honesty, dignity, and virtue.  He is, instead, aggressive, ambitious, eager for monetary gain, and constantly looking to his portrait for posterity.  In the French and Indian war, his successes were minor, but his reputation was secure.  He became, in many ways, a typical aristocratic farmer, spending lavishly on the costumes and architecture favored by English society, and was in debt to British merchants for them.  He loathed this dependency, and Ellis shows that the Washington who wanted to be free of it was the Washington motivated to fight for economic, not just political, freedom.  There was plenty of sincere rhetoric about liberty, but financial liberty was always on Washington's mind.  When he fought in the Revolution, he lost more battles than he won and \\"was not by any standard a military genius.\\"  He learned from his mistakes, and emerged as easily the most famous man in America at the end of the war.  He made a public exit from the national stage that astonished the world; he wanted no coronation, he wanted no office, he merely wanted to return to his farm.  It was the sort of self control that no Caesar or Napoleon could have shown, but Ellis concludes that Washington was always thinking about his place in history (he did not have traditional religious view, and never seems to have been concerned about his place in heaven).  Similarly, he was not eager to assume the presidency, even though unanimously voted in (which \\"scarcely leaves me the alternative for an option\\") but there was no avoiding the role if posterity was to hold him in good opinion.<br /><br />True to traditions started only in the last century, Ellis takes seriously Washington's connection to slavery.  He had many slaves himself, and the main worry they presented him was that the system was inefficient; not only were there workers on his farm, but he was saddled with the upkeep of their families (which he would not split up), many of whom could not work because of youth, age, or illness.  He was interested, as a businessman, not as a liberator, in hired, free labor.  He was progressive in some ways; he freed some slaves at the end of his life, and he allowed slaves to be soldiers in the army.  But he was a man of his time, and committed to keeping the young union strong; he refused to commit the nation to abolition, and was glad when it was taken off the national agenda during his time.  \\"What strikes us as a poignant failure of moral leadership appearedto Washington as a prudent exercise in political judgment.\\"  More satisfactory to us, he did arrange for the freeing of his slaves (albeit posthumously), and was the only prominent Virginian to do so at the time.  Ellis's finely nuanced biography gives a full picture of a vital American presence; this is not the Washington of the heroic statues and portraits, but a remarkable, flawed man who really was human, accessible, and admirable.eared to Washington as a prudent exercise in political judgment.\\"  More satisfactory to us, he did arrange for the freeing of his slaves (albeit posthumously), and was the only prominent Virginian to do so at the time.

When there is a large scientific meeting now, no one is surprised that women should be in attendance, although it can be argued that women's participation in science is still limited or lacking in recognition.  The archetypal woman scientist is the one who broke all the rules of her time, Marie Curie, but even so, she didn't win all her battles.  When she and her husband Pierre jointly won the Nobel Prize in 1903, she was forced to sit among the audience while Pierre gave the lecture of acceptance.  There were many such episodes in her life, and that she didn't furiously withdraw from her busy research due to such rebuffs is remarkable.  There is certainly a feminist message in her story, and in _Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie_ (Atlas Books / Norton), Barbara Goldsmith has allowed the life to deliver the message, realizing that editorializing on the matter is unneeded.  Not only did Marie overcome social obstacles, she overcame her own cycles of profound depression that troubled her throughout her life, to become an enormously productive scientist.  Goldsmith's book is a welcome recall of an inspiring story.<br /><br />Marya Salomee Sklodowska was born in 1867 in Russian-occupied Poland.  Marie was an extremely bright student, and eventually was one of two women getting science degrees at the Sorbonne in Paris (Warsaw schools did not admit women).  She had vowed never to let passion triumph over her research, but the two combined when she met Pierre Curie.  He had also shared her attitude against falling in love, feeling that women \\"draw us away from dedication.\\"  The marriage was a strong one, but the scientific collaboration was nearly perfect.  Within his lab, she took his suggestion to investigate the rays given off by uranium and other elements which had been discovered to produce images on photographic plates.  These were something like the x-rays that had made a sensation, but the images were far less clear and dramatic.  Scientists were fascinated with x-rays, but most thought that these other vague rays were not worth pursuing.  Marie had a huge workload, having to fiddle with sensitive equipment like electrometers that would only yield useful results if handled with exhausting precision, and at the other end of the scale, having literally tons of pitchblende which she painstakingly fractionalized down to a few grains of radium.  Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906; he was limping and unsteady at the time from bone deterioration, so the radium may have directly caused his death.  Goldsmith lists one famous scientist after another who during the decades doubted Marie's results because of her sex.  All her life, even when she became famous throughout the world, she would be denied recognition or appointments simply because she was not a man.<br /><br />Marie went on to further discoveries, and also to practical inventions.  During the First World War, she was inspired to invent mobile x-ray units, cars equipped with x-ray equipment that could be dispatched to battle-front hospitals, especially for the urgent job of locating bullets and shrapnel for the surgeons to remove.  The units, called \\"Les Petites Curie,\\" only took off as invaluable tools once Marie persuaded bureaucrats that women could serve as drivers and technicians.  She continued to work at the Curie Institute, which profited by the ill-advised fashion of adding radium to lipstick and drinking water, and also got funding from those contributing to it thinking that radium was being investigated as a cure for cancer.  She was covered in skin lesions, especially on her hands, when she died in 1934.  Goldsmith's brisk, sympathetic portrait of a driven woman benefits from having excellent descriptions of the historic thoughts about x-rays, radiation, and atoms.  Marie's obsession eventually killed her, but for her, the work was more important than the life.  She wrote, \\"I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done.\\"he work was more important than the life.  She wrote, \\"I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done.\\"  <br />	2004-12-30

Billy Mitchell and the Court-Martial That Gripped the Nation	Books	5	15	15	N	N	The Great Air Power Innovator	The Air Force is the brashest arm of the armed forces.  It is far newer than the Army or Navy, and more reliant on the latest in technology.  There is an image of the flyboy as handsome, heroic, and rule-bending if not rule-breaking.  The archetype of such an image is General Billy Mitchell, whose most famous act was getting a court-martial in 1925 for speaking up about how he felt air power ought to be developed.  His is a story that has been told before, even (badly) in the movies, but in _A Question of Loyalty: Gen. Billy Mitchell and the Court-Martial that Gripped the Nation_ (HarperCollins), Douglas Waller has retold the story with a wealth of new information and the help of the Mitchell family.  Mitchell's story was a sensation during his trial, and as part of the universal drama of the iconoclastic genius against the system, presents issues for current times, besides being a lesson in how big organizations change or resist change.<br /><br />The trial was the climactic event in Mitchell's life, and Waller has told it in lengthy detail, interspersing facts of Mitchell's earlier life and career within it.  Mitchell didn't think his trial was the most important event in his life; he would have listed his role in WWI and his successful demonstration in 1921 that aircraft could sink a ship.  Mitchell loved being a populist, skillfully using the media to enlist the support of the public for his causes.  In September 1925, the Navy's dirigible _Shenandoah_ crashed in a thunderstorm, killing fourteen of its crew.  Mitchell wrote a 6,000 word statement and issued it at a press conference, listing the _Shenandoah_'s demise specifically and other general ailments that he said \\"... are the direct result of the incompetency, criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense by the Navy and War Departments.\\"  Mitchell was ordered to stand court-martial in Washington on catch-all charges that he had violated Army order and discipline and brought discredit to the military.  The trial proved to be a sensation, studied daily and argued over by people who would have otherwise had no interest in air defense.  The outcome is unsurprising; even if Mitchell had had ever fact correct in detail, he still would have been insubordinate.  Hap Arnold, who admired him and commanded the Army Air Forces during World War II, said simply, \\"In accordance with the army code, Billy had it coming.\\"<br /><br />He died in 1936, so he did not live to see his vindication in World War II.  Mitchell had predicted, for instance, that the Japanese would bomb Pearl Harbor from the air.  Like any prophet, he didn't get all the details right, but his predictions about blitzkrieg, strategic bombing of cities, and others proved his thinking on the issues to be far more firmly grounded than his accusers.  He has been vindicated in many ways.  Of course the Air Force eventually became an independent part of the military as he had wanted.  The \\"Mitchellites\\", those who had been his disciples, put his theories into practice during the war he knew was coming.  Congress posthumously awarded him a special medal.  The Air Force Academy's dining hall is named for him, and its class of 2001 selected him as the man they most wanted to emulate.  It is a curious choice for our times.  Waller clearly shows in this full biography that Mitchell was a brilliant and innovative leader and a daring commander in combat, as well as being a visionary on the future of air power, but he was during his lifetime mostly a pain in the neck for those he worked with.  In the current atmosphere where questioning governmental decisions quickly leads to charges of supporting liberals or terrorists, any Billy Mitchell that is rising in the ranks could expect no better treatment from the military.brought discredit to the military.

412403:US	50895620	R3IPXRPO1L6G2T	1578066298	104172978	Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau	Books	5	32	36	N	N	Voodoo Fact and Voodoo Legend	One of the famous above-ground cemeteries of New Orleans is known as St. Louis No. 1, the oldest graveyard in the city.  A tall marble and stucco tomb there is a site where devotees frequently leave gifts - flowers, candy, salt, coins, beads, bourbon - for Marie Laveau, the famous voodoo priestess.  She still attracts attention, and some people still talk to her.  One of these is Martha Ward, an anthropologist at the University of New Orleans, who has written _Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau_ (University Press of Mississippi).  It is a book from a strange sort of participatory journalism; the author says she has \\"relied on dreams, intuition, a hyperactive imagination, and funky Voodoo luck.\\"  She admits to standing in front of the tomb and hearing Marie laugh when asked \\"What really happened?\\"  Marie's answer: \\"Who knows the whole story, and maybe it's better that way.\\"  There is such a gumbo of legend and fact here, along with earnest attempts to clear up history and legal agreements that were deliberately made murky in the first place, that calling upon voodoo as a reference source isn't as dicey as it might seem.  Ward is a competent guide through confusing social customs of strange times in a strange locale, and she interprets the gaps as carefully as possible.  \\"There's hardly any peg in this whole narrative that's literal, truthful or absolute,\\" she warns, but there is plenty of good storytelling and historical recreations of New Orleans nonetheless.<br /><br />Marie Laveau was born in 1801 to an unmarried \\"free woman of color.\\" She grew up in religious training around the famous St. Louis Cathedral in the French Quarter.  Such Christian learning did not limit Marie to being Christian; one of the themes repeatedly emphasized here is that voodoo was not in opposition to any traditional Christian spirituality, but an addition to it.  There are plenty of examples, for instance, of official or folklore saints being incorporated into voodoo.  Marie formed a strong partnership with a controversial priest, Pere Antoine.  Ward says that Marie guaranteed to Antoine the support from her followers and a church full of them, and in return he would perform sacraments of baptism and marriage for interracial couples who otherwise could claim no legitimacy.  Ward concludes that after Pere Antoine's death, the church joined in with the proslavery religious orthodoxy of the times, and that her daughter (also Marie Laveau) made voodoo an alternative for those Pere Antoine could no longer welcome.  She took her herbal and voodoo arts to new spheres in her occupation as hairdresser to upper-class white women.  She also helped slaves escape.  She was famous for her dancing, luridly described by eager reporters, which might involve different states of nudity, on the part of all races, with the movements being called by Marie herself.  Marie would have such dances in her own back yard in her New Orleans house on Friday nights, followed by a voodoo benediction and blessing for everyone; when you left, said one attendee, \\"you surely had the belief.\\"  Marie would see individual clients during the week for the same sorts of problems now brought to counselors or advice columnists.<br /><br />Reconstruction collapsed in 1877, and tolerance for alternative beliefs took a downturn.  Police took up attacks on voodoo practitioners, and in 1897 the city passed regulations that prohibited \\"trance artists, 'voodoos,' and similar tricksters from operating in the city.\\"  Eventually, reading palms for payment, influencing evil or good luck, bringing together enemies, settling lovers' quarrels, and other familiarly voodoo services could lead to arrest.  Practitioners moved across the river to the Algiers neighborhood, and Spiritual Churches continued the practice in small groups.  The beliefs continue; Ward has visited contemporary ceremonies, and of course the flowers and candles keep coming to the Laveau tomb.  (No one knows when the daughterMarie died, or where her remains are.)  It has sometimes made Ward's research difficult.  A librarian at the New Orleans Public Library sighed, \\"If it has Marie Laveau's name on it, it just disappears.\\"  Ward has also dug into baptismal and marriage records, land deeds, and notary files to try to sort reality from legend.  Especially illuminating are oral histories given by ex-slaves to the WPA during the depression.  Ward's book gives a new aspect to women's history within New Orleans, as well as showing the history of the city's vivid Creole culture.  It is a quirky history, with more than its share of supposition about its two main characters, but anyone who expected \\"just the facts\\" about the voodoo queens hasn't even started to understand how voodoo works.aughter Marie died, or where her remains are.)

They were slender and fast, low in the water but with two extremely tall, swept-back masts.  The city fathers of Baltimore in the 1970s figured the city needed something to be proud of.  It had lost its football team, crime was up, and the docks were in decay.  To boost civic pride, a replica Baltimore clipper was proposed, and eagerly funded, built, staffed and sailed.  _The Pride of Baltimore_ was a gorgeous ship, looking smart in any display of the beloved Tall Ships.  In fact, it was first proposed to be a dockside museum, but it eventually became a seagoing craft, spreading the good name of Baltimore (and business interest in it) to Europe.  The plan to resurrect the Baltimore clipper was a resounding success.  Unfortunately, lots of the clippers had sunk two centuries ago, largely due to their top-heaviness, and _The Pride_ did so, too, in 1986, in an unexpected storm as she was returning to Baltimore from the Virgin Islands.  Four of the crew of twelve perished.  In _Pride of the Sea: Courage, Disaster, and a Fight for Survival_ (Citadel Press) Tom Waldron has given the story of the ship and the disaster, a story which ought to please true-life adventure fans.  He also comes to some sensible conclusions about how the accident happened, beyond the simple explanation \\"freak storm.\\"<br /><br />When the proposal for a new Baltimore clipper was made, one of the first naval architects to consider the job wrote, \\"... an exact replica of an old sailing vessel is unlikely to meet Coast Guard requirements.\\"  Indeed, the civic boosters and the architect who got the job made a conscious decision not to have _The Pride_ certified by the Coast Guard.  It was risky to sail on her, but it was authentic, and it appealed to those who loved ships with sails.  There was a crew of both old salts and rookies, none of whom were over thirty.  Six of them were newcomers to the boat.  A violent, unexpected squall of sixty knots simply pushed over _The Pride_; there had been a risky maneuver to bring the ship under better control, but the risk had not paid off.  The ship rapidly took on water, and with no compartmentalization, sank quickly.  The rafts failed to work properly; only one could be inflated, so that the eight survivors had to make do on a raft that would have been crowded with its recommended crew of six.  Waldron expertly describes the chaos of the sinking and the hellish five days on the raft afterwards.  Time after time, ships passing near enough to see them did not see them, until a Norwegian supertanker picked them up.  The only lightness in the raft comes from a couple who had fallen in love on the boat.  The young woman said matter-of-factly, \\"I don't want to go through life without being proposed to.\\"  Her boyfriend, taken aback, issued one of the strangest proposals ever: \\"Sure, Leslie, if we survive, we'll get married.\\"  And so they did, after funerals and investigations and recriminations, all recounted here.<br /><br />_The Pride_ and its four lost crewmen were sacrificed to nostalgia, a dream of the romantic days of sail without recalling the nightmares the sea can bring.  Nothing symbolizes this as much as the hand-held radio beacons that would have sent signals to satellites when the ship was in danger.  Both beacon devices were available to anyone who could grab one, but they were inaccessible, mounted on the inside of the doomed vessel.  The reason?  They were too modern to be kept out on deck and detracted from the vessel's historic aspect.  Waldron's terrific account of the loss of _The Pride_ recounts many such lapses.  _Pride of Baltimore II_ has been built, and to modern standards this time.  But as a survivor reminds us, the most modern of boats are going down, too: \\"When you go out to sea, it's a big place out there and the sea has all the power.\\"A violent, unexpected squall of sixty knots simply pushed over _The Pride_; there had been a risky maneuver to bring the ship under better control, but the risk had not paid off.

418967:US	50895620	RIBW1XIRD1YGH	0743222326	591361893	How Dogs Think: Understanding the Canine Mind	Books	5	37	39	N	N	Thinking About Dogs Thinking Like Dogs Think	In titling his book _How Dogs Think: Understanding the Canine Mind_ (The Free Press), Stanley Coren has already answered the big question.  Dogs do think, or at least Coren thinks they think, and so do most of us who love and keep dogs.  They don't think like humans all the time, but Coren, a professor of psychology, shows that they can often be tested like humans are tested (especially the young humans), and they are certainly doing some sort of thinking.  They are not, any more than we are, automata made of biochemicals.  In coming down on this point, Coren is entering a longstanding philosophical dispute, with the first shot fired by the seventeenth-century French philosopher Ren&eacute; Descartes.  While Plato had thought of the dog as a \\"lover of learning,\\" Descartes refused to grant that dogs had any sort of intelligence.  His refusal was an outgrowth of the strict religious doctrines of the time; anything that had consciousness had to have a soul, and those with souls could get to heaven, and Descartes and the Catholic Church found it unacceptable that dogs might get to heaven.  (In the possibly unlikely event that I will wind up in that vicinity someday, and find no dogs, you can count on me to start an intense letter-writing campaign to have the management change its position on the issue.)  To Descartes, dogs were no more thinkers than the clockwork dolls that were in fashion at the time; dogs were but clockwork, too, but their works were flesh and bone.  And they could be taken apart like clocks; distressingly, Descartes and many others did experiments on helpless and unanaesthetized dogs, and didn't have to worry that the poor creatures actually felt anything more than a clock did.<br /><br />That was the view for two centuries, and though it might be a minority view now, it is still held by some philosophers.  Dog lovers will never accept such reasoning, of course, and Coren tells about experiments that help clear up the issue in a practical sphere.  It has been shown that dogs who have to have surgery recover from the surgery better if they have pain management afterwards; they start eating and drinking sooner than those whose vets have skimped on the postoperative analgesics.  Coren's book gives lots of experimental data, starting with the basics of senses, showing that dogs count less on vision and more on smell than we do, and exactly how well they can smell and see.  It is no surprise that dogs can hear more frequencies than we can, but puppies have a sensory input unlike any of our own.  Their noses have special infrared sensors, and they use them to find that reliable heat source, mother, during the time when they cannot see her.  As they grow up, their noses lose this capacity.<br /><br />There are many wonderful examples of testing being done on dogs that is similar to that being done on infants, tests that show comparable thinking to human two years olds.  Coren considers the stories about how dogs are supposed to have some sort of ESP ability, and finds the stories just that, without scientific replicablility.  In the final chapter, he gives the answer to the question of whether dogs really have conscious and rational minds, and though he has not in all the previous chapters answered it directly, his affirmation will come as no surprise.  Dogs can remember objects, and do primitive counting, and remember sequences.  They have an ability to empathize and to predict how other creatures will act.  Despite previous studies that have shown the contrary, they can watch what another dog (or human) does and learn from it.  They have a sense of fun.  They can deliberately trick others.  Coren obviously loves dogs, and loves his dogs, of whom he tells many anecdotes, but he has been careful to avoid \\"the scientific sin of anthropomorphism.\\"  When he tells you, say, that dogs have an ability to know what humans are thinking, it isn't just a besotted dog-lover talking, but one who can produce the research that demonstrates the truth of the proposition.  He has performed a real service for the humans who will read his book and come away with new reasons to appreciate their dogs, and in clearly showing how dogs can think, he has paid a lasting compliment to our canine friends.rates the truth of the proposition.

He had a spectacular career, with a very high arc to success; the early part of that career is not the subject of _Envy of the Gods: Alexander the Great's Ill-Fated Journey Across Asia_ (Da Capo Press) by John Prevas.  Prevas, an adventuresome classics professor, examines the years of Alexander's decline and fall.  You won't find here his taming of the steed Bucephalus at thirteen, his solving of the Gordian Knot, his first war at age sixteen, his assumption of the Macedonian throne at age twenty after the assassination of his father, nor his spectacular conquests of Asia Minor, Egypt, and Babylon.  Prevas has instead started his account from 330 BCE, when Alexander was twenty-six, pushing west into Asia and the Indian subcontinent, eventually retreating back to Babylon.  It was a seven year circuit, marked by furious conquests, betrayals, orgies, and drunkenness, during which Alexander became increasingly suspicious and erratic.  So, was he \\"Great\\"?  One can't help admiring his degree of ambition, and how far he took it in his thirty-three years, and how well he achieved his aim of immortality.  But with its concentration on Alexander's last seven years, Prevas's book can only inspire wonder that Alexander was able to last as long as he did.<br /><br />By the time Alexander had reached the capital of the Persians, Persepolis, now in Iran, he had extracted the vengeance against the Persians that was his assignment from the Greeks.  He might have said \\"Mission accomplished\\" and headed home a hero, but he had a consuming drive, a pathological compulsion, to push on to the limits of the Earth.  The war had changed from Greece's revenge against Persia to Alexander's personal war for his own glory and deification.  During the push west toward the Ganges, Alexander's ego found new ways of gratification.  He liked the quasi-divine status Persian royalty held over the people, and he started doing things as they did, assuming a loftiness and remove from his men.  He took hundreds of concubines and many eunuchs.  Drinking and feasting became his standard way of life, and there are accounts here of drunken brawls within the royal chamber, and a drunken Alexander who alienated those closest to him.  Promotions became based on sheer loyalty, loyalty that included acceptance of Alexander's divinity.  He insisted on the strictest compliance with his orders, and refused to accept resistance; his men's exercise of free speech was curtailed, a tradition of free speech that was widely valued by the Greeks.  Those who opposed him (or who he imagined opposed him) were subject to the sort of sadistic torture to death that the Greeks viewed as a particularly Persian atrocity.<br /><br />It is astonishing that Alexander could have pushed his soldiers so far.  He must have had spectacular rhetorical powers, and he never lost his physical courage, often unnecessarily putting himself at the advance of any fighting.  He pushed eastward as far as what is now India, but could not push his men to the sea he sought.  His troops finally were fed up with his personal wars, and natural forces like weather had sapped their interest in continuing.  A sulking Alexander called for sacrifices and reading of entrails as omens; when the entrails forecast doom for further advancement, Alexander could save face by following the gods' will, not his men's demands, to begin the return trip, which held more brutal combat and a vicious passage through the desert.  It may well be that he was deliberately inflicting injury on the army that had refused to continue on his eastward conquests.  He reached Babylon again, only to die shortly after by (the speculations are vigorously argued) typhoid, virus, or poison.  He was possibly the greatest conqueror in the world, but Prevas's spellbinding account shows little to admire.  Remember that Dante placed Alexander in the seventh circle of Hell.  This vivid picture of a brutal, drunken, and erratic dictator shows he deserved it, despite all his greatness in battle.gain, only to die shortly after by (the speculations are vigorously argued) typhoid, virus, or poison.

What was the first one?  A good case could be made for the name Wedgwood, the fine pottery that has come for over two hundred years from the factory founded by Josiah Wedgwood in the pottery towns of Staffordshire, England.  Not only has the name continued, but it has been from the beginning synonymous with fine taste.  Its finest wares were bought for their elegance by aristocrats, and then there were other pottery creations that lesser mortals could buy as their betters set the trends for taste.  Josiah Wedgwood knew all about the importance of a name, and about the need to catch the public taste and predict the next fashion.  In _Wedgwood: The First Tycoon_ (Viking), Brian Dolan has given us a compelling account of a commercial success story that has many resonances with modern business practices on the cutting edge of technology, while taking into account a wider view of the social aspects of commerce in the eighteenth century.<br /><br />It is in many ways a rags to riches tale.  Wedgwood's family had been Staffordshire potters for generations, but the potting works had been allowed to languish by Wedgwood's grandfather and father, who had no idea what innovation was.  He was determined to do things differently, and he had absorbed the idea that progress and profits could be made scientifically.  He was a Dissenter, a non-Anglican who favored rational inquiry rather than biblical interpretation as be the best manner of understanding the way the world works.  He loved experimenting all his life.  \\"Labor I will not call it,\\" he said of his time-consuming and exacting experiments.  He instead called it \\"entertainment,\\" and he entertained himself into some of the most technically advanced potting techniques of the time.  His innovations allowed calculated business gambles, which generally paid off.  He was astute in predicting or making tastes; when Pompeian styles became vogue, Wedgwood was at the fore with the invention of \\"colored jasper\\", his medium for reproducing ancient pots.<br /><br />Wedgwood was dedicated to self improvement and to improvement of his society, and knew that business was a means to accomplish both.  In pursuit of better business, he caused better roads and then a canal to be built as part of his social schemes.  He provided training, housing, education, health care, and even retirement plans for those who worked for him.  He was a tough boss, fuming against \\"dilatory, drunken, Idle, worthless workmen.\\"  When he strolled through the workshop, he might spy an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards.  He would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, \\"This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood.\\"  He was troubled by others stealing his ideas; there are tales here of commercial chicanery and theft that are the same as newspapers might report today.  He valued fair competition; of another manufacturer, Matthew Boulton, he wrote, \\"He will not be a mere sniveling Copyist like the antagonists I have hitherto had,\\" but rather a spur to better wares.  Wedgwood had enormous confidence; having become Potter to Her Majesty, he wrote that he wanted to become \\"Vase maker General to the Universe.\\"  He largely succeeded, harnessing the technological, social, and commercial forces of his time.  Dolan's admiring but full portrait shows that many of Wedgwood's values of style, research, innovation, and marketing were new with him but have continued to our own age.e vogue, Wedgwood was at the fore with the invention of \\"colored jasper\\", his medium for reproducing ancient pots.   <br /> <br />Wedgwood was dedicated to self improvement and to improvement of his society, and knew that business was a means to accomplish both.

431537:US	50895620	R1GH7RU01QA4DS	0618005838	521873182	The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution	Books	5	32	35	N	N	A Backward, Exciting View of Evolution	A few years ago, Martin Amis wrote _Time's Arrow_, a novel in which much of the action went backward, from present to past.  In the 2000 movie _Memento_, the climactic scene was at the beginning, and subsequent ones went further and further into the past to explain what had happened.  Now Richard Dawkins has written a fine, big book of backwards natural history, _The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution_ (Houghton Mifflin).  In it, he starts with humans.  He makes clear in these pages that all the living things now on the planet are just as \\"advanced\\" as we are, and by starting with humans he is not making the mistake of insisting that evolution has produced humans as the aim and the culmination of any sort of directed effort.  He is taking an \\"arbitrary, but forgivably preferred, starting point.\\"  Then in a grand narrative, he goes back three billion years as a pilgrimage.  Indeed, he has taken Chaucer as a model, starting with today and going back to a primordial Canterbury.  Along the backwards path, we pilgrims are joined by the branches that are also marching back in time.  First, the chimps and bonobos join us six million years ago, then the gorillas, then orangutans.  In 39 steps, we meet all the living things that took different paths from us, but who in a backwards flow join us again, rodents, shrews, birds, amphibians, fish, insects, worms, corals, fungi, plants, all the way back to bacteria and to the very start of molecular replication that created our living world.  For all Dawkins's scientific astuteness, this is a pleasing romantic conceit, telling a lesson of unity in living things that can only increase our admiration for how far we and all of our fellow creatures have come.  Nonetheless, there is, within the book's 600 pages and 39 reunions, plenty of scientific pedagogy, delivered with the clarity for which Dawkins is famed.<br /><br />At each of the 39 steps, we meet the \\"concestors\\" who are joining us; this is Dawkins's coinage for \\"common ancestors\\", and we get to hear their stories.  This is as in Chaucer, except here we have \\"The Lungfish's Tale,\\" \\"The Sponge's Tale,\\" and so on.  Dawkins has, thankfully, declined to write these in a fictive first person, but instead has used the tales to impress us with nature's versatility, to illustrate points made by Darwin himself, or to explain genetic drift, the importance of sex, or the role plate tectonics played in evolution.  There is an astonishing mass of information in these tales, from how anteaters no longer make stomach acid (they use the formic acid within the ants themselves) to how the \\"hox\\" genes that instruct a human body to make an eye, for instance, are the same genes that instruct a fly body to do so.  The eyes are vastly different, but the genetic instruction \\"place eye here\\" could be swapped from one species to another.<br /><br />This book is beautifully laid out, although for most of the animals there are only line drawings, with a few black and white photographs.  The graphic at the beginning of each of the 39 steps shows how far we have come in the pilgrimage, its timing, and who is joining at that particular rendezvous.  In a way, it is a shame that Dawkins has to deal with being probably the most famous and productive atheist on the planet.  Once _The Ancestor's Tale_ was released, reviews praising it on Amazon immediately started accumulating \\"unhelpful\\" votes, a response that is relatively muted whenever other biologists produce books about science, not faith.  Religious fundamentalists consistently misrepresent his views; more than once he chidingly addresses creationists, asking them to refrain from taking what he has just written out of context.  There are a few pages devoted to debunking \\"intelligent design\\", and in a fascinating aside, Dawkins explains that the \\"gaps\\" in the fossil record seized upon by creationists not only are insubstantial, there are no gaps in the genetic sequences of species, the sorts of descent that the pilgrims traverse here.  We could now study evolution without fossils at all.  It is too bad that literalists cannot agree with the many believers who see no real contradiction between evolution and the Bible, but this is not a book of polemics.  It is just a unique way to explain how wonderfully well science has come to understand how evolution works.  Part of that lesson is that we don't nearly understand everything.  In yet another frequent theme, this time remarking on (of all things) why jellyfish on a lake in the Palau Islands go from one side to the other during the day, he says there isn't a good explanation.  This is not an admission of defeat, but of delight; the lesson of the tale, Dawkins says, \\"...must be that the living world offers much that we don't _yet_ understand, and that is exciting in itself.\\"pilgrims traverse here.

Attila won't say what his immediate plans are; he says he'd \\"be insincere\\" if he made remarks about planning to escape, but he is working on getting an education, and he loves reading.  He has a huge encyclopedia of Hungarian history that even mentions him as a national folk hero.  This is despite his alcoholism, addiction to gambling, womanizing, and career as the worst goalie ever in professional Hungarian hockey.  The bizarre story is rollickingly told in _Ballad of the Whiskey Robber: A True Story of Bank Heists, Ice Hockey, Transylvanian Pelt Smuggling, Moonlighting Detectives, and Broken Hearts_ (Little, Brown) by Julian Rubinstein.  This hugely entertaining story would fail if it were fiction; Rubinstein has done lots of research, including hours of jailhouse interviews with the hero, and it is all true, but still incredible.<br /><br />Attila escaped from Romania to Hungary in 1988, clinging to the bottom of a train.  He wound up in Budapest penniless and friendless, and he had a funny accent.  With unswerving determination, he caught on to a championship Budapest hockey club.  Once he did get a chance to show his stuff on the ice, \\"... it didn't take long for the team to recognize the new kid's level of talent.  Zero....\\"  He didn't get paid, but he doubled as the team's janitor.  He also drove the Zamboni, until while driving drunk one night, he drove it into the stands.  Desperate for some better life, and for a better place to live than the stable he had found, he got drunk, put on a wig and some mascara, and knocked off a post office.  It was easy.  He went on to accomplish almost thirty drunken robberies over six years, always unfailingly polite to the tellers, even bringing them roses.  Capture, of course, was sooner or later inevitable, as long as Attila kept playing the robbery game, and he was eventually arrested in 1999 and put into the escape-proof downtown jail.  He became a television start; in interviews, he was poised, amused, and amusing, and Whiskey Robber television specials, biographies, and t-shirts all sold well.  (Some of the t-shirts toted up his score of banks: \\"Whiskey Robber 28, Corrupt Cops 1\\".)  His case became, as Rubinstein writes, a referendum on the government.<br /><br />It only became more so when Attila broke from prison (by means of an escape rope made of shredded sheets and shoe laces) and started robbing again, increasing the power of his legend.  People refused to turn him in.  Even _Sports Illustrated_ got into the act, erroneously celebrating him as \\"one of the best goalies in his country's top pro league.\\"  Of course he got caught again, and has stayed in prison so far.  Robbing banks is surely wrong, as is boozing at Attila's level, as is losing all gains to roulette, and Rubinstein never makes the mistake of idealizing the hero of his book, no matter what degree the Hungarians have.  He is a troubled and unhappy man, and a talented and ingratiating one, who was puzzled and delighted by his own fame as he made headlines in the crime pages as well as the sports pages.  Attila ought to be overjoyed by this hilarious, larger-than-life book portrait, but Rubinstein has also drawn a picture of a society that was battered by communism only to be let down by the capitalist bosses who took over.

Sequencing the human genome would be the foundation that would explain everything that cells do to work together and produce a human.  It hasn't come close to doing this, of course.  There is too much going on within even that simplest first fertilized egg cell for us to understand.  Certainly, there has been much learned, including some humbling lessons; our DNA shows we are still very close in many ways to the mice that share our mammalian evolutionary heritage, and we are even close to fish and other vertebrates.  But scientists didn't start asking questions about the issues in genomics only when genes or DNA were discovered.  In _Jacob's Ladder: The History of the Human Genome_ (Norton), Henry Gee has looked at the ways people tried to understand what genes do even before they knew there were any such things.  His book is valuable in showing that many of the questions that are still being asked today were being asked by the first men to record their thoughts about how reproduction was accomplished.<br /><br />Aristotle knew about eggs, bird eggs, and he knew about menstruation.  He formed the idea that when menstruation stopped, the unshed blood stayed in the woman and when it met with semen from the male, it was sparked into life.  This dogma was first challenged in 1651 by William Harvey, who is more famous for having charted the activity of the circulatory system.  He had the insight that life came from an egg, even in mammals.  Of course he had no understanding of cells, or eggs and sperm being cells.  He thought the egg was formless matter that somehow gave forth form.  When microscopists eventually saw sperm, they thought that  they were mere parasites, like so many worms that writhe within tissue.  Some suspected they also played a role in fertilization, but as late as 1835 they were classed as a distinct order of worms.  The nature-philosophers, with Goethe the most prominent exponent, regarded the problem of generation as intractable.  It wasn't just that the technology of the time could not make it plain; rather, there was a mystical natural force that impressed form on the formless egg.  The force shaped the organic being and pushed for ever-greater perfection.  Darwin, who was always frank about any weakness in his ideas of \\"descent with modification,\\" knew that a blending of father's and mother's characteristics to produce children would eventually produce only blandness, and not the variability that his theory required.  He had to guess that there was some sort of particulate inheritance, but he was guessing, and there was no evidence for him to base such a guess on.  It was a flaw in evolutionary theory, a flaw eventually made good by genetics, but objections were less often made against this flaw than against the challenge evolution posed to social and religious ideas.<br /><br />The nature-philosophers stressed unity and complexity, and while Gee cannot accept their mysticism, his explanation in the second part of the book of what genes actually do owes much to their basic ideas.  Despite the push to find the gene for schizophrenia or the gene for obesity, genes almost never act on their own, but in networks.  There are tangles of genes responding to gene products in many interlocking biochemical pathways.  The study of such pathways is \\"systems biology,\\" with a mutation in one gene affecting a great many pathways.  Computer analysis of such systems shows that they are very stable, producing a viable output when the many input variables are widely changed.  It is this flexibility that in itself produces the variety that is the powerhouse for evolutionary change, as well as allowing minor changes without letting them completely derail embryonic development.  Gee is an editor for the weekly journal _Nature_, and as such has watched the dizzying increase in the speed of biological research in the past decade.  It is probably the most important science of our times, with prospects for the conquest of disease as well as the scary possibilities of our someday directing our own development.  Gee's account is a useful look at the history of an important part of biological research, as well as a primer on systems biology, which holds promise of much explicatory power in the future.g increase in the speed of biological research in the past decade.

One hundred and forty people were on board, and most of them survived the wreck.  \\"What they had feared was shipwreck and death.  Shipwreck and survival was not a possibility that anyone had much considered.\\"  So writes Stephen Taylor in _Caliban's Shore: The Wreck of the Grosvenor and the Strange Fate of Her Survivors_ (Norton).  Unique among shipwrecks, this one had survivors from a broad spectrum of British society, cast upon a shore about which all were ignorant.  Taylor's gripping story is fragmented; there are large gaps which no one will be able to fill.  Readers will find intelligent speculation to get them through these gaps; Taylor's research includes digging into the old records of the British Museum and academic resources within South Africa (where he grew up), as well as traversing the lands where the survivors trekked after being cast ashore.  It is a gripping story full of period details and human suffering, ingenuity, and greed.<br /><br />The _Grosvenor_ was about to make its usual run to England for the British East India Company, and was hastily joined by William Hosea, a colonial aristocrat with his family.  He was also traveling with a bag of diamonds that would have easily been turned into cash when he got back home.  There were around seventeen other folk of his class making the trip, which would have taken several months; they would have insisted on plenty of food, even if the quality could not be sustained, and there was 2,700 gallons of wine aboard.  For his costly passage, Hosea had directly paid the captain of the vessel, John Coxon who was better at commerce than seamanship.  During the night of 4 August, some of the sailors were alarmed by what seemed to be lights on shore, but Coxon insisted that land was 300 miles to the East.  When the ship foundered, 126 survivors came on land.  Coxon was not the man to provide leadership, and the survivors split up, with groups forming and reforming, and generally leaving the weakest and wounded behind.  They had to face impassable rivers, precipitous cliffs, starvation, and disease.  It was a grueling, distressing story for almost all.  106 perished.  The public was greatly interested in the wreck and its outcome, and took an especially prurient interest in the seven women who were lost; they were, in a phrase of the time, \\"doomed to worse than death among the natives.\\"<br /><br />The wreck has had surprising repercussions in the last century.  In 1925, a drifter named Bock found a bright stone 150 miles south of where the wreck had occurred; it was a diamond, and he eventually accumulated over a thousand of them.  He sold mining concessions, but no one else found anything.  He was accused of \\"salting\\" the diamonds, fraudulently planting them to mislead others, and found guilty.  The diamonds, however, are not the type from African mines, but are just the type Hosea would have been carrying.  Bock's descendants are trying to clear his name, and gain recompense for loss of the treasure, which has disappeared.  The _Grosvenor_ was well laden with goods, but because of its notoriety, folklore made it into a treasure ship.  Over many years, different investment schemes, like the _Grosvenor_ Bullion Syndicate, have proposed diving for the treasure, and some have actually brought in the hardware to do so.  Only failure and ruin came of such efforts, marked, as Taylor says, by breathtaking audacity and an astonishing willingness to be gulled.

Williams, and she ought to know.  After all, she is in the opinion of puzzle-master Will Shortz \\"the world's foremost expert on jigsaw puzzles.\\"  She has built an academic career on jigsaws, and has one of the world's largest collections (around 8,000), and so can be counted to look at them as something more than ridiculous exercises.  In _The Jigsaw Puzzle: Piecing Together a History_ (Berkley Books), she has assembled (ahem - the puns about puzzles, frequent in this work, are surprisingly numerous) an appealing collection of what must have been a pastime in almost everyone's life.  The appeal of the subject is therefore universal, and its aspects are here told with humor and genuine delight.  Though all of us have worked on jigsaws, much of the book has to do with those who work on manufacturing the puzzles and those obsessed with putting the puzzles together, or collecting them.<br /><br />American children almost all have put together maps of the United States, with each state being a separate piece (well, the little ones in the northeast often blended).  In doing so, they participate in the earliest form of the jigsaw.  The \\"dissected map\\" was the original jigsaw, and mapmakers were the original jigsaw manufacturers.  The precise date of origin or identity of the inventor are not known, but there were jigsaw maps by 1760, and the children of King George III played with them, and maybe learned some geography.  They were expensive, and so are the handmade wooden ones that are still made, maybe at $6 a piece.  Such puzzles often have pieces that look like letters our silhouettes of bird, clowns, or infinite others; this was an innovation of Parker Brothers in 1908, the time of the first puzzle fad.  A further fad occurred around the depression, when puzzles were taken up again by a new generation who could no longer afford the theater, who had time on their hands, and who might get some small mental lift by being able to succeed in completing a puzzle.

The history of the slaves and the slavers has been told many ways since then.  Less well known is another form of slavery, the capture of about a million Europeans and Americans by Islamic slave traders, ending only in 1816.  The history of this other trade forms the basis for the particulars in _White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow and North Africa's One Million European Slaves_ (Hodder and Stoughton) by Giles Milton.  Milton seems to have done prodigious research (as he did for his previous bestseller, _Nathaniel's Nutmeg_), and has done his best to bridge the many gaps in Pellow's own story, producing a narrative that is often exciting and always informative.<br /><br />Pellow, born in 1704 and raised in the Cornish fishing village of Penryn, wanted to run away to sea, despite the constant threat of ships being taken by the Barbary pirates.  He was eleven years old when his uncle's ship was captured, and he became property of the sultan, the Moulay Ismail; the author could not have asked for a more repulsive or fearsome villain.  His 25,000 white slaves were given to the enormous project of making a palace that extended for miles, packing wet lime and earth to make the enormous walls and covering it in marble and mosaics.  He could not abide disobedience, even when it was merely in his imagination, and slaves and courtiers were often tortured or beheaded by his whimsy, even at his own hands.  Readers should prepare for extreme unpleasantness in the descriptions of the horrors of the cells or the tortures such as the bastinado, by which a slave would be suspended upside down and the soles of his feet beaten until they were raw.  Pellow converted under torture to Islam, which helped change his fortune, but he was a captive for twenty-three years, constantly wishing he were back home.  He became guardian of the harem, leader of soldiers in military campaigns, and even a slave hunter, before his escape attempts finally succeeded.<br /><br />Pellow was able to write the obligatory first-person account of his trials under the Turk, from which, understandably, Milton has drawn frequently.  He did not live to see any end to the threat of enslavement by the fanatical Muslims which took another century to come.  Strangely, Sir Edward Pellew, a distant relative, was in charge of the fleet that arrived in Algiers in 1816, bombarding the city, liberating the slaves, and permanently ending the European slave trade.  Milton describes how inflamed the British press and Parliament became at the thought of their own citizens in chains, but also explains how little care they showed for black slaves shipped out of Guinea for their own use.  There is little specific to compare here with our own current difficulties with the region, except that horrors, misunderstandings, and religious fanaticism seem to be an unending part of this history.  _White Gold_ is, however, a riveting story of eventual triumph over long odds, and enormously entertaining.tantly wishing he were back home.

This is just the way Wright would have wanted it.  There is a story that he was a witness at a trial, and after being sworn in, he was asked his occupation.  \\"I am the world's greatest architect,\\" he deposed.  When this raised eyebrows, he clearly loved making the explanation, \\"After all, I am testifying under oath.\\"  The remarkable works he produced were a product of that huge ego, as were the financial and marital crises that were present every year of his working life.  It is all covered in succinct form in _Frank Lloyd Wright_ (Viking) by Ada Louise Huxtable, one of the admirable \\"Penguin Lives\\" series.  Huxtable is an established architecture critic, and an obvious admirer of Wright; her book, full of praise and wonder at the works, does not skimp on the questionable morality, which did not just extend to sexual affairs but also to basic financial agreements with clients and creditors.  \\"He never played it safe - in art or in life - and apology was not his style.\\"  Any lack of scruples is long gone; the buildings (most of them) remain.<br /><br />Huxtable is generous in mentions of other books on Wright, to which she refers in the text for the reader's reference.  In 1932 he published his own _Autobiography_, much of which is quoted here.  Huxtable makes clear with every quotation, though, that there is almost always a second or third interpretation of events, and that he wrote not so much to give particulars of his life but to show himself in \\"his Olympian position as the self-described inventor of modern architecture.\\"  Wright was no imitator, as anyone who examines his works can see immediately: \\"He remembered everything, but copied nothing, absorbing what he liked and learned into his own creative thinking.\\"  He had a hardscrabble upbringing, powered by a mother who wanted him even before birth to be a great architect.  He had no formal architectural education, declaring that a conventional education would have been useless to someone of his capacities and sensitivities.  He learned by moving from one firm to another until he had his own.  His first marriage produced six children, but he was never a good family man.  He simply, precipitously left with a lover in 1909, leaving family, debts, and unfinished projects.  In his own mind, he was a moral man, but his morality was his own; he could not have been at fault, only a hypocritical society could.<br /><br />When the depression hit, it hit all architects including Wright.  In his sixties, he published his _Autobiography_ and was regarded by others as finished; he had thirty years of celebrated buildings behind him, and no one expected him to continue, except for possibly putting out variations on what he had done before.  It did not happen, and his later work was so extraordinary that his refusal to go quietly away even in his nineties is perhaps the most inspiring part of his life.  He was brought back into the architectural spotlight with the 1934 Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, a spectacular union of natural and artificial beauty which is now the most-visited architectural shrine in the United States.  He never let up until he died in 1959 while another late masterpiece, the dramatic Guggenheim Museum, was under construction.  Huxtable's book has a few pictures of the main buildings, enough for this overview, but not nearly enough when each of them merits a photo book of its own.  But the brisk narrative is clear, insightful, and provocative, serving as a fine introduction to an astonishing career and personality.declaring that a conventional education would have been useless to someone of his capacities and sensitivities.

It is unnecessary.  There has been for over three centuries the honorable and laudatory term \\"freethinker\\" to designate unbelievers.  It often encompasses the beliefs of deists, so many of whom played a role in founding our nation.  In _Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism_ (Metropolitan Books) by Susan Jacoby, both freethinkers and open-minded religious believers will find a history of remarkable contributions that freethought has brought to our nation over the centuries.  Jacoby is squarely in the freethinker camp, and her book could be seen as one of advocacy, especially as she regards the current government and its faith-based programs.  The history revealed here, however, shows that American freethinkers have been in the advanced guard of good ideas from resisting governmental religion through abolition through birth control.  There are many who say that America's greatness lies in its religious devotion, but even if that is true, its nonbelievers helped found a nation where different religions could be expressed and tolerated, and they have continued to advocate religious civil rights to the current day.<br /><br />Encroachments by those who want religion to be sponsored by government had been attempted long before the nation was founded; Patrick Henry himself introduced a bill in the Virginia General Assembly that would have taxed all citizens to support teachers of Christianity.  Our Constitution quite famously has no reference to Jesus, or even to God, within it.  The Founding Fathers invented the first government that was based on the consent of the governed and not on any claim to a divine foundation.  This was quite deliberate; those at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia explicitly considered, and rejected, putting God in the document.  It is little appreciated that the famous revolutionary Ethan Allen was strongly against organized religion; he wrote a summary of his beliefs in 1784 as _Reason the Only Oracle of Man_.  More influential were the writings of the deist Tom Paine, frequently cited in these pages as a deist with a particular antipathy for the Bible and certitude that Christianity was a ridiculous distortion of true religion.  Another freethinker looming large on these pages is Robert Ingersoll, \\"The Great Agnostic,\\" a Civil War veteran, booster for the Republican party, and spellbinding orator.  It is unimaginable that an avowed freethinker these days might be called upon by his party to speak to any political convention, but Republicans were eager to recruit Ingersoll's oratorical talents.  Ingersoll and others were eager to fight censorship of Whitman's _Leaves of Grass_ or birth control information, and were on the front lines in the Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />The tolerance expected by Jefferson (\\"It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.\\") has been a tradition among freethinkers, a tradition they have tried to get believers to extend even to other believers.  A vicious wave of anti-Catholicism was set off when Al Smith in 1928 became the first Catholic presidential candidate.  Freethinkers were ready to remind the rest of the nation that there was no religious requirement for office.  One of Smith's most fervent defenders was Clarence Darrow, the nation's best-known agnostic since Ingersoll.  Such admirable actions ought to be appreciated by everyone of any belief, but Jacoby has written a history; it is easy for any American to be grateful that freethinkers helped champion birth control or Whitman's poems long ago.  These efforts were controversial at the time, and current freethinkers are subject to the same sort of scorn; consider the death threats that Madelyn Murray O'Hair and Michael Newdow have endured.  Believers who follow Jacoby up through current times, however they might disagree withfreethinkers on the ramparts of \\"Under God\\" in the pledge, stem cell research, or vouchers for religious schools, will have to agree that the freethinkers of the past have helped produce a freer and smarter society.with freethinkers on the ramparts of \\"Under God\\" in the pledge, stem cell research, or vouchers for religious schools, will have to agree that the freethinkers of the past have helped produce a freer and smarter society.  <br />	2004-11-12

Convictions based on eyewitness identifications and physical evidence persuasive enough to convince a jury have later been shown by DNA testing to be completely erroneous.  DNA testing is taken for granted now although there is still reluctance on the part of some prosecutors to allow tests to be made on old specimens, and many of the specimens have been discarded down the years.  The story of one of the first of these cases is told in _Bloodsworth: The True Story of the First Death Row Inmate Exonerated by DNA_ (Algonquin Books) by Tim Junkin.  It is a hellish story of justice gone wrong, and there is plenty of blame to go around; but it is also the story of Kirk Bloodsworth's undying confidence that his conviction would be set right, and the idealistic lawyers who listened to him and eventually made it so.<br /><br />In 1984, nine-year-old Dawn Hamilton was raped, sodomized, and killed in a wooded area near Baltimore.  A composite sketch was produced on the evidence of seven- and ten-year-old boys, and the sketch eventually was connected, despite dissimiliarities, to Kirk Bloodsworth, an ex-Marine.  Much of the book shows how the righteous confidence of detectives and prosecutors lead them to rationalize away any parts of the evidence and identifications that did not fit.  Bloodsworth was eventually put on a disgusting death row, and as an accused and then convicted child molester and killer, he was detested by the thugs in prison who assaulted him in different, disgusting ways.  He did not give up; he wrote letters every day to anyone he could think of who might help, and eventually found a lawyer who had power to get the evidence reexamined.<br /><br />Bloodsworth was freed, and the prosecutors, because he pushed for the tests, now had a DNA sample to match, but they did almost nothing to pursue the real killer until Bloodsworth insisted on action.  The DNA sample revealed the real killer, a man who had been able during the time Bloodsworth was in jail to commit further crimes.  There is a powerful chapter near the end in which Bloodsworth confronts a prosecutor after the killer had been found; she requested the meeting to tell him.  He tells her, \\"I have hated you for twenty years.  You have called me a monster...\\"  He extends forgiveness, which is significant, but he has also been inspired to try to make changes in the system that nearly killed him.  He is, of course, against the death penalty, and is campaigning against the conservative lawmakers who insist that the widespread use of DNA testing is too expensive and causes frivolous delays in sentencing.  He has appeared before Congress on behalf of the Innocent Protection Act, which eventually made money available to provide funds for DNA testing, a program called the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program.  Junkin is a lawyer and a novelist, and has told the details of this case plainly and with no unnecessary drama.  He has successfully, but not oppressively, tied this particular instance to the general problem of basic judicial fairness.  In the book, justice gets done, but it is dangerously delayed, and comes only because of remarkable courage on the part of an ordinary man, persistence by idealistic defense lawyers, Bloodsworth's parents who condemned themselves to poverty to pay for some degree of justice for their son, and the eventual application of the new evidence technology.  Those circumstances were eventually good enough to get him freed; it is wrong to expect that such circumstances will consistently make the system fair.The DNA sample revealed the real killer, a man who had been able during the time Bloodsworth was in jail to commit further crimes.

If this is true, then the book containing this sentiment, _The Last of the Celts_ (Yale University Press) by Marcus Tanner is a very sad book indeed.  Tanner has included the stories of the Celts of different regions; of course, the people still remain, but since the languages involved are being lost, an important part of being Celtic is being lost as well.  Examined in fascinating detail, with historical research and with interviews of relict speakers, are the Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton tongues.  The author's father spoke fluent Welsh to his contemporary family, but did not teach it to his children, and Tanner got interested in learning some of the language.  He researched about why it had faded, and his interests grew to take in all the non-English speakers of Britain and Ireland and the non-French speakers of Northern France.  In many ways, the decline of the languages and genuine Celtic culture is ironic, since Celtic is big.  Celtic religion is supposed to be a throwback to a time when people were in tune with nature, valued women, and were not priggish.  You can buy Celtic crosses and prayer plaques.  You can go to shows like Riverdance or its spin-offs, and you can hear what the world considers Celtic music (pipe, fiddle, harp) on public radio.  These are all just the latest style of Celtic revival, for there have been revivals for different reasons for centuries.  People like the New Age-y aspects of Celtic culture, but this is a mere marketing device; real Celtic societies and their languages are doomed.  Some are gone forever already, and some are in the process, as \\"the Celtic sea, having retreated into disconnected pools, reduces to puddles.\\"<br /><br />All the Hebrides have lost their isolation.  One islander notes another drain on Gaelic: \\"What TV did was to bring a new member into the living room who spoke only English.\\"  Television has split families, with one generation constantly using Gaelic and the succeeding generation using English.  An Irish-speaker near Galway says, \\"The language of the playground is no longer Irish.\\"  For all the resilience of pipe and fiddle music in the pubs, the younger set sings along to Madonna at karaoke.  Religion plays a role in almost all the stories here, sometimes promoting and sometimes restricting native languages.  In Northern Ireland, where everything seems to have a confrontational religious side, the Protestants have little interest in their Celtic heritage because the Gaelic language is central to Catholic republican culture.  The slow death of the Cornish language was not regarded much until the Celtic revival of the 1890's.  The language was revived well over a century after the last speaker had died, and because there was so little knowledge of what the original language was like. when experts came up with competing descriptions of sound, vocabulary, and grammar, there was only confusion and misspent efforts at cultural revival.  The Bretons were doing well at the beginning of the last century, but hitched their feelings of separation from France to Nazism, allowing the French to suppress almost all Breton cultural activity after the war.  Another odd history is of the Welsh settlers to Argentina in 1865.  Their descendants have continued their traditions in the Welsh-looking Patagonian village of Gaiman, where they \\"do good business serving out Welshness to visiting coach parties of Argentine and foreign tourists.\\"<br /><br />They are doing better than most of the quietly expiring Celtic cultures profiled here.  The current romanticization and popularization of Celtic religion, music, and ecological devotion will not help to stop the inevitable decline of these once-vital languages and societies.  Tanner has no remedy, for there is none.  He has, instead, produced a book to document the loss which has occurred for centuries but is faster now.  It is a lively, sympathetic and poignant tour of disappearing worlds.there is none.  He has, instead, produced a book to document the loss which has occurred for centuries but is faster now.

It might just as well apply to hundreds of ideas in these pages.  The book is a fascinating summary of where geology stands now, as a relatively new science which has been completely remade on the foundation of plate tectonics, just as biology has only recently been founded on evolution.  \\"It is not faith that moves mountains; it is tectonics,\\" Fortey insists.  He does not directly confront those who would misuse science to \\"prove\\" an Earth less than 10,000 years old; the real science from real geologists, of course, overwhelmingly indicates an age of billions, not thousands, of years.  But he understands the impulse: \\"Let the time go into the millions, and beyond, and the insignificance of our own sector becomes patent.\\"  Somehow, this is an insignificant insignificance.  Billions of years of continental plates shoving each other around on our planet did eventually bring forth a creature that could understand that process.  The history of how that understanding came about, as told here, is a proud one, full of human errors and pride, but powered by that admirable human trait of curiosity.  \\"Rocks do not lie,\\" Fortey tells us.  \\"They do, however, dissemble as to their true meaning.\\"  Demonstrating the meaning, and clearing away the dissembling, is what this book expertly accomplishes.<br /><br />One of the sacred locales of the science of geology mentioned here is the Temple of Serapis near Naples.  It now consists of three huge columns, each composed of one single piece of marble.  They are discolored about four meters above their pedestals, and the discoloring comes from the boring of a destructive type of mollusk.  This means that the temple (actually a marketplace) was constructed and then was somehow lowered into the sea, whence it arose again.  It was Charles Lyell who realized that the columns could be read to understand the movement of the Earth and that rocks reflected changes by fire, water, ice, and animals.  Lyell's _Principles of Geology_ changed the way people thought of the age of the Earth and how the lands were formed, and it profoundly influenced the ideas of the young Charles Darwin.  Fortey takes us to the temple, up Vesuvius, along the San Andreas Fault, to the Grand Canyon, and more, at each point showing the stones and layers and describing how they got there.  He includes fascinating details, like the work of researchers who are, in a minuscule way, reproducing the enormous heat and pressure of the inner Earth to examine the extraordinary physics and chemistry there.  He tells of the streets of Kalgoorlie, Australia, which were literally paved with gold; the miners who dug up the shiny yellow metal didn't realize that the waste rock they brought up contained gold compounded with tellurium.  When they did realize it, there was a second gold rush.  He mentions a bar at Paddington Station, where the counter is made of a slab of granite from the Precambrian times.  Always a genial guide, with a humorous, curious, and philosophical outlook on the large mass of material he presents here, Fortey reflects that anyone who has missed a train can at least reflect at the bar \\"...that is 1,500 million years old and reflect that half an hour is not a serious delay.\\"was constructed and then was somehow lowered into the sea, whence it arose again.

Collecting garbage, that's something street people do.  But that's not nearly the whole story.  In _Mongo: Adventures in Trash_ (Bloomsbury), Ted Botha has reported on New York street collectors.  \\"Mongo\\" is slang that originated in New York in the 1980s for \\"any discarded object that is retrieved.\\"  This decidedly does not mean mere garbage, the worthless rotting ephemera which no one wants.  There are plenty of discarded things, however, from books to wood scraps to blocks of buildings, which the person who did the discarding thought were worth zero and which the eventual collector thought had value.  And many times, that value is in the thousands.  Frequently this is a surprising story of rags literally going to riches.  Botha reminds us, \\"The street collector you see today could well be a bum or a lunatic, that's true enough, but just as easily a millionaire, a schoolteacher, an accountant, a doctor, a housewife.\\"  He has contacted all these levels to report on them.<br /><br />This is a New York story, for a good reason.  All mongo collectors of all levels \\"... agree on one thing: New York can't be beat.\\"  The reason is simple: \\"Great wealth makes great garbage.\\"  There is great wealth, true, but also people live very close together, meaning that collectors have to range minimally, and there is frequent turnover of renters.  Remarkably, mongo collectors all are breaking the law.  In New York City, garbage placed for pickup is no longer anyone's property but the city's.  Even official sanitation workers are forbidden to take anything for themselves.  Botha never once heard of anyone picked up for picking up garbage, so the regulations about it seem to be universally ignored.<br /><br />The lowest of the low are the black bag people, those who hunt inside black plastic garbage bags.  They have to look through genuine garbage, of course, but can find watches, rings, and even wallets, which they can sell on the street.  Somewhat above the black baggers are those who are eating garbage.  The best garbage to eat is thrown out by restaurants, and the best time to hunt for such stuff is at closing time.  \\"Sometimes they put the food at the top of the bag so it is easier to find,\\" explains once such collector.  Some are dedicated anarchists, loosely organized to share found food so that eating this way is a political option and a rebellion against consumerism.  Higher in the hierarchy are the canners, those who survive on what they can make by selling recyclable cans.  Mongo is sometimes about making a living, and sometimes about making a life.  A Chelsea woman found a computer in the trash several years ago, and from that taught herself to repair found computers, which she now resells.  There is a former bank employee here who specializes in books and printed ephemera.  He has found a first edition of _Finnegans Wake_ as well as signatures of Benjamin Disraeli and Aaron Burr.  There are a couple who dig down in the grounds that used to house outhouses; they can get bottles worth thousands of dollars.  Another excavates sludge for what has gone down modern sewers.  There are artists who make an entire domestic statement with a folk-art installation of _objets trouv&eacute;s_.  There is the conservator who picks up valuable exotic wood for reinstallation into other houses.  There are many collectors here with a passion for what they do, and very few outright loonies.

The question seems so basic to non-geologists; after all, to the rest of us, the mountains just seem always to have been there, and they don't change a bit that we can see.  Geologists, however, look at the world in a different way; even the ancient Andes mountains participate in a life and death cycle, and according to Lamb, they are \\"almost living creatures, and... their life stories are deeply felt by the rest of the planet.\\"  He has wonderfully succeeded in conveying a geologist's view of the world in _Devil in the Mountain: A Search for the Origin of the Andes_ (Princeton University Press), which although it looks at his Bolivian exploits in particular, is a fine primer for anyone who wants to learn some geological basics.<br /><br />The revolutionary ideas of plate tectonics were all well accepted in the 1980s, when Lamb started his career.  Though plate tectonics explained much, it didn't answer specifics about the Andes.  What made them so high, for instance, and how is it that unlike other mountain ranges, they have a bent rather than straight or sinuous appearance on the map?  Through extensive travel within Bolivia in a battered land cruiser, he and his colleagues and students developed a picture of the mountains over the past 65 million years.  The picture of the rise of the mountains can be put into order \\"using not much more than a hammer and a compass\\", but putting  dates on the events cannot be done with simple equipment.  Lamb explains potassium / argon dating, the search for tracks of particles of uranium decay within zircon, the process of crushing rocks to determine their strength, sampling helium from volcanoes, and the use of the Global Positioning System for measurements within a few millimeters.  Though these technical matters occupy much of the book, it is mostly a chronological memoir about how Lamb came to his current understanding of the formation of the Andes.  As such, it is full of adventures, some having to do with unscrupulous natives, or dodgy bureaucrats, or cantankerous machines, told here with good humor.<br /><br />Using the Andes as a working example, Lamb is able to jam his book full of interesting accounts of finding out how the mountains grew, and contrast them with the Alps, Rockies, or the ancient hills of Britain.  The great engine of the inner Earth, powered by gravity and radioactive heat, is revealed to be strange, unlike anything we have to deal with here on the surface, but comprehensible.  Lamb shows that the knowledge is vital for many reasons, not the least of which is that the Andes are a force strongly contributing to world weather.  The Andes make possible, for instance, the rainforests of the Amazon, and over long geological history probably played a role in the spread of savannah in Africa, which may have changed primate evolution.  The forces of such changes are still at work, and are excitingly explained in Lamb's agreeable combination of pure science and field memoir.easurements within a few millimeters.

Most of us, even the redoubtable Catholic Church, have accepted that evolution explains animal diversity and even the emergence of humans, although there are some who for religious (not scientific) reasons are kicking and screaming in refusal.  Science cannot itself take on the existence of gods, for that is not a scientific question, nor is the existence of an afterlife.  But souls; now there is something that science, and especially modern neuroscience, might go to work on.  In _Descartes' Baby: How the Science of Child Development Explains What Makes Us Human_ (Basic Books), Paul Bloom takes an even more basic approach, hardly mentioning such technological wonders as the scanners that show brains at work.  He examines a wealth of clever experiments on babies and children to answer about babies the question posed more often about disreputable politicians: \\"What do they know, and when do they know it?\\"  The answers provide an entertaining and informative evaluation of what we might be able to tell about souls.<br /><br />Ren&eacute; Descartes promoted \\"dualism\\": the body exists, and it is a machine of meat which, when it is alive, is coupled with an immaterial soul.  This, according to Bloom, is a natural view; evolution itself has made us into dualists.  We are wired to perceive material objects and mental manifestations as separate entities, and so naturally we think of the two as separate realms.  But that we evolved that way is not an argument that it is the right way to think of things.  From the very beginning, experiments show, babies treat the world as dual.  Bloom goes on to explain experiments that show that children have inborn knowledge of fairness that is at the heart of our ability to get along with others.  \\"... Our moral feelings are no less adaptations than our taste for sweet foods and our perception of solid objects.\\"  We are from an early age able to empathize with the pain of others, which leads to compassion and to helping them; it's all commendable behavior, and no less so because we come into the world hard-wired to perform it.<br /><br />We perform it because it pays to perform it, and it simply gives us a reproductive advantage.  Empathetic people (and those with altruism and other laudable traits described here) are most successful at working in societies, and we are social animals.  What's more, they will be more effective in understanding and raising children, and so the behavior will be passed on.  Bloom is clearly a materialist, not a dualist, but wisely avoids any attempt to prove the issue.  What he has done instead is not to examine if dualism is justified, but merely why belief in it is so prevalent.  The belief that objects are not really solid is just as fundamentally unnatural as the belief that mind is an emergent physical property of the brain.  This could be heavy stuff, and philosophers have argued heavily for centuries one way or the other.  But Bloom has a diverse array of interests, and includes discussion of such subjects as slapstick humor, autism, modern art, and disgust.  Those familiar with Noam Chomsky's claim that we have special \\"language organs\\" in our brains that make us linguistic creatures will find that idea mentioned here, but vastly expanded to show our \\"physics organ\\" and \\"social organ\\".  Throughout Bloom has illustrated his arguments with summaries of his own or others' experiments on babies.  Those who would expect a materialist also to be a pessimist will be disappointed; he declares himself to be a \\"morally optimistic materialist,\\" and gives examples of moral improvement (like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) that would have made little sense to our forebears.  Not bad for a bunch of natural-born dualists.ste for sweet foods and our perception of solid objects.\\"  We are from an early age able to empathize with the pain of others, which leads to compassion and to helping them; it's all commendable behavior, and no less so because we come into the world hard-wired to perform it. <br /> <br />We perform it because it pays to perform it, and it simply gives us a reproductive advantage.

The name means \\"wandering falcon,\\" and the name fits.  It has breeding grounds in Alaska, and swoops down as far even as Argentina to follow the sunlight, which powers the plants which after other links turn into the birds on which the falcon feeds.  You wouldn't expect Alan Tennant to be to particularly interested in the travels of falcons; after all, he's a snake man, have published several field guides to snakes in different regions of America.  But as is shown in his book, _On the Wing: To the Edge of the Earth with the Peregrine Falcon_ (Knopf), Tennant has an unstoppable and unrestrained curiosity.  He has had his share of funny occurrences, dangerous moments, and inexplicable joys in the quest for following his falcons, a quest that was of minor research significance, relentless discomfort, and intermittent life-threatening peril.  His lovely account of having to do a senseless task because he simply had to will convince the reader of the emotional sense of such an effort; his book gives as well a picture of falcon life and larger ecological concerns, and it never misses a chance to describe the many eccentric humans Tennant gets to meet.<br /><br />The book opens in the mid-1980s when Tennant was watching falcons on the barrier islands of Texas.  He wanted to go with them.  He hooked up with George Vose, a World War II flight instructor who has experience in tracking birds but no particular love of it.  Vose plays Tennant's Sancho Panza, an irritable septuagenarian pilot with a rickety Cessna who loves flying.  Tennant hated flying (and given the scrapes and scares that Vose's plane gave him, with good reason).  The two adventurers don't get much of a chance actually to see their falcons.  They are following just radio blips; losing the blips is a disaster fraught with worry, and regaining them, sometimes after days or weeks of silence, is a joy.  There is plenty of wildlife in Tennant's book, but it is a pleasure to read about how these two became friends.  In contrast, Tennant writes just as clearly and movingly about how his obsession ruins his relationship with his smart and sensible girlfriend Jennifer.<br /><br />The adventures of Tennant and Vose chasing radio beacons take them back and forth across America into Canada for the summer trek and into Mexico and Belize for the winter.  Every bit of bad weather the intrepid  birds go through has to be endured by the pilots as well.  There is plenty to learn about  how evolution has shaped birds in different ways for success.  In contrast to the falcons, for instance, hawks cannot feed on birds on the wing since they hunt mice, frogs, and insects.  This means that they have to economize on their migrations, and stick to flying over land, where they can catch free rides on thermals, a tactic falcons do not use.  Tennant and Vose have to negotiate with Canadian customs to cross into Canadian airspace, but because they would lose their falcon while they waited for clearance, Tennant lies to Vose and says their request was granted.  They track the falcon successfully, but their illegal entry gets them into trouble with the Mounties later.  Almost everywhere they go, they are assumed to be running drugs; it is a far more credible explanation than can be provided when Tennant insists he is engaged in the foolery of hunting falcon radio beacons.  They are more than once intimidated by men with guns who are convinced they are drug-runners or spies with electronic surveillance gear.  The inimical forces of nature are just as problematic, from mosquitoes to bears.  Along the way, the genial guide Tennant gets to write about such things as mammoths and the memorial at the crash site of Will Rogers and Wiley Post.  Tennant reflects, a little sadly, that as eccentric as their quest might have been, it would now be even more unnecessary; falcons are tracked by satellite.  None of those researchers with their eyes on their satellite monitors, however, is ever going to be able to produce as romantic and entertaining a volume as this one.on their satellite monitors, however, is ever going to be able to produce as romantic and entertaining a volume as this one.  <br />	2004-10-21
486485:US	50895620	R1Y7F8PVM91GAI	1403915008	517909211	Mighty Lewd Books: The Development of Pornography in Eighteenth-Century England	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An Academic Book On Lewd Books	Two hundred years from now, some academic will publish an analysis of pornography on the inchoate internet; how it reflected our medical and social views, how it changed our views of the sexes, how it favored some activities over others, and so on.  Everyone knows that humans have enjoyed porn for about as long as they have enjoyed sex, but probably the age of the internet is going to make things different.  In eighteenth century Britain, people had to put up with the print media, but the eighteenth century was a time of rapid change, with advances in medicine, science, and exploration.  Many of these were reflected in the erotic works of the time, and such works have now been analyzed in _Mighty Lewd Books: The Development of Pornography in Eighteenth Century England_ (Palgrave Macmillan) by Julie Peakman.  Peakman, who is a historian of sex, has gone through scads of original material from the time; her extensive bibliography, for instance, has four pages of works attributed to that prolific author, Anonymous.  Her title comes from a diary entry of Pepys, in which he confesses to reading a little of \\"... a mighty lewd book, but yet not amiss for a sober man once to read over to inform himself in the villainy of the world.\\"  Peakman's own book is far from lewd; it is a serious academic treatise, and as for villainy, most people who take an interest in this subject are probably not going to be as self-servingly judgmental as Pepys was.  There is necessarily some low humor in some of the works covered, the publishers were often a furtive lot whom society wished to castigate, and there are prejudices we now think are unfashionable; but this is far from a catalogue of villainies.  Peakman has written in an unjudgmental and detached tone throughout, giving a valuable view of some of the foundations of modern pornography.<br /><br />Italy had taken the lead in producing erotic books during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and then France took over as a center of pornography and developed a graphic style.  The biggest debt English pornography owed to the French was anti-Catholicism.  The French version had frequent attacks on the cloistering of nuns or the secrecy of the confessional; such attacks would have been in accord with the British hostility to Catholics due to political distrust, popular fear, and theological disagreement.  Corruption in the Catholic church was a popular topic, and so tales of vice within nunneries, or of priests seducing nuns or parishioners, were popular not just as sexual entertainment, but as propaganda.  The English detested the Catholic advocacy of flagellation as a penance.  With the antagonism to the Catholic Church, English society took to the stories from France having to do with priests, monks, and nuns flagellating each other for sexual rather than sacred reasons.  Flagellation, and later other sadomasochistic play, became particularly associated with the English; forty years ago when coyness used to be needed in the personals ads, \\"English Art\\" was taken to mean S & M.  Peakman shows how pornography incorporated ideas of the time that we should usually not at all regard as erotic, like botany, garden planning, and electrical research.<br /><br />Peakman makes the useful finding that with literacy increasing, it was not just the upper classes that enjoyed pornography, as might be concluded from the beloved leather-bound limited copies that have come to us from the libraries of the rich.  Chapbooks and broadsheets could be bought  and enjoyed by the working class.  Women had access to such works; prostitutes would keep them in stock.  London was, of course, a center for printing and for porn, but there were thousands of itinerant hawkers who would carry pornographic productions to the provinces.  Peakman also shows how pornography reflected (and thereby influenced) sexual attitudes; porn before the eighteenth century tended to have men and women equally active and eager for satisfaction,but especially with the anti-Catholic porn, women were put in submissive or victim roles.  This is a serious work for those with serious interest in the theme, but given the rollicking nature of that theme, there is reason to smile frequently.  After all, in what other bibliography will you find such works as _A Flaming Whip for Lechery or the Whoremonger's Speculum_, _The Birchen Banquet, Or Curious and original Anecdotes of Ladies fond of Administering the Birch Discipline_, or _A Full and True Account of a Dreaded Fire that Lately Broke out in the Pope's Breeches_?on, but especially with the anti-Catholic porn, women were put in submissive or victim roles.

For the criminals described here, it is easy to steal the art: bind and gag the guards, rip up the alarms, and especially get in and out fast.  When Hart describes one successful heist after another, it certainly seems like no particular challenge.  But what does the crook do when he has that painting?  It is then that the risks mount up; the mere possession of a Rembrandt might give very esthetic thieves satisfaction, but that's not what they are in the game for.  There is little reality to the \\"Dr. No\\" perpetrator, named for the fantastically evil evildoer pitted against James Bond; there really aren't secretive billionaires ordering thefts for hire to get their particular favorite artwork to themselves.  What is far more likely nowadays is that a fraction of the stolen item's value could be used for collateral in, say, a drug deal.  Still, the thief needs to unload the artwork somehow, and this need provides the drama in the episodes of Hart's book, as international police forces work together to orchestrate elaborate sting operations.<br /><br />In 1974, the Vermeer _Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid_ was stolen from the Beit collection at Russborough House near Dublin by a gang whose most curious and visible member was Rose Dugdale, a seductive, smart, spoiled rich kid who rebelling against whatever, was an Englishwoman supporting the IRA's campaign of terror.  Twelve years later, it was stolen again by Dublin gangster Martin Cahill.  Most of Hart's book has to do with the difficulties of finding the paintings again, the dangers and the dead ends as international police forces set spies on Cahill and his gang, and Cahill set his spies on them.  Remarkably, after both these robberies, conservators that had to clean and repair the painting found new aspects of the canvas that changed scholarly opinions about them.  The work of the restorers, and their discoveries, are described here in satisfying detail.  Tangential to the main story are descriptions of the famous unsolved thefts from the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston and the 1994 theft of  Munch's _The Scream_ from the National Gallery of Norway.<br /><br />Hart has given a fast-paced and captivating account of the symbiosis between cops and robbers.  He has valuable remarks on the contemporary art world, art restoration, and the particular way the Irish play the game.  He helps explain the peculiar relationship between Cahill's gang and the Garda by analyzing the history of the Irish resistance to authority.  The recovered Vermeer was rehung at Russborough House, where yet another attempt was made on it.  The Beit collection has since been taken in by Dublin's National Gallery, which is less isolated and more protected.  Hart shows, however, that it is a reasonable conjecture that someone is looking at the Vermeer on the Gallery's walls and wondering just how difficult it might be to make off with it again, and how difficult to gain riches by finding a taker.scholarly opinions about them.

There are few works that can have the exclusive and eccentric list of owners as the Portland Vase has had.  One of the most famous of ancient artworks, and now in the British Museum, it has fascinated historians, poets, mythologists, and potential owners ever since it came to light (probably by a grave robber in Rome) in 1582.  In -The Portland Vase: The Extraordinary Odyssey of a Mysterious Roman Treasure_ (HarperCollins), Robin Brooks has given a biography of a unique object, not only telling its history and about the lives of those who owned and held it, but also about the centuries of unresolved argument about what the figures on the vase mean.  It is an intriguing story that weaves through much of European history.<br /><br />The vase itself is a little object, something less than ten inches tall.  It is not pottery, like most ancient vases, but blue glass, decorated with white figures of classical male and female nudes.  The argument about who they are includes Jupiter and Venus among the most frequently sighted, with Orpheus and Eurydice, Pluto, Castor and Pollux, and a host of others (including, anachronistically, the physician Galen).  Once the vase left the family of Pope Urban VIII (sold to pay gambling debts) it belonged eventually to the successive Dukes of Portland.  The fourth duke leant it to the British Museum, where it was smashed by a confused visitor in 1845.  The 200 pieces and smaller shards were gathered up, and painstakingly glued together by the best restorer in the land.  The vase is timeless, but repairs are temporary; it has been dismantled and re-repaired in 1949 and again forty years later.<br /><br />The vase's story, told here with eagerness and amusement, is one full of surprises and brushes with famous admirers like Wedgwood, Keats, and Blake.  There are three sections to the book, consisting of \\"The Lip\\" (the prologue), \\"The Body\\" (consisting of nineteen \\"fragments\\" where most of the history is given) and \\"The Base\\" (consisting of an epilogue).  There thus does not seem to be any missing chapter, and the base of the vase, a separate piece, is discussed at different points within the fragments.  There is much to be learned here about inheritance practices, tourism, museum culture, and art markets.  The sixth duke asked for the vase back in 1929, when world finances were crashing, so he could sell it.  It was expected to fetch at least £50,000, but failed, and went back to the museum.  The seventh duke offered it for sale to the museum in 1944, for a song, £5,000, and there it remains.

In _Dark Light: Electricity and Anxiety from the Telegraph to the X-ray_ (Harcourt), Linda Simon has written a social history of the early days of electricity.  Simon points out that we now use electrical metaphors to describe ourselves: we are shocked, or wired, and we plug into new ideas, perhaps ideas from the latest \\"human dynamo.\\"  This level of familiarity was hard in coming.  There was a time when \\"electricity was a force stronger in the imagination than in reality\\" and the imagination brought forth worries.  There were rosy speculations, of course, about electric lights that had no flame to catch curtains ablaze, and electric sewing machines and carpet cleaners.  \\"Electric light is safe,\\" went one advertisement, because the public had to be convinced.  They knew about accidental electrocutions (even of technicians who were supposed to know about electricity) and explosions from sparks near gas mains which made headlines.  People were reluctant to invite the force of lightning into their homes.  Simon has provided an entertaining, desultory explanation of the mostly negative public view of electricity in the last half of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Thirty years after Edison invented a successful lightbulb, only ten percent of American homes were wired.  Edison could not conquer the public fear that \\"nature would extract retribution for harnessing its power.\\"  Oddly enough, though there was fear about household electricity, the healing force of electricity was quickly accepted.  Electrotherapy seemed a better alternative than the nostrums or diets that doctors might prescribe.  Thus physicians (and quacks) began manufacturing and recommending electric baths and teething rings and brushes, electrified corsets, and electrical probes for any body cavity to dispense the charge right where it was needed.  The scientists often did not help their own cause.  The famous disagreement between Edison and his former employee Nikola Tesla (and George Westinghouse, with whom Tesla came to work) over what kind of current would be safest could only fuel suspicion that if experts disagreed, there was no reason to accept the new technology as safe.  The alarmists on both sides of the direct versus alternating current debate predicted terrible disasters if the other side had its way.  (A physician at the time wisely said the arguments against electrification were the equivalents of those against illuminating gas or railroad trains a century before.)  Edison cheerfully lent space and equipment for experiments on electrocuting animals by the alternating currents he opposed, and then practiced a bit of skullduggery to get New York to accept alternating current as the force for the new electric chair.  He favored \\"to Westinghouse\\" as the new term for legal infliction of death by electricity.<br /><br />Simon has drawn on forgotten fiction works, some by famous authors like L. Frank Baum and Edgar Allen Poe, to examine how people were accepting the new ideas about electricity.  Mark Twain, in a futuristic mode, envisioned a \\"Phonograph for the application of stored Profanity\\".  She concludes with the discovery of the x-ray, which like so many medical effects of the new technology was widely and eagerly accepted, and people were thrilled to get a peep at their own insides.  Even so, other people saw this as a new menace against privacy, and one company sold X-ray-proof underwear.  When people finally learned about radiation burns and sickness, many must have felt that the worries over the new forces had been justified.  Simon has, with an amused eye, brought together plenty of stories of electrification to show how electrical technology affected society and increased the realms of anxiety before familiarity bred contentment.together plenty of stories of electrification to show how electrical technology affected society and increased the realms of anxiety before familiarity bred contentment.  <br />	2004-10-10
500129:US	50895620	R7ZCLTYQRFJF6	0060090642	750503551	Birth of the Chess Queen: A History	Books	5	5	9	N	N	The Queens Have the Power	Even if you know little about chess, you know that since the object of the game is to take an opponent's king, the king is the key to the game and properly considered the most important piece; but also, the king is a weak piece, much less able to move than the most powerful piece on the board, the queen, who can move in eight directions as far as a blocking piece or the edge of the board will allow.  The rules of chess are all in standard form now, but they weren't always, and the queen used to be far weaker (or even nonexistent).  In _Birth of the Chess Queen: A History_ (HarperCollins), Marilyn Yalom takes a look at a most peculiar coup d'etat.  Her contention, which is entertaining and credible even though it may never be proved, is that the rise of the queen in chess is linked to the rise of historic warrior queens, to the cult of the Virgin Mary, and to the then-new tradition of courtly love.  She has produced a rich history not only of a chess piece and the game itself, but of the evolution of female power.<br /><br />The first literary mention of chess comes from Persia, around 600 CE, but the Persians had taken the essentials of the game from India.  There was no queen on these chessboards.  What was to be her square was occupied by the vizier, the advisor to the king.  He was the weakest piece on the board, moving only diagonally and merely one square at a time.  Around 1000 CE, there were the first European mentions of a queen instead of a vizier; perhaps this was a recognition of who it was that really had the king's ear. By the 1500s, people were playing \\"lady's chess\\" or \\"queen's chess,\\" with the queen acquiring the extensive moves that she has retained ever since.  As far as can be known, the powerful queen arose in southern Europe, and may reflect that aristocratic women in that region had more power than in northern Europe; they could inherit land and become the rulers of the land, for instance.  The move made the game much faster and more complex, but churchmen objected in particular to the prospect of a pawn changing to a queen by reaching the far rank.  Not only did this involve an unnatural change of sex, but it might be that there could thus result two (or more) queens on the board.  The original rules said that changing to a queen could only happen if the original queen had been captured.  This would avoid turning the king into a bigamist.  Arab players, with viziers instead of queens, suffered no such qualms.<br /><br />Simultaneous with the queen's rise were examples of actual queens wielding real power.  There are different obscure ones whose stories are told here, but familiar to many will be Queen Isabella who as \\"a militant queen more powerful than her husband\\" might have made more acceptable the idea of a powerful queen on the chess board.  Eleanor of Aquitaine and Elizabeth I may have performed the same symbolic function.  (Isabella also indirectly spread \\"queen's chess\\" all over Europe by expelling the Jews from Spain in 1492; Spain had been a center for the new form of the game.)  Much later came Catherine the Great of Russia, and in Russia, the chess vizier was edged out by the queen only around the same time.  This is the sort of obscure and fascinating information, with judicious speculation, that may be found throughout Yalom's book.  Chess, politics, and history are here combined in a spirit of an intellectual entertainment which is in perfect accord with the game itself.but churchmen objected in particular to the prospect of a pawn changing to a queen by reaching the far rank.

It has, however, a history far longer than that, and during its subsequent time as a commercial tablet, it has been at the heart of medical, advertising, scientific and historic controversies.  In _Aspirin: The Remarkable Story of a Wonder Drug_ (Bloomsbury), Diarmuid Jeffreys has told the whole story of a drug that became a standard tablet only after many centuries of use, and then, when other pain relievers were crowding it out, became a nostrum for heart attack and stroke prevention, as well as other indications.  It is a terrific story of many side branches, and Jeffreys has told it with a lively sense of humor (for there are many wrong-headed notions along the way, and many peculiar people) and also admiration for those who have pursued the development and use of aspirin in a scientific way.<br /><br />Physicians in ancient Egypt used extracts from willow trees as analgesics, and probably learned about them from the Sumerians before.  Hippocrates and Galen knew of it, but we lost wisdom about such things in the Middle Ages.  The modern story begins with the Reverend Edward Stone who lived in Chipping Norton, England.  Around 1757, Stone came to correct conclusions about willow bark, but used doubtful reasoning, for instance that it was bitter like quinine and so would help fevers.  There was a boom in chemical synthesis in the nineteenth century, and Friedrich Bayer & Co., a German firm, succeeded in making pure ASA in quantities, and christened it Aspirin.  There were few proven drugs on the market at the time, drugs like quinine and digitalis, and other than the opiates, there were no proven analgesics.  This meant that Aspirin quickly became one of the most widely used drugs in the world.  In 1920, the trade name Aspirin was legally determined to have passed into common usage, and from then on, anyone, not just Bayer, could make ASA and call it aspirin.  Aspirin makers fought in advertising, but by the sixties, they had other battles to fight; Tylenol was launched as a prescription drug in 1955, soon going over-the-counter.  Motrin came out, too.  It seemed to some in the 1960s that aspirin was going to continue to fade, but then it was reborn.  Doctors noticed that patients on aspirin seemed to have fewer heart attacks, and researchers began the laborious process of confirming this in large tests.<br /><br />Aspirin has been found to have promise of helping to prevent different cancers, too, and maybe even Alzheimer's.  This is not all a story of benevolent chemistry; after all, Aspirin had made the Bayer company, which was part of I. G. Farben, the giant chemical cartel that used slave labor during World War II and supplied lethal gas to extermination camps.  There are certainly darker sides to the way big business, cutthroat competition, and backstabbing chemists brought us this wonder drug; intrigue, ambition, and greed are all here.  Jeffrey's book tells all this darkness as well as the promises that the drug has fulfilled and may have in the future; in that way, it is an inspiring story of how base motives can sometimes produce a miracle.advertising, but by the sixties, they had other battles to fight; Tylenol was launched as a prescription drug in 1955, soon going over-the-counter.

The U-boats had represented a terrifying war force, a force that Churchill had said was the only real fear he had during the war.  _U-869_ was re-ordered to Gibraltar, and war records showed that it was sunk in that region, and it was presumed lost forever.  Then one day in 1991, a diving ship captain (one who ferries scuba divers out to the wrecks and other underwater sights) in New Jersey, by a means of a bit of cloak and dagger, got the coordinates of a likely spot of interest that had not previously been explored.  That is the beginning of an exciting story of dangerous dives to rewrite history, _Shadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II_ (Random House) by Robert Kurson.  Because of the theme, and because Kurson has so carefully given psychological profiles of the men, this is as suspenseful and gripping as any non-fiction can be.<br /><br />Wreck divers are out to gather trophies.  There would not be much of a story here if physical trophy-hunting was all there was to it.  The two main divers had gathered enough china, medals, bells, and other wreckage; their compulsion grew to gathering facts.  John Chatterton had been a fearless medic in Vietnam, and had become one of the most famous and successful divers in the world.  It was he who first sighted the U-boat; his excitement over the find is high because there was no record of any U-boat sinking anywhere around the area.  Richie Kohler, who ran a glass repair business, got his diving experience among a bunch of rowdies who loved trophies, but also were skilled at working together.  He came from the school of wreck scavenging that Chatterton despised, and the two men hated each other on their first dive together.  Gradually, however, they became as close a team as can be imagined, and Kohler grew into the same sort of fact-obsessed history buff that Chatterton was.  They not only dived, but they rummaged files in governmental and hobbyist collections on both sides of the Atlantic, running in to one dead end after another.  It is a tribute to Kurson's narrative that the descriptions of hunting for facts are almost as exciting as those of hunting for shipboard  artifacts.  Eventually, they demonstrated to the satisfaction of everyone else interested in U-boat history that it was indeed the U-869, but their evidence was circumstantial.  Their terrifying last dives came as they pushed themselves to get evidence that was definite.<br /><br />It all came with enormous costs.  Three others who went on dives to the ship lost their lives in the effort, and the descriptions of their deaths are among the most harrowing parts of these pages.  Chatterton and Kohler both had marriages break up, at least partially because of their obsession with diving and with inarguable identification of the vessel.  Readers will enjoy the triumph after the white-knuckle description of the success of the last dive; Kurson's descriptions of the dangers in such an endeavor, and his careful explanation of such effects as nitrogen-caused delusions, are dramatic and gripping.  Before that last dive, considering the dangers involved, even their fellow wreck divers were warning them to be satisfied with circumstantial evidence, asking who really cares about iron-clad identification of the wreck.  Chatterton and Kohler cared, and throughout this engrossing book, the reader is guaranteed to care, too.sed history buff that Chatterton was.

It looks like nothing else you have ever seen, 250 pages of paintings of weird plants and naked bathers and commentary in a language and letters that cannot be found anywhere else.  This is the Voynich Manuscript, a document well known among cryptographers, linguists, scholars of the Middle Ages, and those simply curious about genuine oddities.  It has been the subject of intense study by experts and amateurs since it came to light in 1912, and though there have been claims that it has been deciphered, the claims have always been shown to be completely overoptimistic.  In _The Voynich Manuscript: The Unsolved Riddle of an Extraordinary Book Which Has Defied Interpretation for Centuries_ (Orion Books), Gerry Kennedy and Rob Churchill examine the document's contents, history, and would-be expositors and their theories, to show how little we know about the book.  It is an enticing, puzzling story, well told to bring the enigma to a broader audience than the specialists who are consumed by it.<br /><br />Wilfrid Voynich was a rare book dealer who reported that he found the manuscript in a Jesuit college outside Rome in 1912, along with a letter connecting it to Roger Bacon, the thirteenth-century British friar and scientist.  Bacon's authorship got a fine boost from the first scholar to take a crack at the manuscript, whose ideas the public and academics welcomed, before they were subsequently debunked.  Since that debacle, professional historians have seldom ventured to work on the document, leaving it to an army of code-breakers and armchair theorists, who are now active on the Internet.  Certainly there is a great deal to think about and speculate upon in the document.  The pictures around which the text is written are distinctly strange, and this book has a good sampling of color plates to illustrate them.  They consist of plants and herbs, with details of flowers, leaves, and roots, which no one has been able to identify.  There are astrological charts that make no sense in any known astrological system.  There are naked ladies dancing, or bathing in a green liquid, which flows from fantastic piping that looks as if it could have been designed by Dr. Seuss.  The text consists of obvious letters and words, but few have been able to agree on exactly how many letters there are in the document.  This is a real stumbling block to decipherment, as is the complete ignorance of what might be its original language.  Neither text nor pictures seem to relate to anything in this world.  Consequently, there have been many interpretations.<br /><br />The authors do not have their own hypothesis for the book to carry.  They are fair-minded and inclusive about the ideas of others, and include a final section in which different experts give their ideas.  Among the experts is Gordon Rugg, a computer scientist, whose most recent work on the decipherment is only suggested here.  Last winter he looked for low-tech tools available in the sixteenth century that could make mysterious text.  He used a \\"Cardan Grille\\" device and found he could generate a page of Voynich-looking gibberish quite easily.  He published his theory earlier this year in the journal _Cryptologia_.  Tables and grilles can account for the statistical anomalies of the text like its repetition of certain words.  Rugg is not the first to simply say that the text is a meaningless hoax, only the most recent.  Even he believes it is an ancient hoax, not a modern one.  Many experts have agreed with his explanation, but it is at heart an unsatisfactory one, since the manuscript is said to be mere gibberish.

Morgan has written many books on American History, including the recent _Benjamin Franklin_.  He has also read a lot of books.  As an expert in the history of the colonial and Revolutionary periods, he has for decades reviewed books on these eras for the _New York Review of Books_, and in the illuminating _The Genuine Article: A Historian Looks at Early America_ (Norton) are reprinted his essays on recent works of American history.  They are \\"... a statement of what I have thought about early Americans during nearly seventy years in their company.\\"  In his introduction, he states that part of his philosophy of reading and writing history is \\"... taking what people have said at face value unless I find compelling reasons to discount it.\\"  The early Americans, for instance, said they were conducting a revolution because of taxation without representation.  Other historians, viewing the events from different political stances, might have tried to demonstrate that this was a class struggle, or that the Americans had been eager to impose their own taxes rather than to do away with taxes from abroad.  No, the American Revolution turned out, in Morgan's view, to be \\"... really what the Americans said it was.\\"  Readers of these essays will find them clear, free of cant, and remarkably charitable.  It is important to note that many of the books covered are not about \\"new\\" books, but new editions of historical papers, like Federalist and Antifederalist writings or the correspondence of Jefferson and Madison.  Morgan in reviews of these books gives his views directly on the historical matters contained, rather than on the opinion of any particular author.<br /><br />Morgan's view of taking things as they seem does not prevent him from reporting surprises.  In chapters on sexual relations in early America, he finds that carrying laws from the old country forbidding sex outside of marriage simply did not work.  In the Carolinas, couples lived, as diarist William Byrd observed, \\"in comfortable fornication.\\"  In New England, sermons were delivered about the orgasmic delights of conversion and sexual comparisons were made between physical love and the love of Christ.  Marriage was seen as a sexual state, and women were entitled to \\"that pang of pleasure\\" which comes from coitus.  In New Haven, the strictest of Puritan colonies, a wife could divorce a husband who could produce no such pangs.  Some towns had a bridal pregnancy rate of 40%.  Although New England is often Morgan's focus, there are many essays on the South.  He maintains that New Englanders left many records of what they thought and did, while Southerners left relatively little of such documentation.  Several of the chapters here are particularly about slavery.  The title of the book comes from an essay on Washington, who generally lost battles, had no known part in drafting provisions at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 over which he presided, and who is credited with some important state papers from his presidency which were mostly ghost-written.  It isn't a great record when put that way, and yet Washington was beloved even by such leaders as Jefferson who strongly disagreed with many of his policies.  \\"If they were so awed by Washington, they must have found something in him that is not immediately apparent in the public record.\\"  He had, it seems, a consuming passion to be honored, and behaved, from dancing to speechifying, in ways deliberately to cultivate esteem.  He consciously pursued honor and power by means of deserving honor and power.  Would that all our politicians afflicted with the same need took the same means to satisfy it.<br /><br />Morgan's essays are exemplary in their clarity.  He is appreciative of the thoughts of those even with whom he disagrees.  He has a sly wit; he says of one author who repeatedly insists that it would be difficult to exaggerate this or that component of a society, \\"Some readers may feel that he has overcome the difficulty.\\"  While this is a collection of reviews rather than a comprehensive history, it throws light on many facets of the young America, and will be enjoyed by all with any interest in the period and in the American character.ficulty.\\"  While this is a collection of reviews rather than a comprehensive history, it throws light on many facets of the young America, and will be enjoyed by all with any interest in the period and in the American character. <br />	2004-09-27
515179:US	50895620	R2H8SVHGC3I695	0743243463	268938613	Branded Nation: The Marketing of Megachurch, College Inc., and Museumworld	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Marketing Where You Least Expected It	James Twitchell has written extensively on advertising and consumerism, and knows that consumers are not logical.  If we were, he says, we would know that we needed, say, a laundry detergent, and would research to see what detergent was best, perhaps checking to see what the boffins at _Consumer Reports_ might recommend.  Then we would take the recommendation to the grocery store, where we would see a very restricted number of possible logical choices.  It doesn't work that way for detergent, nor, these days, does it work that way for churches, museums, or universities.  In _Branded Nation: The Marketing of Megachurch, College Inc., and Museumworld_ (Simon & Schuster) Twitchell has written a funny and scary evaluation of the pervasiveness of marketing in American life beyond the grocery shelves.<br /><br />The problem with laundry detergents is that there are plenty of them, offered by many suppliers, and most of them are interchangeable.  There is very little difference between them, so it is necessary for the manufacturers to create a story about the brand, how it is \\"clothesline-fresh\\", perhaps, or how the power-granules go to work on stains.  Twitchell's thesis is that schools, museums, and churches are all supplying pretty much the same thing, and to up their market share, they are telling stories about themselves (branding) and as good consumers, we are going along with them.  We think that museums have a higher calling than competing for a market share, that they don't really pay attention to the turnstiles, and that they are \\"... only the custodians of, shhh, please be quiet, don't touch, the deep truth.\\"  However true this may have been in the past, it is no longer.  There has been a huge growth in the numbers of museums, the theme of a surplus of goods, though we don't usually view museums that way.  The \\"modern, formal, self-conscious museum\\" is not what people go to as much as they go to theme exhibits, like \\"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the theme is the brand and holds the emotion.  For decades there have been more college students than seats in the classroom, so the marketing had to begin.  Harvard wouldn't admit as much, but it has a great brand.  Twitchell (who is a professor of English at the University of Florida, an institution that does not avoid some withering remarks here) sniffs at the Harvard record, which he says lacks real substance.  What's good about Harvard is not what comes out, but what goes in: \\"the best students, the most money, and the deepest faith in the brand.\\"  In churches, the product, epiphany or salvation, is undifferentiated, producing cut-throat competition for the stable forty percent of people who go to church regularly; this number does not go up, so churches are taking customers (sometimes known as parishioners) from one another.  Twitchell examines the brand shifts in Protestantism that are the same as when Sam's Club comes to town: warehouse churches, of no particular denomination, on the outside of town with huge parking lots.<br /><br />It is disconcerting and amusing to hear of these important spheres of life described in marketing terms, but Twitchell knows the lingo.  All of them, for instance, are LBEs, or Location Based Entertainments.  While his evaluations may be controversial, this is no polemic; Twitchell does not find branding bad; other marketing systems are simply antiquated.  Brands have become motivators, \\"the basis not just of interactions but of interior actions.\\"  He thinks that identification with brands may be the way we will continue to spread common knowledge and beliefs, and that it thus may be the foundation of community.  States are practicing branding (for instance, in advertising as vacation destinations), and countries are, too.

In _A Dog's History of America: How Our Best Friend Explored, Conquered, and Settled a Continent_ (North Point Press), Derr has tried to examine the thousands of years of American dogdom, with many surprises about what dogs have done for us and to us.  Most of us who love dogs as companions aren't used to thinking of them as accomplishing labor for us, but the dog as a mere pet is a relatively recent invention.  For all those millennia before, dogs worked for us, or fed us.  Indeed, our lovable canine friends performed horrendous acts of torture and murder upon us, though it must be said, almost always at the instigation of other humans.  Some readers who look through this volume with a devoted dog at their feet will find much of it hard to take.<br /><br />Dogs first came here around 20,000 years ago, following the humans crossing from Siberia to Alaska.  Not much is known about the Indian dogs because of a lack of history.  They were companions, but they were firstly guards and pack animals.  Christopher Columbus did not have a single dog on his first trip to the Americas, but this was probably the last time boats of exploring or colonizing nations did not bring dogs from Europe.  Columbus himself did not go without them for his second voyage, for the bishop who was in charge of outfitting the fleet added twenty greyhounds and mastiffs for the purpose of making war.  Thus begins a long and distressing history of dogs used as weapons, which will make difficult reading for modern Americans who romanticize their doggies.  The Spanish brought dogs \\"specifically bred and trained to hunt down and disembowel Indians.\\"  In Puritan New England, dogs were used as guards and herd animals, and also to hound Indians.  Before the Civil War, some dogs were trained to hunt runaway slaves, trained specifically to tree or corner a slave, and to maul him if he resisted.  Police used dogs on civil rights protesters, and dogs were tools for torture in the abominable practices at the prison at Abu Ghraib.  Easier reading concerns the changes, starting in the eighteenth century, by which dogs made a transition into the bourgeois home and became valued for loyalty and friendship, and the many stories about dogs beloved by presidents and other famous people.<br /><br />Derr has a huge and complex subject; as he says, the dog embodies \\"unconditional love and cold destruction, domesticity and wildness - opposite forces in continual, dynamic equilibrium.\\"  We are doing better by dogs in many ways, allowing them to be household friends rather than workers, improving their odds against disease, neutering more of them, and gradually reducing the number that have to be euthanized.  We no longer round them up in the summers and shoot them to prevent rabies (or \\"hydrophobia\\").  We are not doing dogs good service by continuing to employ puppy mills, or inbreeding dogs to get \\"pure\\" breeds.  Insistence on breeding extremes have produced dogs that look right by the regulations, but which have serious genetic flaws underneath, including aggressive, nervous, or hyperactive temperaments.  Taking in broad aspects of American social history, Derr has not succeeded (no one could) in putting the dog in its place.  But he has lovingly shown just how many places the dog has had, and through it all has not flinched from showing distinctly darker aspects of the humans who have owned them.him if he resisted.

The fascination with maps did not leave him, through several degrees in fine art and a career in real estate.  He amassed one of the largest private collections of maps, The David Rumsey Historical Map Collection, 150,000 catalogued items stored on the ground floor of his house in San Francisco, which is a working library for people to use.  The items are wall maps, folding maps, globes, map puzzles, and many others.  There is a sampling of the collection in _Cartographica Extraordinaire: The Historical Map Transformed_ (ESRI Press) by David Rumsey and Edith M. Punt, a slim but large-paged, handsome volume containing all kinds of maps concentrating on North America.  They show the history of America, to be sure, but are also a history of mapmaking.  Rumsey has painstakingly put items in his collection on the Internet, so he himself is participating in mapmaking history, and some pages of this beautiful book demonstrate what can be done with maps transformed into pixels.<br /><br />Looking at these lovely maps is to participate a bit in Rumsey's enthusiasm, which one can pick up from his introduction: \\"A map, especially a historical map, ... communicates both above and below the narrow bands of language and observation.\\"  There are only a hundred and twenty or so maps selected here, but besides being beautiful objects to contemplate, they show an amazingly diverse range of ideas: how people explored coasts, or how train schedules were arranged before we had standard time zones, or how we claimed, organized, and sold the land.  For those of us who only look at highway maps, there is an enormous education here.  It is barely possible to mention the subjects of some of these maps; if this subject matter at all interests you, nothing will do except to get the book itself and look through the pages.  For instance, the map by William Clark (of Lewis and Clark) of the trek across western America is here, but in a version issued by Rumsey in celebration of the 200th anniversary of their travels.  It shows the original drawing, seamlessly enclosed within the General Land Survey's first map of the area, which is itself within a 1971 map of a US Geographic Survey National Atlas, which in turn is within a Landsat mosaic from NASA.  The joins of the maps are seamless because they all were turned into computer data that could be massaged in just the right way, and because they are \\"georectified\\" to match up perfectly.  This was hardest to do with Clark's 1814 map, which because of survey and navigation limitations of his time (not because of sloppy mapmaking) had accurate latitudes and distorted longitudes.<br /><br />Rumsey's collection exists physically, of course, but access to the historical maps entailed the basic problem of \\"many hands taking hold of rare and delicate objects.\\"  Digital photography and computer storage have opened his collection for anyone who wants to look, and you don't even have to be there physically.  He has found that magnified images of the maps can show details that were obscure even in the originals.  Astonishingly, information compression has meant that a picture that originally required 400 megabytes can actually be stored in 3% of that size without loss of image quality.  By digitizing his maps and making them available, Rumsey has himself stepped into cartographic history.  This book is a demonstration in book form of what Geographic Information Systems can do, and Rumsey sees the \\"digital wizardry of GIS not as a break from the past and old mapping traditions,\\" but part of those traditions.  If you go to the website, you can look around anywhere; there is no guide.  _Cartographica Extraordinaire_, on the other hand, has the job of demonstrating the progress of history and of information display, and does both engagingly and handsomely.rek across western America is here, but in a version issued by Rumsey in celebration of the 200th anniversary of their travels.

Corporations do, and they know it, and they are ready to pay other companies big money to make sure that the names do more than the job of just being handy labels for their products.  Alex Frankel is a business journalist who has actually formed a company to name things for business, and in _Wordcraft: The Art of Turning Little Words into Big Business_ (Crown), he lets us know how this strange and modern facet of global business works.  A brand is not just a name but \\"... an amalgamation of everything that one thinks about when a particular word is uttered.\\"  If corporations are spending millions of dollars to make sure that the names that are so familiar (Prozac, Amazon, Cuisinart) can become familiar and can subtly carry extra emotional weight, it is a good idea that consumers get to know a little bit about how we are being influenced (led, manipulated) in this way.<br /><br />Frankel's book is an analysis of five brand names: BlackBerry, Accenture, Viagra, the Porsche Cayenne, and IBM's e-business, concentrating on the work of the small firms that name the products of big firms for a fee.  The world's first naming firm has its own apt name, Lexicon, and it was responsible for naming the BlackBerry, the handheld e-mail device of Research in Motion.  \\"BlackBerry\\" is a word with an element of fun to it; it is not, by its own nature, tied to e-mail or messages.  This represents in some ways a liability; another considered word, \\"AirWire\\", might hint of wireless communication, but BlackBerry did not make people think of what the product did.  As a result, advertising dollars had to be spent to make the connection, but it proved to be an easy connection to make.  BlackBerry was launched in 1999, and every message sent by a BlackBerry was labeled as being sent by BlackBerry, further spreading the name.  It became a huge hit at least partially because of the name; some e-mail addicted executives took to calling it the \\"CrackBerry.\\"  The best part of the book is Frankel's depiction of the naming of the products of the pharmaceutical industry, especially the naming of Viagra.  Look at that brand name: vigor, vitality, virile are all there.  It rhymes with Niagara, the famous destination for newlyweds.  (Frankel compares the newer drugs for ED: Cialis doesn't have any particular handle for name interpretation, but Levitra has the \\"vi\\" inside it, and it is connected to levitation, getting it up.)  Viagra was a made up name that caught on quickly.  Phillip Roth lauded it in _The Human Stain_.  It got virile spokesmen to say it was a helpful medicine.  It even entered the _Oxford English Dictionary_.<br /><br />Not everything goes so smoothly.  One of the chapters here examines the Denver case of the Mile High Stadium, whose naming privileges were sold, so that it is supposed to be known as Invesco Field at Mile High.  The public, whose taxes helped pay for the field, didn't like the name, and the editor of the _Denver Post_ refused to allow the \\"official\\" name in the sports pages.  A bar owner who led a civic protest against the name got elected mayor.  There may be larger issues for brand names in the future, as memorable names are manufactured for one product after another; with all that remunerative effort by the naming companies, will we be so inundated with meaning-full brand names that each one will mean less?  It is already easy to talk in corporate names; we Xerox documents, or FedEx them, or we Google for them.  For now, though, the five different namer-named words examined here are getting business done; they are successfully getting the word out.  Frankel has provided an entertaining sidelight on the way corporations do business now, full of juicy anecdotes from executives who take themselves and their naming mission with billion-dollar seriousness.ousness.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

We didn't always have computers, so the effects such as putting fantasy creatures on the screen, like King Kong, had to be done with meticulous stop-motion filming, whereby a movie frame picture would be made of a model Kong, then the model's arm would be slightly raised, one more frame of the movie shot, and the process repeated until a smooth arm movement could be seen when the entire strip of film ran.  It was Willis O'Brien who animated Kong and many other creatures in early movies.  It was Kong who inspired Ray Harryhausen to start making stop-motion films.  In _Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life_ (Billboard Books), Harryhausen and Timothy Dalton tell the story of Harryhausen's entire career, including his humble beginnings.  He was crazy about dinosaurs as a kid, and at the age of thirteen, he was taken by his mother and aunt to see _King Kong_.  He studied up on the movie's techniques afterwards, and started making his own movies, first using a home camera that he could merely hope took only one frame at a time when he tapped it, and then purchasing his own 16 mm camera with a one-frame shift.  He was one of those lucky kids who knew early what he wanted to do in life, and was able to do it; Harryhausen was the special effects wizard behind _Earth vs. The Flying Saucers_, _Jason and the Argonauts_, and _Clash of the Titans_, among many more.  This beautiful book, filled with photographs and drawings to show how the models and effects were made for each of Harryhausen's films (and pictures of the artist's work as a thirteen-year-old as well), is a fascinating record of a career that could only have taken place in a restricted window of time.<br /><br />To start with a clearing of the record: Harryhausen's first model, a cave bear, was covered with fur cut from an old black fur coat hanging in his mother's closet, but despite reports to the contrary, his mother _did_ know all about it and _did_ give her permission beforehand.  This reflects the support his parents gave him toward his youthful enthusiasm, and he is certainly grateful.  Most of the book describes his work for the studios; it devotes pages and pictures to all his films, and he gives detailed descriptions of just how he managed particular shots.  Harryhausen isn't boasting; throughout the book he lets us know what he thought worked and what didn't, what he is proud of and what he winces at.  If stop-motion is no longer going to be an art form, it is good that we have this documentation of what he actually accomplished, for the complexity of his creations and the way they were shot is astonishing.  For instance, the Hydra in _Jason_ not only had a serpentine body and a double tail requiring their own movements, but also seven heads.  In every frame, the model's movements might be only a millimeter, but there were sometimes more than thirty movements to do.  He would have to remember for each head whether it was in the process of going up, down, right, or left, if the mouth was opening or closing, if the neck was flexing, and so on.  Astonishingly, he was so in tune with his creation that he did not keep notes on what each head was doing, except if he were taking a break at the end of a work period.<br /><br />Harryhausen has real affection for his creations.  He has used real animals in some films, like an iguana made to look like a giant lizard in _One Million Years BC_.  The trainer in charge of the iguanas was ready to use an electric prod to rouse the usually torpid lizards, but Harryhausen would not allow any cruelty, so action could only be obtained by a little prodding.  Nonetheless, it was a lot harder to get the iguanas to move in just the way he needed compared to his obedient stop-motion models; he says that using models would have been more cost-effective and more realistic, too.  He refuses to call his creations monsters; they aremostly creatures who are simply out of place.  Of the tyrannosaurus in _The Valley of Gwangi_, he writes that he felt sorry for him, \\"... because all he wanted to do was live his life and eat a few people along the way.\\"  When he had to dismantle one creature to use its armature for another in a succeeding feature, he confesses, \\"It always breaks my heart to have to cannibalize my models.  It's like losing a close friend.\\"  Gentle, self-deprecating humor is a hallmark of all the chapters here, no matter how technical the descriptions become at times.  This is a handsome, large format book suitable for the coffee table; however, along with the beautiful illustrations, the written record of work here to show how creature features were made before the computers took over will be enjoyed by any fantasy film fan.are mostly creatures who are simply out of place.

The answer is correct as far as it goes.  Most of us would probably also think that having discovered how penicillin could fight infection, Fleming got the word out and manufacture of the miracle drug began, to the benefit of all humankind.  The truth is that Fleming discovered the mold's antibiotic potential in 1928, and the drug went nowhere.  He was not able to find a way to extract the active component of the mold and so he never made any use of it.  He gave up trying in 1935.  It was only three years later that a researcher unconnected with Fleming got curious about the mold's potential, and thought it would be worth investigation by his team at Oxford.  Credit is given where credit is due in _The Mold in Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle_ (Henry Holt) by Eric Lax.  Without the Oxford researchers, to whom Fleming was unconnected, the benefits of the drug would not have been available to Allied troops during the war, and Lax shows that developing the drug was a real wartime effort.<br /><br />It was only by sheer luck in 1938 that the brilliant German biochemist Ernst Chain found Fleming's paper, and was immediately interested.  Chain worked within the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford.  He was part of a team that had been assembled by Howard Florey, an Australian physician devoted to research, a man who combined acute scientific instincts with skillful capacity to manage scientific team effort.  Also recruited was Norman Heatley, a wizard in the lab with equipment and microscopic observation and analysis.  It was this team that gave the world penicillin as a working drug.  Throughout the book, Lax has put in reminders of military developments as the Oxford team made its progress.  A picture shows boffins in the decidedly unscientific effort of digging an air raid shelter behind their research facility.  Within the pages are descriptions of getting about by bicycles in the black-out, having to make do on rations (and amazement at the good food that was available when they traveled internationally), and worrying about what to do if there should be not just a Nazi air attack but an actual invasion.  The title of the book comes from contemplation of that possibility.  The team planned that if an invasion of their lab was imminent, they would destroy the lab and burn their research papers.  The most valuable part of the research, the mold itself, was smeared into the coats of Dr. Florey and four colleagues, where it could be covertly carried if they had to flee the country.<br /><br />The patents were lost to America, but the Nobels went to the British.  Fleming, Florey, and Chain got the prize in 1945.  Heatley, the author argues, with his tireless and inspired tinkering, was neglected.  His contribution was belatedly recognized in 1990 when Oxford University gave him its first ever honorary doctor of medicine degree.  The real lack of recognition, of course, is that Fleming in most people's minds is the only one to get the credit.  Part of the reason for this is that Florey's team worked in quiet determination and did not seek publicity.  When news of the effectiveness of penicillin became a topic in the popular press, Fleming made himself available for comments, and though he acknowledged the work of Florey's team, he did little to counter the impression that the team was working on his discovery and even at his behest.  Florey, always idealistic, was horrified that publicity would raise the hopes of patients who could not expect to get any of the then minute quantities of the drug, so he refused to meet with reporters.  Fleming gained publicity, and thus powerful patrons, while Florey and his team were obscure at the start and remain so.  This is an illuminating story that reminds us that there was a time when people used to die because of being scratched by a thorn (and with resistance ever a problem, such times may come again).  It is a fascinating tale full of chance and error that affect significant outcomes, and of foibles and mistakes as all-too-human scientists attempt and finally achieve a miracle.problem, such times may come again).

It wasn't always so.  Maybe because lobsters were so insect-like, settlers to New England shunned them as a food that if it had to be served, was served to prisoners.  Lobsters were emergency food, and if there were no emergency, they were better used as fertilizer.  In a terrific book of lobster lore, _The Secret Life of Lobsters: How Fishermen and Scientists are Unraveling the Mysteries of Our Favorite Crustacean_, Trevor Corson says that it wasn't until the nineteenth century that lowly lobster meat became desirable to urbanites and the commercial lobster fishery began.  The lobsters, undoubtedly, would not say this has been a good thing, and while they are the stars of a book full of enormous amounts of curious information about their habits, Corson has spent just as many pages on the humans for whom lobsters have been an economic or academic boon.  The lobster fishermen, some of whom have inherited the career for generations, are rugged sailors with tough lives and an unmatchable, practical knowledge about what lobsters do.  The other group of humans are the scientists who are trying to figure out the scale from why individual lobsters act the way they do to why populations of the creatures shift the way they do.  \\"For nearly a century the relationship between scientists and lobstermen in Maine had been one of open hostility,\\" Corson writes.  But there has been overfishing in other fisheries, like cod, and the two groups are newly united (though they do not always agree) to keep the lobster population healthy.<br /><br />The book's segments on lobsters and humans alternate, and with all the connections between the two, it isn't hard to find parallels.  \\"There was a sense on this little island that these lobstermen had some gender ratio issues, some jockeying for mates,\\" he writes, after telling about the complicated sex lives of the lobsters themselves.  The scientists have sorted much of this out, but the lobstermen knew how important breeding was.  For years, they have cut a v-notch into the tail of every female they caught with eggs.  This marks her as a breeder, and if she is caught again, even after shedding her eggs, the notch remains to show she must be thrown back to have another go.  It is illegal to sell a notched lobster.  There was an unexpected boom in lobster populations and harvests starting in the last decade, and lobstermen have tried to claim the credit for influencing and following Maine's conservation measures.  Federal lobster scientists aren't so sure; mathematical models indicate that there is overfishing.  The enormous complexity of these issues are made plain here, even if the answers are not.  A great deal of research is pinned on where the female carries the eggs glued to her, and what happens to the larvae after the eggs hatch.  Each larva goes through a series of strange transformations that settle it from a free-swimmer to a bottom dweller.  During one of the stages (confusingly named the \\"superlobster\\"), it swims through the water with its claws outstretched (like Superman), the only time a lobster can swim forward.  It lives this way for a couple of weeks, and when it molts again, it is a baby, inch-long lobster.  The superlobster has the capacity to choose a bottom environment on which it will make the big change, and it may be that changes in the shelter capacity of the environment make for changes in lobster populations.<br /><br />There are such interesting human characters here, so that the foundation of the book, lobster biology, is fully expanded into the scientific, social, and economic spheres.  There is the lobsterman who never ate a lobster; as an infant, he had a reaction to the steam from a boiling lobster dinner, and it was discovered that he was allergic to proteins in lobster muscle.  There is the professor who could not match her academic schedule with her need toget to the coast at low tides to look for lobster babies, so she became a waitress at a lobster house.  The first thing she did there was to give her boss a schedule of when she would have to be off during the next year, based on the tide calendar.  There are the scientists who built Robo-lobsters, automated robots that creep around pools in frank imitation of the olfactory hunting that lobsters do to find prey; perhaps someday such contraptions will be used to sniff out mines.  Through it all are lobstermen and scientists who value the creatures for different reasons, but almost all of whom enjoy a lobster meal; one of the professors teaches lobster anatomy to students at dinner.  The intense study reflected here of these surprisingly complicated creatures does not seem to make anyone admire the lobsters enough to avoid eating them.  As one scientist said, there is a huge bonus at the end of a day studying lobsters: you can eat them for dinner.  Corson's engrossing book ends fittingly (after a discussion of whether the hapless prospective dinner can feel pain) with a great recipe for a lobster feast.eed to get to the coast at low tides to look for lobster babies, so she became a waitress at a lobster house.

How Candy Was Born	The Rabelaisian story of Candy Christian was told in the novel Candy and was one of those \\"dirty\\" books, like _Portnoy's Complaint_ or _Lolita_ to which it is often compared, that people could read, and let others know they read, without embarrassment.  Bursting into American print in the sixties, Candy had a grand, scandalous run on the bestseller list.  The book had its share of legal problems because of its ribaldry, but the sixties were a time of sexual openness and the way had been cleared by courts which had already decided that such books as _Lady Chatterly's Lover_ and the _Tropic_ books of Henry Miller could not be prohibited.  The real legal problems for Candy were not due to its supposed impropriety, but its proprietary issues.  The exceptionally complicated legal determination of ownership of the book, a tussle between its two authors, the original French publisher, and assorted interested bystanders, is told in full detail in _The Candy Men: The Rollicking Life and Times of the Notorious Novel Candy_ (Arcade Publishing) by Nile Southern.  The story of the book's genesis and the arguments over ownership (some not completely settled until long after the main characters herein had died) is told in quoted letters and legal documents, and sometimes in personal detail, since the author is the son of one of Candy's authors.<br /><br />_Candy_ was originally the brainchild of Terry Southern, a young writer who had a healthy interest in attractive and generous girls he met in Paris and Greenwich Village.  Southern had started the novel, but had gotten more interested in writing another one, _The Magic Christian_.  In 1957, missing his deadlines with his Parisian publisher Maurice Girodias, he began sharing bits of it by letter with his beat pal Mason Hoffenberg, who joined in authorship.  The idea of the novel had been sold to Girodias to be part of his DB (Dirty Book) catalogue within the Olympia Press.  He specialized in pornography that could be sold to English-speaking tourists.  He commissioned _Candy_ as he had many other novels, for a one-time payment of a few hundred dollars, paid in fractions as he received the chapters.  Like some of its illustrious Olympia Press predecessors (including _Lolita_, _Candy_, released in 1958, was more than mass-production porn.  When it came to republication in America, Girodias wanted his slice of profits.  Distrust set in, and even paranoia from Hoffenberg, and a decade of claims, counter-claims, and hurt followed.  Southern went into the movies, with some large successes, like co-authorship of _Dr. Strangelove_.  He said farewell to much of bohemian life and to his junkie companions.  Hoffenberg became obsessed with his fair share of _Candy_, and with the lack of attention to him as coauthor while Southern continued to write and remain in the press.  Girodias scratched for anything he could salvage, since his publishing house descended into bankruptcy.<br /><br />Putnam eventually published in hardcover in 1964, with the peculiar stipulation that it would be freed from obligation to pay the authors if a pirated edition came out.  Not one pirated edition, but seven from California alone, came out, some in time to benefit from Putnam's extensive publicity.  Pirates used the Olympia edition word-for-word, because it had the cloudy European copyright, and each bragged that they followed the original text.  The pirates and Putnam made money, as did the lawyers, but the three principals wound up with a meager $9,000 to divide among themselves, the \\"bitter and paltry spoils from a dissatisfying war,\\" as Nile Southern says.  The book was supposed to be unfilmable, but that has never stopped Hollywood; in 1968, _Candy_ the movie was released, to terrible reviews.  Low on actual titillation, it made money, largely due to a cast including Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Charles Aznavour, Ringo Starr, and James Coburn. It has since come out on DVD as a kitschy curiosity.  Thenovel was put out in a handsome edition for the Book-of-the-Month Club.  So _Candy_ the book lives happily ever after, and remains amusing although far less shocking than when it first came out.  The three principals, however, did not live happily, at least in part due to the Candy fights, and all died in relative obscurity.  _The Candy Men_ thus turns out to be a sad book with lots of funny stories about how a really funny book came into being.  Anyone who values _Candy_ will be fascinated with this complicated biography of the novel.The novel was put out in a handsome edition for the Book-of-the-Month Club.

There has been a resultant boom (no bust yet) in books about the boom and bust.  Can we stand one more?  How about one by a serious professional book reviewer who goes to work for Amazon to pump up the \\"content\\" of the Amazon.com website?  Sure, _Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.Com Juggernaut_ (The New Press) by James Marcus, has all the trimmings of books already in the genre: weird personalities afflicted by irrational affluence, ever-shifting work routines and schedules fueled by Starbucks, ambivalence about the worth of impersonal e-commerce, and of course, the deflation of stock options that turns paper millionaires into just regular yuppies.  _Amazonia_ has a lot going for it, though.  It is beautifully written, amused and sad, with an authoritative view from someone who was there at the beginning but no authoritative insistence on what it all means.  It has welcome views of one of the most curious of entrepreneurs, Jeff Bezos, the irrepressible, inscrutable founder.  It is a story of the inside workings of one of the most famous companies on Earth, told by one who was swept up in it but because he was hired for \\"content,\\" remained a detached outsider as the management types tried new ways of pulling the \\"revenue levers\\" (that's official Amazon jargon).<br /><br />Marcus had been a translator and a freelance book critic.  He was interviewed to come on board Amazon in 1996, and was the fifty-fifth employee hired (a further subtitle of the book is \\"A Tale of Internet Euphoria by Employee #55\\"); the operation truly was just starting up, because two years later it would have 8,000 employees.  He was hired basically to write brief reviews of books that would appear on the site.  It would be far more power than he had ever wielded as a book reviewer before, but he didn't like the idea when it was pitched to him:  \\"I'm pimping for literature via the Internet.\\"  The wages were paltry, but the stock options were supposed to be spectacular.  And on paper, they were.  He became, on paper, a millionaire from book reviewing; on paper, during the NASDAQ exuberance, he had stock options worth $9 million.  It didn't last, of course, but he didn't do too badly in the end.  But it's not about the money.  Marcus convincingly recounts how he did not turn into a snooty millionaire or a crestfallen loser, but it's the work, not the prospective wealth or loss thereof, that is what's important here.  Marcus's real job, writing the reviews, was one he really liked.  He worked there for five years, and wrote thousands of them.  Many were \\"the haiku of book criticism,\\" the 45-word review.  He loved calling attention to good titles: \\"There was nothing more satisfying than nudging a noncommercial title into the limelight.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the job didn't keep its high attractiveness any more than the stock options did.  The vigorously powerful editorial team was derailed by (surprise!) automated computer programs, under the label \\"personalization.\\"  Instead of reviews for the customer to browse, each customer made (by purchasing similar items) a personal store.  A personalization engine, rather than an human editor, would make a customer's home page, and Marcus even had a John Henry-like contest to see which was more effective in sales.  \\"Let the rotten little robot trawl through the database for hidden affinities: it wasn't going to beat this steam-drivin' man.\\"  Marcus lost.  Eventually, personalization, driven by the MBAs Jeff was importing, took over.  Reviews by staff of the books themselves ceased to be important, as Amazon shifted the emphasis to reviews written by customers, and customers were invited to vote on the helpfulness of the reviews, and the results produced a ranking of reviewers.  In a wry episode near the end of the book, Marcus started submitting customer reviews under an alias, and won a $50 gift certificate prize for his work, which he eventually had to give back.  Thus ended his foray into \\"the vox pop,\\" the new way of doing things, and soon after he moved on to return to the more familiar bricks-and-mortar, paper-and-ink world.  He had fun, made a little money, and maybe turned some customers on to good books, but with that all over, there is a mildly rueful tone to this sprightly, funny memoir.  He loved literature, he had to do business, and it is sad he could not have found a closer match., which he eventually had to give back.

However, he also would have meant a giant who has, almost three centuries later, become almost an unknown within the history of astronomy.  In _The Transit of Venus: The Brief, Brilliant Life of Jeremiah Horrocks, Father of British Astronomy_ (Weidenfeld & Nicolson), Peter Aughton, who has written before on the voyages of Captain Cook and on Newton, puts Horrocks into his rightful place.  It would be too much to say that he gives us a full picture of Horrocks and his work, for the mass of materials about the astronomer is just too meager.  However, Horrocks was a brilliant astronomical observer and theoretician, and Newton knew it then as we should now.<br /><br />There was in June 2004 a transit of Venus, only the fifth since Horrocks watched his in 1639.  A transit occurs when Venus seems to cross the face of the Sun, and was important in those days because it could be used to calculate how far the Sun was from the Earth.  He studied Kepler's work at college in Cambridge, and trusted Kepler, but not blindly; he discovered that Kepler, who had correctly predicted a 1631 transit of Venus, had mistakenly missed a transit that was coming in 1639.  Horrocks only realized this with a month to spare, but he was ready to trace the planet crossing the Sun; he did so by training his telescope on the Sun and projecting the picture upon a screen within a darkened room.  It was his mathematical analysis of the movements and timing of what he had seen that enabled him to confirm that Venus was moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun, just as Kepler's laws had implied.  However, a clear view of the planet crossing the solar disk showed it to be much smaller than Kepler had thought, and the calculated distance between the Earth and the Sun was far larger than any previous astronomer had come close to considering.  Copernicus had estimated the distance to be 7.5 million kilometers, Kepler 22.1, and Horrocks weighed in with 95.4.  Even then, he was well below the real figure of 149, but it can be said without exaggeration that he was the first man who had an inkling of how big the solar system really was.<br /><br />Horrocks wrote up his account of the transit, and also went on to show that the Moon tracked an elliptical, not circular, path around the Earth, although the path of the Moon wobbled irregularly due to the gravity of the Sun.  He also showed that Saturn and Jupiter were vastly larger than the Earth.  Astonishingly, he made these discoveries when he was only twenty-two; only a year later in 1641 he was dead.  There is no evidence about the cause of his death.  His account of his researches was not published until 1662, and he was belatedly recognized as a genius by the new Royal Society.  His work was revolutionary at the time he did it, but was not as influential as it could have been, if he had been within the mainstream of British science rather than observing and theorizing near Liverpool, if he had lived longer, and if Britain were not torn by its Civil War.  Newton, in his monumental _Principia_, gave special credit to Horrocks for divining the elliptical orbit of the Moon.  His influence might be small, but his importance as an observer and as a theoretician (those qualities are not often so well combined in one person) is clear.  As much as can be known about him is in Aughton's necessarily brief but admiring review, from which readers will get a good idea of how astronomy was done at the time, and a welcome introduction to an original thinker.thought, and the calculated distance between the Earth and the Sun was far larger than any previous astronomer had come close to considering.

This was in some ways unsurprising.  The Egyptians used all sorts of spices to preserve the body so that the soul might wander back into it.  But regarded historically, this is an astonishing use of pepper; the peppercorns were not any African species, not anything Ramses's lands had grown.  The only source at the time was the tropical south of India; there must have been a previously unsuspected direct or circuitous trade route between the regions.  No details about the route can now be known, except that it was part of the lucrative spice trade that for centuries powered economies and exploration.  In _Spice: The History of a Temptation_ (Knopf), Jack Turner includes the story of the first known consumer of pepper along with hundreds of other facts as a way of looking at a part of human history that was vital and has been influential into our own times, but is now merely curious.  Spices are high on the list of goods that have made the modern world.<br /><br />Spices were costly and mysterious, and people thought that they came from Paradise itself, the place in the East from which Adam and Eve had been banished.  It was to gain spices that Columbus sailed, and spices he did bring back, but they were disappointments; that did not stop the continued search for them, and the resultant expansion of the world.  Turner shows that spices were not really used to help make old meat palatable; fresh meat was cheaper than spices.  But they were used to improve wine, a use that became unnecessary after bottle and cork technology came in the sixteenth century.  Though spices were not really responsible for warding off decomposition, they were thought vital for warding off disease.  In medieval medical logic, sweet fragrances might drive off the bad vapors, and spices (most thought of as hot and dry) might drive off a cold (thought of as a disease of cold and wet).  Millions of spam e-mails every day are sent to tell how to enlarge male sexual equipment; those who believe in such cures would do well to invest in the simpler, cheaper, and just as effective formulas given here from the chapter of the ancient treatise, _The Perfumed Garden_, \\"Prescriptions for Increasing the Dimension of Small Members and Making Them Splendid\\"  The priapic value of spices is just one reason the church has had wildly ambivalent notions about them.  There is scriptural documentation that the God of the Bible likes to be sent good smells, as have many gods before him, but Turner's quotations from theologians indignant over the eagerness of their parishioners (and, gasp, their clerics) to partake in spicy foods are among the most amusing parts of the book.<br /><br />Ministers just don't care anymore about the theological implications of spicy food.  The reduction of their interest in such things parallels the reduction in importance of spice as a focus of world economic effort.  It became easier to import spices, and more importantly, it was possible to transplant them to places where it was easy to turn them into simple cash crops on farms.  In medieval times, the rich showed off by giving feasts that had every course heavily spiced, but jewelry and houses (for instance) eventually filled the role of ostentatious consumption.  When spices became cheap, it became a virtue to use just a little of them, and that to bring out inherent flavors in the main ingredients.  When anyone could purchase them, spices lost not only economic cachet, but also the sort of mystical qualities that, say, Columbus sailed for.

It is news, but it is not new; the same thing was happening in the seventeenth century.  In _Fallen Order: Intrigue, Heresy, and Scandal in the Rome of Galileo and Caravaggio_ (Grove Press), Karen Liebreich has found a scandal of priestly pedophilia that ruined and eventually closed a Catholic teaching order, the Piarists.  The order was eventually restarted, and still exists.  It is justifiably proud of making contributions to education (Mozart, Mendel, and Goya, to name just a few, were products of Piarist schools).  It is proud of its founder, Father Jos&eacute; de Calasanz, who was eventually beatified and became the patron saint of Catholic schools.  It is quiet about the scandal that caused the suppression of the order, however, and Liebreich only stumbled upon the story in an ancient Florentine archive when she was doing a doctorate on public education.  Looking through the thousands of letters from Calasanz (she grimly notes that there are no jokes and no lightness within them), she came across a euphemism: _il vitio pessimo_, \\"the worst sin.\\"  Her curiosity up, she went through difficult searches at the Vatican Secret Archive; the Inquisition Archive only opened six years ago, and she thereupon hunted there, too.  There is much more to the story than pedophilic priests and a cover up, but sadly, the patron saint of Catholic schools quite clearly performed the same sort of cover-up that has brought disgrace to his contemporary equivalents.<br /><br />St. Joseph Calasanz had seen the need for schools for poor children.  He founded the Piarist Order in 1592, insisting that his Piarists had to live austere lives, dressing simply, wearing sandals in the winter, eating bad food and little of it.  The rules included that they could not swim, play games, play guitar, or kiss even their mothers.  The rules were broken with zeal by Father Stefano Cherubini, originally headmaster of the school in Naples.  Father Stefano enjoyed sodomizing the pupils, and this became known to Calasanz, who could do little since Father Stefano came from a powerful family of lawyers.  Calasanz therefore promoted Father Stefano, to get him away from the scene of the crime, citing only his luxurious diet and failure to attend prayers.  However, he knew what Cherubini had really been up to, and he wrote that the sole aim of the plan \\"... is to cover up this great shame in order that it does not come to the notice of our superiors.\\"  Cherubini was even made head of the order in 1643 and the elderly Calasanz was pushed aside.  Upon this appointment, Calasanz publicly documented Cherubini's long pattern of child molestation, a pattern that he had known about for years.  Even this did not block Cherubini's appointment, but other members of the order were indignant about it, although they may have objected to Cherubini's more overt shortcomings.  With such dissention, the Vatican took the easy course of suppressing the order.<br /><br />Liebreich has written a strong yet detached and unemotional account of the events, with a broad look to political and religious forces of the times.  She knows that 21st century horror about how priests abuse children is not going to be the same as supposed 17th century sensitivity about it, but she also shows that this does not really matter.  The church had clear teachings on the subject at the time, but concentrated more on how pedophilia endangered the souls of the priests who engaged in it; throughout the correspondence in the book, Calasanz and other priests fretted about public scandal first, and offense to God second, with no mention at all to the wrong done to the victims of the abuse.  In one of the parallels that Liebreich effortlessly draws to our own times in her final chapter, Pope John Paul II issued a quiet papal directive in January 2002 to say that priests were afflicted by these sins of their brethren and that such scandals made other fine priests look bad; the victims are still being ignored.  The question of whether the church could have made a difference if it had learned from the Piarist scandal may be argued back and forth, but that it did not learn and that it continued to shield priests who habitually victimized their young charges is sadly beyond dispute.ffortlessly draws to our own times in her final chapter, Pope John Paul II issued a quiet papal directive in January 2002 to say that priests were afflicted by these sins of their brethren and that such scandals made other fine priests look bad; the victims are still being ignored.

He did not just dream, but he acted.  He was an inventor, and he meant for his great invention to become the revolutionary spark to bring humankind into the rosy and egalitarian future.  His invention: the most advanced and only reliable submarine of his time, the mid-nineteenth century.  In _Monturiol's Dream: The Extraordinary Story of the Submarine Inventor Who Wanted to Save the World_ (Pantheon), Matthew Stewart has written an entertaining biography of the forgotten submariner, whose name is absent even from many histories of the submarine.  There are many contingencies that conspired to keep him an unknown, and many tiny events that could have gone differently so that his invention would have descendants and we would know him as \\"The Father of the Modern Submarine.\\"  As it turned out, he was one of those inventors that didn't get the recognition he deserved, and his life only seems successful in retrospect.  Nonetheless, he was a fabulous dreamer, thinker, and tinkerer, and deserves the rescue from oblivion provided by this volume.<br /><br />Monturiol, born in 1819, was a surprise entry into the submarine inventing game.  By 1856, he was \\"pretty much your typical utopian socialist revolutionary.\\"  He was not an engineer.  He had much to learn, teaching himself the chemistry by which he could produce oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the air.  He developed thick glass for portholes, and once he realized how dark it was down there, he developed an external lighting system that worked just fine.  He was the first to insist on double hulling for a sub; the external one protected the craft and gave it a hydrodynamic shape (these were good-looking, streamlined vessels that resembled giant fish), while the inner one had the safety sealing to protect the crew.  It could dive to 20 meters, although with his perfectionism for safety, he made the craft far more pressure-resistant than that.  It was steerable, and was propelled by its crew of sixteen cranking a shaft connected to a propeller.  The propulsion system was not up to Monturiol's standards, as it could not reach what he thought was an acceptable minimum speed of three knots.  When he realized this, he looked for another way of powering the ship; electrical motors (which would be used on the first military subs of the twentieth century) were not yet feasible, and steam had the hazard of fire within the confines of the vessel.  Monturiol performed thousands of experiments to find a heat-producing chemical reaction that would generate steam and also produce oxygen as a useful waste product.<br /><br />It was a brilliant solution that never got a good try.  Monturiol, never a good business planner, eventually had no funds for further prototypes.  He had spent years of trying, and had sacrificed parts of his utopian dream to bring his machine into reality: a pacifist, he had tried to get military support; a communist, he had tried for capitalistic backing; an internationalist, he had tried to mine local Catalan enthusiasm.  It did no good in the end, as eventually _Ictineo II_ went for scrap, breaking the inventor's heart.  He scraped by for himself and his family by taking hack writing jobs and then a job in a brokerage house, eventually working his way up to being a cashier.  He continued to invent; one of his later inventions, a method of preserving meat for export, ought to have made him millions, but it only made millions for the man who stole it from him.  When submarines became practical in the next century, engineers had to re-learn many of the ideas Monturiol had pioneered, so his actual influence was slight.  Nonetheless, after a century of neglect, Barcelona has a street sculpture of his sub, and a life-size mock-up to show just what the graceful craft looked like, and a street named after the inventor.  Now with this admiring and well-illustrated biography, Monturiol further takes his belated but rightful place within the ranks of those who developed the submarine.takes his belated but rightful place within the ranks of those who developed the submarine.  <br />	2004-08-18

But prospective patients, and the eagerness to be free of ailments, long preceded scientific study of disease and the discovery of such things as bacteria.  Originally, illnesses were thought to be produced by demons who hated us, or by gods who loved us, sending them for our correction.  (Such an attitude continues in those who insist that illnesses such as AIDS are among God's tools for reforming us.)  We are used to medical breakthroughs these days, but just as the greatest of technological steps was our ancient harnessing of fire, the greatest of our medical advances was the realization that disease was not supernatural.  It had patterns of cause and could be controlled at least to some extent by physical, rather than spiritual, steps toward eradication.  These assertions by the ancient Greeks and how their ideas of illness and cure were transferred throughout the ancient world are the subjects of _Ancient Medicine_ (Routledge) by Vivian Nutton.  A professor of the history of medicine, Nutton is extremely well qualified to make this large and academic summary; the many quotations here from ancient Greek and Latin, for instance, are almost all his own translations.  There are plenty of footnotes, and references to ancient texts which have not been previously available, but this is a book that is surprisingly lively and readable for an academic tome.<br /><br />If people know anything about ancient medicine, they know the name Hippocrates, and of course Nutton has much to say about him here.  Unfortunately, most of what we know is wrong, or at least uncorroborated.  He almost undoubtedly did not write the famous Oath of Hippocrates, and much of what is accepted as his writing is actually the writings of many others within his school of thought.  From him, physicians for centuries drew the theory of the \\"Four Humors,\\" the concept that what the body evacuated when it was ill (blood, phlegm, bile, and black bile) indicated excesses or deficiencies of one or more of the humors.  There were other schools of medicine, however, and though they often complemented rather than contradicted each other, there was a good deal of public discussion and give-and-take between them.  Strongly motivating Nutton's study is concentration on Galen of Pergamum, a Hippocratic physician who made his name in Rome in the second century CE.  He wrote millions of words about his theories and practice, pugnaciously contending against other schools of thought.  A doctor's authority only partially came from his adherence to a particular school.  Galen knew this; he stressed over and over again the importance of gaining a patient's confidence, the need for careful observation, and the importance of listening carefully to what the patient says.  Any ancient doctor, and any modern one, could profit from such advice.<br /><br />There is here, indeed, much to consider about the similarities of medicine past and present.  For instance, ancient doctors paid special attention to urging their clients to adopt particular diets and forms of exercise (and probably had as little success in the matter as current doctors).  Galen stressed the importance of doing anatomical dissections oneself, rather than being like \\"a steersman who navigates solely from a book,\\" but many of his contemporaries disagreed with his dismissal of book learning.  The controversy has continued two millennia on, with some arguing that the medical student's traditional dissection of the cadaver can be replaced by, say, interactive videos.  Of course, some of the \\"cures\\" described here will make readers quite satisfied to be living in the 21st century.  There was a treatment for scoliosis, for instance, known as succussion, which consisted of tying a patient upside down on a ladder and then dropping the ladder from a roof.  The author describing this procedure says it is good for drawing a crowd whowant to see a spectacle and don't care about results; but he also says he hasn't seen any patient benefit from it.  Full of descriptions of working doctors and ailing patients, _Ancient Medicine_ is a colorful and authoritative examination of the origins of western medical practice.who want to see a spectacle and don't care about results; but he also says he hasn't seen any patient benefit from it.

It comes even before the rest of the amendment promises free speech, press, and assembly, indicating that the Founding Fathers, who were of diverse religious views, had a high fear of the historical complications that had resulted when governments sponsored religions or regulated them.  (It was preceded even by an article within the Constitution itself that forbade religious tests as a qualification for public office.)  Just what these sixteen influential words mean has been debated endlessly since they were written; indeed, they contain a paradox, for if there are no laws regarding religion, then there is nothing to debate.  Franklyn S. Haiman, a professor who describes himself as \\"a First Amendment junkie,\\" has given a fine summary of the importance of these words and how the courts and eventually the Supreme Court have interpreted them into laws we can live by in _Religious Expression and the American Constitution_ (Michigan State University Press).  It is an extremely complex story, told here in an engaging way by examining different cases and decisions within chapters having to do with specific arenas like religious expression within public schools or within public spaces.  Haiman's book is a perfect summary for the historic understanding of the contemporary state of religious expression in America.<br /><br />When Calvinist Puritans had had enough discrimination in the Old World, they came to the New and began themselves to discriminate against others.  Only four of the original thirteen colonies never had an established church.  Once the revolution had been won, governments did not automatically withdraw from the religion game.  It took a few decades for some states to disestablish the Anglican church, and even then they often retained a prohibition that only protestant believers could hold office.  Conflicts caused by the eventual amendment have different sources.  There are difficulties in the words themselves; what is a religion (does it include the groups following patently fraudulent charlatans?) or what is free exercise (does it include keeping one's children away from doctors so that they can only get the benefits of religious healing?)?  Those who wrote the amendment could have had no concept of current medicine or media.  The greatest problem, because it reflects a difference in judicial philosophy, is whether the amendment (and the rest of the Constitution, of course) should be interpreted with special attention to what the signers of the document would have meant, or should be interpreted as a \\"living document\\" which might mean something different in current society.  The examples given here are thought-provoking and will invite the reader to try to second guess what the Supreme Court should have done in many diverse cases.<br /><br />As long as believers attempt to get the government further to sponsor their particular beliefs, it is to be expected that these battles will continue, and that Haiman will have to revise his book before long.  He won't have to change the many useful appendices, however, which include writings of Roger Williams, John Locke, and Thomas Jefferson, as well as parts of important decisions to which the text refers.  Haiman's book is a thorough and entertaining introduction to contemporary issues, and anyone reading it will get a close view of how separation of church and state has been so important to our country.  An aspect of the story is disconcerting, however.  Those who have sat on the Supreme Court represent inarguably some of the best legal minds our nation has produced, and yet no one can be pleased at the long list of 5 to 4 decisions regarding religious matters that were bitterly argued, or in which those who cast votes for the winning side could not agree upon the basis for their decision.  It is a messy way of making decisions that are at the heart of our nation's history and society.  Given the strong feelings on the issues described herein, they will be forever debatable.

One dinosaur scientist called it \\"one of the high-water marks of natural history illustration in the 20th century.\\"  It depicts 350 million years of life on the land, and at its end, near Zallinger's signature, is a tiny, mousy mammal called _Cimolestes_. Twenty years later, Zallinger painted _Age of Mammals_, a smaller work, on canvas, to show what _Cimolestes_ and its fellow mammals had wrought once the dinosaurs left the world's stage.  In _Beasts of Eden: Walking Whales, Dawn Horses, and Other Enigmas of Mammal Evolution_ (University of California Press), David Rains Wallace has used Zallinger's mammal picture (for which he has great reverence) as a starting point to discuss various aspects of our understanding of those non-reptilian extinct beasts, the ones that are closer to our own species.  Prehistoric mammals don't get so much coverage in books, and certainly not so much in movies, as the dinosaurs, and Wallace has attempted to restore the balance.<br /><br />Mammals first evolved around the same time the dinosaurs did, more than 200 million years ago, but they remained small and inconspicuous.  There were small reptiles, too, but the biggies are the ones that everyone remembers, and everyone forgets the little mammals, too.  This is not the fault of the paleontologists whom Wallace profiles here, willful, disputatious, and jealous experts who felt the creatures were important enough to argue strenuously about.  Scientific antagonism in the Americas was exemplified by the astonishingly vituperative feud between Othneil Marsh, America's first paleontology professor, and Edward D. Cope, who spent his career fighting Marsh's attempt to monopolize paleontology.  Each refused to acknowledge the research of the other except to ridicule it, and they attempted to sabotage each other's expeditions in the western deserts, and climaxed their feud by accusing each other of plagiarism and theft in volleyed letters to _The New York Herald_ in 1870.  Underneath this superficial, unseemly, and malicious competition was a serious scientific divide.  Marsh's work on mammals provided the best substantiation for Darwin's evolutionary ideas, while Cope championed a neo-Lamarckism that claimed that animals changed due to some sort of conscious will to bring themselves into new environments and abilities.<br /><br />Some controversies detailed here, like plate tectonics, have been resolved, and some, like punctuated equilibria, still cause disputes.  Through the controversies are a big part of the story of how we came to a current understanding of prehistoric mammals, Wallace has also concentrated on the entertaining personalities and peculiarities of important paleontologists.  For instance, the famous explorer of the Gobi Desert, Roy Chapman Andrews, explained that most people think hardships are essential to an explorer's existence, but said, \\"I don't believe in hardships.  They are a great nuisance.\\"  His fleet of custom-built cars and trucks were so well supplied that members of the expedition gained weight the longer they were exploring.  Some of the details here will be daunting for those with no reference books; there is no chart, for instance, of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and other eras.  There is a richness of detail and history, though, to show just how these strange beasts, though less cinematic than the giant reptiles that preceded them, have changed paleontological thought and affected our understanding of evolution.idicule it, and they attempted to sabotage each other's expeditions in the western deserts, and climaxed their feud by accusing each other of plagiarism and theft in volleyed letters to _The New York Herald_ in 1870.

We are likely to praise the person who skimps on sleep in order to get the duties of the rest of life, &quot;real life,&quot; done. Scientific sleep research was not even considered until recent decades. Correcting this sort of neglect of a biological necessity is one of the purposes of _Counting Sheep: The Science and Pleasures of Sleep and Dreams_ (Thomas Dunne Books) by Paul Martin. The deliberate neglect of sleep manifests itself in many ways, as if, Martin writes, we all somehow &quot;ceased to exist at night.&quot; There is an enormous literature about sleep, not just the scientific studies that have been conducted over the past five decades, but also poems, essays, and novels having to do with sleep and dreaming. Martin gives quotations from many authors (especially Shakespeare and Dickens) in epigraphs and also as illustrations within the text to show how universal the literary concern for slumber has been; his reading is obviously wide and rich, and his book is crammed with interesting facts about aspects of sleep that ought to convince anyone that sleeping is more important, and more virtuous, than we currently esteem it.<br /><br /> Sleep is universal, even among other animals besides humans. Humble insects and mollusks sleep. Fruit flies find a location where they can remain immobile for a couple of hours, around the same time of day, and if you keep them from sleeping, they catch up as soon as they can. What is sleep for? Nathaniel Kleitman, the founder of modern sleep research, dodged the question. He said he would explain the role of sleep once someone had explained the role of wakefulness. Most hypotheses of the action of sleep have been shot down, and non is completely convincing or comprehensive, so there are many mysteries still to be solved. Martin makes the case that almost all of us in modern societies are deprived of sleep at least some of the time. &quot;Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty,&quot; says the Bible, and even Dr. Franklin roused the sluggards with the reminder that there will be sleep enough in the grave. Our eagerness to stay up, our fortitude in setting the alarm so we get an early start, are not virtues at all, Martin shows. Sleep deprivation robs the next day of comfort and productivity, but can also produce disasters. The grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the Challenger explosion, the near-disaster at Three Mile Island nuclear power station and the true disaster at Chernobyl might not have happened had the personnel involved all been sleeping well. There are many sleep diseases, but the very worst is Fatal Familial Insomnia, in which sufferers endure worsening sleep until their brains become incapable of generating sleep brain waves. Not even the strongest barbiturates bring sleep, and death invariably results.<br /><br /> There isn't much here about that other bed activity, sex, but there is chapter on the universal phenomenon of nocturnal erections and the equally universal one of yawning. There is a chapter on beds, many of them strange or expensive. Cardinal Richelieu was so devoted to staying in bed that he traveled in his bed, with porters carrying him. If he visited you, you would have to tear down a wall or two so that he could be carried, still abed, into your house where he would begin his meetings, again still abed. There is the story of how the Soviets harnessed sleep deprivation by amplified music and flares to keep Nazis from sleeping and overtaking Leningrad. Famous sleepers are profiled. The pianist Anton Rubinstein would have overslept every morning except that his wife found the perfect solution. She would play an unresolved chord on his piano, and he would leap out of bed to complete it. You can learn here about increasing the likelihood that you will remember your dreams, or how to increase your chances of lucid dreaming, during which you have more control over the dream than usual. Throughout this informed survey runs the recurrent and welcome message: Sleep is important, you probably don't get enough, and you should enjoy a good sleep just as you do a good meal. And naps are good for you. Brightly written, Martin's book cannot itself induce somnolence, but can just make us act upon it more readily and knowingly..

Books	5	177	186	N	N	The Porn Business Reported by a Winner	Among the jobs you don't want to tell your parents you got is porn star. In a way this was easy for Christy Canyon. At eighteen, she wasn't speaking to her parents anyway, and she had left them to get on her own. Nonetheless, one of the themes that even the most conservative will approve of in _Lights, Camera, Sex! An Autobiography_ is that Christy loved her family, as disrupted and misguided as her parents may have sometimes been, and wanted to be back with them and accepted. It won't be giving anything away to say that she got her wish. After all, among the generous three pages of dedications at the front of the book are loving notes to her mom and dad, and especially to her sister who during some periods had to act as her ambassador to them. Among the other dedications is one to her producer at Vivid Video, the last studio she worked with, thanking her lucky stars that &quot;... you spoon-fed me all those years under contract and never asked me to do anything you knew I wouldn't do anyway.&quot; Even when as close as she could get to family was her cast and crew making sex films, Christy found supportive friends, and it seems she remains sweetly grateful. It is impossible to say how representative her experience in porn was. However, it is hard to say she was taken advantage of when she was making deliberate decisions to promote and protect herself, and she was able to get out of many uncomfortable situations and assignments. It might be a little surprising that there is so much self-examination in her book and so much reflection on family matters, but it can't be surprising that she has some good stories to tell, and it isn't at all surprising that she is uninhibited in telling them.<br /><br /> One surprise is that she tells the stories in an unexpectedly sophisticated way. She has not told the chronological story of her life. The first pages deal with her first appointment in Hollywood at World Modeling in 1984, but throughout the book, a memory will lurch her back into some experience from her past. On one page, there might be intercalated sentences of memories alternating with events of the moment. She was tricked into going to her first movie shoot, which she thought would be merely the nude still modeling she had been doing. Her agent said it would be a piece of cake: &quot;It's nothing that you haven't done in your personal life. It's one quick sex scene.&quot; He even assured her it could be in her favorite position. Canyon was remarkably inexperienced in sexual matters for one who had rebelled against her parents and hit the road, but to help her agent out, she agreed just this one time; the pay for the day's work being $1,500 was one of the advantages. She froze on the first shoot, but eventually got to enjoy doing scenes. She realized that with the few men she had been with in her personal life, she was inhibited: &quot;I never wanted the guy to think I was some sex-crazed maniac&quot; so she had reined herself in. On camera, though, nobody minded &quot;how loud I moaned and groaned... I realized how much fun it was just to enjoy sex.&quot; She learned she enjoyed sex when it was with another woman, or with more than one person, and she did not at all mind getting paid for it.<br /><br /> Not everything went smoothly. Canyon developed a coke habit, which she later shook, and she had to fend off unwanted advances from some sleazebags. She had to deal with lots of criticism from strangers, some of whom would write her to say that if she only had faith, God would save her from the business she was in. &quot;I was always perplexed by how these types acquired my fan club address as it was only printed in porn magazines.&quot; She got burned out on making films and went to work for her dad's accounting business, but came back to porn with a renewed business sense and also an interest in her paychecks funding her education. Years after she left home, she was even accepted back by her mother and dad, even while she continued her chosen profession; her book makes clear that for all she has managed to do for herself, regaining the love of her parents was the accomplishment she valued most. _Lights, Camera, Sex!_ is a unique look at one woman's experience in the porn film industry. It is unpolished; there are spelling and punctuation errors throughout, but while this would be a difficulty in other works, it is part of the book's charm that Canyon wrote it all herself without hiring an editor or an &quot;As Told To&quot;. When a company expressed interest in publishing the work, but wanted to change it around, she published it herself. Look elsewhere if you seek a confessional from a porn star as victim; this is a story by a victor.he continued her chosen profession; her book makes clear that for all she has managed to do for herself, regaining the love of her parents was the accomplishment she valued most. _Lights, Camera, Sex!_ is a unique look at one woman's experience in the porn film industry.

It was a battle between coal miners and coal company operators, and part of it was depicted in John Sayles's fine independent film _Matewan_. Robert Shogan, a political correspondent and historian, has told its story in _The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising_ (Westview). Shogan brings immediacy to the story by looking closely at details of the war and also at the larger social movements within the nation and the world. He produces a tense narrative that lets up only when the fate of the lost cause of the miners is decided in the final chapters.<br /><br /> After the labor calm during the World War, labor tension was highest in West Virginia. Mining was inherently a back-breaking and dangerous job. The mine owners often cheated on their own work rules, deliberately fudging the loads of coal cars so that miners would get paid for less coal dug. The Stone Mountain Coal Company did everything it could to prevent unionization; it reminded the miners that they not only owed their jobs to the company but also the very houses in which their families lived, and that anyone who joined a union would lose it all. The Battle for Blair Mountain was sparked after company police came to Matewan to throw families out of their homes. Resentment eventually took form of a march the miners planned, and some dreamed of marching to free union organizers from the jails in which they were held and then bringing an end to martial law. Shogan writes that the uprising was &quot;the largest armed uprising on American soil since the Civil War.&quot; With the federal military involved, the outcome was not surprising, although it was a real battle, with roaring machine guns and pincer tactics. With a thousand miners surrendering, many disappearing, and an unknown number killed, it was a staggering defeat for the miners, not just because they lost the battle, but because of the subsequent economic and political consequences. The operators tried, and in some cases succeeded, in bringing the charge against the rebels of treason, actually making war against the state. Not satisfied with a mere legal assault, the operators brought evangelist Billy Sunday in, who said of union organizers, &quot;I'd rather be in hell with Cleopatra, John Wilkes Booth and Charles Guiteau, than to live on earth with such human lice.&quot;<br /><br /> The revolution wasn't crushed as much as it simply expired. The problems of the union were worsened because there was abundant supply of coal from other sources. Federal intervention had represented insurmountable strength, but also it sapped the rebel's fury; one miner said, &quot;We wouldn't revolt against the national gov'ment.&quot; Shogan has written a moderate, intriguing history of both sides in the conflict, but it is hard not to feel that the downtrodden miners were making a brave attempt at economic fairness. &quot;Middle-class mythology to the contrary,&quot; Shogan writes, &quot;class conflict does exist in America,&quot; and so the book underscores unfairnesses of how corporations get their bidding done. Those unfairnesses are still there, as Shogan makes plain, while the distribution of wealth continues to shift to the managers of corporations and labor leaders are still on the defensive.

Bored by mass in the cathedral of Pisa, he started watching the chandelier hanging from a long chain, and timing it with the best clock he had available, his own pulse. Maybe he wasn't the first one to notice this, or to wonder about it, but the pendulum blown by drafts took as long to swing back and forth whether it was making a big arc or a small one. The observation was not exactly true, and his means of measuring it were not exact, and maybe the whole thing didn't happen anyway. Nonetheless, Galileo did discover a secret about pendulums that has profoundly affected physics and the whole world ever since. In _Galileo's Pendulum; From the Rhythm of Time to the Making of Matter_ (Harvard University Press), Roger G. Newton has started from this very first observation of a &quot;simple harmonic oscillator&quot; and briskly traced the concept up through quantum theory. The book contains some daunting math, which the author invites those so inclined to skip, but has scientific history and a summary of physics that is exhilarating and clear.<br /><br /> A simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is only deceptively simple. It can be completely understood mathematically, but gives enough complexity in its variants to be eternally interesting. The most obvious SHO, the pendulum, has its most famous use in clocks, and there are four chapters here on the history of clock-making. It was Galileo himself who, having noticed the regularity of the pendulum swing, realized that a pendulum would be the perfect timer to regulate a clock. He himself designed an escapement for such a pendulum, but only after his death did the design get put into action. Pendulum clocks had their problems, as readers of _Longitude_ know. The coiled balance spring of clocks that could be used aboard ship has, via its elastic properties, the same oscillation potential as a pendulum. Eventually clocks were regulated by tuning forks; the tines of the fork, too, show SHO. Even better results came from electrically vibrating a quartz crystal at millions of times a second, another SHO. Crystals do slowly age, and their periodicity eventually varies, but electrons do not. Atomic clocks, which are more accurate even than the rotations and revolutions of the Earth which clocks are supposed to measure, are based on the frequency of electromagnetic waves emitted when cesium electrons are excited.<br /><br /> Having brought clocks into the quantum realm, the author goes back to trace the physics of oscillation. It was Isaac Newton with his laws of motion who explained why a pendulum acted the way it did, and enabled its motion to be mathematically evaluated. The movement and forces on a pendulum can be graphed, and show up as sinusoidal waves, which are observed all over the place in nature. Fourier discovered that time functions, even if they weren't sinusoidal, could be expressed as sums of different sinusoidal waves. Metaphorically, acoustical and electromagnetic phenomena could be reduced into summed pendulums. Michael Faraday originated the idea of the electromagnetic field, and James Maxwell put the field on a mathematical basis, with, of course, a sinusoidal foundation. Einstein rode an imaginary wave of light to come to his conclusions that reformulated the concepts of space and time. During the last part of the twentieth century, quantum electrodynamics showed that every constituent of matter can be regarded as quantum of different fields, and at the heart of quanta are, surprise, harmonic oscillators. _Galileo's Pendulum_ takes only thirty pages to go from Faraday to quantum electrodynamics, and there are other books to give deeper analysis of the history of physics. However, for the non-physicist, the author has provided a small history with the unique viewpoint of keeping pendulums in sight throughout. Readers will find this an excellent brief review of a surprisingly universal natural phenomenon.rief review of a surprisingly universal natural phenomenon.  <br />	2004-07-27
576441:US	50895620	R2JQY5K6KYIKVG	0374261032	119287911	A Sentimental Murder: Love and Madness in the Eighteenth Century	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A History of Histories	This much is sure: James Hackman, a young clergyman, on 7 April 1779, outside of Covent Garden Theater in London, shot and killed Martha Ray, the mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, and then shot himself but failed to end his own life. What had gone on between the three figures before the murder was not clearly known, but this didn't stop speculations in the press at the time, and hacks, journalists, novelists, and historians have been having a go at the incident ever since. As John Brewer writes in _A Sentimental Murder: Love and Madness in the Eighteenth Century_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), the unknown represented an empty space, and &quot;Into the empty space rushed all sorts of speculation.&quot; Writers could wonder if the lovers were meeting secretly, were they having an affair, did they want to get married, was Ray willing or Hackman forceful, were they working together against Sandwich? Brewer's detailed and intriguing book does not answer the questions, but examines the answers that different writers and different societies have come up with to suit their own tastes and times. The murder of Martha Ray was legally an open and shut case, but its unknowns have kept it open to interpretation and to eager interpreters.<br /><br /> The British press at the time made much of the murder, because of Sandwich's involvement. Remarkably, all three figures were written about with sympathy. Sandwich was depicted as a loving all-but-husband who had made a protected household for his mistress and the children she bore him. Ray may have been a mistress, but there was admiration for a woman who could have risen from low origins and become not a prostitute or even a courtesan, but a respectable companion and mother who was able to fill the household functions of a lady. Even the murderer emerged as a romantic hero. It was the age when sentiment and sensibility were highly prized. Hackman had a bad case of &quot;love's madness,&quot; an out-of-control passion with which readers could sympathize rather than condemn outright.<br /><br /> The first attempt to turn the case into a novel was not classed as a novel at all. _Love and Madness_ was published in 1780, and purported to be the actual letters between Ray and Hackman. It was written by Herbert Croft, a hack writer and would-be lexicographer who dedicated it to Samuel Johnson. Johnson told Boswell he did not like the book, as an example of a disagreeable mixture of fact and fiction, so he was not fooled by its claim to authenticity. Croft clumsily showed his hand by having Hackman lengthily discuss other literary forgeries that were current controversies, but he did amplify the view of Hackman as progressively maddened by his doomed love. Subsequent generations took up the tale, and &quot;Victorian commentators worried over the story like a dog over a bone.&quot; In &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, William Wordsworth incorporated Martha Ray's name into the poem &quot;The Thorn,&quot; its utterance symbolizing ambiguity. Physician Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) diagnosed &quot;love's madness.&quot; The Victorians insisted that their Georgian ancestors were moral barbarians, and frowned on all three parties involved. Victorians had graduated from such depravity, and congratulated themselves upon how far all ranks of England had come since the corrupt days of George III. In the 1920's, the libertine Georgians were celebrated by the &quot;fast set and bright young things&quot; who admired the more open sexuality of the eighteenth century. In the 1930s, the story was retold by a novelist who gave it a racist connotation; the real villain was a guest at Sandwich's manor, Omai from Tahiti, a real figure who had played only minor roles in previous versions. The real story of the murder is not the real story of the murder, in Brewer's persuasive book, but the real stories that different generations have made of it. This is a book to examine the ripples the incident caused, and is a fascinating history for observing how writing history is itself part of history.fascinating history for observing how writing history is itself part of history.  <br />	2004-07-26

But what about their gardens? The question is not trivial. Gardens have always represented an ideal sensual and peaceful environment, and what ancient gardens were like could tell us something about the ancients and about humans in general. This sort of research has been done by Maureen Carroll, an archeologist who has dug in garden sites all around the regions of the ancient world. She has written _Earthly Paradises: Ancient Gardens in History and Archaeology_ (Getty Publications), a small and scholarly book that unlike most academic works, is beautifully produced with almost a hundred pictures, mostly in color. It is a concise overview of what we can now know about ancient gardens of the Near East and Mediterranean region, and will delight those interested in ancient history or in gardening.<br /><br /> &quot;Gardens are ephemeral, as fragile and short-lived as the people who once cultivated them,&quot; Carroll writes. This was one of the reasons that archaeologists neglected them; marble, mortar, and mosaics lasted longer and were easier to find and understand. It was not until the 1970s that the &quot;empty spaces&quot; of courtyards and outside of houses became the target of evaluation. Most of the gardens described here are not agricultural or economic efforts, but luxuries. When Pericles encouraged Athenians not to mourn their possessions in a loss to Sparta, one of the luxuries he specifically mentioned as unfit for bereavement was the garden. Gardens were, however, no less work than they are today. A papyrus document shows that the garden owner Talames required that the gardener Peftumont maintain the irrigation channels, water the garden, protect against sparrows and crows, and do a full day's work.<br /><br /> One of the pleasures of _Earthly Paradises_ is that it gives the ever-valuable lesson of how little people really change. For thousands of years they have found refreshment and sensual delight in gardens that were just for pleasure, not for profit, although baser motives of showiness to impress others also seem eternal. There is one example after another here of ancient gardeners doing the same thing gardeners do now; it isn't surprising that watering and weeding had to be done, of course, but it is interesting that we can recognize so many tools for the gardener. Most iron objects have corroded away, but Egyptian paintings, for instance, show the use of rakes and hoes. We have to assume that they were used in Egyptian gardens as well as for regular agriculture, because such paintings of gardens are idealized and don't show tools or work. There is a detail of a Roman painting shown here of a songbird sitting on a vertical reed stick which serves as a support for a rose plant that has been tied to it. Terracotta pots for plants were so essential to the Romans that they started making them in Britain immediately after invading in 43 CE. A ladder whose impression was left in the ash of Pompeii looks completely modern, with a tapering top such as is used in fruit picking. The central square of Greek cities, the agora, was planted with trees for the shade of citizens, and in Roman cities similar spaces had pits cut into the rock to be filled with soil and used as planters for trees. Gardeners borrowed styles from each other, with, for instance, a Roman garden decorated with statuary of Greek or Persian themes and having a central water channel as was favored in Egypt. The borrowing has gone on especially during the baroque period, when ornate classical landscape design renewed in the Renaissance became the fashion. To be sure, Carroll's delightful book is not a how-to for setting up an ancient garden two millennia later, but gardeners will find much that is familiar here, and some will find plants and arrangements that can agreeably be incorporatedinto their own personal paradises.rated into their own personal paradises.	2004-07-22

It will come as a surprise that much of Hollywood's fascination for prison life, shown in pictures like _20,000 Years in Sing Sing_, was due to an enormously popular penologist, warden Lewis E. Lawes, who served at Sing Sing from 1919 to 1942. Indeed, Lawes wrote the book on which that movie is based, as well as other best-selling books turned into movies, and stage and radio plays. He liked being a media star, but he was also a devoted public servant with humanitarian aims for the prisoners in his charge. _Miracle at Sing Sing: How One Man Transformed the Lives of America's Most Dangerous Prisoners_ (St. Martin's Press) is an absorbing look at Lawes's work within the prison and without, and has lessons for our own time.<br /><br /> Lawes started as a guard, moved into youth reformatories, and had success in getting the youths to work together. His successes took him to the intimidating assignment of warden at Sing Sing. Lawes wanted the job and campaigned for it, but he knew what he was up against; he was the seventh warden in four years. In his first address to the men, he even joked about the impermanence: &quot;If you want to get out of this place quickly, you have to come in as warden.&quot; The men laughed, but they also heard from him that they would get privileges that they earned, and that as the warden walked the yard he wanted to be addressed on any subject they liked. He believed in sunshine, open air, sports and music as civilizing influences. His sports efforts became legendary. The Sing Sing Orioles played the New York Yankees (with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig) at Lawes Field in 1929 (Yankees 15, Orioles 3). The outcomes of the games didn't much matter. The effort meant a lot to &quot;the boys&quot; as he called them, and there were no incidents of foul play or attempts to take advantage of the crowds to escape. He had a cutthroat give him a shave every day, and other felons were nannies to his three daughters. There were failures, but there were countless inmates who learned some civilizing lessons and when free, remembered them. When Lawes visited New York, taxi drivers would refuse his fare: &quot;It's on me, boss. I'm one of the boys.&quot;<br /><br /> Lawes would have seen his greatest failure as his inability to curb capital punishment. When he got to the prison, he favored the electric chair, but as he saw it at work on the condemned, and as he realized that it was doing little for deterrence, he actively worked against it, even as he was responsible for the state-mandated deaths of one inmate after another. He also was aghast at the Baumes laws, which were similar to our three-strikes-you're-out philosophy, by which four-time losers were imprisoned without hope of ever leaving prison alive. Lawes viewed robbing men of hope as the greatest of crimes. The anecdotes of prison life given here are detailed and engaging. Blumenthal has sketched pictures of Charles Chapin, the wife-murderer who became the prison's renowned rose gardener, George Parker who really did sell the Brooklyn Bridge to a rube for $50,000, and Willie Sutton who repeatedly and memorably robbed banks for the inescapable reason, &quot;That's where the money is.&quot; Blumenthal's book is an entertaining depiction of colorful characters and a humane, confident warden who made a difference in their lives.er felons were nannies to his three daughters.

Everyone knew the role of the ubiquitous porter, a role with duties, uniform, and demeanor.  In the movies, actors played porters as porters had played their occupational roles, busy and even servile, humorous and fawning, wise to the needs and foolishness of their passengers and ignorant as members of their race were held to be.  The paradoxes of the porters get a wonderful historical evaluation in _Rising from the Rails: Pullman Porters and the Making of the Black Middle Class_ (Henry Holt) by Larry Tye.  A history of the porters was overdue, but Tye is squeaking this one in.  There were generations of porters, but the last of them is slipping away, and some of them he interviewed for the book did not live to see it printed.  Porters, for all their servility and for all the neglect that passengers often gave them, made an impression, and Tye makes the wonderful case of another paradox.  The porter, whose attitude might be classed now as &quot;Uncle Tom-ism&quot;, was a necessary element to bring about the Civil Rights movement.<br />The porters were, from beginning to end, creatures of the Pullman Rail Car Company.  George Pullman brought out the first one in 1865, and by 1867, he was looking for a reliable way to staff the cars; Pullman needed one single worker who would be hotelier, waiter, chambermaid, butler, and information desk.  There was a newly invented pool of workers to draw from, the former slaves from the South.  Many had worked in plantation houses and were familiar with duties requiring close proximity to wealthy white folk.  There was poor pay and atrocious hours, but many porters appreciated the opportunity to escape the south and trade overalls for bow ties and starched pants.  Porters could read the business pages discarded by their passengers, and they learned how the Pullman Company was flourishing while they were barely getting by.  Part of the porters' history involves eventual unionizing and developing themselves as a commercial force, and the indefatigable efforts of A. Philip Randolph to bring about a union are highlighted here.  Randolph was a Civil Rights leader for decades, and eventually organized the March on Washington, for which Martin Luther King (who held Randolph in reverence) is better remembered.<br />By the time the porters had reached their greatest unified commercial strength, their profession was coming to an end.  Road and airplane travel took passengers away, and Amtrak was just a ghost of past glory.  Tye convinces readers, however, that the porters had a disproportionate effect on the black community.  At their height, porters were 0.1% of blacks in America, and yet for any black American excelling in any field in the last half century, there is an odds-on chance that there was a Pullman porter in that person's past.  They did it by the same means: &quot;... sacrificing for their children, and deferring dreams of self-improvement for a generation or even two, but never abandoning them.&quot;  They may have been underlings, but the best of them profited by being around even the most unpleasant passengers.  About one incident, a porter explained that after some slight, he was able to hold his tongue: &quot;It was an accomplishment.  I kept from hating passengers like that.  I called myself outsmarting them.&quot;  Tye's impressive look at the influence of a long-gone profession is at its best when bringing back the words and stories of the porters themselves.  &quot;My mother taught me never to quarrel with a fool, but to humor him.  That's what I do,&quot; said one.  Another concluded, &quot;You just gotta haul folks as they come.  Some's good, some's bad, some's nice and some's crabby.&quot;ionizing and developing themselves as a commercial force, and the indefatigable efforts of A.

590157:US	50895620	R169ED7QMWPOEK	0743257731	437916513	1215: The Year of Magna Carta	Books	5	72	75	N	N	Back to the Fundamentals	One of the many documents that we honor without paying much importance to what it really was in its time is the Magna Carta.  There is a meadow at Runnymede, near Windsor in England, where in 1215 King John was forced to sign the document, and among other memorials there now is a little temple placed by the American Bar Association.  The American Founding Fathers reverenced the document, and indeed parts of the Constitution may be easily traced to sentences within the Magna Carta.  But the Magna Carta in its time was a bust; it did not bring peace between King John and the barons suing for their share of liberty and was soon trashed in civil war.  _1215: The Year of Magna Carta_ (Touchstone) by Danny Danziger and John Gillingham puts the document in context.  We are right to hold it in reverence, but the authors make clear that the barons were looking after their property rights easily as much as the abstract values of freedom which have inspired patriots through history, and that the document enabled serfdom rather than actual freedom.<br />The surprising part about this book is that the Magna Carta does not really show up until the final chapters.  The title is correct; the book is largely about the year and how people in England lived at that time.  There are chapters on schools, families, tournaments, trials, the church, and other important aspects of life under King John, with mere hints in each about how the Magna Carta might have affected them.  The details of life in that year come thick throughout the main part of the book.  Astrology was promoted, but some monks and teachers thought it was bunk.  People took part in religious rituals, but one prior wrote, &quot;There are many people who do not believe that God exists&quot; and said the universe was ruled by chance, not providence.  No one knows how many the &quot;many people&quot; were.  There were English colonies as far away as Alexandria.  Summers were warmer by one centigrade degree than they are now, with milder winters and lower rainfall.  If you were right handed, you would write with a quill from the left wing of a goose (and vice versa) so that the feather would curve outwards when you wrote.  Wolves roamed the forests which covered nearly a third of England.  Men wore underwear but women didn't.  Hay was used for toilet paper.  Chess was played with enthusiasm but with simpler rules than now.  Adulterers would be whipped naked through the streets.  This is a lively history, and fun to read.<br />The book concludes with the actual signing of the Magna Carta itself and its effects.  The rebellion by the barons in 1215 was quite different from the many rebellions against previous kings.  Those involved fighting to restore a particular monarch to the throne.  The barons had no such champion; the focus of their revolt was simply a program of reform.  The document itself consists of 63 clauses, the first ten of which (and many of the subsequent ones) have only to do with maintaining the barons' property rights.  There are ringing, lofty expressions of principle, but they are late in the charter, and while they are what we revere it for, they were evidently not uppermost on the minds of the barons.  This does not matter, really; &quot;To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice&quot; and that no one will have action against him &quot;... except by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land&quot; were important principles then and now.  The Magna Carta was intended as a peace treaty, but John was eager to wiggle out of it any way he could, and was helped by the Pope, who declared the Magna Carta null and void.  The all-out civil war that followed was capped by John's death a year later from dysentery.  The Magna Carta was reissued, as it was again in 1225, and it is the 1225 text that entered the statute books.  It was this version that bad kings had to reaffirm; public cries after royal infringements, for instance, forced Edward I to confirm the charter in 1297.  This spirited introduction to thirteenth century history shows that the Magna Carta thus may be more eternally important not as a foundation for specific rights, but as the primal symbol for struggle against tyranny.ced Edward I to confirm the charter in 1297.

Here's my advice: take John James Audubon's _The Birds of America_.  Of course you want the original edition, the volumes that appeared between 1826 and 1838.  Not only is it one of the most beautiful books ever printed, if you get tired of it, you can sell it.  The last one that came up for sale, in 2000, went for $8.8 million.  Just about everyone knows about this book, or has seen reprints from it, and has heard of Audubon (perhaps because of the Society that bears his name) and associates him with birds.  He has had several biographies, but _Audubon's Elephant: America's Greatest Naturalist and the Making of the Birds of America_ (Henry Holt) by Duff Hart-Davis takes a specific look at the extraordinary book, and how _The Birds of America_ could not have been made in America.<br />Audubon's own adopted country had no room for his huge project of a book to show all the birds of America life sized.  Naturalists at the time actively discouraged anyone's support of Audubon's efforts, and there were not printers up to the task.  So in 1826, Audubon sailed with his big watercolors to England.  He became a celebrated American rustic, captivating the town of Edinburgh.  He went about carrying his huge portfolio which weighed nearly a hundred pounds, slung over his shoulder.  The first printer of the work, having see it, responded, &quot;My God!  I never saw anything like this before.&quot;  He was right; Audubon's pictures had size, drama, and color no previous bird pictures even hinted at.  The pictures caused a sensation, and Audubon was caught in a whirl of dining and socializing that he enjoyed enormously.  The enormous work of getting subscribers, printing the pictures, and getting a team of colorists to hand tint each one was more than Audubon had counted on.  He wrote, &quot;I am thrown into a vortex of business that I never conceived I could manage.&quot;<br />Audubon and conservation have become synonymous, but his process of making his art will appall those many who belong to the Society bearing his name.  Audubon probably killed more birds than any man in history, saying, &quot;I call birds few when I shoot less than one hundred per day.&quot;  He liked painting birds in action, but he posed them that way, killing them and mounting them so he could get the action stilled.  A companion complained about Audubon working on his turkey painting, &quot;The damned fellow kept it pinned up there till it rotted and stunk.  I hated to lose so much good eating.&quot;  Audubon kept a golden eagle in a cage to observe it, and having it seen alive sufficiently, tried to suffocate it with charcoal smoke, and when that did not work, pierced it through the heart with a pointed steel needle.  As Hart-Davis realizes, Audubon did not lust for blood, but for knowledge.  Imparting that knowledge through his art was his great goal, magnificently realized.  _Audubon's Elephant_ is a much smaller volume than the original it describes, but it is still handsomely produced on fine paper and with fittingly copious illustrations.  It is a vibrant account of an artist accomplishing his dream.servation have become synonymous, but his process of making his art will appall those many who belong to the Society bearing his name.

His family knew him to be special somehow, so he was not given an official name; he was known by them as Apo Gaga (&quot;happy brother&quot;).  And then the highest of the Tibetan Buddhists realized that he was the reincarnation of Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa, who had died in 1981.  The resurrection line of Karmapas goes back centuries before that of even the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet.  Apo Gaga then became &quot;His Holiness the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje&quot;.  The story of his selection and his headline-making flight from Tibet in 2000 is told in _The Dance of 17 Lives: The Incredible True Story of Tibet's 17th Karmapa_ (Bloomsbury) by Mick Brown.  Brown, a journalist who has covered religious subjects before, is not a Buddhist, and indeed his own religious ideas are not part of this book, which is an astonishingly impartial view of the sometimes controversial and (to those of a different religious persuasion) often utterly weird process of making a new divine hereditary leader.<br />Brown's book gives a history of Buddhism as it relates to the Karmapa line.  The first Karmapa was born in 1110 CE, at the age of fifty.  He was omniscient and was able to pass through rocks and mountains.  He predicted he would be reborn many times, and starting a tradition, he left a letter specifying how the next Karmapa could be found.  When the beloved 16th Karmapa died in 1981, there was a puzzling interval when no such letter could be found.  One of his monks eventually produced an amulet the 16th had given him, and it contained a prediction that was to lead to Apo Gaga, who was enthroned as 17th Karmapa in 1992 at age seven.  This succession has been controversial; another monk has claimed the amulet document was a forgery and has put forward his own choice of successor, but the Dalai Lama has given all official approval to the current 17th.  The Chinese communists, who dislike all religions, amazingly accepted the 17th as a &quot;Living Buddha&quot;, in an attempt to get a Buddhist leader under their sway.  The 17th Karmapa and a few close associates made plans for a perilous winter trek over the Himalayas and into India.  By foot, jeep, and helicopter, he made a daring escape to an eventual exile along with the Dalai Lama.<br />Brown has interviewed the 17th Karmapa (as he has the Dalai Lama, and most of the individuals he profiles), and has been impressed.  &quot;He was, patently, a fifteen-year-old boy; yet like no fifteen-year-old I had met before.&quot;  He had composure and authority to a disconcerting degree: &quot;There is something dazzling about him.&quot;  He has had a life of study rather than play, but devotees have donated to him plenty of toys through the years.  Amusingly, when he made his prediction of where the reincarnated descendant from another line would be found, to show the house that should be targeted, the Karmapa made a model with his Lego set.  It is this sort of clash between modern and ancient or religious and worldly that makes _The Dance of 17 Lives_ so fascinating.  The Dalai Lama is now 69 years old, and when he dies, Tibetan exiles all over the world will be looking toward the 17th Karmapa as a unifying symbol and perhaps a successor.  We are used to seeing the Dalai Lama as an elder statesman, but if this description of the 17th Karmapa is true, we can expect a young man to fit in just as well.th.

But freedom at sea can lead to such manifestations as piracy, and not just in the swashbuckling days of yore; it could also lead to corporate irresponsibility and malfeasance.  William Langewiesche's _The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime_ (North Point Press) collects and expands upon his previous magazine articles on this theme.  All of us are dependent upon international trade, and few of us understand how it works or in what ways it is working badly or dangerously, unless we hear about a capsizing or an oil spill.  There are a lot more of those than we hear about, and a lot more crime on the sea than even governments acknowledge.  Langewiesche's book is a fine way for lubbers to get to know how traditional maritime freedom is endangering them.<br />Before World War II, ships were customarily built in a country, were registered in that country, flew the flag of that country, and sailed for the profit of businessmen in that country.  Ironically, the United States began the current anarchical system in a pretense of neutrality during the pre-Pearl Harbor war, registering in Panama ships bringing needed supplies to Britain.  The practice became widespread in the succeeding decades, with many ships now sailing under &quot;flags of convenience.&quot;  They might be registered in countries that have no navy and even no coastline, and the countries involved can get relatively small fees, which are actually almost pure profit.  The countries don't pursue administrative niceties like taxes, labor laws, safety inspections, and so on, and the corporations which own the ships don't mind avoiding such things, either.  Among the cases described here are a too-old ship (with full inspection documents) broken in half by stormy seas.  Pirates can take advantage of the lax laws by making a ship disappear; capture, repaint, rename, and reflag the vessel, and it vanishes from the seas.  Seas are big, ships leave no tracks, and patrol ships and aircraft can see only a tiny percentage of any hunting ground.  Policing the oceans from such attacks is not now possible.<br />The longest episode in the book tells of the _Estonia_, a giant luxury ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994, with a loss of 852 of 989 passengers and crew.

Sarah Wise, in _The Italian Boy: A Tale of Murder and Body Snatching in 1830s London_ (Metropolitan Books), has revived (so to speak) a story that has not been retold since the newspapers and broadsheets made it a sensation in its time.  Far more famous is the case of the &quot;Edinburgh Horrors&quot; wherein William Burke and William Hare had not only snatched bodies but had manufactured them by murdering the victims first.  Their crimes have entered literature and the movies, and &quot;to burke&quot; is even a term for the act.  Three years later in 1831, similar crimes in London came to light and horrified and fascinated Londoners.  Wise's book will do the same for the modern reader.<br />For medical students and anatomists in England, there was only one legal supply of cadavers for dissection, the gallows; getting cut up for show was another particular indignity that could be extended to the condemned.  This might have been enough in years gone by, but in 1831 only 52 people were executed.  A freshly exhumed corpse would fetch around ten guineas, at a time when a well-paid workingman might bring home eighty guineas a year, so the trade could be lucrative.  Carlo Ferrari was a pretty fourteen-year-old street urchin who walked the city with his cage of white mice (and maybe a turtle) until he ran into the villains of this tale.  The resurrectionists involved lured him to a home in a semi-rural part of the city, drugged him and drowned him, and then set off to peddle his body.  When it looked too fresh, the police were called, and an investigation showed that Ferrari had not been the only victim.  Less than a month after the murder was made public, John Bishop, James May, and Thomas Williams stood trial in the Old Bailey.  In a fitting conclusion to their careers, the resurrection men found guilty were resurrected onto the anatomist's table.  It was discovered that Bishop &quot;... had an extraordinarily good physique, proving far more useful as a specimen than the produce he used to deliver.&quot;<br />The trial was a big case for the new London police force, and the role of the Police Inspector, then a novelty, was highlighted and began its acceptance by the public.  The trial threw light on the horrid trade, its prevalence and the medical men who were accessories in its perpetuation.  It served as a spark to reformation, contributing to the passing of the second Anatomy Bill in 1832, which allowed bodies other than those of the hanged miscreants to be a source of instruction.  The unclaimed bodies of paupers could thereupon be used for dissection, and thus the &quot;horrors&quot; of the dissecting table started becoming less horrible; today enlightened future corpses often will their bodies for anatomical teaching.  Wise's startling tale, well illustrated and fetid with cesspools, abattoirs, dissecting rooms, prisons, and Tudor slums, opens again a grotesque and brutal underworld and makes for an entertaining, gruesome history.es May, and Thomas Williams stood trial in the Old Bailey.

It is only a half a millimeter long, for instance, and is a lowly nematode, living on bacteria and slime mold in temperate regions all around the world.  It does, however, display rapid growth and production of subsequent generations, which made it perfect for genetic studies, and transparency, which made it perfect for microscopic analysis.  But even the original researchers on the worm would have been surprised at all the work that has been done in the last forty years.  _C. elegans_ is now &quot;the most completely understood animal in history.&quot;  That assessment comes in _In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite_ (Columbia University Press) by Andrew Brown.  In fact, the worm looms even larger in biological research; work on its genetic map grew directly into the human genome mapping project.  So its story is worth telling, and Brown, a science journalist, has told it largely through descriptions of the personalities and work of the main researchers.  There is little technical detail here about the worm itself, but much interesting history about how the researchers came to understand it so well.<br />Chief of the characters is Sydney Brenner, who designated the worm as a fit source of research in the mid-1960s.  Not everyone thought that the worm was the way to go, or even that trying to understand it at the molecular level was a promising avenue of research.  There was more glamorous work and ostensibly more productive work going on researching fruit flies, for instance, but Brenner's team showed astonishing dedication.  Almost everyone who worked in the lab came away happy, and Brenner and his main colleagues came away with Nobels.  One of the most pleasing aspects of the research was how public it was.  The researchers were in favor of free trade in ideas within the team, of course, but there was a high streak of idealism in sharing results with the outside world.  They truly believed that the unfettered exercise of their talents was for the benefit of humanity.  They insisted that sharing results (rather than, say, copyrighting or licensing them) meant it was more likely that someone would latch on to something interesting which needed further work.  No one owned the genetic map they produced, and it was from the beginning available to all takers (although it is now much more accessible since biologists can log into it on the web).  It is not just that free release is generous and right, but it works.  John Sulston, one of the Nobel winners, said, &quot;It was not a theoretical concept, it was  a pragmatic way of moving forward.&quot;<br />The importance of the worm in all subsequent genetic research cannot be overstated, and so this is a welcome volume to recount how the worm got to be so well understood.  There have been distinct effects on the research on humans themselves.  Vertebrates like humans are not descended from nematodes, but we are distant cousins with an ancient common ancestor which eight hundred million years ago solved the problems of living as a multicellular organism, and every animal ever since has inherited those solutions.  In a real sense, looking at the worm is a way of looking at ourselves, with all the potential for practical knowledge that this brings.  But Brown's book is an inspirational story about researchers who gambled all on the detailed understanding of a humble worm not for practicality, or for riches, but for the sake of knowledge alone.as how public it was.

Sexual acts between members of the same sex were specifically illegal, and cops would bait homosexuals to see if they were interested in such acts.  Professionals who were found to be homosexuals lost their licenses.  Homosexuality was a diagnosable psychiatric illness.  A consensual homosexual act could get even life imprisonment, and a risk of castration.  There may still be discrimination against gays in many ways, but some are now even legally married; societal acceptance is not total, but it is vastly better than it was on 28 June 1969.  That date, regarded as epochal by homosexuals insisting on their civil rights, saw the Stonewall uprising; in _Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution_ (St. Martin's Press), David Carter has given a spectacularly detailed and well-researched history of an event that has been often misunderstood even by those interested in the history of the gay civil rights movement.<br />In the sixties, Greenwich Village was a center for homosexual life; the bohemian residents were simply more accepting of unusual behavior.  Within Greenwich, the Stonewall Inn was one of the gathering places especially for male homosexuals.  The ambience was \\"trashy, low, and tawdry,\\" but unpretentious, and all from any margins (including the exaggeratedly effeminate men who were a fashion at the time) were free to go there without risk of feeling alienated.  Patrons and the bar staff accepted that the place was going to get raided.  Police thought of gays as easy targets in their humiliating sweeps of the bar.  Carter is careful to show that the confrontation that night was somewhere between inevitable and fortuitous, but what set the crowd off was a lesbian resisting arrest and being beaten.  The initial response was tentative; one man could stand it no longer and yelled, \\"Gay Power!\\" only to be shushed by his partner.  The cry, however, was taken up, and the outcasts stirred into action.  The chapters of the book dealing with the riot itself are often tense, with the police being forced back into Stonewall and barricading themselves in, and the gays outside pounding the heavy doors with a parking meter while chanting \\"Liberate the bar!\\"  Many who were there shared the view of one participant, who called the newspapers during the riot: \\"I immediately knew this was the spark we had been waiting for for years.\\"<br />Carter details the changes in attitude that came after the riots, fostered by the too-inclusive Gay Liberation Front through the more successful Gay Activist Alliance.  Political action, confrontation, and street theater were taken up by a group of citizens that had previously kept covert ways.  Having shown up at the scene of the riot to see what all the fuss was about, Allen Ginsberg himself said of the participants, comparing them to homosexuals a decade before, \\"They've lost that wounded look.\\"  Carter clears up myths that have grown up around the event.  It was reported, for instance, that the rioters breaking back into the bar where the police were besieged were merely trying to get back in and party.  There was a further widely reported story that the riots were in response to the funeral the day before of Judy Garland, an idol to some gays.  These stories represent the sort of trivialization that society might well attempt to impose on a revolution that it found unwelcome.  The revolution isn't complete, but at Stonewall the struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights got a real political start.

Lockwood, \\"perhaps the greatest ecological mystery of modern times.\\"  Lockwood has studied the mystery for years, undergone grueling mountain expeditions to get evidence, compiled a solution to it, and had his solution accepted by his peers; it might be, therefore, that he has a slightly exalted sense of just how great the mystery is.  But in _Locust: The Devastating Rise and Mysterious Disappearance of the Insect that Shaped the American Frontier_ (Basic Books), he has set the matter clearly for non-specialists, and has shown how he made his convincing answer to \\"What killed off the locusts?\\"  You may never have wondered about this particular ecological question, but Lockwood's detailed, multi-faceted, and fascinating book provides a refreshing look at entomological and agricultural history, at how field and research science is done, and how evolution works in mysterious ways.<br />The impression the locusts made on pioneers in the nineteenth century cannot be overstated.  They darkened the sky and ate any crops down to stubble, fed on clothes, and gnawed even the handles of farm implements.  There was nothing that could be done.  Of course there were religious appeals to remove the plague, and inchoate government plans to help the starving farmers.  Eventually the federal government did set up programs to investigate the swarms scientifically, and huge amounts of data were collected, but it did not do a great deal of good in the short term.  The farmers wanted to get rid of the locusts then and there.  There were many methods of locust control, including a horse-drawn flamethrower.  Finally, but through none of these efforts, the locusts vanished forever.  Entomologists have thought about this for more than a century, and some interesting hypotheses have been forwarded, each reviewed here, each eventually unsatisfactory.<br />Lockwood's solution was from evidence gathered, among other places, high in Wyoming ridges, in the glaciers.  There are very few locusts pinned in collections, but after much grueling effort he and his team found them encased in glacial ice.  Before finding full bodies, they were able to do some identification by looking at the remains of mouth parts, which are distinct in grasshopper and locust species.  For exact identification, though, bodies with intact penises had to be found.  The penises of grasshoppers and locusts display many grooves, hooks, and curlicues that ensure that the key of the male fits only into the lock borne by a female of the same species, so a penis is the best way to know exactly what species one is dealing with.  Lockwood's solution, which is too interesting to be revealed in detail here, involves some fascinating aspects of the locusts, which were in one form in their home nesting ground but developed a different body type for the migratory (swarming) phase when the home got crowded.  Lockwood also drew upon the lessons we are learning from the Monarch butterfly, which also has a now-endangered home in Mexico from which it sends out migrating waves.  Lockwood's whodunit is beautifully organized and clearly written to tell an esoteric story which he has in many ways fitted into larger ecological, historical, and social frameworks, and in doing so he convinces a reader of a larger importance than just the loss of one species.the glaciers.

It is not just political correctness that would forbid such a name; \\"idiocy\\" and \\"feeblemindedness\\" were once thought to be real diagnosable conditions, and they are not now.  The MSIFY existed, however, but even after it changed its name to the Fernald State School, it was through the 1960s still housing what officials thought were idiotic, moronic, and feebleminded young people.  Sadly, huge numbers of the kids kept there (and in countless similar institutions) had no mental handicaps whatsoever.  In _The State Boys Rebellion: A True Story_ (Simon and Schuster), Michael D'Antonio exposes the Fernald story, a sorry and sordid tale.  The kids described here would today, it is hoped, get reliable foster homes and any special education that was necessary; at the time, they got neglect, assaults, rapes, and cruelty.  Some of the boys described here forced their way out, and did fare surprisingly well, and did get their histories out in the public view, so at least in part this is a story of an inspiring victory over the system.<br />D'Antonio has done a particularly good job at putting the Fernald story into historical context, showing  Fernald as a product of the eugenics movement.  The idea was that morons (a term coined as a medical diagnosis) could be segregated and prevented from breeding more morons.  Among the problems was that at Fernald, plenty of the children were normal.  As Fred Boyce, the main State Boy profiled here, said decades later, \\"Keep in mind that we didn't commit any crimes.  We were just seven-year-old orphans.\\"  Boyce was of at least average intelligence; even his official record at the place said, \\"He is certainly not feebleminded.\\"  He was skillful at sizing up other people, and interested in science.  He needed adoption, but such recommendations produced no effect.  He was only released when he was nineteen.  In Fernald, there was an over-reliance on IQ test scores, and once a label IQ number had been applied, it stuck.  This was true even if teachers could tell just by talking to the boys that the scores were meaningless.  Whatever IQ scores mean, it was true that the boys _dropped_ in their scores as they stayed in state custody, even though authorities taught that IQ was a permanent fixture.<br />The boys were supposed to be separated from the world, but some of the world crept in, from radio and television; one of Boyce's means of learning about the outside was a crystal radio he built, using a found quartz rock for a crystal.  As teenagers, they had a natural rebelliousness combined with a desire to fit in, and they gradually found that they were much more like their fellow teens on the outside than any morons.  Inspired by the civil rights struggles in Little Rock, some of the boys took over one of the wards in 1957.  They rioted, and some wound up in prison.  The real rebellion of the state boys took place in 1995.  They were undereducated, but many of them had found work and made families, although some of them did not reveal even to their wives the horrors of where they had been brought up.  Many of them united to start speaking publicly about what they had endured, and brought a successful lawsuit against the state and against Quaker Oats for having used them as unwitting test subjects in nutrition experiments involving radioactive oatmeal.  A researcher who interviewed the boys to help with the lawsuit put it perfectly: \\"These guys had their lives ruined because people where trying to do good.  That may be the scariest thing about it.\\"  D'Antonio's clear, restrained, and sympathetic portrayal of a misguided institution and its captives is a fitting parable about good intentions.over-reliance on IQ test scores, and once a label IQ number had been applied, it stuck.

It's true that a McDonald's here is pretty much the same as one there, and suburban sprawl seems the same everywhere.  The South, however, is a truly peculiar place that will not be culturally assimilated, and if you don't believe it, check out _Queen of the Turtle Derby: And Other Southern Phenomena_ (Random House), a collection of comic essays by Julia Reed.  Reed, a senior writer at _Vogue_ and a contributing editor at _Newsweek_, grew up in the Mississippi Delta, in Greenville, and now shuttles between New York and New Orleans.  Naturally, as comic essayist, she does not concentrate on the problems of the South, but her funny reporting on the startling eccentricities and insistent traditions of her homeland is a joy to read.<br />The darkest part of the South she covers, even if she does so with a grin, is the violence.  A third of the nation's population lives in the South, and they commit 42% of all homicides.  Serious crime has risen in the South, where it has gone down nationally.  A simple explanation: &quot;We shoot more people because we have the most guns.&quot;  Elvis Presley took guns when he visited the White House.  &quot;I'm sure he didn't even think about it.  He's going out, he's got his guns.&quot;  When her father visited her in her apartment in New Orleans, he failed to mention the high ceilings or the fancy plasterwork or mantels.  His one housewarming comment: &quot;You need to get a gun.&quot;  The title of the book comes from a turtle race, an annual event known as the Lepanto Terrapin Derby.  Turtles race on a sixty foot course for an exciting fifteen minutes.  There is a festival surrounding the event, and the climactic crowning of the Turtle Derby Queen.  The South has such royalty all over, not just the traditional beauty pageant queens, but the Catfish Queen, Poultry Princess, Miss Pink Tomato or monarch over some other local point of pride.  Southerners drink, and there is a chapter here on the bizarre history of Mississippi prohibition which included bootleggers of illegal whiskey paying legal taxes to ply their trade.  Southerners eat.  Personifying Southern hospitality, Reed gives here the recipes for George Jones Sausage Balls, which she got from the country singer himself, for that strange Southern misnomer the frozen tomato, and for fried chicken, although it won't be as good fried chicken as that from her own cook, Lottie Martin.<br />There is, appropriately, a good deal about religion, too, including the story about the Arkansas governor who refused to sign a tornado relief bill because it referred to the tornado as an &quot;act of God,&quot; and his God would never have done anything like that.  Perhaps, as Reed points out, he needed refreshing on the earlier books of the Bible.  Reed herself says that in New Orleans, there are mosquitoes, caterpillars with spines that are toxic even when the caterpillar is dead, feral hogs digging up the levees that protect the city, and indestructible Formosan termites that have bigger colonies and bigger appetites than the normal ones and can eat through mortar.  She used to say that living there is like living in the Old Testament.  She has realized, though, that &quot;the plagues of Egypt lasted only seven days.

That's the way it has been since around 1920, when photographers at British public schools developed the tradition.  And yet that is not the way it has always been, according to _A Brief History of the Smile_ (Basic Books) by Angus Trumble, a lively history of a subject no one might expect to have a history.  The photographer Cecil Beaton instructed his subjects to say \\"lesbian.\\"  In Australia there is a fashion for saying \\"money.\\"  Spaniards say \\"patata\\" (potato) and the Japanese use the English word \\"whisky.\\"  The Czechs used to use the Czech word for cheese, but now say \\"fax\\" which may hurtle them into modernity.  Plenty of languages don't have a smile word; the photographers just ask for a smile and the subjects do the best they can.  We don't smile just for the photographer, of course, and Trumble, a museum art curator, has a lot more to say about his subject, a pleasant history that he happily says is \\"about smiling in the broadest possible sense.\\"<br />The origin of this book was a surprise invitation to Trumble to address a convention of dentists.  As a curator of art, he was thought by the dentists to have something to say on the representation of teeth and beauty.  He began to examine smiles in art.  You can bet the _Mona Lisa_ is here, as is Frans Hals's _Laughing Cavalier_.  There is a famous \\"archaic smile\\" on early Greek sculpture.  The figures of young men and women stand stiffly, but their mysterious smiles give them a reassuring amount of life.  Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th century had a favorite subject of the \\"hennetaster,\\" or \\"chicken groper,\\" a boy who smiles as he feels up a hen to see if she has an egg on the way.  These enormously popular paintings were riotously funny to their owners and the guests to whom they were displayed; the humor in part derived from the interchangeability of the Dutch words for bird, birds, or hens with those for genitalia, women, coitus, and other double entendres.  The mysterious figure of the sheela incongruously may be found in Irish churches; she grins as she displays her genitals.  This image distressed art historians, one of whom depicted the sheela simply with her hands on her hips.  The figure is not like a repulsive gargoyle, however, and harks back to the magical women who would, for a fee, lift their skirts and show their genitals as a way of granting good luck.  Jesus smiles as he undergoes crucifixion in an abbey in Eichstatt, and some of the Romanesque sculptures, which otherwise have very small mouths, are brightened by surprising smiles.<br />This is a charming miscellany.  Here you will be able to find a little bit about gurning, not grinning, which is an extreme form of making faces, in competition, no less.  Lipstick sales go up when economics go down.  Geishas stained their teeth black to set them off against faces painted dead-white.  The nerves that make a natural smile are different from the ones activated when we force a smile, and so the two smiles look different; sometimes neurological patients will be able to do one of the smiles but not the other.  30% of Americans show their canine teeth when they smile, and only 67% turn up the corners of the mouth when they smile.  No one really knows why tiny babies smile except that it is a trick calculated to make the adults around them like them; of course it works.  Laughing has been thought to be bad taste; Lord Chesterfield advised his son, \\"The vulgar often laugh, but never smile; whereas well-bred people often smile, but seldom laugh.\\" King James enjoyed pulling other people's teeth as a pastime, and would pay them for the privilege.  We are smiling more heartily now; Trumble says this is because of modern dentistry, which encourages display of healthy teeth, and modern photography, which can catch a spontaneous smile when previously sitters had to keep immobile for long periods of time to make a portrait.  In chapters on themes such as Decorum, Lewdness, Deceit, and Desire, Trumble has covered more about smiles than you ever thought there could be.  He has a penetrating but light touch; this is not only a history of smiles but a stimulus to them.or long periods of time to make a portrait.

Actually, it would have been more accurate to have said &quot;Better killing through chemistry.&quot;  Du Pont was at the apex in the history of gunpowder, getting out of the outdated business only in 1971, but by then gunpowder had over ten centuries of effects on history.  In _Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, &amp; Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World_ (Basic Books), Jack Kelly has tied the explosive chemical not only to changes in war and international history, but has explained its effect on the inchoate sciences of chemistry and physics.  Kelly more often writes as a novelist, but here shows an impressive range of facts laid out with a novelist's eye to entertainment.<br />It is well known that the Chinese invented gunpowder (a combination of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter), but it is not true that the Chinese were happy to use gunpowder for fireworks and never used it in war.  They had incendiaries and primitive guns.  The gun was originally viewed as the weapon of cowards.  That anyone could use a gun, and that the results of such use were distant and consisted generally of random havoc rather than, say, a well-placed slice from a sword, took some of the valor out of fighting.  By the sixteenth century, cannons had developed into forms that would still be used in the American Civil War.  There was little scientific input into making either gunpowder or guns; it was, rather, the work of craftsmen who were the earliest engineers.  The craftsmen had to put up with an inherently dangerous arena.  Not only were accidental explosions common, but barrels inevitably exploded.  Gunpowder burns at hundreds of degrees hotter than the melting point of iron, and every shot eroded the barrel.<br />There is a good deal of military history here, naturally, and lots about the effects of gunpowder or lack thereof on such wars as the American Revolution or the Civil War.  Gunpowder had other effects, societal ones, changing the importance of class.  Kelly writes that since it enabled commoners to hold in their hands a new form of lethal power, gunpowder was &quot;...among the elements that fertilized the long slow growth of feelings of rights and entitlements that would blossom into democracy.&quot;  It also inspired physics.  Studying the trajectory of cannonballs, Galileo was able to overthrow the classical physical theories of Aristotle.  Newton, building on this, performed the famous thought experiment of firing a cannonball harder and harder from a mountain, hard enough eventually that the ball would only fall in maintaining an orbit around the earth; from there it was but a jump to celestial motions.  Eventually, gunpowder was surpassed by better chemicals; investigations into nitroglycerin and dynamite in the 19th century brought better-burning, safer means of shooting guns and cannons.  &quot;Black powder&quot; is now the name given to the gunpowder which is the subject of this interesting and wide-ranging history.  It is still manufactured, much going to the army of hobbyists and historical reenactors.  The greatest market, however, merely shows that things have not changed too much.  We take the same delight in fireworks as the Chinese did a thousand years ago, and use the same gunpowder for the charge.l War.

The complications of the human brain, however, have ensured that among all the organs of the body or other objects of investigation, it is the slowest to yield its secrets.  Especially over the past two decades there have been intense inquiry and surprising new tools for studying the brain, and in _Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life_ (Scribner), Steven Johnson has made himself a test subject for various means of looking at the brain.  He is a technology writer for Discover magazine, so he gets to try out gadgets for which most of us will never be guinea pigs.  His is a personal view of a universally fascinating subject, and a fine introduction to current brain science for those not familiar with the field.<br />The tests Johnson puts himself through and describes so openly are good subjects for his amused reflection.  For instance, a few years ago he was hooked up to a biofeedback machine, sensors attached to hands and forehead.  The machine was set to monitor adrenaline levels.  He felt nervous, and as is his habit, he deflected the nervousness by making jokes, to the audience of the biofeedback guy.  (His writing is loaded with good humor, too.)  And every joke he made showed up on the monitor as an adrenaline spike; suddenly the jokes &quot;... seemed less like casual attempts at humor and more like a drug addict's hungering for a new fix.&quot;  Here was a little chemical subroutine his brain had been putting itself through every day for almost all his life, and he had not known a thing about it.  He still could not explain why the adrenaline rush felt the way it did, but that's not important.  He wondered how many such little chemical subroutines his brain ran every day, or at any given moment, and what would he learn about himself if he could see them like his adrenaline spikes.  Each chapter here is a sampling of how he got to see another subroutine at work.  He looks at his capacity to mind-read, based on judging the emotions shown in pictures of eyes.  He tries on a neurofeedback helmet that has the potential for increasing attention, and thus decreasing the large amount of medicines children are taking to increase their attention spans these days.  He spends a session in a $2 million MRI machine, takes sojourns into different brain chemicals, recounts traumatic fears triggered when a window of his house was blown in almost catastrophically by a storm, experiences natural highs, and examines the biological and social importance of laughter.<br />Johnson winds up with a tribute to Freud, who realized that beneath the surface of our consciousness, there are all sorts of processes going on of which we are unaware.  The trouble with this, of course, is that while this insight was correct, the sorts of unconscious processes that can be looked at by the gadgets which Johnson describes are very far from the ones Freud thought were active.  The brain is full of busy neurons and designated centers for specific sorts of thought, but it &quot;is not seething with incest fantasies suppressed by the restrictions of civilized societies.&quot;  (In fact, the incest taboo seems more likely to be in our DNA, not in our cultures.)  But still, we all have so many &quot;...voices in our heads, all of them competing for attention, that it's a miracle we ever get anything done.&quot;  Just so.  Johnson has produced an entertaining, idiosyncratic introduction into brain function, highlighting the ways that brains are now open to us in ways they never could have been before.

The Enlightenment of the 18th century, I mean.  As Francis Wheen puts it, do you miss values such as insisting on intellectual autonomy, rejecting tradition and authority as the infallible sources of truth, loathing for bigotry and persecution, committing to free inquiry?  As you might expect, Wheen's enthusiasm for such ideals is not flagging, nor is his indignation that the ideals are not being upheld in our time.  In _Idiot Proof: Deluded Celebrities, Irrational Power Brokers, Media Morons, and the Erosion of Common Sense_ (PublicAffairs), Wheen whines at length about contemporary preposterousness in many forms.  The values of the Enlightenment are being betrayed every day, he demonstrates, and he does so with a fiery keyboard, an infectious sardonic laugh, and a huge command of examples.<br />In fact, the examples often seem so bizarre that they ought to be mere fiction.  Mawkish advice from management gurus like \\"When opportunity knocks, the entrepreneur is always home\\" or \\"Remember to expect miracles... because you  are one\\" may be found in volumes insisting that they were conveying management principles from Moses, Aristotle, Elizabeth I, Gandhi, or Star Fleet.  Deepak Chopra (a frequent target here) has intoned the Principle of Highest First: \\"Go first class all the way and the universe will respond by giving you the best.\\"  Wheen's book was first issued where he writes, in England (as _How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World_), and has an Anglo bent, but Americans will find much about their own leaders here.  President Clinton sought advice from a Hollywood mystic and a \\"sacred psychologist\\" who helped Hillary Clinton talk to Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary's \\"spiritual archetype.\\"  The current president Bush was put into office largely by those who agree with his close alliance with Israel, because according to fundamentalists, maintaining the nation of Israel is a necessary condition for the second coming of Jesus (they usually do not emphasize that the nation has to convert to Christianity, too).  Anyone expecting Wheen to skewer only one political philosophy, to let the liberals go while blasting conservatives, has only to read a few more pages on.  Noam Chomsky, Jerry Falwell, and the Ayatollah all get their turn.<br />It is all right that Wheen is over and over again just shooting fish in a barrel.  These are fish that deserve extinction.  Nostradamus, creationism, newspaper horoscopes, Enron, and new age trendies are all here, as is the teaching of the postmodernist Luce Irigaray that E = mc^2 is egregiously a \\"sexed equation\\" since it \\"privileges the speed of light over other less masculine speeds.\\"  The Cult of Diana is remembered with acerbity; one of London's airports risked being renamed Diana Airport, for \\"The People's Princess\\" and devotee of colonic irrigation.  A feng-shui consultant hired by the labor government to improve housing estates gave the invaluable lesson that red and orange flowers would reduce crime, \\"...and introducing a water feature would reduce poverty.\\"  Teachers have noticed that students cite \\"The X-Files\\" as a factual source; reminded that it was fiction, they counter that it was _based_ on fact.  Wheen knows that the Enlightenment ideals are not perfect.  Science only gives partial truths and must always be checked for its own prejudices or adherence to tradition.  But it gives a lot better answers than are being dished out by his targets here.

But John R. Clarke, a professor of the history of art, argues that the monuments of that glory, like the Arch of Constantine and the portraits of emperors, are not the full story.  There was other Roman art, like wall paintings and mosaics, which, especially if they were decorations in ordinary houses in Pompeii, were not previously regarded as art within art history.  When Clarke first began studying Roman art, these were objects of study in the everyday life of Romans.  This has changed, and &quot;everyday&quot; art of the Romans has become a respected target for academic study, not only for itself but for what it can tell us about the majority of Romans.  In _Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans: Visual Representation and Non-Elite Viewers in Italy, 100 B.C. - A.D. 315_ (University of California Press), Clarke lays out the importance of art made or commissioned by such lowly ones as slaves, former slaves, and freeborn workers.  Emperors and the wealthy represented themselves in artwork carrying out official and prestigious practices that would demonstrate their importance.  Non-elites tended more to want to depict ordinary acts, working, drinking, even brawling.  It isn't surprising that the &quot;unofficial&quot; art could tell us more about daily Roman life.<br />Clarke does begin by discussing how non-elites viewed the official art of the emperors, and then proceeds to the art that non-elites produced.  There are many examples here of art in domestic shrines, business-advertising, status boasting, and humor-provoking.  Clarke speculates, for example, that a painting from Pompeii previously thought to depict a man selling bread is actually a man giving out a bread dole.  There is no evidence of commerce; the receivers of the bread are exultant and do not themselves give up money.  The painting comes from a small house, not that of an elite citizen.  Clarke says that most likely this is the house of a baker who was prosperous, decided that at some point he would give bread away, and wanted to be depicted in his act of charity.  Viewers of his painting would have been reminded of the event, and the baker's prestige would have risen.  A completely different commemoration of a particular event is the painting from another house of a riot in the Pompeian amphitheater.  This depicted a real event arising somehow from hooliganism during games between the home and visiting teams, an event that caused Rome to forbid all gladiatorial shows in Pompeii for ten years.  The owner of the house went to the trouble of having an event that might be thought of as shameful commemorated on his walls.  Clarke gives evidence, from the placement of the picture and the subject, that the owner was a gladiatorial fan, who honored the gladiators by putting on display a commemoration of a riot held in their honor, perhaps a riot in which he himself took a glorious part.  Unlike the citizen who wanted people to remember the honorable act of giving out bread, the fan (and his buddies) liked remembering how the Roman social order could be disrupted.<br />Clarke's book is a serious academic tome, complete with scads of footnotes and a huge bibliography.  It is, however, written in an engaging style.  Clarke is careful to state when he is speculating from incomplete evidence, but even when he does speculate, the evidence is good, and his argument is convincing that art commissioned by these commoners is not a trickled-down version of the works of their betters, but something vibrant and significant to be appreciated on its own.  The book is beautifully produced, on glossy paper with, as is fitting, many illustrations.  The wealth of the patron, and the skill of the artist, may have put limits upon these works, but they show enormous creative breadth and, in Clarke's interpretations, surprising utility.ker who was prosperous, decided that at some point he would give bread away, and wanted to be depicted in his act of charity.

It worked in fiction; it never worked, not once, in any significant way, in actual spying.  Frederick P. Hitz, who has a long history of service with the CIA, knows this and says it is confirmed by former CIA director Robert M. Gates and case officer Dwight Clarridge.  In _The Great Game: The Myth and Reality of Espionage_ (Knopf), Hitz gives an overview of 20th century spying, comparing fiction to the real thing.  It will be a book best appreciated by those who are familiar with the work of such authors as le Carr&eacute; and Graham Greene, but it can be appreciated not just for the comparisons between fact and fiction, but for the many observations of fact about the spying game.<br />Rather than recruitments, there were walk-ins by Soviets; a spy (or potential spy) literally walked in to an embassy and offered his services.  Changing sides comes from diverse motivations.  Some Soviet walk-ins disliked the repression of the Soviet state.  Others needed money.  Aldrich Ames walked into the Washington Soviet embassy in 1985 with what he estimated was $150,000 in CIA and FBI secrets, ready to sell because he had a lot of bills for his extravagant way of living.  Frequently spies have resentment towards their own bureaucracies and failures to rise in them.  Sometimes people are tricked into spying.  Even the James Bond novels describe a specific sort of \\"honey pot\\" entrapment, whereby the sexual liaison would be filmed and the victim forced to spy if he wanted to avoid exposure.  The Soviets could apparently insist to attractive female workers that their bodies belonged to the state and had duties as lures, not the sort of order that western countries could make to their female employees.  It is interesting that honey pots did not work in the opposite direction for another reason.  Entrapped westerners would fret about exposure, but when such entrapment was tried on Soviets, they \\"...would invariably laugh off the threat of exposure as not very compelling in their country.\\"  Gadgets so beloved by the movies are downplayed here.  There have been, for example, extraordinary advances in miniaturization of microphones and transmitters, but a cat equipped with a microphone makes too many sounds of its own; thus the \\"Acoustic Kitty\\" of the Technical Support Division \\"died a deserved death as technically infeasible.\\"<br />Spy reality has affected spy fiction.  Where the heroes used to be unsung good guys doing their patriotic duties, after Vietnam and Watergate, novelists like le Carr&eacute; and Clancy wrote about obsessives, misfits, and power freaks who were interested in playing the spy game for itself rather than for national interest.  The end of the Cold War and the effect of terrorism have potential for bringing back the hero spy.  Perhaps we have hero spies now and Hitz simply is not able to sing their praises because they are still spying.  His book is good at giving details of such things as the treasons of Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, and also the contributions of Soviet double agents to the information Kennedy needed to decide on the Cuban blockade.  It is in giving these inside stories that Hitz succeeds in conveying his thesis: leaving aside the more fantastic Bondian conceits, \\"...real espionage cases are often more bizarre, more deserving of a place in Ripley's than the fictional accounts.\\"e opposite direction for another reason.

The first presidential assassination, that of Abraham Lincoln, has prompted countless books ever since, and endless questions of what our nation would have been like had he lived.  It might be thought that all the details have been covered, but Elizabeth D. Leonard, a professor of history at Colby College, has found a flawed hero who supervised the hunt and prosecution of the conspirators that killed Lincoln; his story is told in her book _Lincoln's Avengers: Justice, Revenge, and Reunion after the Civil War_ (Norton).  Of course the plotters' dirty work is covered here, and their prosecution and sentencing; it may be familiar, but it is told with vivid detail.  What is different in Leonard's book is that she shows how the political and national mood after the Civil War changed the outcome of those proceedings, which in turn had effects on Reconstruction itself.<br />Leonard tells this story by examining the life and work of Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, a former slaveholder who during the civil war was in charge of thousands of military commissions to prosecute both soldiers and civilians.  The day after Lincoln's assassination, Holt took charge of the detection of the conspirators and their prosecution.  It was only a matter of months before the military commission tried the conspirators, found all of them guilty, hanged four (including Mary Surratt, the first woman executed by the federal government) and imprisoned the others.  Many histories of these events end there, but Holt thought he was just getting started.  He had concluded that the assassination plot was instigated by Confederate leaders, including Jefferson Davis, and he was eager to pursue military commissions against them as well.  However, his support from President Johnson waned.  Setting up conflicts that would eventually get him impeached, Johnson pardoned thousands of Confederate leaders, and having declared the war officially over, removed any possibility that military commissions could continue.  He transferred Davis from military to civilian custody in Virginia, where he was released on bail.  The Supreme Court, in the famous _Ex Parte Milligan_ decision, overturned the military commission's conviction of civilian Confederate sympathizers.  Davis would never be brought before Holt's military commission.<br />There was the possibility that Davis might be tried in a civilian court, but Holt never got the hard evidence that would have been needed for a conviction.  Holt was led to bad judgements such as reliance on dubious, venal witnesses.  After a couple of years, Davis was completely free.  In 1867, Holt had a chance for a conviction (in civilian court) of Mary Surratt's son who had been captured overseas, but the divided jury, reflecting the divisions of the nation, did not convict.

It may be that we need reassurance that he is really and permanently dead, because the story of his end has been told many times.  There was room, however, for a comprehensive summary of Hitler's last days, and we now have one, told by a German who is a historian of the Third Reich and a reporter.  Joachim Fest, in _Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), has pulled together evidence and drawn a dramatic picture of those final days, and the immediate aftermath.  It won't be the last volume to examine this extraordinary subject, but it should be the current reference for anyone interested in it.<br />Hitler had known that the war was lost; he said as much four years before the Russians started to close upon Berlin.  After the Ardennes offensive failed, Hitler had returned to Berlin, where the air raids drove him for refuge into the bunker he had prepared for himself and his cronies.  It was more than thirty feet below the ground, about twenty reinforced rooms with few furnishings, even in Hitler's private rooms.  Each room had a naked lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.  The water system was untrustworthy, ventilation was bad, and diesel exhaust often pervaded the inside.  It was grim, and even Goebbels avoided the rooms as much as possible because they caused a \\"desolate mood.\\"  The night before his death, Hitler married Eva Braun.  Retiring to his room with her, he used a pistol and cyanide to bring their ends about.  In the bunker's canteen, the inmates sought relief from all the weeks of tension and danced to boisterous music over the loudspeakers.  An orderly had been sent up to ask for quiet, since the Fuhrer was about to die, but no one paid any attention.  The drinking and dancing only continued.<br />There were famous reports that Hitler had survived, reports that the tabloid press made much of during the next decades; there were plenty of conspiracy theories.  The Russians found a body that looked like Hitler, and insisted that they had his corpse.  It was just the sort of end he had not wanted, however, and he had taken precautions to make sure it did not occur.  A ration of gasoline was obtained, and the two bodies were cremated near the exit of the bunker.  What happened to the remaining dust can only be guessed at; artillery shelling and flamethrowers turned the area even more chaotic.  Some of Hitler's henchmen followed him in suicide, some fled.  Fest's book gives a rough description of the subsequent battle for Berlin, but this is mostly a ghastly story of awful gloom within a grotesquely unnatural cave.  It is a short book, in a readable translation, accompanied by vivid and shocking pictures, unrelieved by any light anecdotes or instances of individual heroism.  Fest's explanation of Hitler's motivation (\\"like a gang leader, he pursued a course that never went beyond the idea of killing and looting\\") is satisfactory, but perhaps no one can explain how with no coherent version of where he was leading Germany he could have been so staunchly supported for so long.  When Fest writes that Hitler's ashes wound up tamped into bombardment-plowed ground, \\"among chunks of blasted concrete and heaps of garbage,\\" it is clear that he has satisfaction that Hitler got the end he deserved.t the tabloid press made much of during the next decades; there were plenty of conspiracy theories.

We have difficulty viewing so far back, certainly because language and culture were different, but mostly because detailed records are scarce.  Robert Bartlett has provided a unique solution to give us as good an idea as possible &quot;...of the spoken words of the past in the time before the tape recorder&quot; in _The Hanged Man: A Story of Miracle, Memory, and Colonialism in the Middle Ages_ (Princeton University Press).  A professor of medieval history, he has examined closely a peculiar event for which there is rich documentation, a judicial commission which was an inquest into a supposed miracle.  While it might seem that such an inquest would be too arcane to give us much of an idea of medieval times, Bartlett has found that the sometimes conflicting testimony of witnesses and the process of the inquiry gives us a window through which we can almost see and hear our ancient ancestors and understand matters important to them.  Bartlett has produced an enjoyable volume of time travel.<br />It was probably in 1290 that William Cragh was hanged in Swansea.  William Cragh was perhaps merely a &quot;notorious brigand,&quot; but in the words of the English rulers of his region he was one of the rebels &quot;in the war between the Welsh and the lord king.&quot;  In fact, he was hanged three times.  The first time, the rope broke.  The second time, the gallows from which it was suspended broke.  The third time seemed to have worked just fine.  His body was taken down and carried to a house in Swansea for preparation for burial.  Its face was black, its eyes bulging, its black and swollen tongue extended.  The son of the baron who had condemned him confirmed that William Cragh was dead.  But he gradually came back to life.  This particular revivification was fraught with religious meaning.  William Cragh on his way to the gallows gave a prayer for his life to Thomas de Cantilupe, the recently deceased Bishop of Hereford.  Thus, his return to life had the makings of a religious miracle, and an inquest had to be done to make sure.  The interrogation of witnesses is the backbone for Bartlett's book.  Along the way, we learn about attitudes towards saints, the means of measuring distance and time, and other details of the way the participants lived.<br />Thomas de Cantilupe got made a saint by a very long process.  Canonization was requested seventeen years before the inquest actually happened in 1307, and then there was a long process of approval before Thomas was made a saint in 1320.  This was a time of flux for the papacy, with five different popes and years when there was no pope, which partially explains the delay.  What shooed Thomas in was a consistent public relations campaign from the local Bishop and the fellows he enlisted, sending fan letters.  Also, King Edward I had strong interest, because he had known Thomas personally.  Thomas has served on Edward's royal council, and Edward was eager (as he himself wrote), &quot;... to have as a sympathetic patron in heaven him whom we had in our household on earth.&quot;  While Bartlett's fascinating book tells a lot about the intricate process of sanctification, it tells a lot more about the people of medieval times and their world view.omas de Cantilupe, the recently deceased Bishop of Hereford.

Such a work is the _Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia_ (Steidl / Fuel), featuring mostly the drawings of tattoos by Danzig Baldaev, with photos by Sergei Vasiliev, and an explanatory essay by Alexei Plutser-Sarno.  In these photos and tattoos, which I guarantee you are like nothing you have ever seen before, are reflected the horrors of Russia written on the skins of criminals.  As strange as the pictures are, they are not so foreign as to eliminate sadness and tragedy; this is a book of devastation on many levels, and anyone flipping through the images will be enlightened about a very distant world, but also will be distressed and mystified.<br />The majority of pages are Danzig Baldaev's drawings of tattoos he has collected during a lifetime as a prison attendant.  The book could not be published before, but Baldaev has brought it out now as a protest of the \\"long time all of us lived under the leadership of villains, tricksters, and bandits.\\"  There are what are called \\"legitimate thieves\\" in Russia.  They represent a robber caste, criminals who have their own code of laws and obey it.  It is in some part hereditary; there are tattoos here that proclaim proudly \\"My father was a thief.\\"  The legitimate thieves have a strict hierarchy that extends inside and out of prison, and are reputed to have representatives in all levels of the government and police.  They have special control of life in \\"the zone\\", the prison camps, where most of the tattoos are applied.  The tattoos are a type of uniform and a service record.  In prison slang, someone's tattoos are known as his (or her) \\"tail coat with medals.\\"  The initiated may read on the criminal's body his crimes, his duration of imprisonment within the zone, his sexual proclivities, and much more.  It might seem that bearing the initials of the Unified State Political Administration would attest the bearer's interest in keeping to the party line, but they actually stand for \\"Oh, God, help me to escape!\\"  A tattoo may testify to \\"God,\\" but only because the letters of that name are the initials for \\"I shall rob again.\\"  The anti-communist nature of many of these tattoos is obvious.  From Lenin to Yeltsin, leaders are depicted as wolves, pigs, or rapists.  These convicts are not dissidents, just outcasts who reject any sort of authority except that of their own brotherhood.  Grotesquely anti-Semitic pictures of devils have a strange twist; they demonize the Jewish leaders who started the communist state.  A swastika means not Nazism but anarchism.<br />The tattoos show a horrifying eagerness for violence against women, Jews, and politicians.  They are funny sometimes, but also bitterly cruel.  The photographs of the bearers, however, show tired or shy faces, or even angelic ones with eyes looking heavenward.  This is a disturbing and astonishing book of a subculture and a way of life still playing a role in current affairs.Administration would attest the bearer's interest in keeping to the party line, but they actually stand for \\"Oh, God, help me to escape!\\"  A tattoo may testify to \\"God,\\" but only because the letters of that name are the initials for \\"I shall rob again.\\"  The anti-communist nature of many of these tattoos is obvious.

Josiah Harlan, born in 1799, was barely remembered as a footnote from the First Afghan War, and understandably was snubbed by the British historians of that conflict.  Reporter Ben Macintyre, researching the history of the area in order to cover its current events, found references to Harlan and became intrigued.  He hunted for Harlan clues in Afghanistan itself, and was led to a tiny local museum in Chester County, Pennsylvania.  He came upon what other biographers can only dream of getting: a previously unknown autobiography handwritten by the subject.  There was also an ancient proclamation making Harlan absolute ruler of a principality in Afghanistan.  Indeed, Harlan inspired a Kipling story, which in turn brought the wonderful John Huston film, and which has now given Macintyre's book its title: _The Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistan_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux).  His life is as surprising and exciting as the fictions it inspired.<br />Harlan first sailed to Calcutta and Canton in a commercial venture in 1820.  On a subsequent voyage, while he was in Calcutta, he learned that his fianc&eacute;e back home in Philadelphia had married another.  Emotionally adrift, hearing that the British were about to go to war against Burma, he signed on as a surgeon to the East India Company.  Macintyre writes, &quot;That he had never actually studied medicine was not, at least in his own mind, an impediment.&quot;  His service over, he signed on with an exiled king to lead an army to reclaim Afghanistan, but he had plenty of intrigues and shifts of alliances before that could happen.  Eventually he would meet up with the Hazara tribe, which in turn wanted him to create their own invincible military.  Of course, he had a price; the prince &quot;transferred his principality to me in feudal service, binding himself and his tribe to pay tribute forever.&quot;  Harlan had indeed become a king.  He also imagined himself a sort of reincarnated Alexander the Conqueror, following Alexander's trails.  He even took on his conquests an elephant, the symbol and mascot of the Macedonian conqueror, but it could eventually take no more of the mountain cold.  Harlan took comfort in that having to send back the elephant, he was once again emulating Alexander, who had had to leave his own elephant troops behind for the same reason.<br />Harlan's enterprising assumption of command and kingdom was only put to an end by the Great Game between Britain and Russia in their struggle over the area.  He tried to play along, with the plots and shifting alliances that he used for all his fifteen years in the region, but eventually the British booted him out, or in his version, he was disgusted by how the British treated the Afghan natives and sent himself home.  He remained active, and was on hand to advise the American government in 1854 about the feasibility of the introduction of camels into the west.  Harlan admired the beasts, and it is safe to say that no American knew more about them, but he did not take into account that American horses, not raised with camels, would be unmanageable around them and that cattle would stampede when they saw them.  He also tried to become the government advisor on the introduction of Afghan grapes into America; he adored the produce of the region, but any plans of return to the area for agricultural efforts were cut short by the Civil War.  Always horrified by slavery, he raised a Union regiment, but he was used to dealing with military underlings in the way an oriental prince would.  This led to a messy court-martial, but the aging Harlan ended his service due to medical problems.  He wound up in San Francisco, working as a doctor, dying of tuberculosis in 1871.  He was essentially forgotten.  His rediscovery, in this fast-moving and entertaining biography, is now especially welcome as a timely illumination into the beginnings of dealings between the mysterious Afghanistan and the U.S.and entertaining biography, is now especially welcome as a timely illumination into the beginnings of dealings between the mysterious Afghanistan and the U.S.	2004-05-14

His father was a director of an engineering lab, his mother a retired psychotherapist, one brother an aspiring Hollywood producer, and another brother an MIT graduate mechanical engineer.  Stephen, therefore, was sort of a black sheep in a family of achievers.  He had as a suitable project the restoration of a cottage in Palo Alto, where he was working in 1997.  It was there that he put the key into a door, and it was stuck.  He could not turn it, even though the lock was new, top-of-the-line, and previously working well.  This simple problem puts into motion the events described in _His Brother's Keeper: A Story from the Edge of Medicine_ (Ecco) by Jonathan Weiner.  Weiner has previously given wonderful accounts of current evaluations of the evolution of Darwin's finches and of the genetics of fruit flies, but here he has given a deeply human portrait of the effect of illness on one family.  The problem is not the lock; Stephen dismantled it and it was in full working order.  Then he discovered that he could turn the key if he used his other hand.  The problem was within his own body.<br />It was Stephen's first signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often called Lou Gehrig's disease.  ALS inactivates neurons which control the muscles.  The muscles atrophy and eventually even those involved in breathing cannot function, so that the victim dies of suffocation.  Death comes almost always within five years after the condition has been diagnosed, and most patients die within two years.  Stephen's engineer brother, Jamie, had tackled many projects, many problems, and had overcome them all.  Surely finding a cure for Stephen's condition was just one more problem, essentially an engineering problem.  It didn't matter that he was a mechanical, not chemical or biochemical or genetic, engineer.  Jamie immersed himself in ALS research, first on the Internet, of course, and then in the medical journals.  He found that one factor getting the blame is the overproduction of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which kills off spinal nerves.  He set up a foundation to power his efforts, and eventually a biotech company.  He got contributions from his family, and his wife belly-danced to make money at benefit performances.  The odds against success were overwhelming, while Stephen lost one function after another, providing the tension within the story.<br />It all should have turned out differently.  It would be unfair to give away the specific ending of the book, but suffice it to say that Stephen at the end is heroically, calmly beating the odds in his own way, helped by a wife who is devoted to him and a family that cares for its lovable black sheep.  He refuses to see himself as victim or hero, just prey to a &quot;normal accident.&quot;  He also does not mythologize Jamie's race for a cure, seeing it as a hunt for a &quot;normal miracle.&quot;  Jamie remains enthusiastic; it is clear that his own hubris in his project is only his individual partaking of the larger over-optimism of molecular medicine.  The latter is obvious in the death of an eighteen-year-old in a clinical trial of gene therapy in 1999; as a result, the plans for gene therapy for Stephen had to be abandoned.  Weiner himself shows that he has been disillusioned by medical hype.  This is an often inspiring story of good intentions and hope, however; it isn't the fault of any of the people described herein, including the author, that hope is sometimes misplaced.e factor getting the blame is the overproduction of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which kills off spinal nerves.

There is even folklore that if you dream that you hit the ground, you die before you wake up (how could anyone tell this?).  The universal falling dream is not mentioned in _Falling: How Our Greatest Fear Became Our Greatest Thrill - A History_ (Norton) by Garrett Soden, but the book brightly examines the universality of thinking about falling, fearing it, and enjoying it.  The fascination and fear of falling is so basic that it undoubtedly came to us from our arboreal ancestors.  We are land animals; if we swim or take to the air, we are doing something unnatural.  The time we have been on the ground and walking upright is actually much less than the time we were in the trees.  We fear falling, but we get a kick out of a controlled fall, perhaps because controlled falling was necessary as we swung among the trees, and uncontrolled falling was to be avoided.  We are newcomers to the flat world, but we carry with us instinctive respect for the power of gravity, and for the kicks it can give us.<br />It is a surprise that a history could be written about falling, but according to Soden, the real history of falling starts in the eighteenth century.  Before that time, people were simply terrified of it.  Even acrobats stuck basically to the ground and did not fall very far.  Not only did people do their best to avoid high falls, they did not for amusement watch others risking high falls.  But in the eighteenth century gravity performers became stars.  Springboard leapers, mountaineers, and parachutists gave audiences thrills.  Many authorities detested that the public liked such things, even though the performers insisted that they were making scientific explorations, not barbarous entertainments.  The movies proved to be a fine showcase for falling stunts, and stuntmen became a new profession.  Many of the gravity activities have now blossomed into the &quot;Extreme Sports&quot; that are popular with young people.  BMX biking, skateboarding, barefoot water-ski jumping, bungee jumping, and free-solo rock climbing (without ropes) all have their adherents, and their place on television.  If you lack coordination for such activities, there is always the amusement park.<br />Although much of this book is devoted to &quot;not falling&quot; or at least not getting hurt in doing so, there is also a serious review of risk-taking and what sort of people do it.  Research has shown that the &quot;death wish&quot; hypothesized by Freud is simply not working in those who take part in such activities, although it may seem to the rest of us that they are getting excitement by courting death.  There are high-sensation types and low-sensation types, but the high-sensation types don't enjoy risk any more than anyone else.  For instance, they use such things as seat belts and condoms at the same rate as most people.  It turns out that high-risk people who are engaged in such things as free-solo rock climbing do the simple, rational thing: they reduce risk by increasing their skill.  It may well be that the neural wiring of the highs is indeed different from the lows and may be able to process lots of incoming data more efficiently.  Soden goes on to show that our languages reflect the negative nature of falls, as in &quot;falling down on the job&quot;.  Icarus fell, and Lucifer fell.  Yet we chase the sensation of falling, or the danger of a potential fall.  Soden's surprising book gives amusing insight into the paradoxical attractiveness of rapid descent.Sports&quot; that are popular with young people.

But what of &quot;that firefighter who is on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year&quot;?  That is the way Commissioner James T. Joyce of the Chicago Fire Department describes the firehouse dog in the introduction to _The Firefighter's Best Friend: Lives and Legends of Chicago Firehouse Dogs_ (Lake Claremont Press) by Trevor J. Orsinger and Drew F. Orsinger.  It is no exaggeration to say that these dogs are for the most part not ornaments, not pets, but working dogs, busy with their responsibilities and taking them seriously.  The authors are not firemen, but like many people, they admire firemen, and they realized that though there are volumes to record the history of the Chicago Fire Department, there were none devoted to its dogs.  For some reason Chicago has a lot of these dogs, perhaps more than anywhere, and the stories here are funny, loving, and inspiring.<br />It is commonly thought that firedogs are just for show, good public relations for fire departments.  They do get trotted out for photo ops and in parades, but many of the dogs here have valued roles as real worker dogs.  Engine 30 has a dog named Thirty, a Dalmatian that has made 14,000 runs over the past nine years.  Once on the scene, many dogs are eager to get into the work, helping to haul hoses or even entering buildings that are on fire.  Many of the dogs are useful ratters.  Dogs who stay in the firehouse are charged with guarding the valuables the firemen leave behind.  It is significant that Chicago firehouse dogs do not have normal dog lifespans.  Some of them die in the line of duty, boldly accompanying their men into burning buildings.  Bruno of Engine 19 died from cancer caused by repeated smoke inhalation.  Dogs do fall off speeding engines.  Rags of Engine 24 stepped into water that had been electrified by a fallen wire and died, but his death ensured that his firemen avoided the same fate.  One dog after another here is described as meeting death by being hit by a car at the scene.  Sometimes dogs are too slow to move out and are run over by their own trucks, and more than one has been killed by being shut in the big firehouse door.  Sometimes the fire station is in a bad part of town and the residents attack the dogs as symbols of authority.  The other great hazard is obesity; the firemen all love to give their dogs table scraps.<br />There are lots of fine pictures here of dogs happily sitting on their engines, climbing ladders, marching in parades, posing for formal pictures with their crews, obligingly wearing fire hats, and being petted by guys who love them.  There are plenty of dogs named Smokey here, and also Sparky, Ashes, and even Arson.  There are stories of the far less successful firepig, fireduck, firegoose, and firegoat.  There are great stories of heroic dogs, and if one or two have become exaggerated in the retelling by the firemen, that is only a tribute to the love and respect the firehouse crews bear for their mascots.he same fate.

But everyone has heard the phrase &quot;the four minute mile.&quot;  It might be arbitrary, but as a footrace there is also some symmetry to it.  Four minutes, four times around the quarter mile track, a strict fifteen miles per hour.  For years, the four minute mile was a monument as an impenetrable barrier, and when Roger Bannister broke the barrier fifty years ago, the whole world took notice.  It was Bannister's victory, of course, and often he was depicted as a lone athlete out to break the record, but there is more to the story.  In _The Perfect Mile: Three Athletes, One Goal, and Less than Four Minutes to Achieve It_ (Houghton Mifflin), Neal Bascomb gives a full and exciting history of events leading to one of the most impressive accomplishments in sports.<br />Necessarily, the other two runners, Australian John Landy and American Wes Santee are mere also-rans, but their efforts were heroic, and as Bascomb makes clear, there may have been only matters of happenstance, like weather, that kept them from being first.  Like Bannister, they had failed to get medals in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, and returned home determined to take the four minute mile upon their return home.  Bannister was restricted by his medical studies; he could not train for hours every day, as the others did, so he had to concentrate his training into exhausting short daily bursts.  His medical background helped, however, in researching the effects of exercise, giving him scientific assurance he could do it.  On 6 May 1954 Bannister made a real try at the barrier.  He had, by that time, taken on a coach, and he had two friends to serve as pacemakers.  The breaking of the record was a worldwide sensation.<br />It is not, however, the perfect mile of the title.  Even the jubilant British press questioned just how cricket it was to use pacemakers and not sheer competition, and the three aspirants in the quest had never run against each other.  The three were scheduled to run in the Empire games in Vancouver three months after Bannister's epochal run, which would satisfy everyone as to who was the fastest miler.  The only pacemakers would be the runners themselves.  There were heartbreaking complications that prevented Santee from running; they had to do with US athletic authorities who persecuted and banned him because he allegedly breached his amateur status.  Both Bannister and Landy did under four minutes in Vancouver in an exciting race, thrillingly described here.  This was a classic victory.  There was no hint of doping, television did not make it into an extravaganza, and the competitors were not millionaires.  The result made front page headlines all over the world; what subsequent footrace has done that?  _The Perfect Mile_ thus takes us back to a simpler time, but this is a welcome story of timeless heroes.three aspirants in the quest had never run against each other.

Reaching back into history as far as 1999, predating most \\"blogs,\\" was the work of Lisa Carver, who wrote \\"The Lisa Diaries\\" for Nerve.com, an enthusiastic and serious adult site that even has a mission statement.  The statement begins, \\"We have created Nerve because we think sex is beautiful and absurd, remarkably fun and reliably trauma-inducing.\\"  Lisa's work fit into that mission perfectly, and her column became the most read part of Nerve.  From 1999 to 2001 she wrote about her sexual activities, which included meeting Dave, falling in love with him, marrying him, and negotiating her way around an open marriage to keep it from falling apart.  Now the diary entries along with earlier material have been published as _The Lisa Diaries: 4 Years in the Sex Life of Lisa Carver and Company_ (Black Books).  It is frank, funny, and sometimes even moving.  Lisa is actually a nice woman, out for a good time, and she enjoys the complications that this can cause.  She writes of the marriage, \\"Ours is a tale of marital problems and solutions, just with a few more penises and vaginas than usual.\\"  Tellingly, the solutions are practical and rather sweet.<br />This is because Dave and Lisa really do have a high regard for each other, which shows through all her adventures.  Lisa never tried anonymity, so Dave from the beginning knew he would be a subject in a public diary.  Lisa has a rule of not having sex with her readers: \\"I feel like they would be too busy imagining how they'd be written up while we did it.\\"  Like most rules, it is one Lisa likes breaking.  She had a contest among her readers, a multiple choice test of math and history questions, and the prize was to have sex with her and Dave.  There are no entries in etiquette books to cover this sort of circumstance, Lisa handled it all with aplomb and good humor.  In another adventure, Lisa sends Dave into a brothel for some R & R, and when Dave explains to the woman, \\"My wife sent me in here.  She thought it would be fun,\\" he got the reply, \\"Oh, well... huh, I guess if that works for you...\\"  Lisa remarks, \\"A prostitute disapproved of our lifestyle!\\"<br />These adventures are shared between Dave and Lisa with considerable boldness.  They trust one another, and get permission from one another to do naughty things, and if they can't get permission, they nicely refrain.  Lisa likes doing outrageous things, but there is a sweetness here communicated in the middle of a lot of outrageous adventures.  She knows that sleeping with someone else is different from loving that person: \\"... it would be wrong to let someone else borrow Dave's space in my heart, even for a minute.\\" Or: \\"[Dave's] always right there, when I can't even go on a date without thinking about him.\\"  Lisa did not set out to write a didactic work, but there are good lessons here: \\"Anonymous sex or competitive sex never brings you the awareness of life that comes with love.\\"  Readers should be willing to accept that as true, since it comes from one who has enough experience to know.  But readers will also be glad Lisa has written about all those other kinds of sex as well.  This is an exuberant work from a woman with an original voice and an enthusiasm for oddity and novelty, but also, quite charmingly, for kindness and love.ure, Lisa sends Dave into a brothel for some R & R, and when Dave explains to the woman, \\"My wife sent me in here.

The books are so well known that they have, according to one report, been quoted more than any other source except the Bible and Shakespeare.  The timelessness of the appeal of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ and _Through the Looking Glass_ can easily be appreciated in the book _Alice's Adventures: Lewis Carroll in Popular Culture_ (Continuum) by Will Brooker.  It is an examination of the manifestations of Alice in the past fifteen or so years, with some attention paid for historic context to the rest of the twentieth century.  That there is still lively participation by Alice in many surprising aspects of our modern world is a cheerful reminder of how good the original books are, and Brooker's own witty book gives hope that Alice will always have a role to play in the culture of any age.<br />But Carroll (actually The Reverend Charles L. Dodgson) himself has in the past decade played a darker role than he ever did before.  In an age when we worried about pedophiles, and also worried needlessly about people accused in atrocious error of being pedophiles, Carroll's fascination for little girls has become suspect and smutty.  Academic papers have been issued to reinforce such views, but all are largely circumstantial.  Thus it seems wiser to think of Carroll with more magnanimity, and to remember that he was never in his time considered anything more threatening than a respectable Oxford don with an eagerness to entertain by mathematical and linguistic puzzles and stories.  The popular press has followed the academic lead, however.  The darker themes of Wonderland have been brought out in recent illustrations for the books, but even here, \\"... none of these illustrators taps to any noticeable degree into the reading of _Alice_ as steeped in sexual overtone...\\"  Brooker shows how the original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel have always influenced subsequent illustrators.  Brooker has great fun taking part in the activities of the Lewis Carroll Society, and finds a pleasant peer pressure: when he wrote to other members he found himself gradually using an address that was much more formal and polite \\"...than I would ever have used towards, say, the _Star Wars_ fans of my previous research.\\"<br /><br />_Alice's Adventures_ gives a look back to how other generations interpreted the tales.  The stories don't have pedophilia in them, but these suppositions color our current view of the author.  In the 1930s, there were abundant psychoanalytic interpretations, and in the 1960s there were psychedelic interpretations.  Brooker  also spends a chapter on an animated computer shooter game, \\"Dark Wonderland,\\" with Alice as a sexually provocative heroine.  The books themselves, however, represent to Brooker \\"...an innocent, timeless, very English work of charming fantasy, suitable for reissue to another generation of young readers.\\"  In showing Alice in current culture, Brooker has written an admiring tribute to Carroll and his creation that will have the laudable effect of getting readers to look again at an inspired original.ny noticeable degree into the reading of _Alice_ as steeped in sexual overtone...\\"  Brooker shows how the original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel have always influenced subsequent illustrators.

The fans have not diminished in number since Gould's death at age fifty in 1982.  Gould was a consummate musician who brought light to neglected but important works, but he was also an oddball who adored the Mary Tyler Moore Show, (...), popped dozens of pills every day to help him over imaginary illnesses, and refused to come out of self-imposed isolation to play a recital for a million-dollar fee.  There has been an authorized biography of Gould before, but now _Wondrous Strange: The Life and Art of Glenn Gould_ (Oxford University Press) by Kevin Bazzana must be the one for all fans to have.  Bazzana is the editor of nothing less than GlennGould magazine, and has written a previous book about Gould's musicianship.  He brings helpful light on such topics as the influence of Gould's one piano teacher and his love of Canada and his home town Toronto.  He is especially helpful in illuminating Gould's early life.<br />Gould's parents were conservative, strict Protestants who stressed propriety as he was growing up in Toronto's Beach district.  They had to make sure he did not practice too much (not too little, like most parents of young musicians) and learned that the strictest punishment they ever needed to enforce was locking up the piano.  He remained close to them all his life, only moving out of their home when his parents were elderly in 1959.  He knew he was going to be a classical pianist from age around five.  He loved his neighborhood and the people who knew he was freakish or famous, but treated him as if he were just an unusual guy.  He hated performing and touring.  Even so, his performances were regarded by many as high points in their lives as listeners.  Among the many stories told here is that of his first Russian concert, in Moscow.  The auditorium was only a third full, but at intermission, concertgoers hurriedly called their friends to tell them what was going on.  There was a small riot for tickets for the second half of the show.<br />It was the recording studio to which he was devoted and to which he retired from his hated performing.  His premiere recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations in 1955 brought to attention a piece that had only rarely been performed or recorded before, being thought too difficult and rarefied.  The recording was a sensation, and remains one of the bestselling classical discs of all time.  (It ought to be; there is no better join of dazzling technique, speedy fingers, and loving intimacy with the music.)  He liked working with the technicians who helped record his performances, and had good humor in the sessions, but it was him in front of the microphone, in the isolation he preferred; he wrote, \\"Isolation is the one sure way to human happiness.\\"  Bazzana relishes the multiple enigmas that Gould presents, and this one is surely key: Gould isolated himself right into millions of homes, where it was obvious he communicated something important.  Today, worshipful listeners, some of whom were not alive when he was, make pilgrimages to see his home sites, and his rickety old chair which he used whenever he played.  He said that the purpose of art is \\"... the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity.\\"  If that is the purpose of art, he would have admired this graceful, readable, big biography that underscores the full complexity of a monumentally enigmatic artist.ll them what was going on.

Richard Barber has done a survey of newspapers and other timely publications and found that people are seeking Holy Grails all the time, but may have no idea about the historic origin of the name for that quest.  A unified theory is the Holy Grail of physics, Marmite's range of vitamins make it the Holy Grail of foodstuffs, and fashion designers somewhere are seeking the Holy Grail of \\"nude\\" tights.  These seekers may not know the Grail by name, but the idea of a quest for something perfect, something elusive, something that really is never going to be found is a universal one.  In _The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief_ (Harvard University Press), Barber, a British authority on medieval history, has made an exhaustive study of the origins of the Grail legend and how, over 800 years, the legend has been changed, used, misused, parodied, and revered.  This is a big, academic reference book, but the appeal of the subject and Barber's erudition and sense of fun make it enticing reading.<br />There may have been a Grail tradition in stories and in pictures, but no one wrote them down until Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, who wrote, among other things, an unfinished romance about Perceval around 1180.  Chr&eacute;tien never finished his story, and didn't say much about the Grail in it, but the idea of this holy relic was so strong that in the succeeding fifty years, several poets from various countries not only completed the tale but added their own material and themes.  Barber, going through the conflicting Grail stories, argues that there is little evidence that there is any \\"true source\\" for the Grail except Chr&eacute;tien's stories and their descendents.  Their context is the orthodox Christianity of the period, but the Church itself officially and studiously ignored the stories.  The stories, however, emphasized the importance of the Eucharist, the spiritual aspirations of knightly questing, and the value of veneration of relics.  Barber's book takes Grail lore up to the current times (yes, including Monty Python), including the vessels that people have sufficient faith (or gall) to insist are the real McCoy.  Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee had some fun with the Grail: \\"The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was a several-years' cruise. Every year expeditions went out holy Grailing and next year relief expeditions went to hunt for them. There was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.\\"<br />Twain's remarks are happier than the other modern manifestations of the legend.  The crowd that sees international, centuries-long conspiracies at the heart of all history all value the Grail.  Alchemists, Nazis, New Agers, Rosicrucians, and the like have all made some sort of claim to it, and if having religious faith in the item is not sufficient, they have backed up their connections to it using astrology, Tarot cards, ley-lines, and other such evidence.  As Barber says, \\"We are not far... from the world of the flying saucer enthusiasts and alien visitors.\\"  In fact, one author has identified the Grail as a flying saucer.  The lore of the Holy Grail fits all because there is so little to work on, and imaginations can make of it what they will.  Barber knows that the force that has shaped the Grail is not history, not fact, but imagination \\"... the creative thought that subtly built on an unfinished story.\\"  Aspiration to acquisition of the unattainable has produced art and silliness, all well documented in an authoritative book.'s book takes Grail lore up to the current times (yes, including Monty Python), including the vessels that people have sufficient faith (or gall) to insist are the real McCoy.

698664:US	50895620	R3GAU7ZBS9YYRY	1582343853	372577569	Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants	Books	5	88	94	N	N	Rats, Sure, But Mostly Humans	Last year when I visited New York City I went running in Central Park, and the very first squirrel I saw was no squirrel at all, but a rat.  According to Robert Sullivan, this would have been a good sign of the prosperity of the colony from which that rat had emerged.  Rats go out at night, usually, and one edging out during the day means that the colony is pushing out beyond its usual boundaries.  Sullivan has made a hobby out of rat-watching, and has written a peculiar and fascinating book about his adventures with his own rat pack, _Rats: Observations on the History &amp; Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants_ (Bloomsbury).  It isn't only (or even mostly) about his observed colony in an alley a few blocks away from Wall Street, but about city rats in general and their history of living with us.  Because of this, Rats isn't really about rats, but about the humans who have imported them and given them garbage to live on and then have been annoyed when they flourish and stupefied when they refuse eradication.<br />Sullivan found a cobblestone passageway near City Hall called (note the irony) Edens Alley.  His fascination for it was founded on the rats' fascination for the provided food, bags of garbage from a market and two restaurants.  He spent night after night in the alley, with night-vision glasses and a folding stool.  Nights spent there, he spent days doing research, which has lead to some surprising facts; since rats are important to us as pests, there has been a great deal of research done on them, much of it practical and some of it less so.  For instance, rats can become immune to poison; even the first anticoagulant medications that were put into bait no longer work in many places, so using them just gives the rats a free meal.  Rats are not limited to being pests; they also have been entertainment.  In the middle of the nineteenth century, you could go to Kit Burns's Sportsman's Hall to see rat fights.  They have played their roles in the unionization of the sanitation workers, and in the civil rights struggle.<br />It is surprising at first to find that the World Trade Center plays a large role in this book.  Sullivan talks to an exterminator who says he isn't an exterminator; he is a &quot;pest control manager,&quot; reflecting the realistic view that rats will never be exterminated, but might be controlled from time to time, and even excluded from some areas.  He had the contract for the WTC after the first bombing in 1993.  Office workers evacuated the building, but they left the food they had out on every story to the delight of the rats.  &quot;We did top to bottom,&quot; he says of the rat clean-up.  When the towers fell in 2001, there had been restaurants in the buildings, and restaurants nearby with food out which had to be abandoned, but not by the rats.  It was impossible to do any rodent-proofing; the rats could come and go as they pleased.  But one firm put out thousands of bait stations, and with good reason.  When the technicians descended into the dust-filled lower levels of the foundations, they could see the tracks of thousands of rats which were tracing paths through the dust.  The fall of the towers meant that Sullivan could not get into his alley to do more observations for a while, but by the time he did, the rats were back.  This is a surprise-filled book of odd facts, strange personalities, and an eccentric narrator, who reacted to the return of his rats after the crisis by being filled with hope.  If the rats are back, then the city is returning to its normal operation.onization of the sanitation workers, and in the civil rights struggle.<br />It is surprising at first to find that the World Trade Center plays a large role in this book.

Yardley and the Birth of American Codebreaking	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A Forgotten Intelligence Innovator	Despite its current reputation, there were times when American intelligence (meaning spying) was an unalloyed success.  For many, the most interesting part of the spy business is signals intelligence, tuning into or breaking into foreign messages and decoding them.  There has been signals intelligence of some sort ever since there has been international conflict, but the field took off when messages could be transmitted wirelessly.  Anyone could pick up the signal, so the trick was to encode it; the counter-trick was to crack the code.  Cryptographers and other spies already know and respect the name of Herbert O. Yardley.  He isn't well known by others, but almost fifty years after his death, he has gotten a full, instructive biography, _The Reader of Gentleman's Mail: Herbert O. Yardley and the Birth of American Codebreaking_ (Yale University Press) by David Kahn.  Kahn is the perfect teller of this tale, having written both articles for scholarly journals as well as popular books about intelligence matters.  There is not a great deal of detail about the procedures of decryption, which are described only generally, but there is a unique American life here.  According to Kahn, Yardley better than anyone foresaw how important cracking signals could be to American intelligence.  He created the first permanent agency to intercept messages and break them.  He was &quot;the most colorful and controversial figure in American intelligence,&quot; and his controversial actions are fully included here.<br />Yardley came to Washington DC in 1914, working as a telegrapher in the State Department.  He was fascinated by the messages that came in and out, and determined that he would give his life to cryptography.  His efforts within the Army Signal Corp were effective, but more important even than the wartime accomplishments was that Yardley convinced the Army and State Department to continue signal intelligence after Armistice Day.  He believed that the stream of international communications could indicate the attitudes and plans of nations who were our friends as well as our foes.  He was right; his work ensured that America knew what the aims of the Japanese were at the arms limitation talks in 1921, saving the government millions of dollars and buying some years of peace.  Those who thought that &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other's mail&quot; eventually closed his bureau down.  Yardley was, at different times in his life, to make up cryptogram puzzles for magazines, to go into the invisible ink business, to write novels, to write screenplays for Hollywood, to run a restaurant, and to attempt commercial orange-juice distillation, as well as to become decoder-for-hire for Canada and China.  He made a hit with his first book in 1931, The American Black Chamber, which caused immediate furor, about his government decryptions.  He showed what his bureau had done, and the reading public was very much interested.  He was accused of treason, but Kahn shows that Yardley was merely trying to make big money, at which he never was very successful.  It was his main character flaw: &quot;Yardley was a rotter, not a traitor.&quot;<br />One year before his death, Yardley published _The Education of a Poker Player_, full of anecdotes about poker games in which he had played as well as practical advice about how to win.  It is regarded as a classic, and is still in print and is admired by serious gamblers and penny ante basement players.  It was a good way for Yardley to bow off the world's stage, but is not his lasting monument.  When it came time to start busting codes again as World War II loomed, no one had to be convinced that cryptanalysts were good sources of power.  Yardley, the first American governmental cryptographer, had done his part to make America stronger through signal intelligence.  He was an important and flawed figure who deserves more recognition; he has, surprisingly, had no biography written before, and Kahn's detailed and readable book will always be the definitive one on the subject.adable book will always be the definitive one on the subject.	2004-04-15

Is there some basis for ESP, telekinesis, astrology, and the other beliefs to which many so tightly cling?  We cannot prove that they are nonsense, but we can show evidence at least that they are highly questionable and that they are used by hoaxers for fame and profit, especially when those hoaxers pretend to be taking a scientific stance.  A wonderful lesson that The Amazing Randi and Penn and Teller have taught us is that magicians can make almost anything happen, or _appear_ to happen, and that scientists can get fooled watching these tricks just as well as Las Vegas audiences can.  A happy, short, and informative book, _Debunked!  ESP, Telekinesis, and Other Pseudoscience_ (Johns Hopkins University Press), by Nobel prizewinner George Charpak and his colleague in scientific investigation of the paranormal Henri Broch, is a plea for intelligent avoidance of deception.  It is translated from the French, but don't worry; the translator, Bart K. Holland, has himself written about the probability errors that people are prone to, and has an interesting preface to tell how he faithfully worked on the translation.<br />Much of the book is devoted to magic tricks.  There is the problem of the magician who can do a good trick, and claim it is no such thing; it is a miracle, the suspension of the laws of physics at his command.  The authors want readers to know some of these tricks; if they can show you how keys can be magically bent (like rabbits can be magically produced), it makes no sense to assume that the bending is a miracle.  Uri Geller is terrific at key bending, but so is author Henri Broch.  And he gives away the secret here; it is a physical process no more supernatural than using a lever, but done in a hidden manner, the way all magicians do things.  Geller claims a miracle; Broch claims a trick.  Quite simply, if both performers produce bent keys in some covert way, whose claim is more credible?  There is a wonderful ESP trick given here, illustrating the principle of surreptitiously conveying information so that it looks as if you have telepathically sent it.  You can learn to stop your heart just like the yogis do, or at least you can make it seem so.  There is an explanation of how the television show _Mysteries_ played up the paranormal origin of water that kept accumulating in an ancient sarcophagus, when there was a good scientific explanation already published.<br />The book is packed with many other examples: the satanic face that appeared in the smoke from the World Trade Center, firewalking, divining rods, amazing coincidences, and more.  The authors are amused by these follies, they are happy to demonstrate physical explanations for them, but they are also indignant.  They are convinced that minds poisoned by pseudoscience are more tractable by those in power.  &quot;Thus we are witnessing a mystification of knowledge, which results in a concept of the world in which many things are forever outside the understanding - and the control - of most people.&quot;  Clear thinking by the public, they remind us, is vital for the action of democracy.  Choices must be guided by rational thought, as much as possible.  The book wonderfully proselytizes for the power of rational, scientific investigation.  &quot;Rationality, too, can lead to error,&quot; the authors remind us, &quot;but a lot less often than ignorance and superstition will.&quot;ven here, illustrating the principle of surreptitiously conveying information so that it looks as if you have telepathically sent it.

Surely the book will not be the sensation it was in Britain, but it is witty, informative, and entertaining; you can't ask for more from a punctuation manual.  And if you do not yet think that punctuation is important, you will after you see all the misunderstandings a little comma can cause.  Take the peculiar title, which is from a joke: A panda goes into a caf&eacute;, orders a sandwich, eats it, takes out a revolver, fires it into the air, and goes out.  When the waiter calls to ask what is going on, the panda plunks a badly punctuated wildlife manual onto the table and growls: &quot;Look me up.&quot; The waiter finds the entry: &quot;PANDA. Large, black-and-white, bear-like mammal native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.&quot;  Oh, let's have one more.  There was an American actor playing Duncan in _Macbeth_, listening with concern to the battle story of a wounded soldier, who cheerfully called out: &quot;Go get him, surgeons!&quot;  Misplaced comma;  it should of course be: &quot;Go, get him surgeons!&quot;  Another story related here, a true one, shows that a comma can literally be a life-or-death matter.<br />The book is zero tolerance indeed.  Truss says it doesn't matter if you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice, &quot;If you still persist in writing, 'Good food at it's best', you deserve ...&quot; and she lists some ghastly punishments.  Such militantism surely qualifies her for the Apostrophe Protection Society, a real organization that (along with Truss) is horrified by commercial signs that announce &quot;Antique's&quot; or &quot;Apple's&quot;.  The recent film _Two Weeks Notice_ gives her recurrent fits.  She wants to know if they would have called it _One Weeks Notice_.  She suggests that we enlist in the apostrophe war, arming ourselves with correction fluid, stickers to cover superfluous apostrophes, and markers with which to insert omitted ones.  But best of all, she gives, simply and generously, the rules that will guide one in any apostrophic situation.  Plus there is history.  In Shakespeare's time, the apostrophe only indicated omitted letters, as it still does in &quot;doesn't.&quot;  Then in the 17th century printers put it in front of singular possessive &quot;s,&quot; and in the 18th they put it after the plural possessive &quot;s,&quot; and here we are.<br />You can turn to this little volume for guidance on the dash, hyphen, colon, semicolon, and more.  The rules are here.  American readers should note that theirs is a reprint of the British edition, without changes to spelling or punctuation.  Often Truss mentions the differences, but she would vehemently deny that this shows that punctuation rules are arbitrary.  Punctuation &quot;... is a system of printers' marks that has aided the clarity of the written word for the past half-millennium.&quot;  The conventions evolved slowly, in conversation between printers and readers.  Truss worries that printing will decline in our e-age.  A printed book has been edited and fussed over, but e-mail often does not even bother with capital letters.  Truss thinks that since punctuation represents an effort of a considerate writer to guide a reader into a correct interpretation, the lack of e-punctuation has lead to clumsy explanations, like &quot;Just kidding!&quot; or even &quot;JK!&quot; having to be added to get a tone across, or the (to her) grievous incorporation of her beloved punctuation into emoticons or smileys.  &quot;Punctuation as we know it... is in for a rocky time,&quot; she says.  But her book is a call to sticklers like herself: &quot;I am all the more convinced we should fight like tigers to preserve our punctuation, and we should start now.&quot;  This delightful style manual has been turned into a manifesto by an author in love with her subject.ld start now.&quot;  This delightful style manual has been turned into a manifesto by an author in love with her subject.	2004-04-12

A friend became a vice president at P &amp; O Nedlloyd which has a fleet of container ships sailing all over the world, and Pollak asked to book passage in one of them.  He left for Hong Kong to board The _Colombo Bay_ carrying a landlubber's baggage including books by Conrad and Melville, CDs of music by Rossini and by Sondheim, and the sort of innocence we all had on 10 September 2001.  In _The Colombo Bay_ (Simon &amp; Schuster), Pollak relates how he was asleep in his hotel in Hong Kong and his family was in New York when the World Trade Center towers fell.  His family was all right, but the voyage and book project that he had so looked forward to now appeared &quot;indulgent and worse, irrelevant.&quot;  He wanted to go home, but his wife talked him out of it, and he shipped out.  It is good that he did.  He didn't know much about the shipping industry when he started, and he learned a lot, and shares it with good humor and the sort of careful explication one expects in, say, a book by John McPhee.<br />Most of the rest of us are ignorant about container shipping, and we shouldn't be.  It affects us all.  Almost undoubtedly in the very clothes you are wearing are plenty of items that came by container ship, and you own plenty of similar goods all around your house from Asia and the rest of the world.  The containers keep the ships at sea, rather than spending time loading and unloading in port.  They have to be stowed by computer, to keep the ship balanced, to keep the ones that will be offloaded soon near the top, to keep dangerous contents separated, and so on.  The work is dangerous, and as Pollak considers during the weeks after the 9-11 attacks, the dangers have gotten greater.  &quot;Flags of Convenience&quot; vessels are registered in countries with minimal shipping industry, and also minimal attention to maintenance, safety, and professional manning.  Such vessels would be easy targets for terrorists who wish to tamper with the cargo, or slip a dirty bomb into the thousands of tons of commercial goods.  There is a simple threat of piracy, which actually changes some of the routing of Pollak's ship.  There are no firearms aboard the ship, reflecting the policy of most liner companies which oblige rather than confront boarded pirates.<br /><br /> Pollak has loaded his narrative with facts.  The sludge residue from the burned ship's oil used to be a nuisance that had to be cleaned out periodically, but now such removal is done by specialists who use the sludge in such alchemy as cracking fuels.  Pollak feeds a pair of crows that have mistakenly boarded the ship in Colombo, and unable to go anywhere else, stay on for 4,000 miles to Suez.  Among the goods carried by the ship are cartons of Marlboro cigarettes, which seem to be an internationally accepted present for, say, quarantine officials who need to be persuaded to hurry about their business and be off.  Pollok's book, though, is also intensely personal.  He had satisfying friendships with the men on board.  He includes conversations and e-mail from those anguished days as he and his family try to understand what has overtaken the world.  He has many surprisingly apt quotations from his on-board reading of Melville and Conrad.  He has proper reflections on how merchant shipping, moving everything everywhere, improves the world's standard of living, and that globalization is in such a way not only inevitable but good.  It is a literally vital industry, remaking the world, but is still an invisible one to most of us.  It is worth learning about, and here is a thumping good book by a curious and intelligent tourist to do the job.aintenance, safety, and professional manning.

It has, of course, happened before.  In World War II, people didn't call these agents \\"terrorists,\\" but \\"saboteurs.\\"  Americans at that time were lucky: the eight saboteurs authorized by Adolph Hitler to come and blow up targets in the United States were bunglers.  That does not keep _Saboteurs: The Nazi Raid on America_ (Knopf) by Michael Dobbs from being entertaining and even suspenseful.  It certainly shows how the case was a sensation in its day, and how agencies such as the FBI operated at the time.  Surprisingly, judgements made by the Supreme Court in the case of yesterday's saboteurs are being cited in the cases of today's terrorists.<br />Operation Pastorius was born out of the recognition that American industries were a threat to the fatherland.  The saboteurs rounded up for the assignment all had histories qualifying them for it; they were all German-Americans, and one was even a U.S. citizen.  They had all lived in the United States, and some had families there.  They got sometimes farcical training in bomb-making, invisible inks, and so on, and were transported by U-boat to the U.S.  A Coast Guardsman on foot patrol on the beach came across the four who landed at the Hamptons, but his fellow Guardsmen did not believe him.  They eventually went to the scene, and even saw the U-boat, but there had been so many false alarms of U-boat sightings, there was little urgency to take them seriously when they reported it.  Saboteurs George Dasch and Peter Burger revealed to each other that they were ready to go over to the U.S. side.  Dasch called the New York FBI, but they thought it was a crank call.  He eventually traveled to Washington, went to the FBI building, and started telling his story.  J. Edgar Hoover bombastically grandstanded by claiming credit for the FBI's breaking the case, skipping over the fact that the FBI had come to dead ends until it reluctantly started interviewing Dasch.<br />It was not long before the eight were rounded up, never having accomplished much besides shopping sprees.  President Roosevelt wanted quick trials and quick executions, and a secret military commission was hand-picked to hold the trial.  To the dismay of the other officers, the defense counsel took his work seriously and appealed to the Supreme Court about the constitutionality of such a secret military trial.  The Court, in a decision known as _Ex Parte Quirin_, allowed the trial to stand, but the decision troubled the justices, who decided that they had to deny habeas corpus to the saboteurs (it was a war effort, after all) and then scurried to find legal pretext to do so.  It is a troubling decision, which has become the precedent for the Bush administration to use military tribunals against the Guantanamo captives.  The Supreme Court's decision meant for the saboteurs themselves that they were all sentenced to death.  The sentences were all carried out, again in secret, except that Dasch and Burger were rewarded with a commutation to life imprisonment, and returned to Germany after the war.  This story, grim at some times and at others like a comic opera (on both the Nazi and US sides), is a wonderfully researched exposition of a minor but fascinating incident in American history that is still having repercussions today.s until it reluctantly started interviewing Dasch. <br />It was not long before the eight were rounded up, never having accomplished much besides shopping sprees.

It was Anne Hutchinson, a Puritan immigrant, who caused the first political (and necessarily religious) crisis in the colonies, and her story is told in detail in _American Jezebel: The Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman Who Defied the Puritans_ (HarperSanFrancisco) by Eve LaPlante.  It is a stirring story of conscience and faith, and a refusal to buckle under to men and to the overwhelming religious majority.  Hutchinson was truly a hero, and in many ways a founding mother of the republic that would be born more than a century after her death.<br />Hutchinson, wife to a prosperous tradesman who plays little role in her story, immigrated to the Puritan Boston, and within two years caused controversy by holding women's meetings to discuss the weekly Bible reading and the most recent sermon they had heard.  LaPlante is very good at describing the sources of Hutchinson's heresy, although Christian churches are quite different now and the tempest then seems very much one in an ancient teapot.  The actual heresy matters little; what troubled Governor  Winthrop and his fellow leaders was that she was acquiring a following, and that she threatened the status quo by the emphasis on individual conscience.  (It was Winthrop who labeled her &quot;American Jezebel;&quot; it is incorrect to say the book has a misleading title since this is how she was known.)  Thus in 1637 she was put before a colonial court (which will remind readers of the far more famous ones that condemned the witches in Salem a half century later) to pressure her to recant her heresies.  Astonishingly, she conducted herself with such self-confidence (and she was in her sixteenth pregnancy at the time) that she won an acquittal, but she refused to go home quietly.  Instead, she started lecturing her accusers, giving them more ammunition.<br />Her profession of direct revelations from God was the basis of a second trial; it really isn't possible to think that such a gathering of men were going to let her go for long.  She was excommunicated and banished in 1638.  In the unforgiving words of one of her accusers, in Christ's name &quot;... I do deliver you up to Satan, that you may learn no more to blaspheme, to seduce, and to lie!&quot;  Thirty families voluntarily went with her in banishment to the new settlement Rhode Island.  There they drafted the Portsmouth Compact, which said that &quot;no person within the said colony, at any time hereafter, shall be in any wise molested, punished, disquieted or called into question on matters of religion - so long as he keeps the peace.&quot;  This revolutionary and tolerant idea is the direct ancestor of the First Amendment of the Constitution.  Hutchinson has also been given backhanded credit for the founding of Harvard College; her heresy inspired the colony to educate ministers who would not allow such sedition.  She was to move on to New Amsterdam for further removal from English control, where in 1643 she was killed by Indians; an irony, for she was generous and tolerant to all tribesmen.  She has been lauded as a feminist hero, but LaPlante's detailed and instructive biography makes clear that she was more than that.  Hutchinson steadfastly refused to keep quiet, refused to have religious ideas imposed upon her, and refused to countenance religious imposition of any type on anyone, and thus she is a hero to anyone who cherishes individual freedom.nfidence (and she was in her sixteenth pregnancy at the time) that she won an acquittal, but she refused to go home quietly.

You probably have three hundred mutations in your genes that impair your health in some way.  Of course, that leaves a huge number of genes to correct any problems, and most of us don't look as if we stepped out of the X-Men comic books.  \\"We are all mutants.  But some of us are more mutant than others,\\" says the evolutionary biologist Armand Marie Leroi in _Mutants: On Genetic Variety and the Human Body_ (Viking).  Leroi takes a review of human mutations based on the wonderful principle that we get to understand how nature normally works by carefully examining abnormalities; when things go wrong, we know that there must be some important process going right most of the time.  So there is extensive evaluation here of strange-looking humans, often with nightmarish defects.  Amply illustrated, the book has engravings from centuries past to show that humans have always had a curiosity about such beings.  Leroi's intellectual interest is far from morbid, however, and his lessons drawn from the monsters here are humane and increase our admiration for how often things go right, and how often those who were dealt a bad genetic hand can still play it well.<br />For example, Carl Herman Unthan was a violin virtuoso by age twenty, although he had no arms.  Of course, not all such mutants are so successful.  Harry Eastlack had a defect that told his body to make bone whenever it made any repair, so that bruises and tears would turn into bone, not healed flesh.  The stillborn babies here are strange indeed.  One has a second developed mouth in its forehead.  Another child was born with over twenty half-developed fetuses in his brain.  The book, however, is far from a chamber of horrors.  Even the most bizarre of the mutants do show us things about the process of becoming and being a human creature.  Conjoined twins, for instance, are closely examined here in many ways for many lessons, like how our developing bodies can know left from right. The deformities in limbs show the importance of embryonic limb-buds, a signaling protein called \\"sonic hedgehog,\\" and \\"hox\\" genes that are the same ones that help keep our vertebral segments orderly.  The same hox genes work to make the segments in worms.  Leroi writes of the \\"breathtaking similarity\\" living creatures have in such arrangements, as evolution has built variations on the same basic plan.  \\"We are, in many ways, merely worms writ large.\\"<br />There are pygmies and dwarfs here, and giants, and men / women of intermediate sex, albinos, piebalds, cyclopes, and families covered all over in hair.  There is natural curiosity about such \\"monsters,\\" but Leroi shows there needs to be more.  They are all products of molecules gone wrong, molecules we can now detect and understand, to better appreciate how molecules go right in the unimaginably complicated dance that creates organisms.  There is a fascinating chapter near the end to show that perhaps ageing and death are caused by specific mutations (we are mutants all, remember).  The final chapter is about the importance of human diversity, and the importance of beauty as a general evolutionary force (as Darwin knew it to be).  A beautiful face has appeal at least in part because imperfections, the myriad types of imperfections as illustrated here, are not apparent, indicating health and fitness.  With a declaration for biological beauty, this is a well-informed, life-affirming book by a scientist who has used molecular errors to ponder deeply the human condition.es can know left from right.

It's far too weird.  For Simmons was a well known Charlesonite, an expatriate Britton in a renovated town house who not only had changed from a man to a woman, but in 1969 married a black mechanic 25 years younger than she.  Then she reported she was pregnant, and eventually produced a baby complete with birth certificate.  This strange life gets a fascinating exposure in _Peninsula of Lies: A True Story of Mysterious Birth and Taboo Love_ (Simon and Schuster) by Edward Ball.  Ball has sifted through the extremely puzzling mysteries here, including the forty-three boxes of Dawn Simmons material kept by the library at Duke University.  One of the most attractive features of this biography is that although it more-or-less tells Gordon's, then Dawn's, chronological story, it is a chronicle of how the author traced down leads, traveled to obscure locales that might have some memory of his subject, and interviewed some decidedly peculiar people who knew him / her.  From initial bafflement to eventual understanding, a reader can join him on an illuminating journey.<br />Ball went to Sissinghurst Castle in England to visit Nigel Nicolson, son of Vita Sackville-West.  Strangely, Gordon Hall grew up around there; he was the son of Sissinghurst servants and himself helped weed the famous gardens around the estate.  Gordon would grow up eventually to move to Canada where he would school the Ojibwa children in 1946, a year he would write about in _Me Papoose Sitter_.  In 1952, as in so many stories of American self-invention, he arrived in New York City.  Gordon Hall, a debonair young man conflicted about his sexuality, became an intimate of the elderly unmarried artist Isabel Whitney, one of the heirs within the cotton-gin Whitney family.  Whitney died in 1962, and Hall inherited a large estate of stocks, antiques, and art.  In Charleston he ingratiated himself to the Historic Charleston Foundation and other locals by finding an old downtown house to renovate and stuff with antiques.  There are some questions about how the flamboyant Gordon Hall spent his nights, but eventually he met John-Paul Simmons, \\"a skinny, happy black guy who looked like he'd stumbled into a good time.\\"  And he fell hard for John-Paul, who wasn't interested in another man.  Gordon was seen in the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins soon after it opened in 1966, and underwent surgery for transformation into womanhood.  Charleston had been titillated by the change from Gordon to Dawn, but the change to Mrs. Simmons with the black husband was much harder to take.  The wedding announcement ran on the local newspaper's obituary page.<br />In 1971 was born Natasha Simmons, and at least one birth certificate shows Dawn to have been her mother; Ball's research gets to the bottom of this issue.  It was the climax of Dawn's life.  She was talked about all over Charleston, and was nationally famous enough that Dick Martin on Laugh-In could make a joke about her baby: \\"We can only hope she grows up to be half the man her mother was.\\"  The remaining decades of her life were just sad.  John-Paul plowed through the family fortune and became abusive.  Dawn moved off in poverty to Catskill, New York, and Jean-Paul got long-term inpatient treatment for schizophrenia.  The final chapter's answers to some of Dawn's riddles are provided by Jean-Paul himself; after much hard work, Ball was able to find him, and schizophrenic or not, his answers are lucid and intelligent.  It is a fitting conclusion to a mystery story, but even better is the help Ball got, throughout his quest for answers, from Natasha Simmons herself.  Cherished by her peculiar parents, Natasha continues to speak with love for \\"Mommy,\\" and reveals herself as intelligent and perceptive.  Dawn's adaptability and pluck have paid off.er peculiar parents, Natasha continues to speak with love for \\"Mommy,\\" and reveals herself as intelligent and perceptive.

Thoreau knew the book.  It was an international bestseller, and it might have been one of the few books besides the Bible in some American homes.  Riley was a legend in his own time, but no longer is in ours.  He is back, brought to us by Dean King, who read Riley's memoir of his adventure in the Sahara, and then read a narrative of the same adventure from a fellow crewman of Riley's, and then himself traveled in the still inhospitable and dangerous regions described in the two books.  King has produced _Skeletons on the Zahara: A True Story of Survival_ (Little, Brown), a wonderful account of fortitude under the most extreme conditions at sea and on the desert.  This is one of the great adventure stories, full of the tortures by man and nature, and of course of the success of an indomitable spirit.<br /> Captain Riley and his &quot;good Yankee crew&quot; of eleven left Connecticut for an ordinary merchant voyage in 1815, and eventually foundered on the west coast of the Sahara, six hundred miles south of Morocco.  They were beset by hostile, thieving nomads, but briefly escaped by taking to sea in the ship's longboats.  They were eager to be away from the Sahara, which everyone knew was a realm of death but which was at the time uncharted, mysterious, and full (so the stories went) of cannibals.  They ran out of provisions at sea and were forced to make for Sahara land south of Bojador, and their prospects were just as bad.  Other tribesmen captured them, took their goods, and made them slaves.  There are many pages devoted here to pain, extreme sunburn, thirst, hunger and other travails.  The means of relieving these tortures are often unpleasant to contemplate as well; the way the captors and crew made do eating unmentionable parts of camels as well as snails and locusts are detailed here.  Riley's eventual captor was a desert merchant Sidi Hamet, who was in financial trouble.  Riley assured Hamet that he had important friends at the British consulate, hundreds of miles away.  He insisted that these friends would buy him and the crew back for a high price.  Of course, there were no such friends, and Riley was bluffing; Hamet insisted that if the ransom price was not paid, he would slit Riley's throat, and perhaps he was bluffing as well.<br />The hapless Riley and the hapless Hamet make the core of this tale, and King cannot be faulted that his source narratives don't have enough details to describe Hamet fully.  He emerges, however, as a friend and savior, even if he was initially only after the ransom.  Riley could not have known it, but there was indeed a procedure for ransoming slaves, and a British consular official made it happen, becoming Riley's lifelong friend.  A measure of the two months in captivity is that Riley normally weighed 240 pounds, and when he was ransomed he weighed less than ninety.  Not all of his crew made it back, and some of them may have spent the rest of their lives as slaves.  King's exciting and surprising narrative ends with the speculation that Riley may even have had an effect on his own country's slave trade.  He became an active abolitionist, easily able to discuss the immorality of slavery; and perhaps since Lincoln admired Riley's book, it may have done its little part to bring emancipation about.ual captor was a desert merchant Sidi Hamet, who was in financial trouble.

Everybody needs a hobby.  But there is bird-watching which is an appreciation of evolution's bountiful supply of feathered creatures, and then there is bird-watching which is a competitive, nay, ultracompetitive year-long sport.  The latter is hilariously chronicled in _The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature, and Fowl Obsession_ (Free Press) by Mark Obmascik.  The book is the story of three men at the top of their game, each racing to determine who during the year 1998 could see (or hear; hearing the call of a bird counts) the most species of North American birds, and maybe break the record for such competition.  Most readers will agree that these men are obsessed, and it isn't too nasty or inaccurate to call them completely nuts, but one can't really criticize anyone for a hobby.  These guys are different, that's all, and you might even spot the differences physically.  Their collar sizes increase from looking up at birds (a condition called &quot;warbler neck&quot;) and they risk cervical nerve damage from the strap of their equipment (&quot;binocular neck&quot;).  It is an unforgiving sport.<br />Here is the cast of characters.  Sandy Komito is a loud-mouthed, deliberately abrasive retired New Jersey industrial contractor who had won the 1987 Big Year, and still held that record of 721 birds. Al Levantin is a multiply-retired chief executive with a mansion in the mountains near Aspen.  He can buy trips to anywhere to see birds, but he cannot conquer crippling seasickness to spot the pelagic ones easily.  Greg Miller is a computer programmer who at the time was busy debugging Y2K problems out of software at the nuclear plant where he worked.  He is miserable.  He is newly and unhappily divorced, broke, out of shape, and with only birding as the passion that keeps him going.  Unlike the other two, he is trying to do a Big Year while he holds down a job.  The thing that really made 1998 so special was that it was the year of the strongest El Ni&ntilde;o on record, and the resultant freak weather patterns brought storms and wayward winds to the continent.  Riding the storms were birds who had been blown away from their own lands or migrations, the &quot;vagrants and accidentals&quot; by which a record year is set.  Many experts think that 1998's record may never be broken.<br />Obmascik puts the annual birding competition into historical perspective.  Audubon wasn't out to make a year record when he challenged himself to paint all American birds life-sized.  Roger Tory Peterson wasn't out to make a record when, in 1953, he mentioned off-hand that he had seen 572 species that year.  But Peterson's comment set off every subsequent Big Year.  Obmascik tells the story of the epochal 1998 competition with verve and humor, using a jokey prose that sometimes indicates that he (a birder himself) cannot believe in the strangeness of the quest of these obsessives.  There are a few incidences of camaraderie, and even some honor-bound help that one competitor condescends to offer another, but largely, this is a volume full of cut-throat birding.  Whether you have any interest in this odd passion or not, these three guys all had an unforgettable year, here vividly reported in a delightful book.hat it was the year of the strongest El Niño on record, and the resultant freak weather patterns brought storms and wayward winds to the continent.

Some have changed the world, and some have never left the drawing board, and some are downright goofy (but innovative).  In a surprisingly captivating work, _American Inventions: A History of Curious, Extraordinary, and Just Plain Useful Patents_ (New York University Press), Stephen van Dulken, who works with patents at the British Library, shows some oddities and marvels that he has sifted from those millions of bright ideas.  There are plenty of good and not-so-good inventions here, but every page has good stories.<br />Like the Frisbee.  Yale students could recall that in the 1920s they threw pie tins from the Frisbie Baking Company (there is one in the Smithsonian).  In 1948, inventors, inspired by the nation's interest in flying saucers, made the first plastic flying disc, better than metal, but it was brittle and snapped.  In 1951 Walter Morrison redesigned it with the aerodynamic rim known as the &quot;Morrison slope&quot; and called it the Pluto Platter.  It was patented as a &quot;flying toy&quot; in 1957, the year Wham-o brought it out, and it had little portholes from which imaginary aliens might enjoy a rapidly spinning world going by.  Wham-o was distracted by the hula hoop madness, and eventually relaunched the disc as Frisbee in 1958.  It has, of course, long outlasted hula hoops, and will never go out of date.  Someone invented the drive-in theater; Richard Hollingshead's mother complained that movie seats were too narrow, and he wondered if sitting in a car would be more comfortable.  Remotes for televisions were originally on a wire, then via photocells, and ultrasound, before they became electronic.  Joyce Hall of Hallmark Cards invented the card display rack; before that, greeting cards were kept in drawers.  Recipes can be patented; KFC has a patent on its chicken recipe, but Coke does not patent its syrup, preferring to keep the ingredients simply secret rather than eventually in the public domain.<br />This is a wonderful miscellany of cleverness.  The text has reproductions of the drawings from many of the patents mentioned: the original shopping cart, the Murphy bed, Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, the board for &quot;The Landlord's Game&quot; (a forerunner of Monopoly), the original Barbie and Raggedy Ann, the famous Coke bottle, and many more.  In a dry, amused tone, van Dulken makes the book something more than just a description of one invention after another.  He has displayed the admirable human trait of inventiveness and thereby shown a social history of technological progress.nd ultrasound, before they became electronic.

The crowd of beer drinkers is different from those who favor cognac, as are those who like sherry different from those who drink single malts.  There is no drink with so strong a reputation for a particular set of drinkers than absinthe.  A cult drink in nineteenth century France, it has strong associations with poets and painters; the claims made for it have been extravagantly laudatory and condemnatory.  It figures largely in literature and paintings of that time and place, which has only increased its reputation, good and bad.  And it is still under prohibition in many countries, including the United States, which makes it forbidden fruit.  Thus there is a good story, lots of good stories, to tell in _Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle_ (University of Wisconsin Press) by Jad Adams.  It isn't too surprising that a main lesson of the book is that extravagant claims, positive and negative, for &quot;the green fairy&quot; are simply exaggerations.<br />Absinthe is a high-proof alcohol drink to which has been added essential oils of wormwood, plus aniseed or fennel, which taste like liquorice and gave the famous clear green color.  It became particularly a drink for French Bohemian writers and artists.  Adams shows, however, that the poets and painters who concentrated on absinthe as a subject were minor artists busy cultivating a bohemian atmosphere around themselves; the greater artists might have included it as part of their world, but had no particular fascination for it. Wormwood has a chemical called thujone within it, which might be a mild hallucinogen, but there is question that it would have had any significant effect at the dose provided in absinthe.  What certainly would have had effect is the high amount of alcohol in the drink.  Absinthe's widespread adoption scared the French government, which listened to the experts blaming it for everything from anarchy to population decline to the rise of Jews.  A national ban was eventually enforced in 1915.  In England, absinthe never had much of a hold, as it was seen as representing everything corrupt about France.  In the US, those who provided alcohol during prohibition had little interest in this particular aperitif, and when prohibition was lifted, absinthe remained on the list of banned drugs.  It was still available to American expatriates in different countries in Europe, and when the Cold War ended, tourism to such places as Prague brought a new boom in absinthe-drinking.<br />Except that there was little to match the extravagant reports of a century before.  Absinthe became trendy with some rock stars (one ad campaign said, &quot;Tonight we're gonna party like it's 1899&quot;), and it isn't surprising that their experiences of it did not meet those of the introverted Parisian artists that had gone before.  Part of the problem is that they are not drinking the same thing.  Absinthe from eastern Europe did not smell of aniseed, did not have oils so that it did not turn cloudy during the preparation ceremony, and did not have nearly enough wormwood to cause mental effects above those from the alcohol.  Any chemical artistic inspiration just wasn't there.  In a fascinating work of history with short biographies of famous drinkers of the time, Adams shows that the problem wasn't chemical.  Absinthe met the expectations of a particular crowd of artists who gave it a particular reputation at a particular time.  Even if the absintheur rock band Sugar Cubes (lead by the famous Bj&ouml;rk) had the absinthe that Van Gogh drank, it would be a bit much to expect equivalent masterpieces.from anarchy to population decline to the rise of Jews.

This cannot sound so strange now as it must have a couple of centuries ago.  We may not be used to mind control of that type, but we live in a world powered by invisible rays and hidden machines.  When James Tilly Matthews entered the famous hospital for the insane, London's Bedlam in 1797, his complaints must have sounded bizarre indeed.  He told his doctor that he, and many of the powerful in England and France, were being manipulated by a mysterious gang who were using invisible gases and rays from an unimaginably complex machine called an air loom, and that his thoughts were being altered and controlled and his body was being painfully punished.  Matthews's bizarre story is the subject of a surprising and novel-like history, _The Air Loom Gang: The Strange and True Story of James Tilly Matthews and his Visionary Madness_ (Four Walls Eight Windows) by Mike Jay.  What is especially peculiar is that although Matthew's ideas were clearly delusional, his complaints stemmed from real persecutions he was made to undergo.  As the old joke says, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.<br />Matthews was a wholesale tea dealer who wound up shuttling between Britain and revolutionary France with a peace proposal.  It is not surprising that Matthews had little effect;  but it is surprising that at the time of the Terror, all he had to endure on the French side was a spell in a French Revolutionary prison.  In 1796, after his return to England, he entered the public viewing area of the House of Commons, and yelled &quot;Treason!&quot; into the hall.  This got him into Bedlam, and he was to be incarcerated for the rest of his life.  His rooms were unheated, he would have straw to sleep on, and for some years he would be chained to his bed.  It is quite possible that pummeled first by peculiarities of world events and then by the cruelties of incarceration as a lunatic that he began weaving contemporary ideas about pneumatics, electricity, and Mesmer's animal magnetism into a widespread delusional explanation of just how he got persecuted into such a position.  We know about his delusions in detail because in charge of him was the apothecary John Haslam, and Matthews was Haslam's star patient.  Jay shows that the delusions can possibly be seen as Matthews's response to persecution, with Haslam as co-creator.<br />This is a tangled tale, expertly told.  There are parts of it that are deeply mysterious, and for which there is no documentation, only speculation; how Matthews came to be running secret diplomacy, and who was paying him to do so, and what he really was doing, can only be guessed at.  The gripping story of Matthews coming to delusional terms with his predicament is actually moving, and his eventual (if posthumous) triumph over Haslam is convincing. Best of all Jay has gone a long way in successfully trying to explain the politics, science, and history of the time.  His picture of treatment of the insane in the crumbling Bedlam, at the cusp of instituting sympathetic &quot;moral&quot; treatments of Philippe Pinel, is unforgettable.  There may not have been a real air loom, but that doesn't keep it from meaning something; and Matthews may have been an incarcerated schizophrenic, but that doesn't keep him from being a bit of a hero.ties of world events and then by the cruelties of incarceration as a lunatic that he began weaving contemporary ideas about pneumatics, electricity, and Mesmer's animal magnetism into a widespread delusional explanation of just how he got persecuted into such a position.

It used to be taught in public schools; I wonder if it still is, since it might be a little too, well, communal for our current philosophy of carving out one's own sector for profit.  Guthrie wrote the song as a response to the treacly &quot;God Bless America,&quot; not because he wanted something secular but because he failed to see how God had blessed the sharecroppers and hoboes and Okies Guthrie lived with.  &quot;Do Re Mi,&quot; &quot;Oklahoma Hills,&quot; and a bunch of children's tunes are part of his legacy as well, thousands of songs, mostly one-offs which no one wrote down or recorded.  He would easily tear out a rhyme and a tune, and did so passionately whenever he felt for a cause.  Frequently inspired, he was also unreliable, irresponsible, and grimy, a difficult man to live with.  In Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie (Norton), Ed Cray has given a full portrait of an influential man whose songs and stories are legendary, but has brought forth both legend and truth, and sorted between them nicely.<br />Guthrie, despite his claims to the contrary, had a middle-class upbringing.  His father was, of all things, a successful real estate dealer, who was too busy to pay the boy much attention.  His mother was distant and uninterested.  He was a dedicated student only when he wanted to be; he would listen to local singers and imitate guitar records for hours.  In 1937, the 25-year-old Guthrie lit out for California (leaving his wife), by freight train or hitchhiking, as did other migrants.  On the road and within the state &quot;he was among people who understood hunger&quot; in camps and shantytowns, and the sense of unfairness to others would never leave him.  He never officially joined the Communist party; he was too independent for that (or, &quot;They wouldn't have him,&quot; according to his first wife).  He did write regularly for the Daily Worker, but instead of earnest propaganda, he presented an aw-shucks column full of personal commentary.  He admired Will Rogers, and much of what he wrote for newspapers shows it: &quot;I aint a communist necessarily, but I have been in the red all my life.&quot;  All three of his wives learned that he did exactly what he wanted, drank too much if he chose, left whenever he decided to, and chased skirts with enthusiasm and success.  He had his share of selflessness, and even considerable heroism; included here are stories about his service in World War II that would make any American proud.<br />The most difficult part of the book, unsurprisingly, is Guthrie's descent into neurological doom by the strange affliction Huntington's chorea.  It was probably the illness that sent his mother to an asylum, and it gradually took away his ability to play, walk, talk, and think.

He never officially joined the Communist party; he was too independent for that (or, &quot;They wouldn't have him,&quot; according to his first wife).  He did write regularly for the Daily Worker, but instead of earnest propaganda, he presented an aw-shucks column full of personal commentary.  He admired Will Rogers, and much of what he wrote for newspapers shows it: &quot;I aint a communist necessarily, but I have been in the red all my life.&quot;  All three of his wives learned that he did exactly what he wanted, drank too much if he chose, left whenever he decided to, and chased skirts with enthusiasm and success.

Then they die and that's it.  Unless you believe in the soul.  The concept of soul has been a comfort, and a goad, throughout time.  Souls are our most valuable, even divine, assets, our best qualities, and they live long after the body is gone.  Some say the souls get rewards or punishments, and some say they get to inhabit some other body, and some say that the idea of souls helps us get around our inevitable deaths but that souls haven't been shown to exist any more than any of our gods have.  Souls are supposed to be eternal and constant, but our portrayals of them have changed drastically over the centuries.  In _Imagining the Soul: A History_ (Sutton Publishing), Rosalie Osmond guides us through the ways we have depicted souls, from the ancient Egyptians through western history until now; it is a rewarding tour not only for the history involved but for what the images tell us about ourselves.<br />The ancient Egyptians pictured a soul as a bird with a human head, combining the person with the capacity of flight.  The ancient Greeks kept the visual image of the winged soul, but had the first ideas of souls that would separate from bodies at death and survive independently thereafter.  Plato thought that thoughts were the best things that humans produced, and he insisted that souls were in charge of this function.  Christian teachers borrowed many of the Greek ideas and modified them.  Significantly, the church fathers imagined souls as having some sort of mystic bodies of their own; the Greeks could stand abstractions, but the early church stood by at least half-corporeal souls, like that of the Hell-tormented Dives who begs Lazarus for water.  The spiritualists adopted the idea of literally weighing souls (in addition to producing ectoplasm), but there is a long tradition, even in Greek art, of souls being weighed as part of the judgement they must endure.  However, a French thinker named La Mettrie wrote in _The Human Machine_ in 1748 that humans were merely complicated machines, different only in degree from timepieces or lizards.  As the idea is expressed currently, mind is entirely a product of brain.  Certainly, if you mess with a brain by trauma or drugs, you do change its mental product.<br />The manifestations of the soul and its images though history are extraordinarily rich, and Osmond is a witty guide who is obviously delighted by what her research has turned up.  She frequently uses exclamation points to show just how funny or ironic she finds many of the ideas and pictures here.  There is organization to the work, with a chapter on souls as depicted in the theater and another on souls at the very time of death.  There is concentration on how each society has handled the folklore of souls in comparison to what can truly be known about them, especially in current scientific views.  Osmond has obviously wide erudition, and has presented it entertainingly in a well-illustrated volume.er, a French thinker named La Mettrie wrote in _The Human Machine_ in 1748 that humans were merely complicated machines, different only in degree from timepieces or lizards.

Someone surely dubbed it the &quot;trial of the century,&quot; as we do even now, with our own interest in contemporary murder and adultery.  Then those involved died off, and the years dimmed even collective memories of the trials of Lucretia Chapman and her lover Lino Espos y Mina for the murder of her husband.  A good story won't die, and a good story indeed is in _The Murder of Dr. Chapman_ (HarperCollins) by Linda Wolfe.  Wolfe has written on true crimes before, but has previously concentrated on contemporary subjects.  She has superbly given historical context for this story, however, and produced a satisfying work full of period detail and comparisons of those times and our own.<br />Lucretia Winslow moved to Philadelphia in 1813.  She was 25 years old, an age that marked her as liable to spinsterhood.  She was tall and striking, and smart, and she moved to Philadelphia to accept a teaching position, one of the respectable ways unmarried women could make it in the world.  Of course, she probably made the move to increase her marital prospects, too, and in 1818 she indeed married William Chapman.  William was ten years older than Lucretia and several inches shorter.  He was an accountant, but studied ways to cure stuttering.  They may not have had a passionate marriage, but it began with respect and affection.  The stolid William eventually ceased to satisfy her.  Enter the third vertex of the triangle.  Lino was 23 years old, a superb conman and criminal deported from Havana.  He had bilked plenty of others before wandered to the Chapman's house, told a tale of how he had been robbed, and entranced both William and Lucretia, who decided that he should stay with them until his affairs were straight and his wealthy family started sending him money again.  Within a month, Lino and Lucretia were lovers, and William was dead.  It seemed that he had died of natural causes, food poisoning or cholera.  Nine days later, Lino married Lucretia, who took a heartbreakingly long time eventually to realize she was being conned and stolen from.  Eventually it became clear that Lino had bought arsenic days before William first turned ill.  When he was arrested for William's death, so was she.  Naturally, their trials form the climax of this riveting book.<br />So, was it murder, and if so, who did it?  It would be wrong to tell how the juries for their separate trials decided on the issue, even though there is a gallows and coffin on the cover of the book.  Wolfe has recreated the trials in fascinating detail.  The newspapers enjoyed scandal then and now, but scandals as domestic news were a zesty novelty.  The papers called Lino &quot;a villain of no ordinary character&quot; and Lucretia &quot;a woman of violent passions.&quot;  Wolfe herself concludes that probably Lucretia did not take part in her husband's murder, but that &quot;probably&quot; is going to have to be judged by every reader.  It is an assignment that no one interested in thrilling true-crime narratives will want to pass up., food poisoning or cholera.

I couldn't read a book about gluttony, for instance, and pride, envy, anger, sloth, and greed are all either humdrum or so obviously bad for you that there would seem no point in studying on them.  Oxford University Press, however, in conjunction with the New York Public Library, has brought out a volume on each of them, none of which I will read.  But lust, well, that's another subject altogether.  There's a deadly sin that I really like, and refuse to see as sinful.  Lust is worth participating in and thinking about, and the Oxford volume _Lust_ by philosopher Simon Blackburn provides an encouraging set of essays that will not please those who insist that lust is just as bad as gluttony or greed.  \\"It might seem, then,\\" writes Blackburn, \\"quixotic or paradoxical, or even indecent, to try to speak up for lust.  But that is what I shall try to do.\\"  Try, nay -  he succeeds.<br />Lust has gotten plenty of bad press, a short history of which Blackburn enjoys giving.  Plato put a shamefulness upon lust that it has never subsequently shaken.  It was an axiom, however, that shame was inherently connected to lust, and that although there was no shame in enjoying a good meal, there was in enjoying a good coition.  Saint Augustine has the reputation of demonizing lust for all Christians thereafter, but Blackburn points out that by the time he came along, \\"the cult of virginity was in full swing.\\"  Augustine insisted that it was regrettable to feel pleasure when one impregnated one's wife, but coitus just for the sake of pleasure was incomparably naughty.  Though Christianity mostly abandoned such extreme views, and though Augustine might be seen as a moderate compared to other writers on the subject, lust has never recovered from the calumny Augustine had thrown on it.  Lust, however, is essential; we are all products of it, and even religious moralists today generally allow that it has a place, even though they might define that place as only within sanctified marriage.  Blackburn's main philosophical defense of lust is, surprisingly, the seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who is not usually noted for liberal views.  Hobbes wrote of the \\"delight of the mind\\" in reciprocal pleasure-giving, a play of imagination as well as of genitals.  There was nothing intrinsically immoral about it.<br />_Lust_ is a little, concentrated book, with color illustrations of various masterpieces depicting humans and gods at sexual play.  Blackburn has reinforced his view by quotations of poetry, mostly Shakespeare but also Dorothy Parker and Edna St. Vincent Millay (who in a sonnet admits a lover's proximity made her \\"feel a certain zest/ To bear your body's weight upon my breast\\", but adds, \\"let me make it plain:/ I find this frenzy insufficient reason/ For conversation when we meet again.\\")  Blackburn's optimistic volume places lust quite properly as a central delight in life.  Those other deadly sins may still be deadly sins, but even so, let us count only six from now on.though they might define that place as only within sanctified marriage.

Current understanding of human language says that we all have portions of our brains directly assigned to language processing, and that every human language is at foundation the same, with nouns, verbs, and so on all doing the same job in each.  As described by one theorist, a man from Mars examining humans might find we were all speaking the same language, only in different dialects.  What if we looked at an even broader sample of creatures on the planet?  Tim Friend, a science journalist, in _Animal Talk: Breaking the Codes of Animal Language_, reviews all the many ways that animals have of talking to each other (not just by sound), to find that there is a far broader understanding between animals of different species (including humans) than we may have guessed before.  Humans have developed remarkable and complex verbal languages, but it's the nonverbal communication that we often share with animals.  It is not too surprising, given that natural selection and sexual selection have operated on us all from the beginning, that we animals share a range of signals.  Not only that, but we talk about the same things every day: \\"... that is, sex, real estate, who's boss, and what's for dinner.\\"<br />To be sure, reviewed here are many ways that animals communicate in which humans cannot participate.  We don't use the pheromones that bacteria use to exchange information, nor do we signal bees with dances.  But insects and animals use yellow or red colors as a universal signal for \\"stay away,\\" and everyone knows what a rattlesnake's noise means.  More significant, however, in Friend's book are the sounds that we share with other animals.  Many of these are obvious.  For instance, imagine you are talking to a baby; you instinctively use a high pitch and soft, smooth tones.  On the other hand, if you are warning a child against touching a hot stove, you use a low pitch, harshness, and staccato.  This is the sort of thing that all we animals do, universally.  We humans might apply words to the sounds we emit, but we have growls, barks, and whines just as birds, dogs, and lions do.  Friend draws upon the work of Eugene Morton to illustrate many instances of the grammatical rules of this nonverbal language.  For instance, harsh, low frequency sounds mean the animal is thinking of attacking; high frequency sounds mean submission and lack of hostility if approached.  A boss who is angry uses a low voice and stops at every word.  A child who wants candy uses a high pleading voice, \\"Please, please, please.\\"  Using the grammar, it is possible for humans to make noises as interspecies communications, modifying the behavior of squirrels or even wolves.<br />In one species after another, Friend describes the different ways that dominance is asserted and settled.  We aren't above such nonverbal communication.  A couple of researchers went back to all the presidential debates since 1960.  They found that they could pick, by deeper pitch and by voice accommodation patterns, the dominant speaker in each debate, and that the dominant speaker always went on to win the popular vote.  (Perhaps the candidates now preparing for the debates ought to spend less time memorizing statistics and more time practicing pitch.)  Friend's entertaining book shows that animals all over are using all sorts of surprising ways to talk to each other, and to us, and that if we will but listen, they have plenty to teach us, even about our own ways of communicating to each other.pply words to the sounds we emit, but we have growls, barks, and whines just as birds, dogs, and lions do.

They make the big homes, and the big deals, and have the fanciest clothes and the best choice in dates.  We enjoy it when they do things that are silly, stupid, or mistaken.  In doing so, we are really doing nothing more than our hominid ancestors did in paying close attention to the chiefs of their tribes; they may not have had money back then, but they had the status and they were carefully watched because of it.  Interest in the rich is programmed in our genes.  Thus it is a delight to find that the rich can be studied as objects of natural curiosity.  Richard Conniff usually writes about other species, but has taken the techniques of the naturalist to study the habits of _homo sapiens peconiosus_ (rich people) in _The Natural History of the Rich: A Field Guide_ (Norton).  He writes that instead of animals in the field, he \\"... had found a new quarry, and they were possibly the most dangerous and elusive animals on earth.\\"  Throughout his witty and informative book, he shows a great sense of fun with his evaluation of this extraordinary species.<br />Conniff gives us many views of rich people acting like animals.  The analogies are often easily drawn and obvious.  This should not be surprising.  Successful tribal animals from all species are driven by \\"the quest for control, dominance, mating opportunities, and, above all, status.\\"  The rich are predatory like jungle cats, or busy with penile displays, like monkeys.  It seems that many rich men are addicted to peeing in relatively public places as a show of domination.  Ted Turner, who shows up often in this book, gave away a billion dollars to the UN, and disdained his fellow rich people who weren't, in his opinion, doing their share, as he quite ostentatiously was.  A virtue is more of a virtue if it is performed privately and not for show, but the rich don't play the game that way any more than other primates do; what he had done was make a \\"bid for status, as plain as the chest-thumping of rival silverback gorillas.\\"  The rich maintain that they already have it made and they don't have any need to impress anyone, but that's not the way they behave: \\"...they usually mean only that they have drastically narrowed down the list of people they are interested in impressing.\\"  Other rich people, or ghosts of doubting fathers or teachers.<br />Part of the fun of the book is that Conniff knows a wealth of examples to draw upon, and there is lots to learn about what we usually take to be animals as well as rich people.  For instance, in discussing the way rich men have arranged for other men not to make attempts on their wives (\\"mate guarding\\"), he informs us about dragon flies.  Anyone who has seen dragonflies knows that they spend some of their time flying in tandem, with the male locked onto the female.  It is wrong to assume they are enjoying in-flight coitus; probably they already got that out of the way, but the male is sticking to his mate until she lays her eggs so that other males don't get to her beforehand.  So various behaviors of the rich (kin selection, altruism, status symbols, territoriality, scent marking, hoarding) amusingly can be found in some much lower species.  The ease of the analogies is partially due to the baroque variations of behavior found all over the animal kingdom; one can find some species somewhere doing almost anything, and another doing the opposite.  In fact, when analogizing the way rich grooms give presents to brides, Conniff tells about the male hangingfly who presents an edible morsel to a prospective mate, but warns, \\"The leap from hangingflies to humans is of course perilous.\\"  Just so, but such leaps are entertaining as well.  Conniff's examination of the rich is not a scientific study as much as it is a bunch of funny stories about how odd those rich people are, stories made funnier by finding that they behave in ways just like other animals do.s the chest-thumping of rival silverback gorillas.\\"  The rich maintain that they already have it made and they don't have any need to impress anyone, but that's not the way they behave: \\"...they usually mean only that they have drastically narrowed down the list of people they are interested in impressing.\\"  Other rich people, or ghosts of doubting fathers or teachers. <br />Part of the fun of the book is that Conniff knows a wealth of examples to draw upon, and there is lots to learn about what we usually take to be animals as well as rich people.

Bobby Fischer came face to face with Boris Spassky in Iceland, and the world took delight in a simple morality play.  Fischer was depicted as the lone American hero gunning to win the title from the Soviets who had held it for decades.  The Cold War was reduced to the free world's champion versus the apparatchiks spawned by the Soviet socialist chess machine.  It was fun to watch the battle in such black and white terms, but in _Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time_ (Ecco), David Edmonds and John Eidinow show that the true story was much more complicated although just as exciting.  For instance, Spassky may have been a Russian patriot, but he was not a Soviet patriot and he was not a member of the Communist Party.  Fischer was eccentric and asocial, and his bratty behavior seemed un-American to many of his fellow Americans.  But both their governments had a stake in the match, and people all over the world who knew nothing about chess watched the contest carefully, and many took up the game.  It was quite truly the most extraordinary chess match of all time, just as the book's subtitle says, and the book makes clear in how many ways it was extraordinary.<br />Spassky loved the game for itself, and, as a well-rounded gentleman who liked fishing and festive parties with his friends, seemed sincerely to be looking forward to what he called &quot;a feast of chess,&quot; win or lose.  He admired Fischer, but the book shows that beyond a colossal talent for chess, Fischer possessed few admirable qualities.  He was a morose man who one journalist said &quot;was likely to greet even an old friend as if he were expecting a subpoena&quot;.  His frequent tantrums (which earned him much derision from his compatriots) did, at least, stop when he sat down to play, and he never attempted to disturb an opponent across the table.  He was called by Dr. Henry Kissinger when he did not show up for the match, assured that he was &quot;our man up against the commies.&quot;  Having lost the first game, he didn't even show up for the second, and thus lost it as well.  But then he crushed Spassky in the third, and went on to a match full of hard-fought draws and wins, many of which are regarded as among the finest games ever played.  President Nixon sent congratulations.  Spassky eventually went into contented retirement in France, continuing to regard the Soviet chess administration with disdain.  Fischer never defended his title, although he has played some exposition games.  He went on to join a fundamentalist Christian church, then to denounce it as satanic.  He may have been the American hope during the match, but he is now deeply anti-American, spouting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories (ironic, given his parentage on both sides, revealed here) to any radio station that will allow him voice.<br />The authors have interviewed all the important officials involved who are still alive, especially Spassky; they didn't interview Fischer, and don't say why, but that was probably just not possible.  _Bobby Fischer Goes to War_ is not a book for those who want to study the chess games.  It has exactly one board diagram, and the games are described generally, not play by play.  Chess players interested in this aspect of the match already have bought better books on the games themselves.  This is a book about personalities, about the history of the times, and about the off-board gambits and counter-gambits, and you certainly don't have to know any details about chess to enjoy it.  There is, to be sure, a great deal to enjoy here, in the re-creation of the match and the geopolitics of the time that lent it importance.inger when he did not show up for the match, assured that he was &quot;our man up against the commies.&quot;  Having lost the first game, he didn't even show up for the second, and thus lost it as well.

People didn't always know this.  It used to be thought that earthworms were parasites, eating at the roots of plants gardeners wanted to flourish.  Chief among the instructors that made gardeners change their minds about the humble earthworm was none other than Charles Darwin, who was fascinated by the creatures, experimented on their abilities, and wrote his final book, _The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms, With Observations on Their Habits_, in 1881.  Darwin's work, and especially his curiosity and his enthusiasm for what worms do for us, run through all the chapters of _The Earth Moved: On the Remarkable Achievements of Earthworms_ (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill) by Amy Stewart.  It is always good to be reminded of just how much natural history Darwin taught us in yet another field, rather than merely his overarching Theory of Evolution, but as Stewart shows, there are now microscopic and ecological investigations that Darwin could not have dreamed of, all of which convince her (and she will convince any reader) that the humble earthworm is a soil engineer that has made our world the way it is today.<br />Earthworms till the soil more intimately than any plough.  By burrowing, they provide aeration.  Earthworm manure (called castings) is highly valued by gardeners, and is even a cash crop for those who raise worms on a large scale.  Earthworms promote bacteria in the soil, and most soil bacteria, rather than being bad germs, are useful in such things as converting ammonium to a form of nitrogen that plants can use, and breaking down other complex molecules so roots can absorb them.  All that earthworms do has just started to be investigated; they are hard to investigate, because it is hard to see what they are doing without disturbing them, even in laboratory pens.  There are species almost everywhere, even in isolated islands, and many of them have yet to be named or investigated.  Complete life cycle studies have been done on fewer than a dozen species.  Stewart's research has led her to confer with many academic and agricultural types who share her eagerness about her lowly subject.  Not all the news is good, because earthworms are not good everywhere.  In northern forests, where they are not native, they have been introduced by transplanting non-native plants or by fishermen dumping their unused bait.  They are busy destroying the leaf fall that ought to remain on the ground to nurture the ferns, flowers, and seedling trees.  But worms do have an important role to play in organic farming, even on large scales, and they can help with the treatment of animal manure or city sewage.  At least one scientist has written that in furtherance of agriculture, earthworms are responsible for the development of each of the world's great civilizations.<br />Stewart herself does little experiments on her worms, from the same admirable sense of curiosity Darwin showed, but she is a gardener rather than a scientist.  She knows just how Darwin felt, though, describing her own worms as &quot;companionable creatures - clean, quiet, and hardworking,&quot; and from time to time, she brings some up from her own worm compost bin to her study, just to keep her company: &quot;A pot of earthworms on the desk is a pleasant distraction.&quot;  She has many remarks on her compost bin, into which go all her vegetable food scraps, and newspaper, and out of which come worm castings for her garden.  She has a useful appendix to tell how to get going on worm composting yourself, and surely plenty of readers of this happy and informative book will do just that.  Even those who don't go that far will have a renewed appreciation for earthworms and for the scientists who have probed the way they make the soil that sustains us.nd many of them have yet to be named or investigated.

The garden was tasteful, with fountains, a pool of water lilies, and blue spruce trees in addition to thousands of roses.  Besides the obvious beauty of the garden, there was one other thing that made it unique.  At one end of the garden was an old execution chamber.  The garden was in the middle of the infamous prison, Sing Sing, in New York.  It was the creation of a prisoner who, before he murdered his wife, was a legendary newsman who worked directly for Joseph Pulitzer, and often himself handled coverage of society murders.  The term of Charles Chapin as city editor of the _New York Evening World_ was full of spectacular tabloid stories, and James McGrath Morris, himself a former journalist, has brought back Chapin's forgotten story and explained how the press worked in the early parts of the twentieth century in the astonishing book, _The Rose Man of Sing Sing: A True Tale of Life, Murder, and Redemption in the Age of Yellow Journalism_ (Fordham University Press).  It is a story at times as lurid, melodramatic, and spectacular as any of the stories Chapin himself published.<br />Chapin started delivering the local paper at age fourteen.  He was determined to get himself an education, and although he could not attend school, he read ravenously and well.  A kindly editor selected books for the boy, classics that Chapin drew upon all his life.  He was thrilled to become a reporter in Chicago, but eventually made his lasting mark in New York, where at the _Evening World_, he presided over a technological revolution.  The new telephone allowed Chapin to give orders to reporters in the field, and to shape the stories.  Field reporters would call in the details of a story, and the new &quot;rewrite reporters&quot; would write it up for the paper.  As a result, Chapin gave the _World_ unrivaled immediacy in reporting New York's news.  Especially fascinating is the story of how Chapin got the news about the sinking of the _Titanic_.  Chapin was recognized as the best of city editors, but he was not easy to work for.  He was merciless on himself, and extended this treatment to his reporters.  His abilities made them tolerate working for him.  He was devoted to his wife, and seems sincerely to have wanted to put her out of prospective misery when his investments failed; he had planned a murder suicide, but only killed her, and turned himself in.  He was convicted of murder in 1919 and given twenty years to life.  In Sing Sing, the warden took particular interest in him, which is not surprising given how different Chapin must have been from the usual criminals there.  Chapin had never been a gardener, but began to cultivate a small plot; he became obsessed with his plants, solicited donations from those he knew in the business world, and commanded inmate assistants with the same fervor he had used on reporters.  Ladies clubs came to take the tour of the grounds, as did celebrities like Booth Tarkington and Houdini.<br />Chapin thus proved to be a model prisoner, and applied for pardon, but no pardon ever came.  He was involved in two mostly postal romances with women on the outside, neither of which ended well, mostly because of his lifelong inability to see or accept ambiguity; it was as if he expected a well-chosen headline to cover all the underlying details.  He died a convict in 1930, and was buried, according to his wishes, with the wife he had murdered twelve years before.  This story, never told before in full, is full of engrossing detail about the competitive working press of the time.  Chapin's life, that of a brilliant and limited man who eventually found horticultural redemption, is almost operatic in its sweep, and makes an unforgettable story., Chapin gave the _World_ unrivaled immediacy in reporting New York's news.

It seems the most unsurprising of desires.  Washington's army had defeated that of the British Empire, and the thirteen American colonies which had declared themselves independent in 1776 had fought to make the independence real rather than merely declared.  Washington saw his job as complete, and he wanted nothing more than to resign his commission and become again a Virginia gentleman farmer.  The very idea was inconceivable to many.  To give up all power, to become a mere citizen when he could quite easily have become king, was simply not the way the game of power was played.  We are accustomed to veneration of the Father of Our Country, so Washington's service and humility might not seem so remarkable to us.  But in _General Washington's Christmas Farewell: A Mount Vernon Homecoming, 1783_ (Free Press), Stanley Weintraub has, if not made us surprised at Washington's desire for retirement, then made us feel the wonder that Washington's contemporaries felt about it, and has invited us to admire a particularly likable aspect of Washington the man.<br />Weintraub's small, concentrated book follows Washington as he proceeds south into New York City, to Annapolis, Maryland, where Congress was in session and could accept his resignation, and finally to his home.  Everywhere he went, citizens who already knew him as Father of His Country were eager to see him.  He would leave one village to go to the next, only to find that riders had preceded him to alert the next village to prepare for celebration.  There were fireworks and dancing; Washington was an enthusiastic dancer and the ladies eagerly sought their turn with him.  Many citizens wrote their compliments to him, and he had an aide to write replies.  There was longwinded oratory.  There were bad commemorative verses.  Manliness at the time did not include an aversion to tears, and many manly tears were shed; an observer of the final farewell wrote, &quot;And many testified their affectionate attachment to our illustrious Hero and their gratitude for his Services to his country by a most copious shedding of tears.&quot;  Barrels of ale and wine were drunk, as in each gathering thirteen toasts (for the thirteen colonies) were dutifully and gleefully swallowed down.<br />The world was astonished at Washington's self-removal from the national stage.  When King George III was told in 1783 that Washington declined further power and wanted only to return to his farm, he declared, &quot;If Washington does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.&quot;  Washington would have been astonished that we have developed a governmental system where people are politicians as a lifetime occupation and profit handsomely thereby.  He clearly believed in his life outside of public service, and in his privacy.  His modesty is evident in that we know almost nothing of his 1783 Christmas itself.  He did successfully return on Christmas Eve, but his &quot;family Christmas remained private and almost entirely unrecorded.&quot;  It was his business, and his family's, and he had gloriously, successfully, and merely temporarily, become a private man again.r of the final farewell wrote, &quot;And many testified their affectionate attachment to our illustrious Hero and their gratitude for his Services to his country by a most copious shedding of tears.&quot;  Barrels of ale and wine were drunk, as in each gathering thirteen toasts (for the thirteen colonies) were dutifully and gleefully swallowed down.  <br />The world was astonished at Washington's self-removal from the national stage.

Frankenstein (or more properly, Frankenstein's monster), in a gorgeous, detailed black and white photo (which for all the fussing over its production would have been called a glamour shot if the subject were someone else) stares from the cover of _Hollywood Horror: From Gothic to Cosmic_ (Harry N. Abrams) by Mark A. Vieira.  In his Acknowledgements section, Vieira thanks his dad for letting him watch horror movies \\"on the Early Show, the Late, Late Show, and everything between.\\"  He also thanks him for making trips so he could buy _Famous Monsters_ magazines.  One cannot doubt that he has a lifelong enthusiasm for his subject, and the format of his book makes this clear.  It has large, glossy pages filled with black and white images of celluloid nightmares, and most of them are by the studio photographers (some of them famous, like Ernest Bachrach) who were responsible for the stills that would sell the film to the public.  Although for many the pictures will be the show, Vieira's intelligent text and cataloguing of the films is worth reading on its own.<br />Vieira has chronologically divided the genre into the Gothic, Psychic, Atomic, and Cosmic.  Boris Karloff's career stretches over them all, starting from his Frankenstein role, for which his costume weighed all of 48 pounds.  Dracula and Frankenstein made lots of money, with violence and the sexuality (both of which seem wonderfully understated in our times) before the Production Code came out drew the \\"grandstanding censure of women's clubs, clergymen, and politicians.\\"  The Psychic section of the book is largely given to the films of Val Lewton, who refused to go along with any previous horror formula.  Cutting in mere suggestions of horror into a love story about normal people was just what budget-conscious RKO went for.  The Atomic years were a reaction to the atmosphere of the Cold War, and routine horror films \\"began to portray science as a tool more evil than Dr. Frankenstein had ever anticipated.\\"  The first of many films to show how nuclear devices could bring forth monsters was 1953's _The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms_, with a custom-designed dinosaur awakened by an atomic test.  Vieira ends with the Cosmic films, paying most attention to a movie monster that is among the most realistic ever, and which has caused more serious analysis than even Frankenstein's monster: HAL the computer from _2001_.  The years tick by and we have yet to make a machine nearly as smart (or fortunately, as diabolical) as HAL.<br />The final portion of the book also includes films that are quite dissimilar from the monster movies covered in other pages.  In a book like this, one will always think of films that ought to have been included or excluded, but Vieira is calling the shots.  He has included _Psycho_, which is not really a monster film but has plenty of terror.  For real scares, read about how Alfred Hitchcock treated Tippi Hedren during the shooting of the filming of the climactic sequence of _The Birds_, or how Frank Sinatra treated Mia Farrow while she was making _Rosemary's Baby_.  Also here are _Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?_ and _Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte_, in which the real monsters are the actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, aging grandes dames of cinema, who were at each other's throats onstage and off.  There are some eccentric choices here, but Vieira's book is a fine-looking survey of a genre of films that, like so many of their monsters depicted, just does not die, and if it does, it comes back with surprising transformations.he atmosphere of the Cold War, and routine horror films \\"began to portray science as a tool more evil than Dr. Frankenstein had ever anticipated.\\"  The first of many films to show how nuclear devices could bring forth monsters was 1953's _The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms_, with a custom-designed dinosaur awakened by an atomic test.

Our times have no monopoly on such cults, of course; our nation's tradition of freedom of worship encourages them, and we look toward economic or societal means to subdue the most flagrant ones, since the law cannot touch them if they are merely worshipping in some sort of erroneous way.  _Murdering Holiness: The Trials of Franz Creffield and George Mitchell_ (University of British Columbia Press) by Jim Phillips and Rosemary Gartner resurrects a forgotten case which is part of our nation's history of cults, religious freedom, vigilantism, and the insanity defense.  Phillips and Gartner, professors in law and criminology at the University of Toronto, have produced a detailed and closely researched history of the incident, and an entertaining one as well.<br />Franz Creffield was an itinerant preacher who arrived in Corvallis, Oregon, in 1902, and drew almost all its Salvation Army members into his \\"Army of Holiness,\\" though they were also known as \\"Holy Rollers,\\" the first time that pejorative was every applied.  He taught that the world was about to end, that wealth was bad, and that he could perform sexual purification of female converts.  This got him tarred and feathered and run out of town.  He was imprisoned for two years for adultery, and after his release, he was in Seattle in May 1906 when George Mitchell, a young laborer from Corvallis, walked up behind him and shot him in the neck on a busy Seattle street.  Mitchell was acting to avenge the seduction and deflowering of his sister Esther, although she would have denied such a thing had happened.  A temporary insanity defense was mounted, but the newspapers and most legal authorities agreed that Mitchell had done the manly thing.<br />Mitchell was acquitted, and his sister Esther and Creffield's widow started talking about getting revenge.  Days after the acquittal, at an ostensible meeting to make peace, Esther shot and killed her brother George at the train depot; she was eventually to say that God had commanded the act.  The second murder caused an even bigger sensation, but the press seemed to think that honor killings were what men should do for women, not vice versa.  An insanity commission arranged for her to go to the asylum rather than the penitentiary, and she was released after some years to return to her family.  She seemed happy, she married in April 1914, and she killed herself by poison in August.  It is a strange end to a strange story.  Creffield had pursued his religious vision with passion and sincerity; George Mitchell killed him, risking his own life on the scaffold because of what society thought was a virtuous defense of his sister; Esther Mitchell's faith was strong enough that she could kill even her brother.  The authors have included many insights into religious, legal, social, and psychological history of the times in a fascinating and dispassionate case study.d her brother George at the train depot; she was eventually to say that God had commanded the act.

Those who take them up on the deal see Teller locked into a secure wooden box, and after a spell of eyes closed, they see him magically, inexplicably free.  Those who peek see just how easily the trick is worked.  Penn and Teller know that they can give away the secret of this or other tricks and there is still a show.  The gadgets used in the illusions aren't the story, the performance is.  Jim Steinmeyer knows this, too.  He has designed illusions for magicians and Broadway shows, so he knows all the hardware.  In his book _Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible and Learned to Disappear_ (Carroll and Graf), he has given away lots of secrets.  But he is not the stupid Masked Magician, revealing tricks for notoriety and fortune.  What he has given us is an appreciation of magic history and the refinements in fooling people by clever stagecraft, but he has never forgotten to remind us of the dazzle of the performance.<br />The elephant of the title is one named Jennie, who, at the New York Hippodrome in 1918, vanished from her box on stage, under the direction of none other than Harry Houdini.  The hardware he used to make Jenny disappear was surprisingly simple (as are most of the gadgets that make magical effects).  It was a product of a boom in the art of conjuring that had started around sixty years before.  &quot;It's all done with mirrors&quot; is a dismissive phrase, and yet the history given here of mirror illusions shows that they have been refined in countless ways, from putting ghosts on the stage to producing a talking disembodied head on a table.  The ghost craze also manifested in spiritualism, and magicians were keen to cash in on the craze.  Among them were the Davenport brothers of Buffalo, who allowed themselves to be bound with ropes inside a cabinet, whereupon in the dark, ghostly hands appeared, instruments were played, and so on.  The brothers were tied up before the manifestations, and after, so it seemed as if they could not have been working the tricks.  Other magicians could easily see this was a rope escape trick, dressed up in the fancy of the day.  But spiritualists only saw the Davenports as demonstrating the truth of communication with the afterlife.  The controversy didn't hurt business at all.<br />The stories of these tricks often involve intense competition between magicians.  One who invented a trick was likely to see it performed by someone else shortly thereafter.  Oddly, patenting a trick is little help; a patent has to have public details of how the mechanism works, and so if he does go to the trouble of patenting an effect, an inventor describes it in unhelpful ways, thwarting the patent process itself.  The theft of secrets kept the illusions lively, as other means were found of doing similar effects and tricks were repackaged.  &quot;Sawing through a Woman&quot; was invented by P. T. Selbit in 1921, a reaction to women's liberation and an outgrowth from the Grand Guignol theater.  Before long it was &quot;Sawing a Man in Two,&quot; &quot;Sawing a Woman in Half,&quot; or &quot;Matter through Matter.&quot;  There were other illusions stretching a woman, or crushing her, and there were furious arguments about giving credit (and fees) to the correct inventors.  Steinmeyer's story thus leaps repeatedly from one time to another, and from America to Europe.  We in the audience ask how a magician has made an effect, and Steinmeyer has answered this thoroughly for some of the tricks discussed here.  But there is a lot more than a &quot;how&quot;, but also why, when, and who.  On display here are the personalities behind the deceptions, and the evolution of the psychology of stage deception.  Steinmeyer has given a great performance; wecan know the trick and we are still left in wonder.can know the trick and we are still left in wonder.	2004-02-16

When reading _Daniel Boone: An American Life_ (University Press of Kentucky) by Michael A. Lofaro, I realized that I didn't know anything about Daniel Boone.  I thought he wore a coonskin cap and was a contemporary of Davy Crockett, and maybe fought at the Alamo.  I discovered at the end of the book that Lofaro blames television, too.  Boone's fame to my generation comes from &quot;...Fess Parker playing the lead in _Daniel Boone_, a historical disaster for baby-boomers who still confuse Boone with Crockett&quot; because Parker sequentially played one then the other in the mid-fifties.  Lofaro had insight on my own ignorance, and his book is shot through with impressive scholarship that takes Boone, as much as possible, from myth and tall tales (and television-inspired error) and puts him into realistic historical perspective.  There is plenty here that is inspiring, and fit for legend-making, and also plenty to show that Daniel Boone had essential trouble in managing to get along with society.  And also (_pace_ Davy Crockett), Boone hated coonskin caps.<br />He was born in Pennsylvania in 1734, to devout Quakers.  His rudimentary schooling shows up in many excerpts from his writings here; for instance, it seems to be true that on an East Tennessee tree he carved the inscription &quot;D. Boon cilled a Bar on tree in the year 1760.&quot;  Boone did indeed become an accomplished woodsman and hunter, and was always less fit for the life of frontier farming.  He had a pattern of reaching out to new lands; he had a wanderlust, to be sure, and encroaching civilization always meant that he had to move to new frontiers to hunt game, but he was always eager to apply the simple solution of moving away when having people live around him was just too complicated.  He would be on the move all his life.  He fought for the British (along with Washington) in the French and Indian War, and then against the British in the western version of the American Revolution, which consisted mostly of fighting Indians.  He had prodigious skill in the outdoors, and there are many stories here of heroism and craftiness.  Although he could always win battles against Indians, he could not win against lawyers, and was often in court because of disputed boundaries he had surveyed.  He was guileless and always assumed that treating someone honestly would get him honest treatment in return, an assumption that he never seemed to learn was unwarranted.<br />Boone was amazed that he became famous.  There was a bogus autobiography printed in 1784, that was translated into German and French, and made Boone internationally known.  He was painted by the young John James Audubon.  James Fennimore Cooper based much of Natty Bumppo on him, and in a note to one of the Leatherstocking Tales said that Boone headed out from Kentucky to Missouri in later life &quot;because he found a population of ten to the square mile inconveniently crowded.&quot;  Tales of Boone's dry wit became staples.  He did indeed, when asked if he had ever gotten lost in the wilderness, reply, &quot;No, I can't say as ever I was lost, but I was bewildered once for three days.&quot;  He blazed trails, most notably through the Cumberland Gap, and then was dismayed that they became widened for wagon travel and further encroachment by civilization.  Ending up in Missouri, he spent his last years hunting buffalo and trapping beaver.  He died at 85, as the nation was pushing further west and the wilds were more speedily declining.

Lofaro's informative biography puts the brilliant pioneer and naïve citizen at the center of a complicated and longstanding war between settlers and Indians.	2004-02-14

As it is, the tilt has made it one of the most famous buildings in the world, and a target for millions of tourists through the centuries.  The tilt has made the building, and has almost destroyed it.  In _Tilt: A Skewed History of the Tower of Pisa_ (Simon and Schuster), Nicholas Shrady has sorted some tall tales from the facts of the building, and given a bright, short history of Pisa and its fortunes.  It doesn't answer the question of why we should all be fascinated by this faulty building project, but it gives us information to increase our delight.<br />The tower was begin in 1173 as a matter of civic pride in a city whose seagoing fortunes were brimming, and construction had not proceeded very far before it began to lean.  There are plenty of legends about why it leans, but it is a simple fact that the tower rises above a former bog, whose subsoil, made of deposits of sand and clay silts, is unstable.  A commission was formed in 1298 to determine what to do about the tower's tilt; at that time it was off center by only one degree.  The tower leaned more and more, and there were fifteen more commissions over the centuries to halt the problem, with no success.  A commission after the fall of the San Marco campanile in Venice fell in 1902 found that the tower was leaning more than ever, but no one had a scientific, geological, or architectural solution.  It was only in 2000 when the most recent commission completed its work that there was any real success.  An English soil expert lead a team to remove sixty tons of dirt from one side of the tower, which obligingly shifted in that direction, back towards perpendicular.  Of course no one for centuries has planned to make the tower upright, but now tourists can reenter it for the disorienting climb up the crazy spiral staircase.  The tower is stable, for now.<br />_Tilt_ is published with a pleasant gimmick.  It does not really need a gimmick, for Shrady's history of the building and the puzzlement it has caused the world is enormous fun to read.  The book, however, has been published at a slant, with each of the pages a decidedly non-orthogonal parallelogram.  If you put this book on a shelf with others, the spine will tilt into the shelf.  It's fun to see a book that isn't rectangular, and a bit disorienting to hold the book or read it in bed, with the point of the spine sticking downwards into one's chest.  We take perpendicularity for granted in such matters, and the odd shape of the book reminds us that there is a eccentric charm in a book, or a tower, that doesn't stand up straight.It does not really need a gimmick, for Shrady's history of the building and the puzzlement it has caused the world is enormous fun to read.

There seems to be a general ignorance in the US of what Islam stands for, unless it stands for rejection of Jesus as the son of God, of feminism, of pacifism. But if we are to come to some understanding of the religion and the culture, it only makes sense to try to understand its founder. Thus it is timely that _The Prophet Muhammad: A Biography_ (HiddenSpring / Paulist Press) by Barnaby Rogerson is now available. A vivid, living portrait, it will do excellent service for anyone who is interested in initial instruction in the life of the prophet. Rogerson does not make his own religious beliefs plain in the book, but he is clearly enthusiastic about the Islamic world and the ideas the Prophet gave to us. When he started asking questions about Muhammad, his fellow travelers might reply \\"Are you a Muslim\\" or \\"Do you intend to become a Muslim?\\" It was clear they wanted to know what side he was on. \\"I was on the side of a good story,\\" he says, and a good story he has told here.<br />Muhammad was born in 570 in Mecca to a noble family. He was a shepherd as a boy, graduating to the lucrative and essential camel trades. He grew to love the incense which was the most lucrative item of trade, and his other great physical delight was women. He strongly disapproved of celibacy and he liked women for their chatter, wit, advice, and wisdom. When he started, at age 40, to have religious visions, his wife was his first convert. After his death, he took ten other wives. Rogerson does not neglect to tell about Muhammad's possible moral deficiencies. Perhaps the greatest moral quandary for us is that Muhammad went to war against the rest of Arabia for purely religious reasons. His visions also included eternal torture for whoever Allah condemned, a morally corrupt scheme. But his teachings included disclaimers of racism that would have been good for other scriptures to include, and exhortations toward scholarly knowledge.<br />What is best about Rogerson's biography is that it reminds us that there is a wealth of available detail about the life of its subject. Besides his enjoyment of physical pleasures of scent and sex, the Prophet liked cats. He retained humility, refusing to associate himself with miracles except for his revelations. He liked other people and enjoyed humor. He disdained possessions, always giving things away and refusing to accumulate wealth, but he liked shopping for household needs. An experienced camel-trader, he would cheerfully ride on the humble mount of a donkey or mule. He deliberately lived as a poor man, an example of saintliness that must embarrass the rest of us. He loved simplicity, and would have been appalled at mosques ancient and modern, whose architectural magnificence others find inspiring. There are contradictions, some of them distressing, in his actions, but it is remarkable that we have such a full record of his words and acts and enthusiasms. This humane portrait comes in a time when we sorely need better understanding of its subject.e been good for other scriptures to include, and exhortations toward scholarly knowledge. <br />What is best about Rogerson's biography is that it reminds us that there is a wealth of available detail about the life of its subject.

Can you identify the eight parts of speech, and diagram a sentence?  If so, and if you went to American schools, you are dating yourself; you are probably not young anymore.  And quite possibly, you don't think it makes much difference.  David Mulroy disagrees.  In _The War Against Grammar_ (Boynton / Cook Publishers), he reports upon a hiatus he took from his usual work, translating and teaching Latin and Greek poetry, so that he could research the history of grammar.  He did not do so from purely academic interest; in 1996, at a public hearing on standards for public schools, he suggested that a good goal would be for high school seniors to identify the eight parts of speech.  He was surprised that he had suggested anything controversial.  The very National Council of Teachers of English had pronounced that instruction in grammar did nothing but take time away from more important studies.<br />Mulroy makes clear that there is a need for grammar study.  Opposition to grammar education coincides with decreased literacy, lower SAT scores, and increased need for college remedial writing and reading courses.  His fascinating history of the subject goes way back to the basics; it isn't surprising, given his own interests, that he turns to Ancient Greece.  Dionysius Thrax in the second century BCE made the first division of words into the eight parts of speech, taken up by Roman and English grammarians in their turn.  Oddly, the rise of the universities meant that logic, not grammar or literature, was king, but the humanists were able to insist on a Latin grammar book for all English students in the 1540s.  Raised on it were Spenser, Bacon, Marlowe, and Shakespeare; it might be oversimplification, but there is probably some sort of cause and effect here.  American education was in direct descent of this emphasis on grammar, until the advent of &quot;progressive education&quot; which shunned &quot;formalism,&quot; instruction by rote.  Instruction in grammar was held to be detrimental to the unconscious and automatic way students would express themselves.  The definition of what a sentence is can be disputed, as can definitions of the parts of speech, and the conclusion has become that such formalisms need not be taught.  This has become the way teachers of English teach English, or fail to.<br />It doesn't have to be this way.  Mulroy gives many examples, in different languages, of the art of diagramming sentences.  If you can break a sentence into its parts and know how the parts function, you can understand it.  He admits that when he is stymied by a complicated sentence he wants to translate from Latin or Greek to English, he starts diagramming it.  &quot;Normally, the obscurity vanishes before I finish the diagram.&quot;  He tells of the remarkable success of schools that insist that students master grammar.  Schools in England have made grammar the centerpiece of a literacy drive.  In America, there is even an Assembly for the Teaching of English Grammar within the National Council of Teachers of English, but its members are a tiny fraction of those in the NCTE.  Mulroy's classic structure for advocacy (problem, history, solution) gives his book a surprising immediacy and practicality.  At the end, a reader will possibly think, &quot;I can't have just finished a book about the lack of grammar in today's schools.&quot;  Mulroy has made the erudite instruction surprisingly entertaining.nstruction in grammar was held to be detrimental to the unconscious and automatic way students would express themselves.

If so, it was possibly bound up in religious ideas, in some of which it is integral (&quot;Where will YOU spend eternity?&quot; says one local billboard).  Religious infinities have lapped over into mathematical ideas in surprising ways, and if you hanker to do some serious reading about mathematical infinities and their history, you should consider _Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity_ (Norton) by David Foster Wallace.  Wallace is a novelist, author of the huge and well regarded _Infinite Jest_.  He isn't a mathematician, except by avocation, but his enthusiasm for his subject is apparent on every page.  It's a good thing that this is so; this is definitely not a superficial look at the subject, and Wallace calls upon some high-powered math that you may not even have done in college.  The result is a penetrating book from a serious amateur on some of the most important ideas from nineteenth and twentieth century mathematics.<br />Wallace starts his good-humored and sympathetic tone from the beginning: His &quot;Small But Necessary Foreword&quot; begins, &quot;Unfortunately, this is a Foreword you have to read.&quot;  There are plenty of footnotes, but half of them are marked &quot;IYI&quot;: &quot;If You're Interested,&quot; as are many of the paragraphs in the main text (along with &quot;Semi-IYI&quot;).  In a history composed of increasing mathematical rigor, Wallace jokes and uses slang.  Much of the history has to do with trying to solve the paradoxes of Zeno, like the one about how you can ever get to the other side of the street when you first have to go halfway, then half of the rest of the way, then half of that, and so on.  The paradoxes were curious, but when supremely useful calculus came along, the infinitesimals used had never been rigorously defined.  It was not until Georg Cantor showed how to deal with infinities as real mathematical entities that calculus had a mathematical foundation.  He showed that infinities could be compared, and some infinities were larger than others.  The proofs of these ideas (about one of which a mathematician said, &quot;I see it, but I don't believe it!&quot;) gave calculus roots, but also gave rise to questions that eventually shook all of mathematics to its foundations.<br />Wallace doesn't get much into G&ouml;del and his eventual Incompleteness Theorem, and it is just as well.  There is enough excitement here, at least exciting for anyone who finds paradoxes a charming way to make the neurons spin.  Admittedly, he has included equations and propositions full of Greek letters and advanced functions that only math buffs will absorb.  He says of Weierstrass's demonstration of continuity, for instance: &quot;There's a reason this all looks so hideously abstract: it _is_ hideously abstract.&quot;  The substance is tough going, but there is enough style here, in jokes, curious illustrations, and piquant asides, to make this a fascinating show of intellectual prowess.howed that infinities could be compared, and some infinities were larger than others.

But a large segment of American society does not see this as good news.  The books are seen by some Christian fundamentalists as spiritually dangerous to children, since they introduce concepts of the occult in attractive ways.  Certainly not all Christians feel this way, recognizing the books as belonging to the type of fantasies written by Christians like C. S. Lewis and others.  If fundamentalists feel that the Harry Potter books are the works of the devil, however, they are in good historical company.  In _Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture_ (University Press of Kentucky), Bill Ellis has continued an academic query which he described in his previous _Raising the Devil_.  While his current book is not an analysis of Harry Potter books and the movement against them, J. K. Rowling's works are shown to be just a contemporary part of folklore beliefs that have gone back for centuries.<br />Witchcraft was (and is) practiced in opposition to an increasingly rationalistic theology.  The practices allow marginalized groups to use traditions to give themselves a sense of degree of control over their lives, but can also be employed by those who have no particular conflict with society.  Ellis examines such hardware of the occult as the &quot;grimoire&quot; or magic book, chain letters (!), and even the rabbit's foot.  He shows how young people are especially prone to old-time occult activity.  Since medieval times, people have made special trips to, say, Neolithic monuments.  Folklorists call this &quot;legend-tripping,&quot; and teenagers have kept up the tradition.  The trip, often to a forbidden house or a graveyard, is made in a cultivated atmosphere of fear; stories of previous trippers who suffered the penalty for violating the taboo get passed along and keep the tripping alive rather than restraining it.  Ellis shows that teens calling upon spirits by means of the Ouija board is quite similar to calling spirits out during exorcisms, an illustration of how belief in the occult actually compliments and supports orthodox belief.  Frightened fundamentalists may be taking the Ouija threat too seriously; one student user says, &quot;You really don't get any answers that mean anything.  We just get drunk and have a good time.&quot;<br />Ellis, himself an active Lutheran, makes clear that he is not advocating for the folklore practices described here, or even apologizing for them.  He admits that while many of the practices might be harmless, spooky fun for teens, there may be bad consequences as well.  He gives such concrete examples as vandalism resulting from a graveyard visit, rather than the possibility that Satan might take over the souls doing the trip.  His is an academic work, but even so, with its unusual themes, it is an entertaining one.  He is especially amused by the famous spoof article in the satirical paper _The Onion_, telling about how satanic groups were being overwhelmed by Harry Potter readers trying to join up.  The article was ridiculous, but was sent as a chain letter by many Christian youth counselors as a bona fide warning about the danger Harry poses.  Their more Internet-savvy students were embarrassed that their elders could not tell reality from a joke.  _The Onion_ just gave the elders an opportunity to overreact, but Ellis's book shows that the pattern of overreaction, giving definition to both orthodoxy and the occult, has been going on for centuries.passed along and keep the tripping alive rather than restraining it.

Charles Dickens took one of the new-fangled Cunard steamers from England to Boston in 1842, and wrote a funny, famous article about how it was noisy, cramped, and boring.  It was bad enough that on the return trip, he took the slow traditional sailing packet.  Dickens's account is evaluated in _Transatlantic: Samuel Cunard, Isambard Brunel, and the Great Atlantic Steamships_ (HarperCollins) by Stephen Fox.  It isn't surprising that with Fox's love of his subject (and his prodigious research) he has found that Dickens exaggerated for literary effect.  Even so, the Industrial Revolution, finally applied to transatlantic travel, did bring more comfort to travelers, as well as much more speed.  Fox has deliberately confined himself to the period from the birth of steam at sea to the climax, the _Mauretania_, the &quot;greatest steamship ever built,&quot; launched in 1907.  His history covers only in part the social whirl of cruising, which has been handled many times before.  _Transatlantic_, a big book, covers in detail the changes wrought by engineering and the men who made them happen.<br />The changes were enormous.  Sail gave way to steam via paddlewheels and then to propellers.  Piston steam engines became turbines.  Wooden ships became iron and then steel.  Everything went faster, and the fascination for speed drove the innovation.  The administrators of the passenger lines always virtuously denied having anything to do with racing, but everyone knew what ship was the current record-holder.  The Owners of the lines denied involvement in races because speed was the enemy of safety.  Originally, however, it was thought that the safest way to get through fog or nighttime gloom, even in an area threatened by icebergs, was to put on full speed and thus get out of there quickly.  There were plenty of colossal disasters at sea, and many readers will find these the most interesting parts of this volume.  Most surprising is how there was so little chivalry in these Victorian times.  For instance, the 1854 sinking of the _Arctic_, a masterpiece of design from the United States Collins Line, occurred after it was rammed by another steamer in the Grand Banks.  As the ship went down, there was chaos unrelieved by heroism; one fireman said, &quot;It was every man for himself, and no more attention was paid to the captain than to any other man on board.  Life was as sweet to us as to others.&quot;  The not-full lifeboats discouraged further embarkations at gunpoint.  40% of the crew survived, and only 8% of the passengers.  &quot;Women and children first&quot; was unheard of or unheeded; all the survivors were men.<br />Speed and safety were paramount for the owners, but the passengers remembered comfort, which also increased during the period.  The upper class passengers could count on ten course meals and plenty to drink; a good deal of the crossing must have been spent drunk, perhaps as a way to feel less of the seasickness which is described here repeatedly.  (Speed, therefore, in its way was a means to comfort, by cutting the voyage time.)  Dining rooms and salons became monuments to the highest in Victorian taste.  Fox describes them, and there are photographs in the book of very comfortable and luxurious surroundings, improbably but beautifully wrought in Renaissance or Tudor schemes.  He also tells of the lesser conditions in steerage and the brutal work of the men who kept coal on the fires.  He makes the analogy that the ships were like buildings (or even whole towns), and points out that the many Victorian buildings we have left are often retained or restored with respect and loving care.  That has happened to none of the ships herein described.  Every one is gone, a few lost in the deep and all the others lost to the wreckers for scrap.  We have such ancient specimens as the _USS Constitution_ or _HMS Victory_, but even the most glorious examples of the age of steam are irrevocably gone.  Fox's monumental book lovingly brings them back in the only way possible.titution_ or _HMS Victory_, but even the most glorious examples of the age of steam are irrevocably gone.

This explanation was put forward only a couple of decades ago, and though it was revolutionary at the time, it has been confirmed so well that it is hard to imagine that there will ever be evidence to disconfirm it.  Peter D. Ward, now a professor of geological sciences at the University of Washington, worked on evidence for this Cretaceous extinction, and then turned his attention to a previous extinction, one that makes the Cretaceous look like a fender-bender.  In _Gorgon: Paleontology, Obsession, and the Greatest Catastrophe in Earth's History_ (Viking), Ward has told the story of his researches into the Permian extinction, which 250 million years ago exterminated forever 95% of the species then living.  This is a personal account, a memoir to tell about field adventures, the atmosphere in modern South Africa, and the theory he has come up with.  It is a fine introduction to current ideas about the Permian extinction, and what it is that paleontologists do.<br />The Gorgon of the title was a beast something like a tiger, ten feet long.  The fearsome Gorgon was not a mammal; it had eyes at the side of its head and it had scales on its body, both characteristics more associated with lizard-type creatures.  And the Gorgon itself left no descendants.  It was one of the victims of the Permian wipeout.  Ward was in South Africa in 1991 to research another type of fossil, but circumstances sent him into the heat, cold, storms, flies, ticks, snakes, ants, and scorpions of the Karoo desert.  The stratification there, and other evidence, brought fundamental changes in the way paleontologists view the Permian extinction.  The eventual explanation includes that there was not a single, rapid event, but a series of short, successive ones altering the atmosphere and changing the population of creatures that could survive to beget the dinosaurs and mammals that were to come.  The explanation isn't final; no scientific explanation really is, but it is how things stand right now.<br />In addition to being a scientific memoir, Ward's book describes visits to South Africa when that country was going through amazing changes.  On one visit, he was interrogated by severe and unfriendly white passport controllers, for instance, whereas years later he would be greeted by welcoming black ones.  He would also visit during times where he could show his white self anywhere with impunity, whereas years later to be white \\"meant that one had money and was fair game.\\"  He was informed on a later visit to avoid a certain region because it was Thursday; seeking clarification, he learned that Thursday was cremation day.  AIDS had come, and he was being advised not to be downwind of the burning of the week's accumulated bodies.  Also, Ward is open about the effect of his career on his family, which he obviously loves, but he loves his travel to the field as well.  Leaving them again for Africa, he can't find words to explain why the hunt is so important for him, and the parting becomes an unsweet sorrow, even an angry one.  \\"Why do we do what we do?\\" he asks.  It is a great question.  He has answered the scientific questions as directly as he can, and in his report of struggling to overcome many physical, emotional, and societal hurdles to find answers, he has given an indirect but satisfying answer to his personal why.hat could survive to beget the dinosaurs and mammals that were to come.

We might describe a hero as lionhearted, but a villain as a snake or a rat.  Or an insect.  Insects are generally regarded as bad creatures.  They sting, bite, spread disease, and eat our homes and food.  Of course, they are no more bad than lambs are bad.  They are simply doing what evolution has equipped them to do.  It can be argued that they are not good, too, but in _What Good Are Bugs?  Insects in the Web of Life_ (Harvard), entomologist Gilbert Waldbauer makes the case that as far as making the natural world go around, insects are very good indeed.  In fact, he calculates that only about 1.5% of the known insects do us any harm, and a very much smaller percent of the total insects do so, since we have only identified about a tenth of them all, and are better at identifying the pests.  Waldbauer, who is professor emeritus of entomology and in this book reflects on decades of loving interest in his subject, says that without insects &quot;...virtually all the terrestrial ecosystems on earth... would unravel.&quot;  His book, usefully organized with each chapter about a particular activity that insects perform, makes an entertaining and convincing case.  We could not have evolved ourselves without insects, and could not keep living if they were to disappear.<br />It is not surprising that Waldbauer's first chapter is about pollination.  Most people know that insects are the pollinators of many flowers and other plants, but people didn't always know this.  Pretty flowers were said to be merely a manifestation of God's eagerness to give us pleasure.  It was only in 1793 that an observer wrote about flowers, scent, and nectar as a lures for insects, and the discovery that the plants could not be fertilized without them.  Most of the plants we eat are fertilized by insects.  Insects also help plants by spreading their seeds, thus keeping sibling plants from breeding with each other and spreading the range of the plants.  Dung beetles roll the seeds away, locusts carry undigested seeds in their guts, and ants and termites bring seeds into their nests.  Ants also protect plants; a species of ant lives on the acacia tree and when these ants smell a mammal, they go on alert ready to sting anything that would take a nibble of a leaf.  They also clear out the plants that live nearby which would compete for the acacia's nutrients.  Insects directly help animals, besides being food for them.  Many birds bathe in ants (&quot;anting&quot;) to get their mites and lice eaten away.  Ants protect birds in particular trees, and other birds deliberately make their homes near wasp nests.  Insects do harm plants and animals, but in Waldbauer's larger evolutionary view, this is merely a limitation of population growth, a prevention of a species burning out in uncontrolled profusion.  Harvester ants, for instance, compete with rodents for seeds, and thus keep the rodent population down.  Insects are vital in the role of cleaning up.  They clean up dead flesh, manure, and dead plants.  Bacteria are the ultimate decomposers, but they cannot work on rough plant litter.  Once the litter has passed through the guts of maggots, springtails, termites, and others, bacteria and fungi can go to work on it, turning it back into soil.<br />The action of termites simply shows why we think them bad.  Termites do nothing except make a living off dead wood, as they have always done.  We are the ones that have turned things topsy-turvy by valuing dead wood in our buildings.  Waldbauer's book is hugely valuable in taking this larger view of fascinating fellow creatures.  It gives many instances of clever experiments that entomologists have done, bothering the bugs until they give up their secrets.  It provides countless examples of evolutionary design that is intricate, even witty.  For instance, the botfly has to get its eggs deposited onto a mammal for them to develop, but the female never has to worry about getting swatted; she catches a fly or mosquito, glues her eggs to it, and releases it.  The botfly larvae know to pop out when they are delivered to a warm-blooded animal.  The book's many examples of this kind can only increase one's admiration for the clever humans who have figured out such things, and for the intricate ways insects have adapted themselves to become a cornerstone of all our planet's life.getting swatted; she catches a fly or mosquito, glues her eggs to it, and releases it.

A guidebook in 1822 described the South American country in glowing terms.  It had good soil, timber, gold, a healthful atmosphere, and a work force eager to bring the country into modernity.  Descriptions of Poyais made it especially attractive for the times; there was speculation that a canal would be dug to unite the Atlantic and Pacific, and the region was going to be a new world economic center.  The Cazique (Prince) of Poyais himself was in London and Paris in the 1820's, and he and his wife were was greeted by the rich and powerful, and bankers and investors were eager to befriend him by making money from his country.  Ships carrying immigrants to the new land were chartered and sailed off.  The problem was that Poyais never existed.  In _The Land that Never Was: Sir Gregor MacGregor and the Most Audacious Fraud in History_ (Da Capo Press), David Sinclair has told an extraordinary tale about an amusing, and deadly, hoax; it is a rattling good book of history and human folly.<br />MacGregor was the Scottish son of a merchant family, who had an undistinguished spell in the British Army.  The most distinguishing thing he did was to become obsessed with uniforms, niceness of rank, and honorary badges.  He served in the Venezuelan army, and had some success, and some claims to heroism, but also took every chance to puff those claims.  He also repeatedly ran away from action.  He was good at devising uniforms, honors, and military protocol.  He returned to London in 1821 and he explained that he had been created Cazique by the grateful and anglophile King George Frederick of the Mosquito Shore and Nation.  The title brought with it thousands of square miles in the Territory of Poyais, and as Cazique, he was required by the King to govern the territory in the interests of its native inhabitants.  As Cazique, he had instituted a rudimentary civil service, a beginning army, and a democratic government.  He had come to London for the coronation of George IV, because his Poyasian people had long been attached to the British monarchy, and he hoped to develop interest in Poyais during his visit.  He succeeded.  Investors bought his bonds, and immigrants sailed to the new land.  They found nothing like he had described, and most of them died. Those who returned, astonishingly, blamed administrators and ship captains for their plight; some even officially signed a document that freed the Cazique from all blame.  He got no legal punishment, and retired to Venezuela on a military pension.<br />Sinclair's entertaining history raises the slightest of possibilities that MacGregor was merely a fantasist who began to believe in his own pretensions.  He might have thought he could really become a Cazique if he could settle the territory.  He had drive and a skill for self-promotion that could, in other circumstances, have made him a leader of settlers to the territory.  He proved to be more interested in the superficial trappings of power, and in the prospect of gaining quick riches, but it is not at all impossible that he could have become just as rich if he had told the truth.  There have been other hoaxes, bubbles and vaporous dotcoms, but this is the only one that traded on fantasies of an entire simulated country.  MacGregor's story, told here with verve and good humor, is a rousing cautionary tale.London for the coronation of George IV, because his Poyasian people had long been attached to the British monarchy, and he hoped to develop interest in Poyais during his visit.

If its leader, US Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, had had his way, the Ex. Ex., as it was known, would still have been sung internationally for the inarguably tremendous contributions it made to geography, biology, and simple adventure.  In addition, it started the still-lasting partnership between the US government and the sciences that, say, does the exploring upon Mars.  Wilkes, to a large extent, made the expedition successful, and also defeated himself by preventing it from being universally celebrated.  _Sea of Glory: America's Voyage of Discovery, The U. S. Exploring Expedition 1838 - 1842_ (Viking) by Nathaniel Philbrick tells an amazing adventure yarn of real explorers, and real human flaws that by turns endangered and enabled the exploration efforts.<br />There were unprecedented logistical tasks in assembling the expedition, which at its start consisted of six ships and 346 men (including nine scientists).  Senior officers had trouble putting the expedition together, and the Navy gave the task to the forty-year-old Lieutenant Wilkes.  Philbrick writes, &quot;Wilkes was a great man.  But he was also vain, impulsive, and often cruel.&quot;  He took offense easily, and would not be placated by offenders.  He remained aloof from his officers.  When things went wrong, he was quick to assume that his men had been incompetent or malevolent.  Philbrick concludes that a more self-confident and capable leader probably would not have brought the expedition greater success, although it could have brought greater on-board contentment and post-expedition fame.  With his enormous flaws, Wilkes was resilient and resourceful, and the list of accomplishments chalked up by the expedition is long.  For instance, they brought back forty tons of biological and anthropological specimens, many of which became the foundation for the collections displayed at the Smithsonian Institution.  But upon his return, Wilkes was court-martialed for his many real abuses, and some that were not real, such as a charge that he falsified surveying sightings.  While he got off lightly, and became recognized as a naval hero in the Civil War, and even an Admiral, he is not the recognized hero that, say, Scott or Shackleton is.<br />His flaws brought on his obscurity, which Philbrick's engaging volume will at least partially correct.  There are literary theorists who say that Wilkes was the model for Ahab, and Melville did indeed know of the expedition and its outcome.  A closer literary fit, because of his distrust of his subordinates, would be Captain Queeg of _The Caine Mutiny_.  Philbrick, in _In the Heart of the Sea_, previously made exciting the tale of the doomed whaleship _Essex_, and there is plenty of nautical excitement in his story of this expedition as well.  There is less of a tale of men against nature here, though, and more of the conflict of commander against officers, and of a man against himself.ithsonian Institution.

Sure, the things pile up and please skiers and dismay drivers, but taken one by one, each snowflake is not only pretty, it has enough complexity and mystery about it to delight any careful observer.  In _The Snowflake: Winter's Secret Beauty_ (Voyageur Press), two careful observers have documented what intrigues them about snowflakes.  Kenneth Libbrecht is head of the physics department of Caltech, and he not only rushes out with a magnifying glass when it snows, he grows snowflakes artificially in his lab.  Patricia Rasmussen is a photographer who started taking pictures of snowflakes with her own equipment and then used Libbrecht's special apparatus.  This is a book a little larger than a hundred pages, but the pictures are elegant, and the text tells the current explanations, as far as we now know them (there are still mysteries), of why snowflakes look the way they do.<br />The famous snowflake pictures of William Bentley inspired Rasmussen to start taking pictures of snow.  Bentley's pictures are carefully reproduced white-on-black images, but Rasmussen has experimented with colored light to give multicolored pastels that shine on and through the hundreds of crystals depicted here.  There are plenty of the six-armed variety, but also triangular snowflakes, and twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four armed ones, as well as tiny ice crystals shaped like needles, prisms, barrels, or bullets. can form at the right conditions.  Different humidity and temperature produces the shapes.  For the familiar snowflake, each arm experiences the same microclimate, so each changes in the same way.  One arm of a flake thus does not &quot;know&quot; what the other arms are doing so it can turn itself out identically; they are all simply products of identical environmental history.  As can be suspected, snowflakes that develop in the same regions have the same general design.  But of course, everyone knows that no snowflakes are identical.  Libbrecht considers whether this question is really true, and finds it cannot be answered without close considerations of &quot;What is a snowflake?&quot; and &quot;What is identical?&quot;<br />Snowflake science is here presented clearly and with good humor by someone who obviously loves his work.  Libbrecht demonstrates that since a snowflake is a billion billion water molecules grabbed from the atmosphere, some of them are from your own exhalations.  He does the calculations to show that about a thousand of the water molecules in every snowflake you see in this book (and of course, any other snowflake) come from you.  &quot;Thank you for your contribution,&quot; he says, &quot;and keep up the good work.&quot;  Jaunty and illuminating scientific descriptions, plus the most beautiful pictures of snowflakes ever made, make this a volume that can be valued for eye-catching brilliance or mind-engaging elucidation.But of course, everyone knows that no snowflakes are identical.

I was thus delighted to find that this government branch has produced a quite beautiful volume, _History of the United States Capitol: A Chronicle of Design, Construction, and Politics_ by William C. Allen.  It even has a publication note: \\"106th Congress, 2d Session / Senate Document 106-29 / Printed pursuant to H. Con. Res. 221,\\" but don't be put off by this.  It may be an official US Government publication, but it is a large format book of almost five hundred glossy pages, it is well illustrated, and it is written with no touch of bureaucratese.  Cynics alert: the government can do some things very well.<br />Of course, that is what the book itself is about.  The Capitol is a real triumph, a gorgeous building that does everything architecture can do to inspire hand-over-the-heart patriotic feelings.  Underneath that magnificent dome are wings that are beautifully proportioned and decorated, and it comes as a surprise to learn just how much the building consists of additions that were never anticipated when its first stone was laid in 1793.  Indeed, the splendid dome we see now was before just a smaller spherical cap without decoration, and the building consists more of additions than it does of the original structure.  We may now think of the building as essentially finished; indeed, historic preservation activists have in recent decades prevented any major additions or changes, but for most of its history, the Capitol has been tinkered with and pieced together.  In 1827, Representative Charles Wickliffe of Kentucky addressed the house to complain that the building was not yet finished, and that old men from his district who had worked on it were now amazed to find out that the work was incomplete.  Almost ever since, elected representatives within the building have criticized the Capitol, bothered its funding, politicized the selection of architects, and in general acted like politicians.  The building remains symbolic in this way: a magnificent outcome has arisen despite the arguing and shenanigans.<br />The book describes the placement upon Jenkins Hill of the \\"Congress House\\" within the famous plan of the city drawn up by Pierre L'Enfant.  It was Jefferson who insisted that that it be called a \\"capitol,\\" with roots deep in the Roman republic, emphasizing ancient principles of citizenship and self-government.  There was a competition for the design of the original building, but there is not really one original architect, as it was built by compromise between various plans.  George Washington insisted on a dome \\"for beauty and grandeur,\\" but thought it might be a good place to put a clock or a bell.  It was the classicist Jefferson who advised Washington on the final design, and who worked intimately with B. Henry Latrobe to produce the initial structure.  Prominent within it was the rotunda, with proportions taken almost directly from the Pantheon in Rome.  The Jefferson - Latrobe partnership was enormously productive, but not without some conflict.  Latrobe, for instance, was in favor of a \\"lantern\\" to be raised upon the dome as a means of covering it and allowing for light to enter, but Jefferson was clearly bound to classical precedent; he knew of no such lantern on classical buildings, terming them \\"degeneracies of modern architecture.\\"  By the time the dome was really to be erected, the British had in 1814 burned much of the original building, and Charles Bullfinch designed a relatively low, spherical dome close to the desires of Washington and Jefferson.<br />Latrobe was the first of the architects to deal with the Americanization of classical influence.  For instance, the sculptors of the enormous eagle above the Speaker's rostrum produced a weird bird that wasdistinctly un-American.  The Italian sculptor modeled the bird from memory, and it was only after shipments of anatomical parts of a bald eagle to the sculptor that we got an eagle whose inauthenticity would not \\"be detected by our Western Members.\\"  Latrobe also designed novel columns for the inside of the building, capped by magnolias or graceful tobacco leaves rather than the classical acanthus.  His most popular feature, however, were the corn columns, the body of which resembled stalks of corn tied together (rather than plain fluting), with a cap of ears of corn.  Everyone liked them, and they enabled him to get extra appropriations.<br />The architect who has most to do with the appearance of the Capitol as we know it was Thomas U. Walker, who entered the competition for the expansion of the building, once the old Senate and House chambers were acknowledged as too small.  His design of wings for new chambers on either side of the old ones, and connected to them by narrow corridors, was approved by Millard Fillmore in 1851.  Walker worked on the creation of the new chambers even though for most of his term the building project would be transferred to the War Department.  It is not clear who had the idea for a vertical extension of the low dome into the splendid one we now see, but by the time a certain Representative addressed his colleagues about the fire hazard of the mostly wooden Bulfinch dome, Walker was already designing its replacement.  Many of Walker's beautiful drawings and plans for the dome are reproduced here.  The dome is of fireproof cast iron, painted to look uniform with the stone of the rest of the building.  Miraculously, the colossal and ornate dome exceeded in weight the original, much smaller, masonry and wood dome by only twenty percent.  It was not without controversy; there were many in architectural circles who insisted that buildings and materials must be honest and iron should not imitate stone, but this was never a controversy entered by the politicians.  The dome had been started by the beginning of the Civil War, but the firm with the contract for the cast iron had over a million pounds of it on site, and kept working even though the government admitted that the war would postpone all payments.  During the war, the Capitol was used as a bakery, a barracks, and a hospital.  With the confusion of war, the grounds became trampled by hogs and goats, and they rubbed against and discolored the ironwork waiting installation.  But the great dome was completed by the time the war was over.<br />There have been extensions to all four sides of the Capitol, and many changes to the interior.  While many of the historic decorations have been deliberately retained, a few (and it seems significantly few) changes have done serious damage to what went before.

The theme, the \\"Ode to Joy,\\" is a tune everyone knows, consisting of only six tones spread over twenty-four bars; you can probably pick it out at the piano even if you don't know piano.  If music is, as is often claimed, a universal language, then this is as universal as it gets.  And so it is disturbing that no other musical work has been so used as a political tool.  _Beethoven's Ninth: A Political History_ (University of Chicago Press) by Esteban Buch gives a history of the often contradictory appropriations of the work during two centuries of wildly differing political times.  An intellectual, scholarly look at what people have done with an emotive composition, the book will make readers wonder about how music comes to convey anything to us, and whether there is a moral value to art.<br />The words of the more agreeable song consist of very rich appeals such as that all men will be brothers under the wing of joy, and that the millions should embrace in a kiss for all the world.  (I cannot help feeling that the joy conveyed in the music is more likely to be received by those who don't know German.)  At least the lyrics are not a simple manifesto; because of this, though, and because of the universality of the appeal to joy and of the tune itself, the Ninth has become distinctly political music.  The German nationalists adopted it in the nineteenth century at the same time the French detected that it was the soul of liberty, equality, and fraternity.  Communists hear a call to classless brotherhood.  Catholics have found the literally divine in it.  Hitler liked to have it played on his birthdays.  It was played in his concentration camps.  The BBC played it as an anti-Nazi symbol.  Cleared of the stain of Nazism, the tune in 1985 became the official anthem of Europe.  The tune, that is, under the re-written form by Herbert von Karajan, former Nazi party member.  The European anthem is wordless.  The tune became the Rhodesian national anthem in 1974, an anthem to apartheid.  It was played in celebration of the Berlin wall coming down.  (Bernstein conducted, and \\"freedom\\" was substituted for the word \\"joy.\\")  The Ninth has affected our technology; when the CD was unveiled, the duration of the music on one CD was selected to allow all the Ninth Symphony to go on one disc.  The clearest artistic demonstration of the ambiguity of this multi-significant music was in Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_, where, with all the freedom he can handle, droog Alex responds to the Ninth with visions of lovely ultraviolence.  The film uses an electronically synthesized version, a Ninth as queer as a clockwork orange.<br />It would be nice to think that a paean whose main line is \\"All men will be brothers\\" would somehow rise above politics.  Buch not only shows that this did not happen, he has set out all the contradictory claims on the music that started shortly after it premiered and have continued to our time.  He rightly shows there is no \\"correct\\" interpretation if one is looking for political meaning.  This is far from saying that the music can mean anything anyone wants.  After this detailed look at the work's misappropriations, readers will be eager to sit down and just listen.  It's the most glorious music, and it engenders goodwill towards others just in the listening.  It may be facile (and untrue) to state that the Ninth is above politics, but although politics have sadly trivialized and tarnished it, it remains humanity's anthem.zi party member.

The tale of this atrocity has been told before, but never with the detail and sweep found in _And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank_ (Pantheon) by Steve Oney.  It is a huge book, a result of seventeen years of research, and provides insights into the case from sources that have previously not been consulted.  Despite the detail, Oney's essentially chronological narrative maintains intensity throughout.  We already know that Frank gets lynched in the end, but the events leading up to the lynching are still suspenseful, and the varied aspects of the aftermath are still surprising.<br />The chronology begins with Mary Phagan, thirteen years old and an employee of the National Pencil Factory in Atlanta, of which Frank was superintendent.  On 27 April 1913, her body was discovered in the basement of the factory.  Suspicion turned to a black janitor, Jim Conley, who gave three different contradictory versions of his story to police.  His final version was that Frank tried to seduce Mary Phagan while Conley stood guard for his superintendent, and then that he and Conley disposed of the body in the basement. When Frank was interviewed, he was visibly nervous, and urged by the Atlanta papers, police arrested him.  It was easy for demagogues in Atlanta to rake up the old stories about Jewish plots or financial vampires sucking hard-laboring Christians dry, and whatever Frank's chance in the courtroom, public outrage against him was constant.  Convicted, he was given a last minute commutation from death sentence to life imprisonment by the outgoing governor, since his cause was internationally known.  Spurred by the demagoguery of Tom Watson and his weekly _Jeffersonian_, citizens of Marietta, Phagan's family home, organized an astonishing military-like operation to break into Frank's prison, transport him to Marietta, and lynch him.  The citizens trooped out to see the hanging body, and one woman said she could not stand to see a hanging, \\"But this - this is different.  It is all right.  It is - the justice of God.\\"  Crowds enjoyed hearing the hymn \\"That Old Time Religion.\\"<br />Not a single conspirator in the lynching was prosecuted.  This was partially because one of their members was put in charge of the grand jury examining the case.  Some of them went on to further civic careers.  The lynching was a spark in the modern revival of the Ku Klux Klan.  It also sparked B'nai B'rith to found the Anti-Defamation League.  Tom Watson rode his popularity into the US Senate in 1920.  Oney is especially good at giving a social history of Atlanta and the relations between blacks, whites, and Jews within it.  His portraits of the many individuals nationwide who were involved in the case are excellent, with the most interesting being that of lawyer William Smith.  Smith, after coaching Conley and thus assisting in Frank's conviction, became convinced that the trial's outcome was wrong, and began doing his own research into the case, amassing a body of facts that should have come to light during the trial.  Although Conley is now generally thought to have been the true culprit, Oney quite rightly does not come down on one side or the other.  He reports the evidence as given at the trial, almost all of it circumstantial, and the contradictions, and the evidence on both sides tainted by bribery.  The result is a spectacular demonstration of narrative power through intensive detail; _And the Dead Shall Rise_ is factual history written with all the dash of a thriller.emagoguery of Tom Watson and his weekly _Jeffersonian_, citizens of Marietta, Phagan's family home, organized an astonishing military-like operation to break into Frank's prison, transport him to Marietta, and lynch him.

You just see them both happen at the same time, simple.  But let's say you are very sensitive to the speed of light, so sensitive that you can tell the difference in the interval between light coming from five miles away or ten miles away.  Imagine yourself on a mountain and you see simultaneous lightning strikes on mountains that are both five miles away from you.  You see the light from both at the same time; simultaneity is easy to spot.  But now imagine the lightning hits simultaneously a mountain five miles away and another ten miles away.  You now see one lightning strike well before the other.  Where did the simultaneity go?  It has suddenly gotten complicated and elusive.  _Einstein's Clocks, Poincar&eacute;'s Maps: Empires of Time_ by Peter Galison (Norton) is the story of what happened when two quite different thinkers contemplated the problem of simultaneity, and also of how people have done their best to promulgate an increasingly accurate time within their cities, countries, and the world.<br />Quite famously, the young Albert Einstein was a mere minor bureaucrat in the Patent Office in Berne starting in 1902.  Galison shows that time synchronization had to be on his mind because some of the patents he examined were for gadgets to help keep clocks in synchrony.  Synchronized clocks were becoming increasingly important, for keeping trains from hitting each other, and then to keep microseconds from interfering with mapmaking.  Poincar&eacute; was President of France's Board of Longitude, and synchrony was vital to him as he sent time-signals to cartographers in, say, South America.  If the sent time was off due to cable delivery, the map might be half a kilometer in error.  Poincar&eacute;'s contemplations of synchrony led him to a mathematical concept of relativity that preceded Einstein's.  Poincar&eacute;, however, didn't take the leap to eliminate the ether as Einstein did.<br />This is not a book to explain relativity.  It is a broad history of modern timekeeping, and since Poincar&eacute; is a relatively obscure figure, his polymathic additions to different fields of knowledge will be astonishing to most readers.  It especially concentrates on how there was a complex historic interplay between theories and mechanisms, abstract and concrete inventions, that brought our current understanding of relativity about.  It is a stimulating work, sometimes not easy to get through and certainly not easy to summarize.  But there are intriguing insights about the two personalities involved, and fascinating explanations of the give and take in mathematics, engineering, philosophy, and physics eventually that allowed relativity to be understood.explain relativity.

We know in our hearts, though, that there are limits.  The cruelties of war cannot be extended infinitely.  In the ancient world, there was the supposition of a code of honor.  Brave warriors were expected to fight to their fullest capacity and die if they must.  There were classes of weapons, though, even in ancient times that made bravery and skill futile.  The ancients had to confront germ warfare, chemical weapons, and weapons of mass destruction; no, these are not worries solely to our own times.  In _Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, &amp; Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World_, (Overlook Duckworth) Adrienne Mayor reviews the terrifying weapons that the ancients came up with, the ambivalence about their use, and the similarities to our own times.<br />Mayor's review is of both historic fact and legend, and she says that the mythic and historical evidence is here presented for the first time.  It may have been that historians assumed that ancient people knew too little science to make what the military now calls &quot;biochem&quot; weapons.  They may also have assumed that ancient warriors, if they could, refrained from use of those weapons because of a warrior's code of conduct which forbade such horrors.  Mayor has found hundreds of examples to the contrary.  She has plunged not only into Greek documents, but Roman, Muslim, Chinese, and Indian to show that some authors wrote disapprovingly of biochem weapons, but that also all these cultures used them, so that the issue of what was and was not acceptable was always clouded.<br />When we think of biological weapons, we think of germs, and the ancients used germs, but they also used such devices as snakes, wasps, and venomous frogs.  Naptha, pitch, or quicklime were used as liquid incendiaries long before the seventh century CE when a &quot;petroleum consultant&quot; named Kallinikos invented a horrifying cannon that pumped burning naptha (Greek fire) upon the enemy.  Fleeing armies would leave a repast of food laced with hellebore and mandrake, or even the honey produced by bees that had collected nectar from poisonous rhododendrons.  Stink bombs and smokes were used, according to an Islamic manuscript, for &quot;...causing damage to forts and castles and horrifying the enemy.&quot;  Mayor gives pages and pages of examples, many of which are particularly unpleasant reading, but which will permanently silence anyone who wants to argue about the particular brutality of modern war.  She usefully draws modern parallels, such as the similarity of Greek Fire and napalm, for instance, or shows how the Pentagon has sponsored research in how to use insects as &quot;war-fighting technologies&quot;.  There are pages here to show that for millennia soldiers have been dealing the terror that biochemical weapons inspire, and their unintended consequences (&quot;collateral damage&quot; and &quot;blowback&quot; are not new).  This is an informative and useful book, but given the topic, and our inability through millennia to rise above such measures, a sad one as well.seventh century CE when a &quot;petroleum consultant&quot; named Kallinikos invented a horrifying cannon that pumped burning naptha (Greek fire) upon the enemy.

Even though we aren't really very good at following this rule, and have to be reminded (with questionable results) during flu season, it seems so very obvious.  It is hard to imagine the time when people did not know this, when their mommies did not instill it into them so that it was something like an instinct.  And yet, even the best medical professionals of the mid-nineteenth century had to be convinced of it, and until they were convinced, they literally killed their patients because they were not washing their hands.  _The Doctors' Plague: Germs, Childbed Fever, and the Strange Story of Ign&aacute;c Semmelweis_ (Norton) by Sherwin B. Nuland tells the story of how doctors learned to wash their hands.  It was a surprisingly difficult lesson for them to learn.<br />The problem, for those who could see it was a problem, manifested itself most dramatically in maternity wards.  The world had not learned about germs yet, but the doctors did not lack for explanations of what is known as puerperal (&quot;childbearing&quot;) fever.  Unseen spirits were blamed, as well as miasma, a mysterious condition of stale or unhealthful air.  For us, it is obvious what was happening, once we know that doctors doing autopsies were going directly to the bedsides of mothers about to deliver, without the use of rubber gloves or handwashing.  But only the young Hungarian obstetrician Ign&aacute;c Semmelweis could see it initially.  Semmelweis could make a clear case for a &quot;cadaver factor&quot; being the cause of the death of so many women.  His solution was simple: hands were to be scrubbed with disinfectant between patients.  It worked, and Semmelweis had the figures to show it.<br />Unfortunately, Semmelweis turns out to be a deeply flawed hero for this book.  He was abrupt, sarcastic, and bullying when he tried to get the doctors to clean up regularly, and he alienated many from his ideas by his abusive personality.  He was not only a difficult person to get along with, he inexplicably refused to document his findings in writing and he performed only the most primitive of experiments for verification.  He ignored those colleagues who had supported him by fleeing to Hungary when he felt neglected.  When he finally did publish, it was in a big, impenetrable book that contained the sort of invective for his foes that he displayed personally.  He came astonishingly close to playing a key role in the definition of the germ theory of disease, but simply because of his personality, he had no such influence.  He has been pictured before as the upright physician fighting the establishment, and this is somewhat true; but the better picture, given here, is that his own flaws meant that he would not win such a fight.  Eventually, he became more obsessed and unreasonable, and his wife had to trick him into confinement at a mental hospital.  He seems to have perished there by a beating from the attendants.  Nuland's fascinating story shows how an &quot;obvious&quot; medical solution had to be discovered and promulgated more successfully by others, and leaves unasked the question of what current &quot;obvious&quot; solutions we may be neglecting as we climb the crooked ladder of medical progress.to get along with, he inexplicably refused to document his findings in writing and he performed only the most primitive of experiments for verification.

Kaufmann, and America's Most Extraordinary House	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Structure, Architect, Client: A Fine History	Fallingwater is quite out of the way.  It was a country house, a weekend retreat, and as such was placed way in the Pennsylvania woods.  Yet every year, 140,000 people visit it, and Franklin Toker demonstrates in _Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E. J. Kaufmann, and America's Most Extraordinary House_ (Knopf) it is the most-visited home in the United States except for those visited for history or for an association with a personality.  People come to see Fallingwater because it is an architectural masterpiece.  And yet, as Toker says, &quot;Visiting Fallingwater has only a little to do with architecture and engineering: the quality we perceive here is essentially spiritual.&quot;  Because of the deep allusions to nature (the most common remark is that the house seems to have been part of the surroundings or to have grown out of them naturally), every visitor from every culture, even one who has no love for modern architecture, finds something appealing in the building.  Toker, a professor of the history of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh, obviously loves his topic, but more importantly, he knows not only twentieth-century architectural history but specifically the history of one of the main commercial builders of Pittsburgh.<br />There is plenty to read about Wright here, but the world knows him well already (though the book does puncture myths, some complimentary and some not).  E. J. Kaufmann, however, if known at all is known as the man who built Fallingwater.  He was an astute businessman, a Pittsburgh department-store tycoon and philanthropist.  Wright needed the house because at the time his reputation had stalled and he had no clients, and Kaufmann needed the house to redress the anti-Jewish snobbery of Pittsburgh.  It worked for both sides wonderfully.  That does not mean they had an easy relationship.  Wright demanded loyalty of his clients, worshipful obedience, and got it much of the time.  But Kaufmann was not worshipful, and could not be bullied.  After the unalloyed success of Fallingwater, he continued to build personal and commercial structures, sometimes dangling the commission in front of Wright, sometimes getting plans but never building with him again.  They were the city Jew and the Midwestern isolationist, and as Toker reflects, it is amazing they accomplished anything at all.<br />Toker tells all about the most memorable aspect of the design, the overshoot balcony, which was a late addition to the plan.  Toker makes plain that Wright had a brilliant and intuitive sense of form and structure, but he was not an engineer, and Fallingwater was imperiled by the start.  Only recent reinforcement cables have kept it from falling down.  Toker includes a fascinating chapter about the &quot;hype&quot; and the &quot;buzz&quot; that surrounded the house from its beginnings.  Wright's friend, Henry Luce, got the building into his own magazines and into newspapers all over the world.  Ayn Rand took details of the Fallingwater story and included them transformed into fiction for her novel _The Fountainhead_.  A final chapter is devoted to Kaufmann's son, Edgar Junior, who was briefly a student of Wright's (not a happy time for either).  He was &quot;an important American aesthete of the twentieth century,&quot; but he also cultivated the idea that he was the real spark that got his dad to erect Fallingwater.  He may have been deluded or lying, but he did take loving care of the place, donating it to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy which makes it accessible to the public.  He was himself one of the many sources consulted for this big and well-illustrated volume.  Toker is an obvious fan of the house, and of Wright, and of Pittsburgh, and his enthusiasm shows in richness of detail and anecdote in a volume that shows architecture to be surprisingly exciting.and could not be bullied.

Entering the trial, Wilde was a celebrity and a playwright with the magnificently silly _The Importance of Being Ernest_ in successful performance in London and New York.  Afterwards, he was pursued, tried, convicted, and imprisoned at hard labor for the then crime of homosexuality.  It is a story that has been told many times and turned into dramas.  Those of us who love Wilde's writing and outrageous wit will always wonder what would have happened if he had been able to write and live as he wished, instead of being ruined and sent to an early death.  Amazingly, the trial record has until now been unavailable.  There were summaries, and publication of extracts, but only with _The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde: The First Uncensored Transcript of the Trial of Oscar Wilde vs. John Douglas (Marquess of Queensberry)_, 1895 (Fourth Estate) do we have a full record.  In 2000, an anonymous source donated a transcript of the trial to the British Library.  It was authenticated, and has now been edited by Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson.  Anyone interested in Wilde's life and writing will be fascinated by this verbatim record which puts judge, prosecutor, defender, and of course Wilde himself on the stage of the Old Bailey to play out their roles verbatim.<br />Holland has a useful introduction to recall the details of how Wilde was snared into legal doom, spurred by his young man Lord Alfred Douglas (&quot;Bosie&quot;) to bother Bosie's abominable father Queensberry.  When, after several skirmishes, Queensberry left his calling card at Wilde's club, with the words &quot;To Oscar Wilde posing as somdomite&quot; (spelling was one of the Marquess's shortcomings), Wilde should have thrown it into the fire.  Instead, egged on by Bosie, he took Queensberry to court for libel.  It was the mistake of his life.; as Holland writes, &quot;If I could ask my grandfather a single question, it would have to be, 'Why on earth did you do it?'&quot;  Wilde did not take advice that he leave the country, and so sealed his own doom.  Most of the pages of this book are the words from the trial, and most of those words come from the bouts with Wilde in the witness box.  Initially he seemed to enjoy his role in the events, and gave as good as he got.  For much of the repartee reported here, the transcriber notes: &quot;(_laughter_.)&quot; and &quot;(_more laughter_.)&quot;  But an eventual flippant answer overthrew Wilde on the stand, although his case could not have been won.  When Carson asked about a companion, &quot;Did you ever kiss him?&quot; Wilde replied, &quot;Oh, no, never in my life; he was a peculiarly plain boy.&quot;  It was not long after that Wilde and his lawyers withdrew the charges, and Queensberry was declared not guilty.<br />If Queensbury was not guilty of libel, it was reasonable to think that his accusations were truthful, and with the evidence already gathered, Queensberry assisted in a speedy arrest of Wilde, who once again had refused advice that he leave the country.  The subsequent trials, one with a hung jury and one finding him guilty of gross indecency, are not covered in this volume.  Wilde had two years of hard labor, and three sad years of exile before his death in Paris in 1900.  He produced the mordant &quot;Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; but little else during these years, and while there are plenty of examples that his wit remained in conversation, we were robbed of subsequent examples of the delicious laughter that had come from each of his successively improving plays.  This is a useful book as full documentation of the first trial, and Holland has given helpful notes throughout.  Those who admire Wilde, however, will find it more than useful.  Wilde was brilliant at Greek and admired Greek drama and life, and it is no exaggeration that the transcript of the trial, reading as it does like a piece of period theater, has all the marks of a classic tragedy.t does like a piece of period theater, has all the marks of a classic tragedy.	2003-12-09

Asked how he came to be born in Lowell, Massachusetts, he replied, &quot;I wanted to be near my mother.&quot;  And it is his mother that his countrymen remember him for.  &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1: Portrait of the Artist's Mother&quot; is one of the most famous paintings in the world, better known as &quot;Whistler's Mother.&quot;  Sarah Walden, a leading picture restorer, got the job of restoring it a few years ago.  She researched the work extensively before she took on the intimidating task of renewing its surface.  In _Whistler and His Mother: An Unexpected Relationship_ (University of Nebraska Press), Walden has described the restoration process in her book's final chapter, but has also given a history of the picture and its changes in meaning.  It is a book full of surprises concerning just how the world looks at a masterpiece.<br />Whistler's mother was sixty-seven when he came to paint her; she was a stand-in when the model of the day did not show, one day in 1871.  Walden is firmly of the opinion that the portrait is Whistler's best work.  Whistler, a dandy who liked attention and was profuse with his (sometimes foundationless) philosophy of art was reticent about this particular painting.  When someone congratulated him on it, he said only, &quot;One does like to make one's mummy just as nice as possible.&quot;  He lived in England for thirty years, but got little recognition from the English.  Even the portrait of his mother was not appreciated.  It was cool, gray, and empty, and it puzzled London critics.  It was a sensation, however, in Paris.  The geometry, the gray, black, and white, the Japanese influence, and the detachment all were a hit.  After complicated negotiations detailed here, it was bought for the Louvre, Whistler's supreme achievement.  Indeed, the American affection for the painting, after it was lost to France, had to do with its being an icon of home, religion, and maternity.  One of the surprising things revealed in Walden's work is that the painting itself physically changed in ways that would reinforce the American interpretation, ways that would have ideally been undone in the restoration.<br />Walden reveals some of the technical difficulties of the restoration process, but also admits that because of the particular difficulties of this work, we will never get to see it as the Royal Academy did.  She has written before of the dangers of over-restoration of paintings, with a result that &quot;... the most seasoned Old Master can come to bear a remarkable resemblance to a colored photograph.&quot;  The dark blacks that are the signature of the painting are irretrievable, but the light areas did not suffer the same problems of thinned pigment, and ought to be fully restorable.  There is here an introduction to the larger philosophy of restoration.  Improving the whites of the bonnet and the handkerchief would ruin any remaining trace of the harmony which Whistler so valued.  In an analogy Whistler would have understood, Weldon writes, &quot;You cannot successfully readjust one note in a symphony, however historically accurate, if the others are several tones flat.&quot;  Weldon tells of a number of compromises that left the painting if not like the day it was finished, then a clear reminder of what it used to be.  The color before and after pictures here are dramatic.  Through Weldon's work on the canvass, and now through this detailed and loving story of the painting, we get to see Whistler's work anew.for the painting, after it was lost to France, had to do with its being an icon of home, religion, and maternity.

The complexity comes with the infinite arrangements of the four simple letters of the molecule, and the array of proteins that the arrangements code for.  We are just at the beginning of understanding and using the coding, and Stephen O'Brien, head of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institutes, is one of the decoders.  In _Tears of the Cheetah: And Other Tales from the Genomic Frontier_, he has told fourteen stories of deciphering DNA for the purpose of determining animal history.  There are remarkable discoveries outlined here, in which O'Brien directly took part or supervised those who did (he is gracious in his acknowledgement of these colleagues), and some of the molecular science is complex and will challenge readers who are not familiar with the field.  The stories themselves, however, are compelling, and will be a good introduction to just what sort of mysteries are being unlocked by our knowledge of DNA and genomes (the sum total of an animal's genes), and how the solution of the mysteries holds potential not just for intellectual satisfaction but for the benefit of humanity.<br />The story that gives the book its title is about genetic studies of wild cheetahs, and it reflects a theme of a population bottleneck which is frequent in these pages.  Because 12,000 years ago, the number of cheetahs were drastically cut (probably by an epidemic), only a handful remained to breed.  When O'Brien came to investigate why cheetahs were breeding so badly in zoos and preserves, there was a shock: there was almost no variation in cheetah DNA.  They were as inbred as lab mice.  Some mice in China a thousand years ago, however, had been squeak by a viral plague because they had part of the virus incorporated into their own DNA; this may mean that all sorts of DNA strands of viral preventatives are awaiting our discovery, and use.  There is a chapter here on Florida's endangered panthers, which like cheetahs are dangerously inbred, and the politics of conservation of species and subspecies.  O'Brien explains how feline immunodeficiency virus (something like our HIV) infects many cat species but kills few of them because beneficial genetic changes are evolving.  There is a fine chapter on the century of controversy about how to classify panda bears.  There were good arguments from the physical characteristics of pandas that put them in the bear family, but there were others that indicated they were related more to raccoons.  The argument was at a dead end; some of the means of classifying animals are based on simple human judgement and are therefore to a degree subjective.  With examination of the DNA, however, O'Brien's team could show that the panda's ancestors split away from the family of bears about twenty million years ago.  Pandas are bears, and the controversy is, thanks to molecular genetics, over.  Looking at DNA has been the way to show that meat from endangered whales was being sold illegally in Japanese markets, forever changing the sham arguments that the Japanese used that their whaling was only for scientific research.  O'Brien's team was involved in solving a murder by DNA fingerprinting, but not DNA of the murderer; O'Brien is an expert on feline DNA, and they had to make a link between the murderer and the only applicable physical evidence, cat fur on a jacket spattered by the victim's blood.  The cat belonged to the murderer's family.  Another chapter shows that amazingly, the human gene lines that squeaked through the bubonic plague in the Middle Ages may be the ones that are best fighting off AIDS.  As both a memoir along the lines of &quot;My Most Unforgettable Genomic Researches&quot; and an introduction to what is going to be an increasingly important method of understanding our world's biology, _Tears of the Cheetah_ is a real success.  The really tantalizingprospect, however, the main message of the book, is that humans and animals may have a genetic store of disease-fighting capacity that is only beginning to be understood, and has tremendous potential for improving health worldwide.prospect, however, the main message of the book, is that humans and animals may have a genetic store of disease-fighting capacity that is only beginning to be understood, and has tremendous potential for improving health worldwide.	2003-12-05

He had to make this plain when he was under attack while on the stand in a trial against a crocodile skin importer.  The defense attorney insisted, \\"Isn't it true that you love crocodiles so much that you would say anything, do anything, to protect them?\\"  Brazaitis feigned naïvet&eacute;, and asked, \\"Would you like me to put my feelings into perspective?\\" and the attorney took the bait.  Brazaitis said simply, \\"I love my wife.  I like crocodiles.\\"  The judge and jury laughed, the defense attorney, turned scarlet, and the defendant lost the case.  This is just one of the funny stories of a working herpetologist and zoo curator from Brazaitis's book, _You Belong in a Zoo!: Tales from a Lifetime Spent with Cobras, Crocs, and Other Creatures_ (Villard).  This is a breezy, delightful memoir that may be short on introspection but is long on enthusiasm and amusement.  It has plenty of interesting information about the peculiarities of animals involved, especially the human variety.<br />The title comes from Brazaitis's upbringing.  His stepmother eventually became frustrated with his aimless adolescent living and exclaimed, \\"You are an animal, and you belong in a zoo!\\"  Brazaitis says that out of spite more than anything else, he took her words literally, and immediately wrote the Curator of Reptiles at the Bronx Zoo to apply for a job.  After all, Brazaitis liked animals, especially the kind that \\"... had scales and everyone else was afraid of.\\"  To his surprise (and that of his stepmother) he got the job.  It was at the very lowest rung of the ladder, \\"as a broom-pushing, turtle-feeding, glass- cleaning, often terrified reptile keeper at one of the most prestigious zoos in the world.\\"  He worked his way up, and he makes clear that it was work, and often dangerous.  He has been bitten by a snake exactly one time, while he, as a young keeper, was feeding an Okinawan habu snake.  It turned out that it was a dry bite, or only a puncture from the un-envenomed secondary teeth.  He is embarrassed about the incident, and ashamed of the many morons (a favorite word of his) who brag about being bitten by a poisonous snake without eventual harm.  He is proudest of his professional achievement of instructing zoologists how to tell the sex of crocodiles.  The wealth of stories here do not have just to do with captive animals.  One New Year's Eve he was called out by the police to help with an apartment full of spiders and snakes which they had to enter as a crime scene.  His job was to make the place safe for the police to enter, to investigate the two dead humans also in the apartment.<br />There are funny stories here, like the letter of complaint he had to handle when he was curator at the Central Park Zoo, from a concerned member of the public who thought that a keeper should be stationed at the monkey cage and use a cattle prod whenever the monkeys engaged in sexual behavior.  There are scary stories, too.  One of the chapter titles says plenty: \\"The King Cobra's Gone!\\"  It details a harrowing three-day search for one of the most poisonous snakes in the world which had slipped its cage.  There is the puzzling mystery of the disappearing and returning snakes and snake food, tales of how you transport crocodiles and frogs, and instructions on the care and feeding of the zoo patrons.  There are understated concerns about the environment and the futures of the species he has cared for.  He worries about the current commercial climate that says that animals valuable for trade need conservation, but other animals need even less concern.  This is a funny, thoughtful, jauntily-written book, and will, as the author hopes, inspire those with a sense of adventure and a feeling that they are different from the rest.a puncture from the un-envenomed secondary teeth.

It is learned by schoolchildren and reinforced by movies and popular songs.  At the very start of _Love and Hate in Jamestown: John Smith, Pocahontas, and the Heart of a New Nation_ (Knopf), David A. Price notes that the \\"imaginative\\" Disney movie gave Pocahontas a Barbie-doll figure, a deerskin from Victoria's Secret, and Smith as a love interest.  Peggy Lee sang that Pocahontas pled to her father that \\"He gives me fever with his kisses.\\"  It should not surprise anyone that such accounts are wrong, but the degree to which they are wrong and the intricacies of the real story, as much as we have them, make fascinating reading.<br />The upper-class councilors and leaders only succeeded in making Jamestown dangerous, and did not make it profitable.  Smith, a commoner who had studied Machiavelli and intended to use his knowledge, got into trouble even on the voyage from England.  He was actually imprisoned on the ship, for insurrection; probably he was doing nothing more than insisting that people do things his way.  He learned the language and customs of the Indians.  This was essential; these were not unorganized tribes, but a confederation of tribes ruled by Powhatan, an intelligent and ruthless military leader.  Although Smith was only in Jamestown for little more than two years (1607- 1609), much of the book is devoted to the displays of friendship, enmity, trust, and betrayal between the two strong central characters.  The third main character, Pocahontas, remains obscure in history, partially because Smith, in all his writings, had little to say about her.  It does seem that she rescued him not once but twice, but at the time she was around twelve years old.  While it is possible she might have had some adolescent infatuation for the powerful leader of the colonists, no historian seriously believes in a romance between them.  After Smith left, due to an injury, she was captured to blackmail Powhatan, but joined the settlers.  She was married to John Rolfe, a widower who gave us the blessings of tobacco as a cash crop.  She sailed to England, where she and Smith had one awkward reunion, but he was able to ensure that she was not neglected by the court when he wrote a letter to Queen Anne to confirm her merits, the aid she had given the settlers, and her status as the daughter of the equivalent of an emperor.  The Old World was too much for her; she died, probably of pneumonia or tuberculosis, before Rolfe could take her, against her will, back to the New.<br />John Smith never returned to Jamestown, although he explored and mapped New England (he gave it that name) and he was always writing books to promote further colonization.  Price's book makes clear that Smith's enterprise, and the Virginia Company's, were commercial from the start; Jamestown was a company before it was a colony.  As the man who saved it, Smith became memorialized as a particularly fine example of an American; Chief Justice Marshall, George Bancroft, Noah Webster, and others praised his courage, prudence, and resolution.  (It might be, too, that his interest in wealth, exploitation, and self-promotion are also American characteristics.)  Price is right to show that that though Smith was no Founding Father, and that the Founding Fathers did not look to him directly for an example, he had prescient views of America as a place of liberty, where one could pursue one's own purposes and passions as far as one's ability and industriousness could go., she was captured to blackmail Powhatan, but joined the settlers.

Such a changes aren't rare anymore; there are psychological and surgical protocols that have become standards because the change is so often sought.  Naturally, there is more to it than just a swap of genitalia, and it affects friends and family.  Sometimes the effects are disastrous, even if the one who has changed is still glad to have made the change, and sometimes most of the people involved adapt remarkably well.  The latter is the fortunate result Jennifer Finney Brown writes about in _She's Not There: A Life in Two Genders_ (Broadway Books), and so she can write comically about many of the episodes having to do with the change.  Boylan is a comic novelist, and an English professor, and so she brightly writes about the absurdities involved in her situation.  There is also plenty of heartfelt seriousness here, though it often takes the pleasant form of frank gratitude to her best friend and her wife.<br />The former James Boylan knew he was a she for as long as he knew anything about such roles.  He grew up thinking love was going to cure him, and he did fall in love, very happily.  \\"Here at last we shall leave all of this and move onward with this new life, finally, miraculously, _healed_.\\"  He married, had two sons, and had his successful academic career.  But he was not healed.  At age forty, he determined that he would began his transition into a body that would match his inner gender.  His wife, Grace, could not understand it; she accepted initially some of his cross-dressing (always remember, those who cross-dress are not necessarily those who feel they are in the wrong sex, nor is either category to be confused with homosexuality), but quite logically, she grieved for the prospective loss of the man she loved.  Faced with his desire to make a biological change, Grace turns out to be a real heroine, and Boylan knows it; Boylan's love for her throughout the book is obvious.  He was as open as he could be with his sons, assuring them that the change reflected no change in his love for them, and that such a change was rare and was not what they themselves were in for.  In may ways, the change was hardest for his best friend, the novelist Rick Russo, who puts a moving afterword to the book, a tribute to their friendship, and a meditation on just how badly changes can go if you don't have friends around to help.<br />Eventually, Boylan, with Grace and Russo, goes to a surgeon who is one of the best in the business.  After all, Boylan joked to Russo, \\"If you're in the market for new genitalia, you really don't want to shop in the bargain basement.\\"  Dr. Schrang promised as a goal that he would make her \\"sensate, mucosal and orgasmic,\\" and the surgery seems to have managed all three.  The three friends got through it.  Boylan and Grace are still married, and still want to be, although one of the curiosities of the situation is that if now they wished to marry, they could not.  There are times in this comic memoir, full of irony and gender puzzles, when the value of friendship shines brilliantly through in a deeply moving way.

Patients were restrained on the operating table by strong orderlies and leather straps and given a cloth to bite on to help keep them quiet.  Surgeons may have been skillful; they used the sharpest of knives to cut off limbs, for instance, with astonishing speed.  They could not control pain except by getting it over with as quickly as possible.  When the anesthetic properties of ether were discovered, it was a great boon to humanity.  But Stratmann's book, _Chloroform: The Quest for Oblivion_ (Sutton) details the history of the second great anesthetic.  It is a dramatic rise and fall story, told with detail and a sense of broader social history.<br /><br />Ether worked wonderfully well, but it had disadvantages, especially its explosiveness.  James Young Simpson, an obstetrician in Edinburgh, discovered the effects of chloroform.  There were no experimental standards in place, and Simpson's procedure sounds simple and dangerous: he would get samples of any substance with a \\"breatheable vapour, inhale them from a tumbler, and make notes of his reactions.\\"  He enlisted friends as guinea pigs as well.  Four days after being knocked out by chloroform in 1847, he used it successfully on an obstetric case.  Though there is a legend that ministers denounced chloroform because taking pain away from childbirth was irreligious, Stratmann has not found documentation that this is so, although Simpson did get private letters along those lines.<br /><br />Despite the frivolous objections, chloroform did have its bad effects on some patients as all medicines do.  There was a long and emotional argument over whether it affected the heart or the respiration after doctors finally realized that some people were dying from it.  Chloroform continued to be used until newer, safer agents began to be used in the 1950s.  This surprising book shows that it was not just used for anesthesia, but also for general sedation, to combat seasickness, and even as fuel for steamer boats.  In addition, it was used for criminal activities like murder and robbery, but it was not very successful for these (or for many of the other proposed uses), even though they did make good lurid stories for the Victorian press.  The wide range of _Chloroform_ makes it an amusing history not only of an important aspect of medical science but of the society of the time.agents began to be used in the 1950s.

Fiammetta Rocco is qualified to write about the disease.  She has had it herself, and her father had it many times.  Her grandparents kept a farm in Africa, and while it can be expected that there were plenty of diseases to bother or kill, malaria was the most prevalent.  The story of the battle against malaria has been told many times, but since it combines science, the conquest of nations, and religion, it will always prove inexhaustible.  In _The Miraculous Fever-Tree: Malaria and the Quest for a Cure that Changed the World_ (HarperCollins), Rocco has focused on the discovery, utilization, and culture of quinine, the drug that for centuries has brought some hope against the disease.  That it has had to work for centuries, of course, means that the battle is far from won.<br />Perhaps the most malarious city in the world was Rome.  It was said that the many marshes around the city provided &quot;bad air&quot; (how the disease gets its name), but of course they actually provided breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that spread it.  When there was a convocation of cardinals, for the eventual election of Pope Urban VIII in 1623, there was a clash of politics, philosophies, and personalities, but the most worrisome aspect of the meeting was that one cardinal after another sickened and died.  At just about that time cinchona bark started coming in.  That it was a miracle cure is clear, and part of the wonder was that a constant scourge of Europe had a cure growing in dense forests in the mountains halfway around the world.  Jesuit priests in missions in the Andes saw that natives used it to stop the shivers when exposed to dampness and cold, and when it was tried on malaria, not only did it work to ease the shivering, it took away the other symptoms of the disease.  It became know as &quot;Jesuit Powder,&quot; and Protestants protested against its use; it also seemed to contradict the humoral theory by which medicine was done at the time.  Its efficacy meant that it would conquer such prejudices, but Rocco shows how in one world war after another, the medicine was not available to troops who needed it.<br />Malaria is still a killer, one person succumbing about every fifteen seconds.  The pharmaceutical industry is generally uninterested in researching and producing medicines for tropical diseases, and the artificial substitutes for quinine have resulted in resistant strains.  But surprisingly, the Jesuit Powder has barely sparked any resistance, and it still works.  This detailed and fascinating book ends with the optimistic outlook for the company Pharmakina, based in the Congo, which is simply growing cinchona trees, harvesting the quinine, and selling it at affordable prices.  Such an operation won't do for the big drug companies, but sensible profits from a reliable product represent good business.  This is a reminder that for all the colorful and dramatic history of malaria and our efforts to treat it, the past is not as important as the future.y which medicine was done at the time.

Walter Anderson has never before had a full biography, but now University Press of Mississippi has brought out _Fortune's Favorite Child: The Uneasy Life of Walter Anderson_ by Christopher Maurer.  It will be treasured by those who love Anderson's vision shown in his thousands of prints and watercolors, as well as his murals.  It is certainly true that Anderson had an uneasy life as detailed here in full, but also an extraordinarily productive one.  The biography cannot explain the idiosyncratic genius which inhabits his pictures; nothing can do that.  But it does allow us to appreciate the way in which a talented man could triumph over enormous difficulties, not the least of which was a serious mental illness which prevented normal or reliable work habits or relationships with others.<br />Anderson was born in 1903, in the garden district of New Orleans, one of the big cities he would return to repeatedly, although his sphere of expression was almost always wilderness or rural areas.  He was schooled in art in New York and Philadelphia, and during some of the time he was at school, his family set up a fledgling business in Ocean Springs.  Shearwater Pottery, set on land acquired by his mother and financed by his father, was a real family endeavor, with his brothers throwing and designing pots, mother decorating them and worrying over aesthetics, and father balancing the books and promoting the business.  Once Anderson returned, he took part in the effort, decorating plates and designing figurines.  Shearwater was to become a mainstay in his life, and a financial anchor; he never made much money from it, but he didn't need much money for his unconventional way of living, and he was singularly uninterested in profiting from his artwork.  He had an unconventional marriage with many separations and general unhappiness.  Nonetheless, his wife knew better than others how to appreciate him, even in the beginning: &quot;He isn't just gifted or talented.  He really is an artist, a genius,&quot; she wrote to one of his psychiatrists.  His attacks on others, and upon himself (with cutting and burning), fueled by delusions and paranoia, would land him into one psychiatric ward after another.  He took long trips by bicycle all over the country, and even spent time in China to study murals there, always sleeping rough and traveling with no luxuries.  His most famous excursions were of course his trips to Horn Island, the eight miles to which he would row with his watercolors and scanty supplies, spending weeks at a time, away from all humans and rejoicing in the neighbor animals he found.<br />Anderson died of cancer in 1965, during a hospitalization for a lung tumor, a hospitalization he smilingly admitted was the first one of his own volition. Only afterwards did his family start gathering up the huge amount of notes, sketches, and watercolors with which he had been consumed for a lifetime.  But even they had no idea what they would find in the padlocked door of a little room that had been added to his cottage at Shearwater Pottery.  When they pried open the door, they discovered that all the walls and the ceiling had been crammed with brilliant murals of sunrise, sunset, nighttime, and all the cranes, fish, pelicans, and other creatures that had been subjects of such intense lifetime study.  It was just one more instance of his relentless motion to depict and to participate in nature for his own sake, realizing nature through art.  The discovery of the room, now part of the Walter Anderson Museum in Ocean Springs, is the close of this satisfying, moving, and well-illustrated biography.wife knew better than others how to appreciate him, even in the beginning: &quot;He isn't just gifted or talented.

It might seem that a recounting of the search for the cause of Lyme disease and a treatment for it would lack import.  Lyme disease is not insignificant; it isn't as deadly as other newsworthy infections, but it has affected hundreds of thousands of Americans, and can cause symptoms from the curious but unthreatening (like a &quot;bull's eye&quot; pattern of a rash) to arthritis, nerve damage, meningitis, and heart disease.  _Bull's-Eye: Unraveling the Medical Mystery of Lyme_ Disease (Yale) by Jonathan A. Edlow, M.D., is a valuable addition to the chronicles of detective work that have led to our understanding, and sometimes treating, serious illness.  As in most such stories, this is a tale of triumph, but it is muted; there is still a good deal of confusion and ill-will among patients, doctors, and their lawyers regarding the illness.<br />Lyme disease was first recognized in the US in Connecticut in 1975.  It is caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called _Borrelia burgdorferi_, but it is spread by what epidemiologists call a &quot;vector,&quot; in this case the deer tick.  The flurry of investigation of the disease was sparked by patients who could not get proper answers from their physicians, and were only eventually referred to Yale University, where the departments of rheumatology, epidemiology, and even ecology started investigating.  Thus began the effort to get an epidemiological grip on the phenomenon.  Gradually the patterns of the illness itself became clearer.  There were stages, first a skin rash, then joint pain, but the connection between the two was uncertain.  There was associated meningitis, facial paralysis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and disturbance of heart rhythm in some cases.  Though Edlow charts the course of greater understanding of the disease, and makes a good case for pure and applied science eventually producing an accurate concept of the disease and its effects, he describes also the missteps and clinical errors, as well as the personality clashes, the human aspects of scientific endeavor which hamper progress.<br />In fact, the book ends on a rather sad note of discord.  Yes, there has been a boom in knowledge about the disease, and Edlow rightly draws on inspiring stories of other epidemiological success, like the connection of cholera to an infected water supply in nineteenth century London, the development of Koch's postulates as a tool for infectious disease investigation, and the degrees of precision in increasingly complicated laboratory tests.  Patients with a sense of independence began to question the theories of the disease's course and treatment, and support groups sprouted up.  Some of the groups began to favor the conventional school of treatment and the physicians who followed it, while others preferred alternative methods (not alternative as in homeopathy or acupuncture, just alternative to the prevailing theory).  There seem to have been organized efforts to censure doctors on one side or the other, some of whom have had to have bodyguards from time to time.  There has been acrimony at professional meetings.  Edlow found that those who were helpful when he began writing his book in 1993 made themselves unavailable for interview in 2000, presumably because of the politicization of the controversies.  Edlow writes, &quot;Nature goes about its business quite independently of those humans who try to uncover its secrets.&quot;  _Bull's-Eye_ is documentation that nature is hard enough to understand, and human nature gets in the way of even the best scientific efforts.of the disease and its effects, he describes also the missteps and clinical errors, as well as the personality clashes, the human aspects of scientific endeavor which hamper progress.<br />In fact, the book ends on a rather sad note of discord.

The physicist who issued them was convinced that at last he was going to be established as a scientist of repute; he had other discoveries and inventions to his name, but had garnered little official acknowledgement.  In _Pendulum: L&eacute;on Foucault and the Triumph of Science_ (Atria Books), Amir Aczel, one of our best explicators of science themes, gives a remarkable account of just how it was physically demonstrated that we are not the center of everything.  The book takes in a good deal of history of the ideas of astronomical movements, and nicely places Foucault's invention within his society and time.<br />Aczel rightly gives a history of the idea that the Earth turned, an idea that was at one time dangerous to hold because of religious implications.  But the only thing the heliocentric model really had going for it was that the mathematical calculations for understanding and predicting celestial motion were simpler.  That made it a good model, but still, you could sit on a hill and night and watch as the heavens moved, and feel no spin of the Earth.  Foucault enabled us to see and feel a bit more accurately.  He was a brilliant engineer, and an even better tinkerer with gadgets at his disposal.  He had worked with electric lighting, microscopy, and photography, and turned his attention to the movement of the Earth.  Mathematicians and physicists had said that such motion could never be observed, but Foucault worked in his cellar for months, perfecting his experiment, which seems so very simple in retrospect.  He designed a series of larger pendulums.  A pendulum swings in its own plane; on a moving Earth, the pendulum seems to shift around, depending on where the pendulum is located.  People loved the huge pendulums and the clear demonstration.<br />Foucault was thereafter a celebrity, a status that he enjoyed.  But it did not help him with the members of the Academy of Sciences.  They were angry.  He was not a trained scientist.  He was not a trained mathematician.  He had scooped them all with a simple experiment that had a universal appeal.  It was not until three years before his death in 1865 that he was elected a member of the Academy, although he had gained many honors by that time.  One of his further inventions was the gyroscope, which he invented specifically to see in another way the turning of the Earth (his word for it, &quot;gyroscope&quot;, means literally &quot;turn see&quot;).  Once again, he demonstrated the truth that the calculations had shown, but in a physical way.  Aczel's book clearly shows how Foucault's ideas fit into the progression of our better understanding (and acceptance) of celestial movements.  There are clear explanations here as well of how Coriolis force, a force Foucault knew nothing about, acts on pendulums, cannonballs, and storms, as well as how Foucault and his idea fit into the religious and political times.  This is a readable tribute to a remarkable thinker.  Come see the Earth turn.ault was thereafter a celebrity, a status that he enjoyed.

Sure, the themes of Allen's films (New York, anguished intellectuals) aren't ones that are shared by most blockbusters, but his process of making films is different.  Since he started making his own films over thirty years ago, he has put out about one every year, a record no other American director has come close to, and of course he writes them and acts in most of them.  It is no metaphor that he has put his life into films, and in _Woody Allen: A Life In Film_ (Ivan R. Dee), the movie critic for _Time_ magazine, Richard Schickel, examines the life work along with Allen.  The book is the complete text of a four-hour interview shown last year on the invaluable Turner Classic Movies channel; that version was edited to ninety minutes.  It also has an essay of appreciation about Allen's work, which Schickel clearly values.  He admits that he is biased, not because of friendship for Allen, but because of similarities between them, being roughly the same age and distrusting organized religion, corporate America, and aromatherapy.  Allen &quot;... speaks to me - and _for_ me sometimes - in a quite uncomplicated way.&quot;  If you do not share his bias, he warns, you are reading the wrong book.  If you do, you will find Schickel's essay, and especially Allen's own words about his work, a delight.<br />The film a year output has lead to many people thinking that along with all the other neuroses that Allen has depicted for himself, he is a workaholic.  He denies it.  He likes the work.  &quot;It keeps me sane to the degree that I'm sane.  It helps me.&quot;  But if he can't get the shot exactly right, and it is time for the Knicks game, he lets the shot go.  He may love making the movies, but he is distinctly modest about them.  &quot;I think I'm going to write _Citizen Kane_ every time out of the box, and it's going to be great.&quot;  And then he is humiliated by what he sees on the screen.  &quot;I have failed almost every time...&quot;  He reflects here on his ability to make jokes; even in high school, he could get out of class at one and go into New York to start writing jokes for clients to put in the newspapers.  His films are not all just funny, of course.  Even though there is humor in, say, the masterful _Crimes and Misdemeanors_, the sad lesson of the movie is that good intentions don't count; &quot;... they do in your heart - but to society success is the bottom line.&quot;  The earnest film-maker in the movie is a loser and the murderous doctor loses nothing.  &quot;I just wanted to illustrate in an entertaining way that there's no God, that we're alone in the universe...&quot;  No wonder people like his early funny ones.<br />Schickel has done a masterful job asking the right questions.  He does not go much into Allen's personal life, but sticks to the work.  Allen gets to explain his attitude toward actors, and it is clear why he can continue to get the best of them to work with him.  He lets them improvise, and he lets them alone: &quot;You get out of the way and let them do what has made them great.&quot;  He is laudatory about Mia Farrow's participation in the films, and for all her subsequent acerbity towards him, he did provide her with an enormous body of work.  Schickel rightly gets Allen to talk on the magic in his movies, like the character leaving the screen in _Purple Rose of Cairo_.  Magic is the only thing that could save us, but it doesn't do so for Farrow's character because she, like all of us, has to choose the real world.  There is a surprising segment on gangsters in Allen's films, who play roles more often than I had remembered.  Allen says that with his father having been a pool hustler and his own having grown up on the streets of Brooklyn, he is closer to gangsters than intellectuals: &quot;I mean, I was thrown out of college in my freshman year.&quot;  There are insights in this small volume aplenty, and if you like Allen's films, you will learn much about him by hearing what he has to say about them.bout him by hearing what he has to say about them.	2003-10-31

The movies do their job of simplifying and giving form to a history that actually was extremely complicated and lacking in some basic documentable facts.  This realization runs throughout _The Bounty: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty_ (Viking) by Caroline Alexander.  Even in her detailed recreation of the court-martial of the mutineers, for instance, she cannot reproduce the testimony of Captain Bligh, for he was off at sea and did not participate, nor, of course, can she tell us what the chief mutineer, Fletcher Christian, had to say.  Not only was he never brought to trial, but he never wrote down his story, and we don't even know for sure how he eventually died.  Nonetheless, Alexander has taken what we can know, informed us what we never will be able to know, and has produced a vigorous history that, even with its inevitable voids, makes compelling the crime and its outcome on the participants.<br />Bligh was the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist, who had sailed with Captain Cook in the Pacific and who took up the pet project of importing breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies to be a staple for the slaves there.  Bligh's model for captainship was Captain Cook with whom he sailed, and whose example of humane treatment he meant to emulate.  He fed his men well, was careful not to let them get scurvy, and he tried to avoid flogging any of them.  He did wind up flogging them, but far less than their previous commanders did.  Alexander shows how Bligh's insistence on minute detail and his harsh tongue may have been part of the explanation for the mutiny, but it would be odd if sailors were so oversensitive to being closely overseen or to strong language.  Absurdly, the mutiny was sparked by a theft from a shipboard supply of coconuts.  Bligh accused Christian of being a thief and scoundrel, and this was too much for a man of honor, or so Christian's supporters tried to make out.  When Bligh arrived in England, having made the amazing 48-day, 3,600 mile trip to Timor via the overloaded open boat in which he and 18 loyal crew members had been set adrift by the mutineers, he was a hero.  He went on to further nautical successes, but families of the mutineers started a series of attacks against him.  In the end, what sealed the reputation of Bligh was &quot;a force more formidable and unassailable than any enemy he would meet at sea - the power of a good story.&quot;  It is a tale of the young hero triumphing over his master into an island paradise.  What is more, it is the brooding romantic breaking chains from the stern rationalist.  It was at the dawn of the Romantic age, and Alexander shows how writers like Wordsworth and Coleridge took up Christian as a romantic hero.<br />Alexander's book is far more than a fair reevaluation of the reputation of Captain Bligh.  She has given details about sea-going, class struggle, and especially the complicated legal wranglings by the accused mutineers, including the ones who successfully used what we would now call spin against their former captain.  The _Bounty_'s story here is exciting, but Alexander's fascinating narrative of the repercussions shows how history is made, or in some cases, made up.for a man of honor, or so Christian's supporters tried to make out.

Darwin's findings, after many years of cogitation and hesitation, were the foundation of his _Origin of Species_, but the _Beagle_'s voyage was not one primarily dedicated to science.  It was by a naval ship bound for exploration but also for territorial annexation.  From 1872 to 1876, however, HMS _Challenger_ circumnavigated the globe for no purpose other than getting scientific information, especially about the sea.  In _The Silent Landscape: The Scientific Voyage of HMS Challenger_, Richard Corfield has told the story of this remarkable voyage, but has also taken extraordinary leaps into the science the voyage sparked well into our current century.  It is an inspiring story of the importance of pure science.<br />_Challenger_ was originally a warship, but for its new endeavor, most of its guns were removed to make way for laboratories.  The corvette was changed to the first scientific exploration vessel the world had seen.  It was a ship on the cusp, with both sails and steam.  There was a naval staff to run the ship and the sounding and dredging apparatus, and also the &quot;scientifics,&quot; the boffins who were to make the scientific investigation and documentation.  There are many first findings reported here, like the &quot;manganese nodules&quot; (which are composed of more than manganese), balls of metallic rock which litter the sea floor like potatoes.  The way such stones are formed is still a matter of dispute, but they are of serious interest now to oceanic mining conglomerates.  Professor Corfield has told the story of the voyage in sequence, but, as with his section on plate tectonics, he frequently jumps ahead for a century to tell what has been found since the _Challenger_.  Just when the reader might be close to an overdose of scientific detail, Corfield lightens the story with quotations from the journals of the members of the crew to reflect on the danger or the tedium of the work.<br />The official report of the voyage of the _Challenger_ occupied 50 volumes, the last published in 1895.  Corfield explains that the voyage laid the foundations for current theories of climate change, global warming, continental drift, and much more.  &quot;Its importance can hardly be exaggerated,&quot; he says, and part of the appeal of this volume is that _Challenger_'s legacy of discoveries in the twentieth century are so well laid out.  But Corfield stresses also that _Challenger_ was a milestone in the history of humanity, a first voyage for knowledge for its own sake.  One of the most appealing characteristics of our species, the quest for satisfaction of curiosity, was manifest on this first voyage.  It was the start of a grand tradition of oceanic and aerospace exploration.eflect on the danger or the tedium of the work.<br />The official report of the voyage of the _Challenger_ occupied 50 volumes, the last published in 1895.

Part of the book was about the Komodo dragon, as close to a real dragon as we are likely to see, and like a real dragon, it eats humans from time to time.  Animals that eat humans are the subject of his latest science and travel opus, _Monster of God: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind_ (Norton).  It is an entertaining and instructive look at the animals that regard us as dinner, the animals at the very top of the food chain.  It won't do to include the worms or microbes that will eat us all in the end, nor the malarial mosquito that he reminds us might be considered the most deadly of animals.  A few snakes may poison and kill, and elephants and rhinos may trample, and wolves may group together to bring us down.  None of these count; they don't individually stalk, attack, and eat humans.  This is a book about lions and tigers and bears.  And crocodiles, oh, my.<br />Quammen visited the Gir forest in west India to see the lions.  Lions in India?  Yes, it is a subspecies closely related to the more familiar African ones.  A few hundred lions live in a wildlife sanctuary, but the sanctuary also is home to a people called the Maldharis and their cattle.  They do pretty well, rarely getting hurt, and they never use guns or traps.  The important lesson here is not only that there has been reserved enough land to support an island of lions, but that they live with people who are determined to coexist with them.  Australia has an ongoing program of harvesting crocodiles in the Kakadu National Park.  The indigenous people who live there take part in the program, and gain money from it.  Croc numbers are up, and human deaths are up, too.  But there is a good trade in croc skins for handbags and wallets, and the paws make dandy backscratchers, so the beasts thrive.  Brown bears, conspecific with American grizzlies, are doing well in Romania because of fluky bad government.  The late and detested dictator Ceausescu kept a department of his government busy feeding bears for him to shoot.  The shepherds were the losers; they don't generally have guns, and their sheep are frequent victims of bear attacks (as they themselves less frequently are), but this has been the way for centuries.  One of the shepherds explains: bears are a treasure of the forest: &quot;A forest without bears - it's empty.&quot;  The native Udege people have similarly lived for centuries in harmony with their Siberian tigers.  It has been suggested that selling prospective big game hunters the right to kill a couple of tigers a year (there are only a few hundred, dropping fast) might provide financial incentive to protect the habitat.  It's a solution, slightly appalling, that has worked elsewhere.<br />You can tell that Quammen's subject is not really man-eaters, but people.  He shows that these top predators have been incorporated into our stories, from _Gilgamesh_ to _Alien_, and into our art and religion.  True to his previous work, the fate of these animals is looking grim, despite Quammen's investigation of some various success stories.  Large predators all over the world cause loss, terror, and death, but not to all people equally; over and over, it is the poor people in the country who are at risk.  But in one example after the other, the poor have come to some understanding with the beasts; there are larger economic forces at play that are going to remove them from the world.  They are known as &quot;keystone species&quot;, without which the structure of ecosystems will fall.  Take them away, and the world gets less dangerous for us, their potential prey, but also less interesting; the niches, Quammen shows, will be filled with squirrels, possums, and rats.  Large animals need large spaces to live in, and plenty of meat, and we are increasingly unwilling to let them have their way.  Quammen is too good a writer and thinker to allow shrill polemicism into his book, but realizes that we have already lost much of our sense of place in nature.  He does write about the predators that are still surviving, but they are anomalies.  When the monsters that have been so important to us are gone, we will have lost much more than just big meat-eaters.  A forest without bears is empty.their way.

Jane Austen knew this.  In _Mansfield Park_, she wrote, &quot;If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory...  We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out.&quot;  Past finding out two hundred years ago, yes, and not nearly fully found out now, but memory is gradually yielding its secrets.  James L. McGaugh is the director of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at the University of California, and he has written a primer, _Memory and Emotion: The Making of Lasting Memories_ (Columbia University Press), which is a fine summary of how some of the mysteries of memory are being tackled.  He has written &quot;for a general readership&quot; (the book is in the &quot;Maps of the Mind&quot; series), but the subject will be a foreign one for most readers, and there are pithy pages that his general readers may have to struggle through.  For the most part, though, McGaugh tells good anecdotes and admirably makes clear some of the most hidden of mental processes, and the explanations help us wonder anew at the remarkable capacities that every one of us takes for granted.<br />It is certainly a field in which people are interested.  There are plenty of books with titles like _Boost Your Memory Now_, and the health stores do a fine business in herbal treatments that are supposed to make our memories better, with little evidence they work.  There may be drugs that improve specific memories, however, or decrease their consolidation.  Much of the research has been done on rats; evolutionarily, their brains wound up much like ours, just smaller and less complex.  Rats can be trained to do such memory-requiring tasks as maze-running and then can be fiddled with in ways that humans cannot.  Such drugs as strychnine, a central nervous system stimulant, can be given immediately _after_ maze training (that is, after all the learning exercise has been done), and the rats remember better what they learned during the training.  Giving the strychnine hours after the training does nothing; the brains must have a consolidation phase during which the memory is laid down.  Other experiments show that a drug like propranolol, used to lower blood pressure because it counteracts the body's store of epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), can counteract epinephrine's capacity to help consolidate memories.  Giving propranolol after an emotional memory test blocks the enhancement boost that emotion gives to memory.  This is not an academic exercise.  Emergency room victims of trauma, if given propranolol, are less likely to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.<br />In such ways is memory yielding its secrets.  In his review, McGaugh quite rightly refers to the important work of Susan Loftus that shows that false memories can be implanted, especially in children.  If you go to a family reunion, it does not take long to learn that some people remember important events one way, and others another contradictory way, but the memories are really there, false or not.  Implanting such seemingly real memories is the way that bogus therapists convince their patients that, say, they have received Satanic abuse as children.  Eyewitness testimony has been shown to be terribly fallible, now that we have video cameras and DNA testing.  But McGaugh and others have been able to discover some secrets about how generally reliable a servant memory is and how it is able to do its job.  His volume allows us the pleasing exercise of picking up from a leader in the field just how much research has been accomplished, and of catching a bit of his enthusiasm for his work.nt, can be given immediately _after_ maze training (that is, after all the learning exercise has been done), and the rats remember better what they learned during the training.

His volume allows us the pleasing exercise of picking up from a leader in the field just how much research has been accomplished, and of catching a bit of his enthusiasm for his work.	2003-10-13

You never heard the official name of the firm's most famous effort, the Central Overland California & Pike's Peak Express Company.  You have certainly heard of the popular name of the endeavor: the Pony Express.  You know the Pony Express, because from its beginning, it was the stuff of legend, and the legend has never stopped growing.  That is the main point of _Orphans Preferred: The Twisted Truth and Lasting Legend of the Pony Express_ (Broadway Books) by Christopher Corbett.  Corbett has given as good a history as can be written about the Pony Express because he has shown what difficulties there are in digging up such history.  \\"We know that much to be true\\" becomes a frequent refrain in his work to emphasize how little we really know of the truth.  It isn't important.  The legends about the Pony Express may not be literally true, but they are real and they mean something, and Corbett's book is about them as much as it is about plain facts.<br />Take the title of the book, for a start.  An ad that supposedly ran in newspapers all through California in 1860 sought \\"Young, skinny, wiry fellows, not over eighteen.  Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily.  Orphans preferred.\\"  The ad has been reproduced many times as part of the Pony Express's history, in such journals as _The New York Times_, but there is no documentation of any original.  Such a title for the book is thus perfectly emblematic of its contents, and also ensures that the undocumented quotation will continue to be attached to the Pony Express.  Such are the risks of writing fact about legend.  Russell, Majors, & Waddell instituted the Pony Express in 1860 as a commercial gamble that mail could get in days from the western edge of civilization (St. Joseph, Missouri) to the western edge of the country (Sacramento, California), almost two thousand miles.  The most surprising thing about _Orphans Preferred_ is that almost exactly halfway through the book, the Pony Express is disbanded.  This reflects its short life; it ran for only eighteen months, overtaken by the first transcontinental telegraph.  So much legend was based on such an ephemeral institution that the second half of the book examines the making and continuance of the legend.  One name looms largest: Buffalo Bill Cody, who had a Pony Express performance at every show.<br />Buffalo Bill's representation may well have been heroic, but it must have been realistic, too.  That is much more than can be said for the Pony Express in novels, and especially in movies.  Corbett lists various movies through which the Pony Express rides, and could never have actually ridden due to its northern route or restricted months of operation.  _The Pony Express_, made in 1953 and staring Charlton Heston, is \\"the best bad movie\\" about the service, and is \\"a spectacular fraud,\\" containing \\"virtually no facts in its entire 101 minutes.\\"  But it is wrong to let facts get in the way of a legend; Buffalo Bill never did, and because of him, everyone still knows about the Pony Express.  Corbett's entertaining book is certainly not a debunking of the myths as much as an appreciation of them.bout _Orphans Preferred_ is that almost exactly halfway through the book, the Pony Express is disbanded.

It has been influential in stage, music, and movies, and in the relationship between the sexes.  It comes as a surprise, then, that the publisher of _Striptease: From Gaslight to Spotlight_ (Abrams) could boast that the book is the only fully illustrated book available on the history of the subject.  If this is indeed so, at least the one history is a memorable one.  Jessica Glasscock, the author, has written a witty and fact-filled text that takes the history from the roots of striptease in the nineteenth century to its culmination and dormancy in the 1950's.  Guys used to say about _Playboy_, \\"I only get it for the articles,\\" and one could enjoy this book just for the text, but there are pictures, lots and lots of pictures, to document all the periods covered.  All the pictures are pretty, and most are revealing, but none could raise a suspicion of obscenity except within the eye of the most prudish.  As any good striptease dancer knows, suggestiveness and refusal to reveal all are hallmarks of a good performance.  As Glasscock writes, the response to a properly performed striptease is a physical response, but the stripper has to be more than physically exciting.  The stripper reveals herself, or at least parts, and this can be arousing, but she has to do more: she has to entertain.  The stripper is a performer, on a stage, with distance from audience members which makes teasing possible.  The entertainment has to result in shock, or amusement, and props and costumes and gimmicks are essential; a woman simply taking off her clothes may be erotic, but it isn't a stage entertainment.<br />The foundations for the stage entertainment striptease which evolved in the twentieth century may be found in the stage performances of the nineteenth, a period that Glasscock covers in satisfying detail.  American variety shows were spiced by two seemingly opposite forms of female visual appeal, the static (nudes imitating classic art) and the animated (Oriental dancers).  The artistic nude thus became part of vaudeville, which was transformed into the American review performed on the accepted New York stage, most famously produced by Florenz Ziegfeld.  From there, burlesque theaters took a synthesis of women in tights or disrobing in some sort of peek-a-boo fashion, as well as the oriental dance transformed into a bump and grind.  The Minsky  Brothers, purveyors of burlesque on the Great White Way, can properly claim that their organization invented the word \\"strip-tease\\" in the 1920s.  The Minskys also instituted the runway (borrowed from the revues in Paris) which brought the girls closer to the audience.  They took advantage of the publicity from police raids, which inevitably incited curiosity and boosted ticket sales, but eventually burlesque (and thus striptease) was officially banned from New York in 1937.<br />Of course it didn't stop in New York, where burlesque shows were simply renamed \\"Follies\\" and continued to play.  Strippers like Gypsy Rose Lee performed without objection at the 1939 World's Fair in Queens, and from the World's Fair the strippers moved out into the heartlands by means of the state fairs and carnivals.  More upscale locales for striptease were nightclubs, and such lights as Blaze Starr, Tempest Storm, and more recently Dita Von Teese and Catherine D'lish kept the tradition going.  In the 1950s, striptease was the last surviving part of the burlesque tradition, but its popularity meant that club managers wanted strippers to go out and hustle patrons for drinks; the distance by which strippers might tease the audience was thus reduced, and it vanished as \\"lap dances\\" became the fashion.  Playboy pinups imposed a \\"girl-next-door\\" accessibility, and filmed pornography went for frankness rather than teasing.  There is a New Burlesque at many clubs now, and an annual Tease-o-Rama Burlesque Convention, so while it may be part of a nostalgic recall, there is little chance that striptease will fade away.  Brightly written as a real history of a cultural movement, and gorgeously illustrated, Glasscock's review is a good indicator that striptease has a past, a present, and a future.lgic recall, there is little chance that striptease will fade away.

It is tangled with pure science, technology, industrialization, profiteering, and world politics.  In the past ten years, there have been loud boasts and loud denunciations about GM crops.  Those who invent and stand to profit from new herbicide-resistant, insect-resistant, salt-resistant, nutrient-added species have promised that farmers, starving third-world children, and the environment will all be benefited.  On the other side are those equally insistent that \\"Frankenfood\\" promises nothing but superweeds, distorted genomes for traditional crops, allergies, decimation of fauna, and benefit to no one but giant corporations.  Peter Pringle has entered this zone of contention almost like a war correspondent, and his bulletins from the front form _Food, Inc.: Mendel to Monsanto - The Promises and Perils of the Biotech Harvest_ (Simon & Schuster).  Pringle has tried not to take sides, but to report on the curiosities, colorful characters, and paradoxes of the new technology.  Because of this, the volume will probably be unsatisfactory to anyone with strong feelings on one side or the other, but it is a good overall look at the controversy.  Pringle insists that people are going to have to make informed decisions on these issues, and his book is a good step in that direction.<br /><br />Pringle starts with the story of Ingo Potrykus, one of the researchers who invented \\"golden rice.\\"  Potrykus coaxed genes from daffodils (of all things) into rice so that the grains contained beta carotene, which can be converted in the body to vitamin A.  Getting the vitamin to third-worlders who didn't have it was supposed to put a humanitarian face on the worrisome technology.  It didn't happen because a mega-company had to be paid off, and the biotech industry was accused of various other infractions.  While Pringle certainly covers the overreactions of anti-biotech forces, he has the most criticism for Monsanto and its fellow corporations.  He gives many examples of how GM food has been cavalierly treated and regulated.<br /><br />There is potential that GM crops might help us, but we are stumbling.  Environmental activists shout whenever there is any product from GM agriculture, and the corporations have a skuzzy record of bullying Mexican bean importers and Canadian rapeseed growers for punitive royalties, as well as lying about the possible dangers of the crops.  The dangers are considerable; what is going to happen, for instance, when genes to produce medicines are inserted into our grain and we get tetanus vaccine in our corn flakes?  The industry has done so bad of job of safety issues that rightly or wrongly, the European Union will not import GM plants, and starving Zimbabwe has refused relief from GM corn.  There is surprisingly little evidence that GM crops actually help in any way; even the financial benefits of Bt crops have been no better than marginal.  The problems are not going to go away; having tinkered with the basics of plant identities, humans are unlikely to stop.  _Food, Inc._ is a thoughtful and unalarmist look at the problems.  GM plants have promise and hazard, and neither their promoters or detractors, nor governmental regulators, are providing sufficient service to those of us at the bottom of the food chain.santo and its fellow corporations.

If watching paint dry does not excite you, how about watching typesetters set type competitively?  Before you start yawning, realize that there were racers who set type, just as now there are racers who bicycle, and crowds paid to watch them and cheered and bet on the outcome.  There must have been something not-so-dull about the contests, and there is nothing dull about _The Swifts: Printers in the Age of Typesetting Races_ (University of Virginia Press) by Walker Rumble.  Partly this is because of his strange subject; the Swifts were the typesetters who were so good at their craft they could race against others, and they were colorful characters involved in an eccentric sport.  Also, Rumble, a historian who has worked as a printer, has included a great deal about printing technology, printing unions, and the place of women in the trade.<br />Typesetting was the last printing task to be given over to machines.  It was the working realm of the fellows called &quot;typos&quot; or &quot;comps&quot; (compositors).  The really fast typos were the Swifts, who picked out letters from cases, set them into their sticks, justified, put in hyphens, and so on at an unbelievably fast pace, their pistonlike arms going back and forth more than once a second.  There were shop races for beers, and in 1886 there was a series of highly publicized typesetting races.  They did not happen on the shopfloors where the typographers customarily worked, but in the public arenas known as &quot;dime museums,&quot; where the competition would be one of a number of attractions including animal displays and stage shows.  Challenges were extended, and appreciative crowds wondered at the capacity of the Swifts to bring down type into comprehensible lines.  Cash prizes could be $1,000 (when a top compositor made $30 a week).  The promoter who had been responsible for P. T. Barnum's celebrated Jumbo the Elephant offered to put the competing Swifts on tour, and to Chicago, Boston, and other cities the competition traveled, often with a hometown champion thrown into the fray.  Victors could endorse products, like the types forged by a particular firm.  One of them performed a specialty piece where he composed with the upper and lower cases reversed, and then he composed blindfolded, and then he composed with the reversal and the blindfold in place.  The crowds loved it.<br />It was a short-lived sport.  Part of the problem was that after the competition in Boston, there was a novelty added after the men had raced: women typesetters.  That would not have been so bad, but the women were faster than the men.  The men sniffed that &quot;as much latitude was allowed the ladies in the matter of time and proofs, their scores cannot take rank as genuine records.&quot;  However, there isn't any evidence that the women had special latitude given at all.  But of course the big problem was not that the men were being shown up by women.  The year of 1886 was not only the one for the typesetting race frenzy, it was the year that the _New York Tribune_ inaugurated its brand-new Linotype composing machines.  The machines, dirty, noisy, and laborious to operate, knocked women out of the typesetting business, to be sure, but they knocked the Swifts out as well.  A linotype operator was supposed to live a clean life, he was stuck to his machine and could not travel from one workplace to another, and he could be expected to average a rate more than twice the speed of the fastest Swift.  As one of the champions remarked in 1895, &quot;The glory of the composing room is gone forever, and soon will be but a reminiscence...&quot;  It was not even a reminiscence, with hot metal Linotypes themselves eventually giving way to phototypesetting and digital typography, until Walker Rumble reminded us of it in this surprising and detailed examination of a strange facet of American history.g Swifts on tour, and to Chicago, Boston, and other cities the competition traveled, often with a hometown champion thrown into the fray.

For 75 years, if you have needed to know about an English word, you could turn to the _Oxford English Dictionary_ and you could expect enlightenment.  You could know you were getting the authoritative low-down on any word you might come across, and you could not only find its definition, but its history of use given in quotations dating from its very first known appearance in print.  For word fans, using the _OED_ is a joy, and every turn of the pages in its monumental volumes registers new affection and admiration for an unequalled intellectual accomplishment.  Five years ago, Simon Winchester wrote _The Professor and the Madman_, an inspiring account of an inmate of an asylum who helped compile the _OED_'s words.  It was a footnote to the _OED_'s larger history, and now, in _The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary_ (Oxford University Press), Winchester has given that history with the same humane and appreciative tone of his first book on the subject.  Anyone who uses English ought to know the _OED_, and anyone who loves the _OED_ will find this book fascinating.<br />Winchester gives a fine brief guide to the history of our language, and shows that by the Victorian age, philologists felt a comprehensive dictionary was needed.  In 1842, the Philological Society settled on a proposal of a gargantuan dictionary, one that would have old words and new, one that would have every word and every meaning for that word.  There was certainly something of power in such a scheme; great men and great ambitions would push the influence of English throughout the Empire, nay, the world, and increase the influence of Britain and her church.  The story of the _OED_ is inextricably the story of the chief editor for the original edition, James Augustus Henry Murray.  He was the son of a Scottish linen draper, and after a rural upbringing, he had to leave school at 14 because of poverty.  However, by that time, he had developed precocious interests in geology, astronomy, archeology, and plenty of other fields, especially languages.  He became a teacher at a boys' school in London, but in 1879, he was appointed editor of the dictionary project.  Murray was not just a lexicographic and organizational genius, however, but a cheerful and persistent diplomat, who was adept at dealing with difficult personalities and making friends with those who were originally nuisances.  He was also a family man whose very happy marriage produced eleven remarkable children.  The children never had pocket money but by earning it in sorting dictionary slips.  One wrote, &quot;Hours &amp; hours of our childhood were spent in this useful occupation.  The motive actuating us was purely mercenary.&quot;  One unforeseen result of this upbringing is that when the crossword puzzle craze came on, all the Murray children were brilliant at them.<br />Murray himself died in 1905 and did not live to see the completion of the work in 1928 (there was a supplement in 1933 for all the new words that had been put in use since the start).  But he knew himself that there would really be no completion of the work any more than the language itself would be complete.  A dictionary is a snapshot of current language, a verbal description that rapidly goes out of date.  There has been a second edition, and a web-based version, and a Revised Edition is being worked on, which will possibly weigh a sixth of a ton and comprise forty volumes.  Perhaps, though it will appear in only an electronic form.  But Murray's basic plan for the dictionary was so good that the plan has remained intact, and the book will continue reflect the growth of our language.  The _OED_ is still looking for volunteer readers, to make slips for new words and also to try to find previous usages for words already in.  For instance, according to the _OED_'s last bulletin, if you can find a source for the phrase &quot;pick up steam&quot; (that is, to accelerate) from before 1944, the editors want to hear from you.ot;pick up steam&quot; (that is, to accelerate) from before 1944, the editors want to hear from you.	2003-10-01

You certainly have them in and on your car.  Perhaps you are not fascinated by mirrors, but that may be because they are all around, ready to be taken for granted.  Like most things taken for granted, it is a good idea to take notice again, and Mark Pendergrast has done so for the common and not-so-common looking glass.  _Mirror Mirror: A History of the Human Love Affair with Reflection_ (Basic Books) looks at how mirrors have played roles in history, literature, technology, sex, science, and magic.  There is a good deal here to reflect upon.<br />Our ancestors had to make do with looking into puddles, polished obsidian, and eventually polished metal.  It was not until the thirteenth century that industrial mirror-making was begun, in Venice.  City authorities forced the glassmakers to the island of Murano because they used such dangerous furnaces.  In addition, authorities could better keep watch on the members of the glassmakers' guild if they were isolated on the island; escaping from the island carried the death penalty.  Mirrors are inextricably entangled with light, and one of the pleasures of _Mirror Mirror_ is that it gives a history of our improving concepts of what light is.  Telescope makers for centuries have been increasingly able to coax light to reveal secrets of our universe, and a large part of the book is about this history of telescope making.  There are many stories here of mirrors that took years to grind into the perfect shape before they could be installed in famous observatories.  The troublesome mirror that had to be corrected on the Hubble is here, as are newer Earth-based mirrors that can be magically adjusted to correct for atmospheric distortion.<br />Despite the book's subtitle, there is not a great deal here about humans looking at themselves in mirrors.  There is a firm called True Mirror that makes a right-angled mirror surface that produces an unreversed reflection; wink your right eye into it and the right (not left) eye of your mirror image winks back.  People looking into such a mirror can be confused, or repelled, but are often fascinated, and the makers encourage mirror gazing as an aid to self-understanding.  It is clear that Pendergrast is much more impressed with mirrors used to look at our place in the universe rather than mirrors that we use to apply our make-up.  He has written a fascinating book that shows that the mirrors in observatories, in orbit, in compacts, and in magic tricks reflect ourselves and our wide range of interests.led True Mirror that makes a right-angled mirror surface that produces an unreversed reflection; wink your right eye into it and the right (not left) eye of your mirror image winks back.

At every second of every day, people somewhere in the world are watching Lucy stomp grapes, drunkenly pitch a vitamin product, or get woefully behind on a candy assembly line.  &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was the hallmark of her career; she didn't do anything as well before or after, but it wasn't for lack of trying.  _Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball_ (Knopf) by Stefan Kanfer is a big, entertaining biography that spends about a third of its pages on the &quot;Lucy&quot; years, when the star produced a classic program that will, like the films of other clowns such as Chaplin and Keaton, always find an audience.  Even during those years, however, Lucy's life was tense and unhappy except for her professional efforts.  It is the standard paradox of comedians, and Kanfer rightly evaluates it in full.<br />Lucy was a beautiful brunette from Jamestown, New York.  She worked as a model and then became &quot;Queen of the Bs&quot;, a hardworking actress stuck in second-rate pictures.  Her eventual success on television stemmed directly from her marriage to Desi Arnaz, but their joint effort was from the beginning an attempt to keep the marriage together.  Kanfer is careful to show just how much Desi contributed and how revolutionary the format of the show was; production in front of a live audience with three cameras going had never been tried before, for instance.  But he knew she was the core of the show; when she tripped on a cable, he told everyone, &quot;Amigos, anything happens to her, we're all in the shrimp business.&quot;)  She got opportunities to show off a physical comedy that movie producers had denied her.  The television success did not, of course, save the marriage.  There are wonderful anecdotes about the production of the show, and surprising facts such as Lucy's summons to appear before HUAC because she had been a registered Communist, and her role in bringing such shows to the air as _Star Trek_.<br />Lucy was increasingly anxious even during the height of her success.  Her marriage failed, and she had fitting worries as her children tried being adults.  She had a phobia about birds and about dirt, and she was a prig, fretting over the morals of movies and upbraiding Marlon Brando for _Last Tango in Paris_.  Spinoffs after &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; were derivative failures, and her movies, except for _Yours, Mine, and Ours_, were embarrassments.  Toward the end of her career as at the beginning, she just did not fit; but it was a glorious second act.  Kanfer, who wrote an excellent biography of Groucho (who along with Harpo and Zeppo has a cameo in this book), has loaded it with facts and anecdotes that anyone who likes Lucy reruns will enjoy.  He has not been able to explain just where Lucy's amazing gift for an almost universally enjoyed brand of comedy came from.  No one could do that.  She had more than her share of failures and disappointments, but harnessing that gift was her main aspiration in life.  The best part of her energies went to acting happy in a television marriage and acting a manic fool in improbable situations with which everyone could identify.  She had a decidedly sad life overall, but increased the world's mirth.  _Ball of Fire_ helps fans appreciate how much of a gift that was.re HUAC because she had been a registered Communist, and her role in bringing such shows to the air as _Star Trek_.<br />Lucy was increasingly anxious even during the height of her success.

Remember, pornography literally, etymologically, is \\"whore writing\\", or writing about or by prostitutes.  Of course we have grown away from this literal standard, but _The School of Whoredom_ (Hesperus Press) by Pietro Aretino meets it.  It consists of a classic dialogue (from the time when dialogues where the choice way of explaining ideas in astronomy and philosophy) between a whore and her daughter who will become a whore.  This makes it sound quite a bit coarser than it really is.  While the book is not without frankness and the translator has not spared four-letter words, it is a sophisticated satire on the morals of men and women.  It is full of jokes, robust humor at the expense of courtiers, clerics, men, women, and different ethnicities of the sixteenth century.  It has some advice to a daughter that works just fine in modern and less meretricious settings.<br />_The School of Whoredom_ (written around 1535) is not a work like Aretino's famous _I Modi_, called the world's first \\"stroke book\\".  While it treats of the erotic endeavors of men and women, it could hardly be called an erotic work itself.  Basically, it is instruction more on how to be a courtesan than how effectively to engage in coitus.  As such, it is more about manipulation of the emotions of men than of their anatomy, and might be read as a prescient call to feminist solidarity.  Whoring, mother Nanna reminds daughter Pippa, isn't easy: \\"So, you see, becoming a whore is no career for fools, well I know it...\\"  She also advises, \\"You'd need more skills than a doctor to be a courtesan.\\"  There is plenty of other advice, some proverbial.  \\"Never mock at the truth and never do harm with a joke.\\"  \\"Don't take pleasure in upsetting friendships by reporting gossip; avoid scandals; and whenever you can make peace do so.\\"  By such means, Pippa is to ensure her position of relative esteem in society, but always she is to be mindful of the bottom line: \\"... a courtesan whose heart pounds for anything other than her purse is like a greedy, drunken tavern-keeper...\\" who eats his own fare instead of selling it.<br />While the liveliest parts of the book are the descriptions of ruses for parting punters from their extra cash, there are many pictures here of a vibrant society, one which valued good food and entertainment.  Aretino's work shows they also liked satire.  There is much here to expose those in power, and plenty that makes fun of the sexual peccadilloes from cardinals to monks and nuns.  Nanna discusses the merits (or lack thereof) between Frenchmen, Spaniards, Romans, Florentines, and Germans, giving pride of place to the Venetians (\\"If I said everything they deserve to have said about them, people would tell me: 'Love has blinded you.'\\").  Nanna has triumphed over men for years, and is delighted with Pippa's prospects: \\"My heart swells so much with pride at seeing you at home in these affairs that I'm in raptures.\\"  Careful reading, though, almost five centuries later, shows she has instructed about far more than the ways of whoredom.dful of the bottom line: \\"... a courtesan whose heart pounds for anything other than her purse is like a greedy, drunken tavern-keeper...\\" who eats his own fare instead of selling it.<br />While the liveliest parts of the book are the descriptions of ruses for parting punters from their extra cash, there are many pictures here of a vibrant society, one which valued good food and entertainment.

As recounted in a riveting history, _Triangle: The Fire That Changed America_ (Atlantic Monthly Press) by David Von Drehle, the fire was caused not just by a careless cigarette, but by social, industrial, and labor forces summed to that point, and true to the subtitle, it changed those forces ever afterward.  Anyone studying the economics and history of twentieth century America needs to know the prominence of the sweatshops, but as Von Drehle points out, we are now once again concerned about the sweatshops from where our clothes issue (they just don't happen to predominate in New York anymore).  And though after Triangle there were important safety laws imposed in New York, there are still factory disasters happening in the equivalent of sweatshops in other parts of the world.<br />Ironically, the Triangle factory made shirtwaists, which were the women's blouses of the time, and they were something of a sartorial liberation for women.  It was a practical garment, with no hoops or corsets, and yet it was fashionable enough for the Gibson Girl.  The book covers the lengthy strike at Triangle of 1909, but the strike was not about safety, just hours and pay.  Von Drehle shows that there had already been factory buildings successfully protected from fire.  Automatic sprinklers, firewalls, and fireproof doors and stairways were, from the 1880s, standard in some factories.  The Triangle owners paid lots for insurance, and little for safety.  The building itself was promoted as fireproof, and it proved essentially to be, but the contents were certainly not.  There were about 250 workers in the building, and as they attempted to escape, each fire hazard took its toll.  A door to the rear stairway was locked, for instance, because the owners insisted that workers use only one stairway.  This ensured that before leaving the building, everyone could be checked for goods smuggled out.  Crowds mobbed shut other doors which opened inwards.  The account of the fire is vivid and scary.  140 people died in the fire, 123 of them women.  About a hundred of the deaths were those who fell or jumped.<br />The owners were tried for manslaughter.  Van Drehle has uncovered a lost transcript of the trial, which focused on the locked doors.  On the stand, one of the owners stressed the importance of having the door locked to prevent theft, but when pressed to state how much loss there had been to theft, he admitted that it was less than $25 a year.  The owners were deemed not guilty, and gained $60,000 in insurance payments.  The resulting public outcry provided a new impetus for workplace safety, creating rules that are in force even today, like the ones requiring outward swinging doors.  Van Drehle shows that even more importantly, it began to be taken for granted that a progressive government ought to be regulating such matters.  Tammany Hall came around to protecting the workers, and from this change grew such philosophies as the New Deal.  _Triangle_ compellingly tells the story of the building's fire, but even better, it covers the stories of the women workers involved in the disaster, and the changes the fire brought.  The fire lasted a horrific ten minutes in 1911, but it has not finished burning yet.g the building, everyone could be checked for goods smuggled out.

Regarding bodies superficially, but in whimsical depth, is the purpose of _Adam's Navel: A Natural and Cultural History of the Human Form_ (Viking) by Michael Sims.  While he may make a brief foray down the mouth or into the ears, Sims has left the innards pretty much alone.  Instead, he has gone on a head-to-toe journey, scribbling down historical, etymological, literary, and  physiological nuggets connected to all the external body parts.  The book is a miscellany; other than the deliberate southwards theme, there is little unity, but that doesn't matter.  Sims is a journalist on scientific and cultural matters (the science here is definitely science light, in keeping with the fun of the volume), and he has amassed a huge amount of information, even if it reflects a quirky selection.  The overall topic is inherently interesting, and the digressions themselves are full of facts.<br />For instance, after regarding the face, its relative hairlessness, the thirty-six ways of moving the eyes, and the way faces are inherited as shown by the photos of your ancestors on the mantel, Sims treats us to pages about the Face on Mars.  What this silly case, and all the other faces-in-the randomness manifestations, show is that we are evolutionarily programmed to see faces even if they aren't faces.  Not only do newborns know to fix their gaze on faces (thereby getting attention from the more competent humans around them), but predators such as ourselves are better off mistakenly making a snap judgement \\"Hey, there's a face!\\" and then sheepishly refining the assessment if it really isn't one.  Sims's discussion of the eye includes binocular vision, the fashion appeal of sunglasses, and Medusa who could turn to stone anyone who looked into her eyes.  It winds up with \\"the argument from design,\\" famously expressed by William Paley in 1802, and demolished by evolution since then.  Darwin himself was troubled by the complexity of the eye, and (as befits a good theoretician) he accepted that this could be taken as an argument against natural selection.  These worries proved groundless, as biologists learned of the connections between primitive eyes (like those in flatworms) and complicated ones like our own.  As befits the book's title, there is plenty here about navels.  A professor of physics, Karl Kruszelnicki, has solved the longstanding mystery of why so much fluff gets in them (and he was awarded an IgNobel prize by the science humor magazine _The Annals of Improbable Research_).  Kruszelnicki did a year-long, self-funded study of various navels, shaved and unshaved, to confirm \\"... his theory that abdominal hairs serve as a conveyor belt for transporting fibers upward from underwear.\\"<br />It is really impossible to summarize the contents of a volume like this whose every chapter is packed with factual amusements.  Read here about the agonizing lip problems of Louis Armstrong.  Learn why Barbie's breasts have resulted in a fatwa against her from Kuwait.  Reflect that lexicographer Samuel Johnson refused to put terms for private parts into his dictionary, and now \\"johnson\\" is widely accepted as slang for \\"penis\\" (resulting in the witty chapter title \\"Boswell's Johnson,\\" having to do with, among other things, the sexual adventures of Johnson's biographer.)  Consider why the male figure on the plaque carried through the universe by Pioneer 10 has a penis, but the female has no vulva.  Learn how the French do not French kiss, but instead Italian kiss.  Any fan of trivia, presented with an eye to fun rather than strictly to erudition, will learn plenty here, and laugh (often in self-recognition) many times besides.was troubled by the complexity of the eye, and (as befits a good theoretician) he accepted that this could be taken as an argument against natural selection.

All of a sudden she makes a fist, extends the pinkie on one side and the thumb on the other, and wiggles the fist with its extended digits.  You are mystified.  What do you do?  The answer is simple: You pull out the _Field Guide to Gestures: How to Identify and Interpret Virtually Every Gesture Known to Man_ (Quirk Books) by Nancy Armstrong and Melissa Wagner.  After all, it is pocket sized and full of pictures, and you always have it with you. You find the photo of the gesture, but you ignore the similar one with the fist elevated and the thumb pointed to the open mouth (&quot;Let's Drink&quot;) or the one where the thumb is near the ear and the pinkie is near the mouth (&quot;Call me&quot;).  No, the gesture is the &quot;Hang Loose&quot;; your partner in conversation is using a sign associated with Hawaiian surfers, but actually traced to Spanish explorers.  The gesture  derives from &quot;Let's Drink&quot;, but as given without the &quot;bottle&quot; gesture, it has no implications of recreational drug use, just &quot;take it easy&quot;.  If you are in Japan, however, the gesture might mean &quot;six.&quot;  There is more information available on this gesture, and on over a hundred others in this funny and interesting book.  It doesn't matter that you know most of them already; included here are pointing, nodding, hugging, rolling the eyes, and so on.  You can find out the history of the gesture, where it might be misunderstood, and exactly how to make it.  You will be surprised at how many gestures you already use and take for granted.<br /> For a sample, look at just a few of the gestures that can be made with the hand in a simple pointing configuration.  The index finger extended from the fist is universally understood to mean &quot;look over there&quot;.  Pointing upwards, it means &quot;one&quot;.  Elevated and wagged it means &quot;No, no, no...&quot;  Slashed across the throat it is an utmost gesture of disapproval.  Inserted in and out of the fingers of the other hand, it means, well, you know.  Tapping the finger on the side of the nose means &quot;We are sharing a secret.&quot;  Put to pursed lips, it is &quot;Shhhhh!&quot; even without the sound.  Put to the side of the head and rotated it means &quot;crazy&quot;.  There is a special subtlety to this particular gesture in Japan.  It means &quot;crazy&quot; when rotated counterclockwise, but &quot;vain&quot; when clockwise.  This distinction, however, the authors note, is fading.  Amusingly, as with other field guides, there is a disclaimer at the front of the book to say that it can't list the millions of gestures and meanings, and stressing that it therefore cannot guarantee full reliability.  Of particular interest to the naughty will be the large section dealing with gestures of disrespect.  If you follow the explicit &quot;1-2-3&quot; directions here, you can perform &quot;The Moon&quot; at someone, for instance.

Pamela Pilbeam says, &quot;There is nothing so fascinating for a human being as others of the species,&quot; and if we can't rub elbows with the stars (and scoundrels) of our species themselves, then waxwork simulations will do.  Pilbeam has written an enjoyable history, _Madame Tussaud and the History of Waxworks_ (Hambledon &amp; London), which gives insight to a subject that, quite obviously, people find fascinating.<br />The future Madame Tussaud was the niece, possibly daughter, of the man who made waxworks a popular exhibit in Paris.  Once the Revolution came, both the theater and waxworks were a sort of newspaper, but waxworks, unlike newspapers and theater, were not censored.  The exhibit showed who was in, who was out, and who was guillotined.  There was a great appetite to put the guillotined heads on display, and, according to her sometimes unreliable memoirs, Madame Tussaud at her studio would receive the heads hot off the chopper.  She would make wax copies, so that there would be enough heads to go around, some going for display in England.  Her eventual marriage to Monsieur Tussaud became unsatisfactory, and to pursue a career in exhibitions, she left him for England in 1802, never to return.  Remarkably, she was 41 at the time, when women did not launch themselves into mid-life careers; she was to continue running her show until her death at 89.  She originally had a traveling exhibit, offering music, good lighting, and space in which visitors could walk around and see themselves, as well as the waxworks.  Her marketing was well-targeted; her show became a central place for people to socialize.  Eventually she settled in London.  There were plenty of others waxworks, but Madame Tussaud continued to be the one to see.  She installed over five hundred figures in the new space, more than any competition could muster.  She kept the exhibits timely and watched what people watched; a mannequin which didn't make people pause and look was doomed to be melted down.  Most importantly, when museums had limited entry, she bought up relics, royal robes, and paintings that would make her waxworks respectable to the respectable middle class.  But &quot;respectable&quot; has its limits; the most popular attraction has always been the Chamber of Horrors.<br />At last counting, Madame Tussaud's had more visitors than any pay-for-view attraction in England.  Pilbeam examines the appeal, but it is hard to say exactly why a three dimensional image of, say, Madonna, would be a draw, when there are plenty of lively photos and movies that provide perfectly good depictions.  There are some artistic claims among those who appreciate the exhibits; there is no reason, of course, why a wax sculpture should be less &quot;art&quot; than a bronze.  Somehow, waxworks might be entertaining, might be instructive, but fundamentally are just fun.  The same can be said of Pilbeam's book.the new space, more than any competition could muster.

He wrote his friend Joseph Hooker in 1856: \\"What a book a Devil's Chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low and horridly cruel works of nature.\\"  Richard Dawkins has taken the quotation for the title of a collection of his writings, A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love (Houghton Mifflin).  Darwin also wrote of a particular wasp: \\"I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living body of caterpillars.\\"  But as Darwin (and Dawkins) would remind us, the evolutionary process has produced wonderfully designed creatures, and a wasp who cares for its young by letting them hatch within a hapless caterpillar is simply doing a competent job of getting the young off to a good start.  It might be distasteful to us (and should have been to a supreme being), but nature just doesn't care.  It isn't kindness of the mother wasp, or cruelty to the caterpillar, but simply amoral nature.<br />But as chaplain, Dawkins notes that while wasps and caterpillars can do nothing about such amorality, we can.  \\"At the same time as I support Darwinism as a scientist, I am a passionate anti-Darwinian when it comes to politics and how we should conduct our human affairs.\\"  There is no inconsistency here any more than in the physician who studies cancer, but is bent on eliminating it.  And as devil's chaplain, Dawkins urges us to use our evolution-given brains, reject the pacifiers of faith in immortality, and rejoice in our short lives because they are all we have.  Dawkins, you see, besides being an eminent Darwinian whose books like The Blind Watchmaker have wonderfully well laid out what evolution means, is also possibly the world's most famous atheist.  You will find here his views on religious beliefs and creationists (or their newest incarnation as advocates of Intelligent Design), of course, but on \\"alternative medicine,\\" crystal healing, homeopathy, and so on.  Besides the rants, there is good humor and some warm tributes to friendship, especially in his memorials to his friends Douglas Adams and Stephen Jay Gould.  The final chapter, \\"A Prayer for My Daughter,\\" is a letter he wrote to her when she turned ten, to let her know how he thought she should select what to believe.  The great question to ask in all disputes: \\"What kind of evidence is there for that?\\"<br />Readers will be reminded of the belligerence of Thomas Henry Huxley, \\"Darwin's Bulldog,\\" but evolution is only one theme here.  Included is his hilarious review of the book by the hoaxer Alan Sokal who submitted a nonsense paper to a postmodern journal and had it accepted.  He rages against postmodernism, with its \\"all views are equal\\" stance making his scientific view equivalent to a voodoo view.  He expresses his doubts about the jury system, and in a wonderful chapter (\\"Genes Aren't Us\\") discounts just how important genes are for personality.  Another chapter makes us wonder at just how close we are to our ape cousins.  Throughout, he is witty, and above all informative on a wide-range of subjects, not just on his refusal to accept what he sees as the diverse delusions of most of the world.

Would you use it?  What if using the medicine was a crime?  George McMahon doesn't have to worry, much, about that.  He has a strange congenital illness called Nail Patella Syndrome (NPS), which clogs his kidneys, causes his bones to break with little stress, and brings on muscle cramps and chronic pain.  The federal government provides McMahon with the medicine he needs to ease the symptoms and live a relatively normal life.  Only six other patients get it, because the federal government frets about the medicine - it has no worrisome side effects on McMahon, but the government worries that others will use the medicine as a drug to get high.  McMahon is one of seven people in the United States who can legally smoke marijuana.  How this came about, the difficulties it has presented for him, and the problems of other patients who could use the drug if they could get it, are the subject of _Prescription Pot: A Leading Advocate's Heroic Battle to Legalize Medical Marijuana_ (New Horizon Press), which McMahon wrote with his friend Christopher Largen.  Read it and you might not think of marijuana in the way you do now.<br />Demerol and Percodan worked for the pain of NPS (codeine made him throw up) but they also put him into a brain-addled haze.  In the sixties he smoked pot; although his fellow tokers got intoxicated and giggly, he simply got... better.  The spasms eased, the pain was not so debilitating, and he could move around more.  But it worried him.  He didn't want to have a problem with drugs.  Looking back on it, he knows he should have been concerned by the prescription pills he was swallowing which made him a junkie.  He eventually found a doctor who jumped through all the paperwork hoops to enroll him into the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program.  Eventually, the doctor started receiving shipments of McMahon's medicine, ten joints a day.  It continues to be his regimen, and he continues to do well.<br />McMahon's story isn't proof that marijuana works as medicine; it is actually just one anecdotal case history, though it is told with appealing humor and modesty.  There are the stories of others told here, just as anecdotal (and some from those who have to get the pot illegally), but also just as affirming.  However, there have been a limited number of studies on the few patients who get the drug legally, and the data is not just anecdotal: glaucoma, chronic pain, anorexia, nausea, and spasms can all be helped by it.  That seems to make little difference to the government.  In 1992, the legal medical marijuana program was closed to new applicants by the first Bush administration.  The problem, as the White House saw it, was that there were too many new applicants because of the AIDS epidemic.  The real problem is that the government has trouble accepting that marijuana can be anything but bad.

It continues to be his regimen, and he continues to do well.<br />McMahon's story isn't proof that marijuana works as medicine; it is actually just one anecdotal case history, though it is told with appealing humor and modesty.  There are the stories of others told here, just as anecdotal (and some from those who have to get the pot illegally), but also just as affirming.  However, there have been a limited number of studies on the few patients who get the drug legally, and the data is not just anecdotal: glaucoma, chronic pain, anorexia, nausea, and spasms can all be helped by it.  That seems to make little difference to the government.  In 1992, the legal medical marijuana program was closed to new applicants by the first Bush administration.  The problem, as the White House saw it, was that there were too many new applicants because of the AIDS epidemic.  The real problem is that the government has trouble accepting that marijuana can be anything but bad.

To Katy Lederer, it was family.  In _Poker Face: A Girlhood among Gamblers_ (Crown) she has told of a very strange upbringing and the result.  Her memoir goes from New England, Manhattan, and Berkeley to (of course) Las Vegas, and is a fascinating tale of attempts to beat the odds.  It is sad and funny, but she has no axe to grind against herself or any of the family members whom she accepts with understanding and love.  Besides being a family memoir, her book also has a good deal of reporting on how gambling is done, and in some cases, done as a career.<br />Games were central to her growing up.  &quot;Our parents didn't much care whether we got good grades in school.  Winning at games was what mattered.&quot;  No one helped anyone during the competition.  When brother Howard disappeared, he was said to be homeless in New York, but actually, he had fallen in love: &quot;He fell in love with the game of poker - not just with the cards, but with the money and the banter and the drugs.&quot;  He rose from playing nickel stakes in filthy dives to becoming a professional.  He ran a sports betting operation, and hired their mother as a bookkeeper for a very lucrative operation.  He eventually took it all to Las Vegas, where he became a high stakes poker player.  He taught their sister, and then Lederer herself.  Howard's instructions were clear; what is really going on at the table has nothing to do with your cards, and everything to do with the cards of the opponents and what the opponents are thinking about them.  Lederer got to be competent enough at poker only to be winning a little overall.  &quot;My sister and brother were by this time world-class players, and I lived in great fear of becoming an appendage - their little sister who could write but who was not so great at cards.&quot;<br />She finally folded, going back to the writing career she had begun at Berkeley.  Writing is a lot like poker: cheerful and bright when all is going well, but universally glum if things are going badly.  No matter the changes of mood, though,  &quot;... the absolute worst thing imaginable is to never again be in action, to never again write a word.&quot;  She is certainly in the action in this exploration of love, competition, loss, and chance.  She has quite generously dealt us a full house.egun at Berkeley.  Writing is a lot like poker: cheerful and bright when all is going well, but universally glum if things are going badly.

Krakauer, whose reputation is that of an outdoor adventure writer, might seem an unusual choice to write about the spiritual bizarreness of Mormon Fundamentalism, but it turns out that this is another fascinating and well-written foray into human extremes.  It is not much of a step from _Into the Wild_ which had to do with a young man's deadly obsession to get into the Alaskan wilderness, or _Into Thin Air_ about the egomania of those climbing Everest.  Krakauer's latest book has already been condemned by the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), although the polygamous, incestuous, and murderous contemporary prophets herein described are from offshoot sects.  But the LDS has reason to take offense.  Krakauer does not just tell the story of recent crimes attributed to fundamentalists, but gives a history of the mainstream church and how its principles could have allowed such sociopathic cultism.<br />The central crime in the book is the horrific butchering of Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter in 1984.  Brenda was the wife of Allen, one of five Lafferty brothers who had left Mormonism to enter Mormon fundamentalism, and she spoke out against the change to polygamy.  Ron Lafferty got a revelation from God which commanded him to \\"remove\\" Brenda and her baby, and he and his brother Dan followed the command.  Krakauer shows it was Joseph Smith himself who inserted polygamy into the beliefs of his fledgling church, and he emphasized the importance of personal revelation for all church members.  People liked getting revelations directly from God, and if those revelations contradicted the official church revelations, how could anyone tell the difference?  Krakauer writes about other chilling examples of Mormon fundamentalism, like the abduction, \\"marriage,\\" and rape of fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, but he comes back in the end to the imprisoned Dan and Ron Lafferty, whom he interviewed.  Dan proved to be a particularly intriguing source.  He admits that he has wondered if the murder of Brenda Lafferty and her daughter was some sort of great mistake, but has decided no.  He cannot figure out exactly how his acts fit into the imminent return of Jesus, who will welcome him and the faithful to \\"clear the dance floor for our thousand-year party\\" after all the nonbelievers are removed.  But he is quite certain that he would do it all again: \\"I was guided by the hand of God.\\"<br />In his concluding remarks, Krakauer acknowledges the need to be open about his own religious persuasion, which is not emphasized through this fascinating book.  He grew up in Oregon and had many Mormon teachers and friends.  He is an agnostic, who finds himself praying \\"in times of great fear, or despair, or astonishment at a display of unexpected beauty.\\"  It seems to be more than self-justification when he writes, \\"... accepting the essential inscrutability of existence ... is surely preferable to its opposite: capitulating to the tyranny of intransigent belief.\\"  The tyranny of these particular beliefs, certainly.  Mormonism is growing to be a religion that will rank among the biggest, and the fundamentalists it has spawned are not diminishing.  We are all too familiar with what Muslim fundamentalists can do, and Christian ones like James Jones, and all the Mormon fundamentalists that are portrayed on these pages.  I, too, am writing as an agnostic, and maybe I would simply like to have more people leaning toward my view, but it would not be too bad if those murderous believers all had a good deal more doubt.ng examples of Mormon fundamentalism, like the abduction, \\"marriage,\\" and rape of fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, but he comes back in the end to the imprisoned Dan and Ron Lafferty, whom he interviewed.

Odysseus, in way, was one, as was William Tell, and John Wayne as the Ringo Kid.  Jesus's story certainly conforms to the myth of the \\"good outlaw,\\" and a more contemporary version was Martin Luther King.  The figure best known for being a hero and being an outlaw, however, has been with us for over six hundred years: Robin Hood.  Now he has an authoritative life story: _Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography_ (Cornell University Press) by Stephen Knight.  Knight, a professor of literature at Cardiff University, is an authority on all Robin Hood lore, but does not here restrict himself to the early ballads of Bold Robin.  In a witty and universal tour of the legend, he takes in all the Hollywood and television versions, and even the parodies.  Most of them stay quite close to the Robin Hood legend as it was formed in its early stages.<br />The question for any biographer of such a legend always is: \\"Did he really exist?\\"  There is an eagerness to find a real human being who performed Robin's feats, or at least served as a starting point for the stories.  But Knight doubts there was any real figure: \\"... it seems highly improbable, or at least unprovable, that a Mr. R. Hood ever existed.\\"  It is far more likely that the character in the ancient plays and poems \\"...is the original Robin Hood, real only in the sense that he is the focus of a real myth.\\"  The important thing is not the Robin Hood incarnate, but what tellers and audiences made of him.  For those who needed monetary relief, he began not only to rob from the rich but to give to the poor.  For those who were distressed over corruption, he especially robbed sleazy officials of the state and church.  For those needing national or racial identity, he became Saxon against the bad Norman Prince John.  In the twentieth century, he raised his bow against (metaphorically) Nazism and McCarthyism.<br />Robin Hood has been portrayed by Kermit the Frog (whose green made him a natural for the role).  In _Time Bandits_ he was John Cleese, stiffly introducing himself: \\"Hello, I'm Hood,\\" and going on to explain the nature of the poor he is bound to assist: \\"I'm sure you'll like them. Of course they haven't got two pennies to rub together but that's because they're poor.\\"  Robin's outfit received top billing in Mel Brooks's _Robin Hood: Men in Tights_; Knight explains the association of tights to the story thus: they were \\"originally deployed so that nineteenth-century actresses playing Robin could show their legs.\\"  The myth has proved powerful enough to survive much kidding, and not just recently; a 1600 play _Looke About You_, has the unique stage direction \\"Enter Robin Hood in the Lady Faukenbridge's gowne, night attire on his head.\\"  Knight, in a remarkable and witty study of the formation and re-creation of a legend, shows that in times of oppression, Robin Hood has always been there for us as resistance to authority.

The next on the list is _The History of the Peloponnesian War_ by Thucydides, which is completely different.  His classic history of the war between Sparta and Athens has been an object of respect and close study ever since it was written, but is tough reading.  Translators agree that Thucydides's style is difficult and subject to varying interpretations, and the different battles and overall strategies of the war can get lost.  If you plow through Thucydides, you don't even get to find out how it all turns out; his account ends almost seven years before the war did.  If this is daunting, help is at hand.  A new volume titled _The Peloponnesian War_ (Viking) has been written by Donald Kagan.  He has previously written a four volume history of the war for scholars, but has here distilled the narrative into one (admittedly large) volume.  His goal was &quot;... a readable narrative... to be read by the general reader for pleasure and to gain the wisdom that so many have sought in studying this war.&quot;  He has certainly succeeded.  The complexities of the conflict all across the Mediterranean make clear that this was a true &quot;world war,&quot; but Kagan has made it as clear for non-specialists as we have any right to expect.<br />Of course one expects detailed descriptions of the basis of the conflict, the nature of battles, and the personalities of the leaders involved, and these expectations are certainly met, throughout all the arenas of the war.  Kagan has deliberately not drawn parallels between this, the first well-documented war effort, and all the others that came after it.  Nonetheless, the reader will find much that is familiar, with the either comforting or dismaying realization that things do not change much, even over millennia.  Here one will read about mutual nonaggression pacts and how they tangle nations into war.  The Olympics are shown to be tools of nationalism (or, at this time, city state-ism).  Candidates for office put on religiosity and spectacles; one by Alcibiades's opponent Nicias was an opulent parade for the sake of Apollo.  Kagan writes that most Athenians &quot;...believed that the gods must favor so pious a man and smile on the city he led.&quot;  Here also are worries about the military-industrial complex; a contemporary writer said on one occasion that Athenians had rejected a truce because of deceptions by &quot;practiced warmongers who made private profit from public troubles.&quot;<br />The maps in this volume deserve special mention.  They are numerous and clear, and generally are within the text near where the geography needs description.  Kagan finishes with an essay about sources.  Thucydides is, of course, cited many times, but Kagan does not entirely accept his much-praised impartiality.  Among the other sources are Xenophon, an Athenian general who was a disciple of Socrates.  The comedies of Aristophanes are frequently cited, for the light they show on certain warriors and politicians, as well as the time's free-ranging nature of satire and public ridicule.  It is a pleasant surprise to find that Kagan has found special value in Plutarch; although he lived five centuries after the war and was a biographer rather than a historian, Kagan thinks that Plutarch's own citations of previous historians show admirable scholarship.  Kagan's own history of the war falls squarely in that tradition.s into war.  The Olympics are shown to be tools of nationalism (or, at this time, city state-ism).

Religious people have a special fondness for those who were doubters and scofflaws and have come to see the light.  Because more people belong to religions, it seems sometimes as if there are more conversions to belief; perhaps it is that the converts have a forum from which to boast of the change, too.  But there are changes in the other direction, also, which perhaps are less noticed because a change to a minority is better left as a quiet change and not trumpeted to others.  It is not Dan Barker's way to keep quiet.  Barker was a top-rank fundamentalist minister, in demand for his ability to get converts and renew faith.  After years of success, he starting doubting and reconsidering.  He went over to the other side, finding that atheism was more to his satisfaction.  He wrote _Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist_ (FFRF, Inc.) to explain his position ten years ago, and has continued to speak out for atheism and to debate believers since then.<br />Barker was called to the ministry when he was fifteen years old.  He went to Bible college, was a missionary, and a touring musical evangelist.  He wrote Christian musicals, still performed.  His credentials as a soul-winning preacher cannot be doubted.  It was when he had turned thirty that some questions started coming.  There was no revelation, no incident causing revulsion from the church.  There was first a tiny step away from literalism.  Barker began to allow himself to have dealings with even liberal Christians.  He eventually realized: &quot;There is no basis for believing that a God exists, except faith, and faith was not satisfactory to me.&quot;  He sent a letter to all he knew, to say that he was no longer a Christian.  The responses were &quot;everything from friendly curiosity to outright hatred.&quot;  Many insisted he must be hurt and bitter.  His marriage came apart, and he lost many friends, but realized that friendships that can endure only if religions are identical are not very sound friendships after all.  He is a social and basically happy person, who did not have trouble finding friends in his new world.  His parents both tried to talk him out of it, but came around to his side, instead.<br /> _Losing Faith in Faith_ is not a unified autobiography, but a series of chapters of reminiscences and essays about an atheist's beliefs.  It is cheerful and written with a good deal of humor; if you want profound or florid rhetoric on the same subject, Robert Ingersoll is your man, but Barker is quite able to tell a lively illustrative story or poke fun at the way he used to believe.  There are essays here on the historicity of Jesus, the nature of the Bible as a moral guide, the possibility of ethical behavior without belief in the supernatural, and various biblical contradictions.  Those who have no faith in gods will find an inspiring story and many reasons to cherish their current unbelief.  The believers who are bold enough to pick up this volume will, if they are open-minded enough, find a great deal of entertainment, and will enjoy attempting to counter some persuasive arguments from the other side.nly if religions are identical are not very sound friendships after all.

His exploit should not be ranked, perhaps, with those of Lewis and Clark, or Scott, or Livingstone, but nonetheless, this year we should be celebrating the centennial of his epochal achievement.  In 1903, Jackson took the first automobile trip across the United States.  The commemoration will include a Public Broadcasting documentary on the trip by Ken Burns, who was persuaded to make the film by his friend Dayton Duncan.  The two of them have produced a book to go along with the film, _Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip_ (Knopf), and it is a good-looking and entertaining volume.  A hundred years later, anyone can take a car and perform Horatio's Drive in a few days, but in 1903, there were about 150 miles of paved roads in the entire nation, and most of those did not link one town to another.  Jackson was a real pioneer.<br />Jackson was a thirty-one-year-old doctor from Burlington, Vermont, and an automobile enthusiast.  On 19 May 1903, he was with a bunch of well-to-do men at the University Club in San Francisco.  A wager was made; fifty bucks said that no one could drive from San Francisco to New York in less than three months.  Jackson accepted immediately; he was on the road four days later.  He hired a mechanic, and acquired a mascot, a bulldog named Bud who got his own automobilist goggles.  His owner said that Bud was \\"...the one member of [our] trio who used no profanity on the entire trip.\\"  Jackson bought a used Winton for $3,000.  It had a two-cylinder, 20 horsepower engine, a chain drive, and top speed of thirty miles an hour.  It had no windshield and no roof.  Jackson named it the _Vermont_.  They bounced along the road, losing important items sometimes, and often they were mired in thick mud.  The solution was generally to get a farmer to hitch his horse to the _Vermont_, and then pay the farmer by giving him a ride in the car.  Stagecoaches had to bring spare parts.  Blacksmiths had to weld parts together.  Whenever the car came into a rural town, it caused a sensation.  People liked to have their pictures taken as they sat at _Vermont_'s right-sided wheel.  It took 63 days, but Jackson made it to New York, and was a sensation.<br />Jackson went on to become the owner of Burlington's first radio station and a bank president.  He got ex-president Teddy Roosevelt to get him into the Army for World War One, even though he was too old to enlist.  But he loved telling his story about his great drive as the proudest of his accomplishments.  In 1944, he donated the _Vermont_ to the Smithsonian, where it will be forever on display, gleaming without a speck of the dust and mud that it picked up in its historic 6,000 mile journey.  Bud's goggles were donated, too.  For better or worse, we can drive all over our nation now, with little of the trouble Jackson went through, and with little of the adventure or need for his sort of pluck.  _Horatio's Drive_ in pictures and words brings back a time when automobiles were novelties enthusiastically boosted by eccentrics, and a forgotten little epic of American adventure.parts together.

It represented the climax of global exploration; never again would the world concentrate so on the efforts of men tramping through the unknown.  The story of the search for the source of the Nile has been told many times.  The current retelling, _Into Africa: The Epic Adventures of Stanley &amp; Livingstone_ (Doubleday) by Martin Dugard, tells the story of two vastly different explorers and the unimaginable hardships they went through on their travels through what was known as &quot;the dark continent.&quot;  Dugard weaves the stories of the explorers, and those who went before them, their backers, the nationalistic goals of the time, and of course the dangers of the trail, to recount the tale in full.  It is still a grandly exciting story.<br />David Livingstone originally went to Africa as a 27-year-old missionary; Dugard points out that this was before missionary work became tainted with imperialism.  He was going to save souls, but he got bored, and he was disgusted by the boredom of his converts during public worship.  He requested permission to &quot;go forward into the dark interior,&quot; and when it was granted, he looked forward to the prospect with &quot;inexpressible delight.&quot;  In 1886, he set out to find the source of the Nile.  He entered the continent, and was lost to the outside world for five years.  Speculation about his condition, and rumors about his death, were widespread.  The _New York Herald_, sensing a scoop, sent roving reporter Henry Stanley to find him.  The treks of both Stanley and Livingstone as jointly recounted here are full of distressing accounts of malaria, dysentery, hookworms, and maggots eating living flesh.  Then there are starvation, dehydration, floods, tribal wars, thorns, ants, crocodiles, and much more.  Livingstone, evidencing the sort of humorous understatement that must have supported him well, wrote in his journal, &quot;It is not all pleasure, this exploration.&quot;  After being found, Livingstone did not return to England with his new friend, but died two years later still searching for the authentic source of the Nile.  His heart was buried in Africa, and the rest of him in Westminster Abbey.  Stanley was a pallbearer.<br />There is plenty of history here, and exciting, often gruesome, adventure, told in a spellbinding prose.  We will have no exploration on this sort of epic scale again.  There is certainly nothing wrong with exploring strands of DNA or hunting for undersea treasure, but such efforts will always be largely technological.  The baldly heroic exploits described here may be of another age, and may come to us now with distasteful colonial and racial baggage, but Stanley and Livingstone could hardly help that.  The world was in a frenzy to read news of the famous explorer and his rescuer, and re-living events by means of _Into Africa_ will let readers experience the same thrills.the sort of humorous understatement that must have supported him well, wrote in his journal, &quot;It is not all pleasure, this exploration.&quot;  After being found, Livingstone did not return to England with his new friend, but died two years later still searching for the authentic source of the Nile.

The baldly heroic exploits described here may be of another age, and may come to us now with distasteful colonial and racial baggage, but Stanley and Livingstone could hardly help that.  The world was in a frenzy to read news of the famous explorer and his rescuer, and re-living events by means of _Into Africa_ will let readers experience the same thrills.	2003-08-20

And you can be thankful that you have no place like the homes Jake Halpern has visited.  He somehow became the &quot;Bad Homes Correspondent&quot; at the _New Republic_.  He kept writing stories about towns being eaten by sinkholes, homes built over burning coal mines, homes where &quot;Welcome Home&quot; would have had a touch of sarcasm to it.  In _Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales_ (Houghton Mifflin), the intrepid Halpern goes to live in five unpromising homes.  He is in quest of the answer to why people would voluntarily take and keep homes in hellish or threatening areas.  He does not find profound answers; they like their homes because these are their homes.  He does, however, introduce us to some funny and strange characters, and shows us how they make themselves improbably at home.<br />Princeville, North Carolina is a town inundated by Hurricane Floyd, but Thad Knight came back to his ruined home, and other citizens returned.  Whittier, Alaska, is a peculiar town that consists essentially of one 14-story high rise, and about 200 people live there.  They stay inside a lot of the time, because the temperatures are frigid and the winds are killers.  To get to it, you have to drive through a tunnel over two miles long.  Millie Decker is 82 years old, a former rodeo rider, and has an address that would be coveted by Hollywood hopefuls, in Malibu.  She has not abandoned it for any of the infamous fires that regularly come her way, fighting each one by wet gunnysacks.  Ambrose Besson is a Storm Rider on Grand Isle, Louisiana.  Others take the bridge to the mainland, but he stays home and cooks with his fellow storm riders.  Jack Thompson will book you a spell in his bed and breakfast in Hawaii.  Of course, you have to trek across a live lava field to get to Jack's; &quot;... there is always the possibility of taking a bad step and falling downward into an active lava tube.&quot;  The lava is all around and may well take Jack's house someday.<br />There isn't much they can really do by staying.  It does not make much sense, to others, but of course it doesn't have to.  In the epilogue of the book, Halpern goes back to these strange friends he has made, and tells them about each other, and finds that they easily sympathize with their fellows in the book.  Jack, for instance, upon being told about Thad Knight, says, &quot;It just sounds like another person who really likes his home and is willing to put up with whatever might come along with it.&quot;  Most people are interested in conventionally making home life bigger and easier and inevitably more expensive and complicated.  Read this amusing book about these mild kooks and realize that not all of them live in dangerous homes.quot;  The lava is all around and may well take Jack's house someday.  <br />There isn't much they can really do by staying.

Without it, we cannot work, travel, or communicate, or at least we cannot do these things with the efficiency we have come to expect when we have easily available current.  With electricity so demonstrably vital, it is a good time to learn just how we got it.  _Fleet Fire: Thomas Edison and the Pioneers of the Electric Revolution_ (Arcade) by L. J. Davis is not just Edison's story, but the story of electricity going back to the Greeks.  It is a story filled with odd characters; given the peculiarities of so many of them, it might be thought improbable that delivered electricity could have ever become so universal.<br />America was involved in electrical experimentation from the beginning of scientific evaluation of such things.  Ben Franklin, of course, is forever associated with the start of electrical investigations, and to him we owe such terms as battery, discharge, and condenser.  Investigating electricity, however, proved to be a great disappointment for the practical Franklin; he may have invented the lightning rod, but he could not make electricity do anything practical.  The great step toward practicality was made in 1796 when Alessandro Volta stacked zinc and lead and made a powerful and useful battery; experimenters no longer had to rely on iffy static charges in a Leyden jar.  For almost eighty years, most of the world's electrical power came from batteries.  This was despite the invention of the dynamo generator by Faraday in the 1830s.  It was not until 1873 in an exhibit in Vienna that dynamos were wrongly connected and someone noticed that one dynamo could turn another dynamo into an electric motor.  A few years later, Thomas Edison sensed the opportunity of sending electricity into homes to do motor work.  He also worked hard on the light bulb, but Davis makes the case that \\"The light bulb destroyed Menlo Park and it wrecked Edison as a major inventor.\\"  The problem was direct current, and much of the book involves the vituperative competition between Edison for direct current, and Westinghouse and the extremely weird Tesla for alternating current.<br />Davis gives many examples of inventors who because of petty jealousies or greed did not get credit for their work; if you have never heard of Reginald Aubrey Fessenden, you have heard his radio, the one that sends voices rather than the mere impulses Marconi managed.  There were so many wrong turns taken by brilliant men on the way to find good ways to make and use electricity that Davis's tale is an exciting (I will not say shocking) account of human foibles.  It is good to be reminded, once again, that scientific knowledge cannot be gained in an orderly or planned fashion, but is accumulated catch-as-catch-can, the way humans perform even the most serious endeavors.major inventor.\\"  The problem was direct current, and much of the book involves the vituperative competition between Edison for direct current, and Westinghouse and the extremely weird Tesla for alternating current.  <br />Davis gives many examples of inventors who because of petty jealousies or greed did not get credit for their work; if you have never heard of Reginald Aubrey Fessenden, you have heard his radio, the one that sends voices rather than the mere impulses Marconi managed.

If you have ever read his wonderful memoir _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_, you know plenty about the humorous side of the serious physicist, the man who originated quantum electrodynamics as well as plenty of other accomplishments within his field, to say nothing of playing the bongos.  Now there is an unusual memoir, a tribute from a young physicist who came within Feynman's orbit at Caltech in the early 1980s.  _Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life_ (Warner Books) by Leonard Mlodinow gives us another snapshot of Feynman, which would always be welcome, but this one is special.  Mlodinow was starting up to be an academic physicist, and got to get advice from Feynman on the task, as well as on what is important in life.  Mlodinow presciently taped many of the sessions, and got around to transcribing them only recently.  Feynman has lots to teach us still, even if we aren't physicists.<br />Part of the attraction of this little volume is that while it is about Feynman, it is also about Mlodinow's discomfort as a whiz kid brought in to work at Caltech. He was glad to get the appointment, but also intimidated.  &quot;These people at Caltech might actually expect something of me.&quot;  He didn't know how to start, and floundered for months, until he decided to talk with Feynman, just down the hall, about what he thought about string theory.  &quot;Look,&quot; Feynman said dismissively, &quot;If you really believed in string theory, you wouldn't come here asking me. You'd come here _telling_ me.&quot;  The lesson was, find something you believe in and go to work.  In Feynman's view, it wouldn't do to work on just anything.  If you weren't working on something beautiful, and something you believed in, then the work wouldn't be fun.  And fun was essential: &quot;For me, physics is more fun than anything else or I couldn't be doing it.&quot;  Feynman isn't the only curious character in this memoir.  Next door to Mlodinow's office is another Nobel winner, Murray Gell-Mann who had brought the unifying theory of quarks to subatomic particles.  John Schwarz, working alone for many years, finally brings out string theory.  Stephen Wolfram appears, before &quot;Mathematica&quot; and his own rewrite of science, to eat a pound of rare roast beef.  There is also a good deal of science in the book, a brief summary of where physics stood at the end of the millennium.<br />Mlodinow had a hobby of writing during the time, writing screenplays, which some of his fellow physicists must have thought beneath him.  Feynman didn't influence him directly to go into writing, but at least partially because of Feynman's teaching about going after the work that is fun, he wound up writing rather than doing physics.  He left Caltech to write an acclaimed history of geometry, and even scripts for _Star Trek_.  It is obvious he absorbed the lessons he has generously shared with us in this amusing book, for he left Caltech hoping that he could do something Feynman would admire.  &quot;And then I thought, no, even better, I hope that someday I will write something that I would admire.&quot;  Very nice work, Mr. Feynman.uldn't be doing it.&quot;  Feynman isn't the only curious character in this memoir.

Most historians had neglected or scorned the little-known plot.  Eventually Parssinen was lucky enough to find the papers of Harold Deutsch, a historian who had interviewed participants in the plot and their family members, but had died before writing up his results.  Parssinen took over, and has produced _The Oster Conspiracy of 1938: The Unknown Story of the Military Plot to Kill Hitler and Avert World War II_ (HarperCollins).  It was a failed conspiracy, just as was the much more famous bomb that failed to kill Hitler in 1944 (there were other failed plots as well), but it is worth examining as a check against the picture of Hitler as universally popular among Germans at the time, and as a point of reflection.  How might the world be different now if Hitler had been killed before starting hostilities?  After all, Parssinen writes that the evidence \\"... shows that the 1938 conspiracy was well planned and had reasonably good prospects for success.\\"<br />Parssinen has built up the drama concerning the conspiracy by a meticulous, sometimes hour-by-hour, reconstruction of events in London and Berlin.  Except for the ending of the plot, the tension is considerable even though we know the outcome.  The chief conspirator, Lieutenant Colonel Hans Oster, was second-in-command at Abwehr, the intelligence division for the German military.  He was shocked by the imprisonment of religious figures and political dissidents, and by the first concentration camps.  It was not until the \\"Czech Crisis\\" of 1938, however, that significantly more officials began to agree with him.  The generals knew that Russia and France were pledged to defend Czechoslovakia, and that if Germany tried to take it, the British would probably come in as well.  They despaired that they would be deployed in a war they could not win.  The conspirators knew that they could only rely on popular support if Hitler were about to start a war for which the German people had no enthusiasm, and they tried to have their contacts in England keep up the pressure so that no appeasement happened.  Eventually Chamberlain accepted Hitler's pledge that no further European territories would be demanded; in the words of a conspirator at the Department of the Interior, \\"Chamberlain has saved Hitler.\\"  The conspirators could not act.  They made several later assassination attempts, foiled by bad luck.  In 1943 the Gestapo discovered Oster's scheme to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland; he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.  In 1945, a few days before the American troops liberated his camp, Oster was hanged.<br />_The Oster Conspiracy of 1938_ is a detailed examination of a particular period and chain of events that led up to the war.  It is exciting at times, and of course sad.  Parssinen indulges in some speculation about what might have happened.  The conspirators were interested in setting up a government based on Britain's; it might have been conservative, but it would have been broadly representative of German popular opinion.  No war, no Holocaust, no Cold War are among the contingencies that might have occurred (although of course some other horrors would have erupted).  But above all, fifty million people died in the war, and they would not have.  \\"It might have been\\" has never been sadder.akia, and that if Germany tried to take it, the British would probably come in as well.

You may have even noticed that if you are walking with a friend, you tend to walk in step, even if you are not consciously trying to do so.  We like linking rhythms, and in doing so we are simply participating in a seemingly universal drive: &quot;The tendency to synchronize is one of the most pervasive drives in the universe, extending from atoms to animals, from people to planets.&quot;  So writes Steven Strogatz, in _Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order_ (Theia / Hyperion).  Strogatz is here reporting on a mathematical field in which he is one of the key researchers.  There are no equations in the book, and he even invites readers to skip the pages with the most involved explanations.  This overview of the field, however, is invaluable.  Spontaneous order can be used to explain phenomena as diverse as crickets chirping in unison, fireflies flashing in orchestrated beacon-like displays, the beating of the heart, the united photons of a laser, the constancy of the moon facing us, and the frictionless work of superconductors.  It isn't all benevolent; neurons in an epileptic fit are nicely synchronized, too.<br /><br />Strogatz understands that it is hard to get an intuitive grasp of such ideas.  &quot;We're accustomed to thinking in terms of centralized control, the straightforward logic of cause and effect.&quot;  That isn't the way things work in the many examples cited here.  Spontaneous order affects huge systems, interconnected so that each player affects every other player, millions of interactions occurring simultaneously.  We carry around in us countless synchronizing oscillators, and Strogatz makes an analogy of the organs in a body being like musicians in an orchestra in producing a unified output.  The most famous and well defined cyclic clock in the body is the sinoatrial node, a patch of 10,000 cardiac cells which sends out the electrical pulse synchronizing the cells of the heart to contract together.  A mathematical biologist made a model of the network in 1975, and Strogatz himself put the model into a computer.  The voltages of the linked cells could all be set to random, and the initial timings could all be off sequence, but quickly a beat developed.  &quot;It was spooky.  The system was synchronizing itself.&quot;  But Strogatz cautions against attempts to see patterns when they are not there; the faddish &quot;biorhythm&quot; analyzers never had any scientific verification, and only the shoddy studies have purported to show that crimes and psychiatric admissions follow the phases of the moon.<br /><br />Strogatz has done a fine job with cheerful writing and apt and sometimes jovially contrived analogies to make his field intelligible to the general reader.  An extra attraction is that he shows how scientists within the field have interacted to make the inchoate ideas intelligible.  He is quite enthusiastic about the joy of scientific discovery, a personal story he tells to which any reader will respond.  For those who have been interested in chaos and complexity, here is a description of a new view of the patterns nature follows at all levels around us.nds out the electrical pulse synchronizing the cells of the heart to contract together.

Almost all of its books and ephemera were burned.  Burning a library seems a particularly vicious and sad thing to do, but it would not have surprised Matthew Battles.  He works at the rare books section at Harvard's library, and he has written _Library: An Unquiet History_ (W. W. Norton), a tour of libraries through history, and what becomes of them.  Those of us who frequently use our local libraries and even take them for granted may reflect with pleasure on the anomalous (and deceptive) permanence of our particular library.  Battles writes, \\"There is no library that does not ultimately disappear.\\"  Some of them are done in by natural causes, and plenty more are deliberately destroyed to make a social or revisionary point.<br />There is more to libraries than their destructions, of course, and more to Battles's book.  It is full of well-written and surprising paragraphs, brimming with erudition, and part of its attractiveness is that he has not stuck to any structural plan.  This is not an attempt at a comprehensive history of libraries, but it does take into account a lot of history.  \\"By bringing books together in one place, cultures and kings inevitably make of them a sacrifice to time.\\"  Though the destructions of libraries by Shi Huangdi (who started the Great Wall of China), through the Nazis and into Sarajevo are necessary subjects here, the grimness is lightened by portraits of eminent librarians.  For instance, cataloging by means of the famous Dewey Decimal System was invented by Melville Dewey, born in 1851; he was a spelling reformer and changed his name to Melvil.  The seventeen-year-old Dewey inhaled a great deal of smoke as he rescued books from the flames when his school caught fire, and the subsequent cough led doctors to predict his death within two years.  This taught him he had no time to lose, and though he lived to be eighty, he was always a genius for efficiency.  He did not invent the card catalogue; it is a surprise to find that Edward Gibbon did so, putting his library's inventory onto playing cards.  But Dewey standardized the catalog, as he did much other library furniture and gadgets such as date stamps.  He also pioneered the systematic education of librarians and helped found the American Library Association.<br />Battles traces the constant conflict about what libraries should contain; some say they must include everything, others say they should include only the best of everything.  The arguments on the issue have been spirited, especially when joined by Jonathan Swift, frequently cited here, who insisted not only on the best contents for libraries, but concentration on just the classics.  He would have been dismayed by our popularization of libraries.  Surely, however, he would have found the modern library a wonderful place to pick out the odd fact, or to wonder at the oddities (lovable or not) of humanity; readers will find _Library_ quite good for this, too., he was always a genius for efficiency.

It is a good rule of thumb, but like most rules of thumb, it requires intelligent neglect or violation, and working geologists do so to form an accurate picture of Earth history.  There has sometimes been resistance to violation of the rule; the wipeout of the dinosaurs by an asteroid hit 65 million years ago is now generally accepted, but was not when it was proposed.  But even without extraordinary outside forces, our globe used to be a very different place.  Between 750 and 590 million years ago, there were sudden lurches in climate that froze even lands at the equator.  Or so goes the Snowball Earth Theory.  _Snowball Earth: The Story of the Great Global Catastrophe that Spawned Life as We Know It_ (Crown Publishers) by Gabrielle Walker describes the theory and its importance, but the current importance may not be merely its scientific significance.  What makes the theory particularly interesting right now is that it is being championed by a colorful Harvard geologist who is attempting to make it accepted geological thought.  Walker's surprisingly exciting book is thus not just a summary of ancient geology, but also an entertaining examination of personalities involved.<br />The snowball Earth theory is not entirely new, but the book is largely the story of Paul Hoffman, a brilliant, driven geologist who was eager to make some sort of difference in his field.  Argumentative, energetic, and brilliant, he has a strong reputation as a geologist and as a difficult character.  Disputes by him are not objective quibbles published in obscure journals, but stand-up, screaming fights.  Partially because Hoffman has taken up a sort of gladiatorial grandstanding for the theory (he has made his own contributions and confirmations), there are equally adamant anti-snowballers.  The combative nature of science is on display here; Walker writes, &quot;Science works at its best when somebody puts forward a theory and everyone else tries to pull it down.&quot;  She is good at describing the pains of field work (something at which Hoffman is adept), but academic battles are the emphasis in her book.  Of course Hoffman hopes his ideas share the same fate as those of Alfred Wegener, whose ideas about Plate Tectonics were originally ridiculed; so far, they have survived the challenges about which Walker reports.<br />Particularly valuable in the theory is the light it might throw on the bloom of life into complex multicellular creatures.  Of course a deep freeze would have been disastrous for all the simple slimes that were found all over the Earth when the freeze came.  There might have escaped, however, pockets of cells that, according to the theory, were the precursors for the famous Cambrian explosion in the trilobite times.  Perhaps the snowball produced the complexity, although this is far from clear.  It is one of the many details that is going to have to be argued over.  Walker winds up with a description of the Earth's future; if we are still around in a few hundred million years, we might well have to deal with a return of the snowball.  It is too hard to think about time lengths of such spans, but geologists routinely do so, although the spans are back in the past.  Walker's book is a good introduction to serious thought about such times, and to the very human way such science is done.ve nature of science is on display here; Walker writes, &quot;Science works at its best when somebody puts forward a theory and everyone else tries to pull it down.&quot;  She is good at describing the pains of field work (something at which Hoffman is adept), but academic battles are the emphasis in her book.

But in 1984, horrific charges were lodged against the school and incredible descriptions of abuse were spread.

As documented in _No Crueler Tyrannies: Accusation, False Witness, and Other Terrors of Our Times_ (Wall Street Journal Books) by Dorothy Rabinowitz, the three were not only innocent of the offenses; the offenses never even occurred, except in the minds of prosecutors, of so-called experts on child abuse, and of coached children.  While this is material that will be familiar to those who have read about bogus satanic scares and incidents such as the more famous McMartin preschool case, Rabinowitz offers  impassioned but reasonable histories of the Amirault case and others that raise serious questions about the functioning of our legal system.<br />The Amiraults' troubles seem to have begun when Gerald changed a boy's underpants.  After that, the mother started worrying about the boy's bedwetting and other problems; bedwetting, according to a rash of media stories at the time, was a symptom of child abuse.  Gerald was arrested, the school was closed, and charges grew.  Other children began to report that they had been forced to drink urine and had been raped with knives and sticks, assaulted by a man in a clown suit, and tied naked to a schoolyard tree in front of the teachers and students.  These atrocities had supposedly been happening for the past two years with no previous complaints, and no parents dropping in at the school had noticed anything out of the ordinary.  There was never any physical evidence; how the children might have been probed with knives without physical result was never explained.  The similar accusations within schools which had turned out to be fraudulent never made investigators or prosecutors doubt the rightness of their crusades.  The officials involved never had to bear any penalty for ruining the lives of the falsely accused.<br />In many of the stories, reason eventually triumphed, and the miscarriages were rectified, although sometimes after long stretches in prison.  Rabinowitz first reported on the Amiraults in the _Wall Street Journal_ in 1995, and readers who could easily see how stupidly the courts were carrying on donated thousands of dollars for their legal fees.  One reader paid for the college tuition of Gerald's daughters.  Gerald himself could not have paid.  With eventual general public and legal agreement that he had been profoundly mistreated by the courts, his case became a political football.  The usually unforgiving Governor's Board of Pardons ruled unanimously in 2001 that his sentence should be commuted.  His mother and sister had previously been cleared of the identical charges.  The Governor of Massachusetts at the time knew what a liability being \\"soft on crime\\" and allowing a child abuser to go free would be for future political support, and inexplicably connected the case to that of a real child abuser who had been easily convicted because of videotapes and other physical evidence leading to a confession.  Gerald Amirault remains in prison.  Rabinowitz's title for this clear and troubling book comes from a quotation from the Baron de Montesquieu, who in 1742 wrote, \\"There is no crueler tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and in the name of justice.\\"  We are not yet free of these tyrannies.f the ordinary.

The composite numbers, like 15, are formed by multiplying other numbers together, like 3 and 5.  The prime numbers are the ones like 17 that cannot be formed by multiplying, except by themselves and 1.  Those prime numbers have held a particular fascination for mathematicians; they are the atoms from which the composites are made, but they have basic characteristics that no one yet has fully fathomed.  We know a lot about prime numbers, because mathematicians have puzzled over them for centuries.  We know that as you count higher and higher, the number of primes thin out, but Euclid had a beautiful proof that there is no largest prime. However, the primes seem to show up irregularly, without pattern.  Can we tell how many primes are present below 1,000,000 for instance, without counting every one?  How about even higher limits?  Speculating about the flow of primes led eventually to the Riemann Hypothesis, the subject of _The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics_ (HarperCollins) by mathematician Marcus du Sautoy.  The counting numbers turn out to be astonishingly complicated, and Du Sautoy knows that egghead number theorists will understand these complications better than we nonmathematicians, but he invites us to consider at a layman's level the importance of the particular quest of proving the Riemann Hypothesis.  He is convincing in his demonstration that it is worth knowing what all the effort is about.<br />Bernhard Riemann, a mathematician at the University of Gottingen, introduced a &quot;zeta function,&quot; and proposed that when this particular function equals zero, all the zeros will wind up on a specific line when graphed on the complex plane.  Further effort has shown that there are millions of zero points on that line, just as the hypothesis says, and no zero points have been found off the line.  Neither of these facts makes a proof, however.  Du Sautoy wisely shows some of the enormously complex technicalities of the speculations and computations, but makes no attempts to try to get the reader to comprehend the hypothesis at the level he does.  There are a number of reasons that the proof is so important.  Right now there are a large number of tentative proofs of important mathematical ideas; they are all based on the Riemann Hypothesis being true, but of course, it has not itself been proved.  A proof would tell us more about the prime distribution and finding primes, and this subject has become vital since cryptography, including how you privately send your credit card number across the internet, is based on prime numbers and the difficulty of factoring two big primes multiplied together.  The way the Riemann zeros are distributed seems to mirror the patterns quantum physicists find among the energy levels of the nuclei of heavy atoms; in proving Riemann, we may have a closer understanding of fundamental reality.<br />With the Riemann Hypothesis central to a lot of mathematical effort, Du Sautoy is able to bring in a lot of side issues, such as Turing's attempt to find a program that would attack the proof, the four color map theorem and computer proofs in general, G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem, and much more.  The mathematics, such as it is, is leavened by portraits of mathematicians, who range from conventional to very peculiar.  A good deal is said about the dashing Italian mathematician Enrico Bombieri who rocked the mathematical world with the announcement that the Riemann Hypothesis had finally been proved.  There was jubilation over the announcement until mathematicians realized that the e-mail bore the date 1 April.  He could not have picked a better theme for anApril Fool's joke; all the mathematicians were eager to see this one proof finally nailed down.  Readers who take du Sautoy's entertaining tour can get an idea of why all the effort is being expended on the proof, and what elation there will be if it is ever found.il Fool's joke; all the mathematicians were eager to see this one proof finally nailed down.

He wasn't around to see a particularly interesting manifestation of the cave art in London starting in 1984.  At that time, because of a loophole in the law, London prostitutes started advertising in phone boxes.  The practice became so prominent that now a book reproducing hundreds of the cards, along with a brief documentation of the history and sociology of the practice, has been produced: _Tart Cards: London's Illicit Advertising Art_ (Mark Batty Publisher), by Caroline Archer, is a surprising and good-looking examination of the legal, social, commercial, and advertising issues involved in the cards, as well as an amusing collection of cards offering many different sexual practices.  If you can't spend time in a London phone box, this book will take you there.<br />Advertising in phone boxes, which belonged to the Post Office and thus the government, was illegal until 1984, when British Telecom was privatized.  Enterprising prostitutes saw the loophole and moved their cards from news agents to phone boxes; after all, each card sported a telephone number, and it made sense to advertise where potential clients could use it immediately.  Sometimes the women place their own cards, but they more often subcontract this work to \\"carders,\\" often students or unemployed.  Placing 600 cards a day might get a carder 200 pounds; thus mere card distribution is a trade of millions of pounds per year.  Catherine Archer has her doctorate in typography, and is especially interested in the typefaces of the cards.  A historic typeface from the nineteenth century tends to be used for cards offering mock schoolgirl services or flagellation.  Massage services often have whimsical and feminine scripts.  Domination cards can have \\"stern words set in Gothic letters.\\"<br />Archer is not the only person enthusiastic about the cards in their own right.  Cards are traded, like Pokemon cards, and sometimes children do the trading.  Some collectors are quite serious in appreciation of the cards' artistic merit or social significance.  There have even been parodies of cards, used to promote tours of musical acts or to protest aspects of the use of public spaces.  Archer has produced a very interesting examination of the phenomenon, but the best parts of the book are the pages and pages of reproductions of cards, all in full color and unexpurgated.  \\"Have you been a naughty boy?\\" enquires a professorial-looking woman with a cane.  \\"If you're feeling rather randy, always keep this number handy!\\" exults one, or \\"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but whips and chains excite me.\\"  There are even variants for Christmas: \\"Have a Cruel Yule.\\"  This is an amusing and handsome book, on an esoteric subject which the author has made interesting and pertinent.

Then when the death comes, the story is ready to go.  This is not something that book publishers have done.  Such a rush to print, with all the preparation a book takes, would be considered disrespectful if not ghoulish.  It is easy to acquit A. Scott Berg of unseemly rashness in the case of the memoir _Kate Remembered_ (Putnam), although its subject, Katharine Hepburn, died 29 June and the book was ready to buy on 11 July.  There are essential items in his defense.  Berg had the book virtually completed for the past two years and only needed to put an ending to it.  He had visited with Hepburn many times since he first met her in 1983, she knew he was compiling the book, and she agreed it should be released as soon as possible after her death.  And finally, it is clear from the book that Berg and Hepburn had a loving friendship during her final years.  Berg's intelligent and entertaining look at his friend and his examination of his friendship with her is courteous and sensitive.  Berg has written highly regarded biographies of Max Perkins, Samuel Goldwyn, and Charles A. Lindbergh, but he admits this is no biography, because he cannot write about her objectively: &quot;I walked into her life adoring her; and over the next twenty years, my admiration for her only swelled.&quot;  Movie fans who felt similar affection toward Hepburn will love this memoir.<br />During her professional life, Hepburn had not had the reclusiveness of Garbo (the actress she most admired), but she had not played the publicity game as stars often did, and was happy to have someone to talk to when Berg set out to interview her for _Esquire_.  The mere interview became twenty years of dinners together and weekends spent at her cottage.  Berg's book is full of wisecracks the two traded.  When she got an invitation to receive a fashion award, he quipped, &quot;Are you sure they didn't mean Audrey?&quot; which got him her ice cream cone in his face.  There were intimacies shared on both sides; it was a grand friendship.  Hepburn, the product of an independent and eccentric family, remained outspoken and headstrong throughout her life.  She might not have been our finest actress, though some will argue she was, but she certainly took control to get herself one of the finest and longest careers in Hollywood.  She remained unaffected despite her stardom, and many times throughout the book, she reports self-criticism even more than self-deprecation.  When Berg asked if she regretted being childless, she replied, &quot;I would have been a terrible mother because I'm basically a very selfish human being.&quot;  She won a record four Oscars but she never went to the ceremonies to collect them, saying she didn't believe in awards; but she tells Berg, &quot;Mine was a bogus humility.  Actually I was thrilled to win.&quot;  She calls herself a pig for using her husband of long ago for finances and security as her career began.  She has remarks to make on many of the stars she knew as friends, and does so in a chatty fashion, but she is usually more generous to them than to herself.  There are few revelations and little scandal here.<br />For those of us who admired Hepburn the actress and Hepburn the individualist, and would have loved to have had the opportunity to have sat down and talked with her at length about her life, this book will be as close as we get.  Berg had enormous good fortune in getting to know Hepburn intimately.  He knows it, and his memoir is a wonderful tribute to their friendship.  There will be plenty of biographies after this; Hepburn certainly deserves them.  She didn't want tributes after she died, hoping everyone would just go on with their lives after thinking about her for a few minutes.  &quot;And if anybody wants to do more than that,&quot; she said, &quot;they can rent one of mymovies.&quot;  Yes, we can, and thank goodness for the permanent cinematic record.  She could not have known, though, that she could have also suggested that we read this loving memoir.movies.&quot;  Yes, we can, and thank goodness for the permanent cinematic record.

If you are lucky enough to remember one, it will be something you think about upon awakening and perhaps through the day.  Dreams are strange, frightening, and funny enough that it isn't at all uncommon to tell a friend, &quot;Guess what I dreamt last night?&quot; if there is a peculiar dream that bears relating.  Most of us are convinced that dreams mean something.  It used to be thought that gods communicated their intentions to us via dreams.  Other people insisted that dreams could predict the future, and there were dream books in which you could look up the subject of your dream, say &quot;cat,&quot; and find that dreaming of a cat was a certain prediction for maybe riches or maybe love.  Freud's thoughts about dreams were close to this sort of thinking; the content of a dream had hidden meanings that were available for interpretations.  But everyone who looked to dream content for meaning was looking in the wrong place, according to J. Allan Hobson in _Dreaming: An Introduction to the Science of Sleep_ (Oxford).  Not the content of dreams, but the form involved and the neurological basis for it are where the meanings of dreams lie.<br />Dreams are characterized by visual hallucinations, emotionalism, disorientation, and other characteristics of delirium.  Hobson makes the case that we do not have to wait for senility or brain damage to descend into delirium, but we do it every night.  Careful analysis of what happens to the brain in dreaming indicates some basic neurobiology.  Dreaming represents an alternate form of consciousness represented by alternate neurochemical functioning within the dreaming brain; noradrenaline and serotonin in particular, chemicals that neurons use between each other as signal transmitters, are shut off in the dreaming brain in the parts that would allow a waking brain to direct thoughts, make decisions based on experience, and so on.  Brain scanning has revealed that the regions of the brain involved in vision and in emotional reactions are quite busy in dreams, but the areas governing decision-making and judgment are quiet.  The state of Rapid Eye Movement, when dreams are most likely, seems to be important in consolidating memories and in giving children rehearsal for action, enabling them to become their own agents when awake.<br />These REM activities are what is important, and will need much more research; what we dream is not exactly a random side effect of the brain's REM work, but the content of the dream seems to defy scientific interpretation.  Freud's concentration on content, and his insistence that there was a wish drive producing the dream, and a censorship function that made the dream bizarre so that we could handle the wishes in a distorted form, has been a bedrock of psychoanalysis, but has not leant itself to confirmation the way science is done now.  For Hobson, who does his research in the sleep labs at Harvard, the dream is not symbolic, nor is it wish fulfillment, nor a process of censorship.  The dream is simply the dream; what was cryptic for Freud is, for researchers with scanners and brain wave recorders, clear and penetrable because of scientific tools Freud could never have dreamed of.  Hobson's pithy book, full of humor and of examples from the journal he keeps of his own dreams, is a fine basic primer to a new way that science is investigating this aspect of consciousness.ved in vision and in emotional reactions are quite busy in dreams, but the areas governing decision-making and judgment are quiet.

Distant societies think nothing of eating dogs.  Some closer ones think eating horse is completely acceptable.  Then there are frogs, snakes, and insect larvae.  It is all a matter of getting enough protein.  One man's protein is another man's atrocity.  Americans are used to eating meat they find in Styrofoam trays wrapped in plastic, but the indigenous peoples of central Africa have always eaten the animals living around them: elephants, antelopes, porcupines, rodents, and so on.  They don't mind a stew of gorilla or a chimp's sirloin, and what of it?  It's the way they have always done things.  Tribal languages, in fact, often use the same word for wild animal as they do for meat.  The world, however, is not the way it always was, and a shocking book, _Eating Apes_ (University of California Press) by Dale Peterson, shows that apes on the menu is not something the world ought to continue to accept.<br />We ourselves are members of the tribe of great apes; chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans are on the branch with us.  But if African tribes don't share our scientific view or our squeamishness, traditional hunters, in predation balance over the centuries, surely are not going to do lasting harm.  Traditional hunting, however, is no longer traditional.  There has been an invasion from outside the continent by logging companies, making huge profits from our demand for hardwoods.  The companies have lots of workers, many of them from the region, and all the workers have to be fed.  Hunters, many of whom are also from the region, are hired to bring in the protein.  Bows, arrows, and nets have given way to the far more efficient and deadly wire snares and automatic rifles and shotguns.  Perhaps if greater firepower were the only threat to our primate cousins, they could still make it.  But we are destroying their habitat (again, mostly by logging), and primates will suffer before other species because of their slow rate of reproduction.  There are plenty of species headed toward extinction, but few because we are eating them, and none so close to us evolutionarily.  In addition, butchering the apes may be the way humans got HIV and Ebola viruses.  It may well be that you haven't heard of the problem of eating apes into extinction because the conservation organizations are keeping quiet about such a downer of a message, and because they are, believe it or not, in partnership with the loggers.<br />What will be needed is the courage to challenge cultural convictions.  It is possible for the West to value (or at least claim to value) sensitivity to other cultures, but in the case of eating apes, it will have to impose scientific knowledge of close kinship, risk of disease, and impending loss of primates to get the native cultures to change.  It may even be possible within the corporate culture, which mines habitats to get at profits, to insist not just on sustainable development (a nebulous idea the logging companies pay lip service to) but to take on a wider view of environmental improvement.  You can figure up the odds of occurrence of these cultural changes, and especially if you look at our past record, you will not be optimistic.  Peterson includes an appendix of what you, and what conservation organizations, can do; he obviously is not giving up hope.  Perhaps it is a sign of hope that his reasonable and dispassionate account of this disaster will start many people thinking about the previously covert problem of the loss of the apes.

It used to be thought that laughing was one of the things that separated us from other primates, but it has been shown that chimps and other cousins have laughter; this only means that laughter is even more intimately associated with our inner life than we had previously supposed.  But human laughter is not simply a physiological response to an amusing situation or to delight.  According to F. H. Buckley, in _The Morality of Laughter_ (University of Michigan Press), laughter is a civilizing force, and if you laugh, you are a moralizing agent shaping your social environment.  Buckley is a lawyer, and while he may be an academic, he is not a professional philosopher.  He admits that laughter has been frowned upon as a subject for academic and philosophical investigation; laughter is just too lightweight.  However, his entertaining volume, which includes its share of jokes and is wittily, if densely, written, demonstrates that there may be more to laughing than is usually thought, and that the subject has been worth his serious attention.<br />We often laugh at something surprising, at a story that turns out in a way we were not expecting; we find the incongruous funny.  Buckley demonstrates, however, that though such incongruities may spark laughter, there is a tripartite social arrangement going on between a jester, his audience, and the butt of the joke.  The wit proposes a joke.  The listener laughs or not.  Laughter indicates a social tie consented to by the listener, a solidarity with the jester in laughing at the butt.  The laughter is judgmental.  The jester has proclaimed his superiority over the butt, and the listener who laughs agrees.  \\"There is no laughter without a butt, and no butt without a message about a risible inferiority.\\"  The laughter shared between the joker and the listener promotes trust between them.  We are far more likely to laugh aloud when seeing a play in a theater to spread this communal trust than we are when reading the script at home.  Buckley gives counterexamples of such jokes as puns, which may seem not to have a butt (but sometimes do); but there are so many examples of pointed jokes given here that the overall pattern is clear.  For instance, when George IV was told by a courtier, \\"It is my duty to inform Your Majesty that your greatest enemy is dead,\\" the courtier intended to give the news of the death of Napoleon; but the king replied, \\"Is she, by God,\\" indicating his disdain for Queen Caroline.  Buckley shows that laughter may correct behavior, directing it toward moderate norms.<br />A delight in reading this volume is that Buckley is extremely widely read, and can, with seeming effortlessness, draw upon Graham Greene, Aristotle, Moliere, Hobbes, Bergson, and many others.  His erudition does not keep the book from being lively.  Laughter goes with joy, and as Buckley says, \\"... of all things, the ability to find joy in life is our chief earthly good.\\"  In a volume filled with widespread intellectual thrusts and asides, he has provided much to think about, as well as directly delivering plenty of his very subject matter.hen reading the script at home.

One might not expect much from Martin Lloyd, who spent 23 years in Her Majesty's Immigration Service, especially since as author he has confined himself to one little part of his job.  In _The Passport: The History of Man's Most Travelled Document_ (Sutton), however, Lloyd has made uniquely interesting a document that most travelers just take for granted.  From the paper it is printed on to its cover, and from cuneiform to optical scanner recognition, the passport is all here.  This is just the book to give to someone racking up international frequent flier miles.<br />It is surprising how unsubstantial a passport is in legal terms, and how much it has changed in the centuries.  International law, amazingly, has nothing to say about the rights of those with or without passports.  Passports themselves were originally a sort of letter of introduction, but then monarchs became established and realized that it was useful to have some sort of control of who was leaving or entering one's realm.  Even this was not given much legal weight.  A more-or-less organized passport system has been in place for three centuries, but before the First World War, one could travel to most of the world without one; a passport was \\"in most cases a facility or a politeness, not a requirement.\\"  Internationalizing passports has presented problems, many of which have no good solution.  It was difficult, once passport booklets had become the standard and once typewriters were universal, to develop a way to type into the booklet without breaking the spine.  Worse, it was often hard to tell what was the front of a passport; Lloyd may be writing from his own experience when he explains that puzzled passport control officers would try to remember whether a certain nation's passports opened at the front, the back, were read sideways, and if so, which way sideways.  International Civil Aviation Organization organizes passports, and has decreed, for the sake of civil rights, that passports not have a magnetic strip; that would make using them easier, but it might also encode information about the bearer.<br />Lloyd has included a host of interesting anecdotes about passports through history.  William Joyce, for instance, was famous as Lord Haw Haw, the broadcaster of Nazi propaganda.  He was obviously a traitor, but he was born an American and had become German, and had never been British.  He was captured by the British, and accused of treason, but it is not logical that Britons could try a non-Briton for such a thing.  Joyce happened, however, to have gotten illegally a British passport, and this was enough eventually to hang him.  In 1953, an American named Davis declared himself a citizen of the world, and made his own passports under the auspices of the World Service Authority, a \\"fictional organization\\"; the document was mistakenly endorsed as real by some countries.  Napoleon III, himself nearly a victim of an assassination plot involving false passports, said that passports are \\"... an obstacle to the peaceable citizen, but are utterly powerless against those who wish to deceive the vigilance of authority.\\"  Today's travelers are probably more inconvenienced by searches and interrogations, but Lloyd's original book, full of surprising facts, gives the full story of the original and everlasting ticket to overseas, one that governments have found useful, travelers a nuisance, and international law a nonentity.ays.

It has pictures of naked people, to be sure, but often pictured from a comic or artistic view; this is not the place to find traditional cheesecake pin-ups.  At Nerve, the old excuse \\"I only get it for the articles\\" is actually credible.  There are serious essays about sexual topics, historic investigations, memoirs, and hilarious investigative articles by a novice trying sexual techniques.  There is a personals site with ads that are fun to look at even if you aren't in the market.  For the past three years, Nerve has been where to read \\"The Em & Lo Down,\\" sexual and relationship advice from Emma Taylor and Lorelei Sharkey, or, as the subscript goes, \\"Advice From Near Experts.\\"  Funny or serious, their counsel is always worth reading, even if they are only near experts.  Now Em and Lo have produced _The Big Bang: Nerve's Guide to the New Sexual Universe_ (Plume), although the production is credited to \\"the writers at Nerve\\" and seems to have been a team effort.  True to Nerve tradition, the new sex manual is practical, good looking, and fun to read.<br />Em and Lo cannot do anything without humor, and there is plenty here.  The most serious it gets is Chapter 12, which is simply titled \\"Read This Chapter.\\"  It starts, \\"Don't even think about skipping this chapter, because whatever you know, it's not enough.\\"  It is, inevitably, about sexually transmitted diseases. There is more to sex than seriousness, Em and Lo would be the first to agree, and most of the rest of the volume is devoted to having fun.  There is a great chapter on what used to be called Hong Kong honeymoon accessories, marital aids, or adult novelties, but are now simply, and with brisk appropriateness, called toys.  There are pages and pages of descriptions of toys, pros, cons, and suggestions; you will even find the \\"Hello Kitty Vibe\\" featuring the mouthless visage of the kitschy cat. (_The Big Bang_ may be written by women, by the way, but the advice, just like most of the toys, can be used on both sexes.)  There are simply lots of good suggestions in other chapters, given by enthusiastic authors who have obviously found their dream subject.  There are many, many suggestions for couples.  A great chapter on kink allows that \\"Just because you like to be tied up, spanked, and called 'bitch' doesn't mean you're a bad feminist.\\"  There are useful chapters on oral and anal sex, the G spot, birth control, and lubricants.  A whole chapter is devoted to the importance for both sexes of doing Kegel exercises for better performance and pleasure. Yes, yes, yes.<br />_The Big Bang_ lacks the mass and comprehensiveness of the excellent _The Guide to Getting It On!_, but it has great humor, sound advice, and an enthusiasm for the subject that ought to be infectious.  It can be enjoyed solo, but would be fine material for couples to read together.  For those who value jocular, informal, and informative writing, and don't know everything about sex, this will be a delight.Vibe\\" featuring the mouthless visage of the kitschy cat.

His account of his travels on the _Beagle_ are still enjoyed by readers looking to see how he began his insights, and his writings on the evolution of species and humans are of course well known and epochal.  Less appreciated these days is that Darwin did not always write on the big subject, but he disciplined himself by writing on the small.  In _Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough_ (Norton), Rebecca Stott has taken one important aspect of Darwin's long career, with the idea that the barnacles, in many ways, were the making of Darwin as a scientist.  Much of this information is not particularly new and is covered, though in less depth, in the many Darwin biographies.  However, Stott's attention to Darwin's barnacle work, his family issues of the time, and his growth as a biologist focuses welcome attention on an important part of his life and career.<br />After his return from the _Beagle_ voyage (and his first collection of a barnacle specimen), besides writing up his journals and discoveries from his voyage, Darwin formed his first ideas about the origin of species and evolution.  He wrote up his ideas, but refrained from publishing; he not only knew how controversial evolution would be, but he realized he needed to issue these ideas after having more basic biological knowledge.  So for eight years, from 1846 until 1854, Darwin worked on barnacles.  He had to dissect hundreds of them under the microscope.  He had to work with both the adult forms and the free-swimming larval forms.  He corrected misconceptions and made startling discoveries about their sex lives.  As a result, his eventual volumes on barnacles were the sum of all knowledge in the field, and continue to be used by specialists.  His home in Kent became the world capital of barnacle studies, with specimens and scientific visitors constantly coming in and out.  He gained new ways of writing in scientific jargon, but also ways of carefully building up an argument, using his own doubts on an issue to gather evidence to present a solution.  He gained first hand knowledge of zoology and embryology.  He had a firmer concept than almost any biologist of what a species was, and what the relationship between species was.  Natural and sexual selection, ever on his mind, were confirmed in his studies on all the myriad variations of the humble barnacle.  After his eight years toiling among the _Cirripedia_, he began his work on his _Origin_, and it was a grander and more confident work than it would have been had barnacles not been his companions all those years.<br />Stott's accomplished retelling of the barnacle stories is accompanied by descriptions of Darwin's extensive medical problems over the same years, and his treatment by a quack's \\"water cure.\\"  There are stories about his visit to the Crystal Palace with his family.  There are also accounts of his loving relationship with his wife, and his exemplary capacity as a father.  These years also included the sad death of his beloved daughter Annie.  Most important, however, is how the barnacle years transformed Darwin.  While he is reviled by many because of his clash with their religious opinions, Stott has concentrated on the celebrated characteristics of Darwin the scientist as formed and manifested by his laborious conquest of an uncontroversial corner of natural history.  She has done students of Darwin the service of showing how important he was for the barnacle, and how very important the barnacle was for his scientific development.al of barnacle studies, with specimens and scientific visitors constantly coming in and out.

Sam Patch was America's first celebrity daredevil, someone who made his fortune and his fame by spectacularly endangering his life, jumping from waterfalls.  Paul E. Johnson, in _Sam Patch, The Famous Jumper (Hill and Wang), has not exactly brought Patch back to life.  As Johnson explains, people like Patch did not have linear careers that lent their lives to being told as stories; they had episodes, not biographies.  Patch only lived thirty years, and jumped professionally only for the last two of those, but he did have a wonderful career, and even some meaning within American history and sociology.  Johnson has, though Patch's story, examined some details of Jacksonian America, industrialization, philosophies of art, and aspects of fame from self-endangerment and self-promotion rather than self-improvement and civic involvement.  Patch was, after all, a lout and a drunkard, but it must mean something that he achieved such a level of fame that his feats could be cited by Melville, Hawthorne and Poe.  Even Andrew Jackson's favorite steed was named Sam Patch.<br />Sam was around seven years old when he took up work in a mill; families in the early eighteenth century were being drawn to mill towns since mothers and children could easily get work.  He was good at the work, and fiercely independent in the craft of \\"mule spinner\\".  The independence manifested itself in his jumping as well.  He learned the craft of jumping as other boys did, but when he moved to another mill town, his jumping acquired a social and political aspect that endeared him to the populace.  He jumped to spite a rising industrialist in Paterson, New Jersey, and then in support of his own class when there was a dispute over how the town should celebrate the Fourth of July, and jumped again during the first labor walkout.  People loved the jumps, and newspapers reported them.  Patch became a working-class hero.  He went on to jump into Niagara Falls twice, and finally in Rochester.  On 13 November 1829, he took a plunge into the Genesee Falls, into which he had jumped successfully a week before.  He was drunk, and hit the water out of control.  It was months before the body was found, but respectable Americans had found a new cause to rail against; one preacher spoke of the \\"strange and savage curiosity\\" of the crowds who came to see the jumps, and another told his Sunday school class \\"... that any of them who had witnessed Patch's last leap would be judged guilty of murder by God.\\"<br />Sam Patch could have been an emblem against the masses, but it did not work out that way.  He became the subject of poetry, comic stories, and stage plays.  \\"What the Sam Patch!\\" became a common way of swearing.  There was a Sam Patch cigar.  He has even recently been the subject of a novel.  Rochester has welcomed his memory as if it were that of a favorite son, and you can buy souvenirs at Sam's Gift Patch.  There are those who insist that any American Dream must be built on hard work, domestic harmony, and sobriety.  Johnson's able and well-researched portrait, with its many digressions into aspects of our fledgling democracy, shows a different sort of dream and a new sort of celebrity.  Americans, bless their hearts,  had from the beginning a delight in one who tweaked the nose of his betters and got fame for lots of wrong reasons.ass hero.

Thoughts happen without our thinking about making them occur or about the incalculably complex neuronal interactions that would make them happen.  How can it possibly happen that intracranial meat makes mentation?  Check with an expert, like Paul Broks, who is a British lecturer and consultant in neuropsychology, the study of brain processes that produce thought and behavior.  In _Into the Silent Land: Travels in Neuropsychology_ (Atlantic Monthly Press), he will bring you up short: &quot;My area of supposed expertise, neuropsychology, is the subject about which I feel the most profound ignorance.&quot;  He cannot satisfactorily account for how the brain generates conscious awareness.  He reflects that this is something like finding out that your airplane pilot knows nothing of lift, drag, and so on.  And yet, the patients he describes in his book, and his own introspection, and his fictional thought experiments are so strange that readers will be amazed that they could have ever taken themselves (or their _selves_) for granted.<br />The people Broks sees in his clinic are those with damaged brains of some sort, &quot;thought experiments made flesh.&quot;  This is the territory previously explored for us by Oliver Sacks, whom Broks names as an influence on his own thinking and writing.  Especially illustrative are the split brain patients, those who have had the cables cut from right brain to left, usually to try to short circuit seizures.  It is possible to get a sedative to one side of such brains and then to the other, so that clinicians can interview only one half-brain at a time.  In such a patient, Naomi, Broks finds, &quot;Ms Left-brain was talkative and cheerful. Ms Right-brain was unsettled, mute, morose.&quot;  But Ms Left-brain afterwards was responsible for describing the entire session, and had no memory of Ms Right-brain's difficulties.  This is the usual sort of sharing, and not just in patients with split brains.  The left hemisphere not only is the spokesman for both, but also is &quot;the brain's spin doctor,&quot; making odd events (such as the transient communicative ability of the right brain) comprehensible and acceptable.  The left brain, quite simply, lies to make a palatable reality.  We are all split up like this.  Different wrinkles in the brain handle language, thoughts, memories, feelings.  Broks worries: &quot;There is no special point of convergence.  No cockpit of the soul.&quot;  Unity is an illusion.  The brain is pretty well mapped, via MRI slices, and we have good ideas about what large parts of it do, but even if you look around a living brain, you will fine no self there; &quot;... there is no ghost in the machine. It is time to grow up and accept this fact.&quot;  But take heart; even if we exist in some mysterious emptiness between neurological components, this is itself  a &quot;... beautiful, liberating thought and nothing to be afraid of.  The notion of a tethered soul is crude by comparison.&quot;<br />Though serious, Broks's book has a lot of fun with the paradoxes of consciousness.  It is often a set of arguments for different sides of questions, with no firm answers.  It is not just case studies, but includes reflections on the fate of Einstein's brain, and on the status of the &quot;Little People&quot; in Robert Louis Stevenson's dreams that gave the author his best work.  Broks has written some whimsical stories to bring points home.  Memorable is a sci-fi parable which summarizes many of the puzzling ideas Broks presents.  It involves a teleporter, something like the famous one in Star Trek.  For a trip to Mars, the machine scans every atom of the traveler, reduces the information to digital format, sends the data to Mars, where every atom is reconstructed.  The rules of teleportation, however, decree that the sender has to be annihilated; this avoids duplication.  But what happens when the machine malfunctions, sending the data for proper reconstruction, but doesn't do the vaporization of the original sender?  Where is the person?  How can one mind be in two places?  How long before they become two different persons by having different experiences?  Which one should the authorities, belatedly, vaporize?  The witty story is titled &quot;To Be Two or Not to Be&quot;.  It climaxes an enigmatic and enlightening book that will give much contemplation to anyone with a brain.when the machine malfunctions, sending the data for proper reconstruction, but doesn't do the vaporization of the original sender?

Yet, in _The Parthenon_ (Harvard University Press), Mary Beard reminds us that there are great voids of mystery about it, that we don't know what large portions of it looked like when it was built, and that much of what we see when we look at the ruin now is a controversial restoration.  Beard's serious, academic, but witty monograph makes us look at the ruin again, and realize the role it has played in imagination and in objective Western history.  Not only is the Parthenon an amazing and influential building, but it has a few thousand years of history and controversy (starting from before it was built).  Beard gives us all the details in a lively account.<br />Beard, a classicist, reminds us that we have to do a lot of guesswork about the Athenian government of the fifth century BCE, even though it looms large in our imagined history of democracy.  There were rumors of financial and sexual scandal connected to the project, which was attacked as a colossal waste of money and \\"dressing up Athens like a whore.\\"  The temple was not for worship such as occurs in our churches and mosques (both of which, in time, the Parthenon became).  It was a strongbox, a place to keep not only the valuable statue secure, but also plenty of other treasures.  The friezes were attacked by Christians when it was turned into a church, and had milder defacement from the Turks when it afterward became a mosque.  The temple was more or less intact, though, until 1687, when Christians blew up the gunpowder the Turks were storing there.  The ruin we see now on the Acropolis is not the ruin that was left.  We now see columns running between the pedimented ends of the building, but this is a reconstruction from the 1920s.  To put it mildly, this restoration did not meet the current standards for historic preservation, although it was heartily approved at the time.  It is not an accurate reconstruction but \\"a plausible fiction\\" made of materials that were to hand, and it inexcusably injured the ancient blocks.  Current reconstruction will position them as well as current research methods can direct.<br />Of course the history of the Lord Elgin and his theft or rescue of the sculptures is recounted here in very fair detail.  What happened to them in the twentieth century, however, shows how large a role they play in the world's affections and interest.  The rich art dealer Joseph Duveen provided the new accommodation for the Elgin Marbles at the British Museum.  He somehow had access to the sculptures being prepared for their new accommodation, and in 1938, the director of the museum was horrified to find that copper tools and carborundum were being used to clean the figures at Duveen's direction.  Beard reports that \\"... heads did, discretely, roll, and 'remedial measures' (the phrase alone makes you shudder) were taken on the marbles.\\"  There was a flurry of press criticism at the time, but a scholar turned the story up only a few years ago, resulting in an angry and emotional international conference to try to get to the bottom of the events of 1938.  Beard says this is only the most recent climax of \\"the longest-running cultural controversy in the world,\\" the fate of the Elgin Marbles.  The Parthenon may be only a ruin, but it plays a role in the world's cares beyond just being a beautiful spot for sightseers.

But everyone loves butterflies, and everyone has done so since early childhood.  They are fascinating natural specimens, and their colors fill us with admiration and wonder.  It isn't surprising that they have caused obsessions in many people in many centuries.  In _An Obsession with Butterflies: Our Long Love Affair with a Singular Insect_ (Perseus Publishing), Sharman Apt Russell has packed some taxonomy of butterflies, and also biology, but also a history about the obsessed and a chronicle of butterfly culture.  Russell reveals that she is obsessed herself, but her obsession translates into an enthusiastic and poetic look at science and history that is full of life and color.<br />Anyone who reads this book will come away with admiration for the cleverness of tactics which evolution has given to butterflies.  Caterpillars are especially vulnerable in a world that is out to get them; fungi, pathogens, wasps, ants, birds, and lizards all find caterpillars a tasty meal (oh, and humans, too).  The Western Tiger Swallowtail's caterpillar is only a speck when it comes out of the egg, but as it grows and molts, it takes on the appearance of a bird's droppings.  No one is interested in bird droppings.  Caterpillars have enemies, but friends, too; some have developed a symbiosis with ant colonies.  The butterflies get protection and nourishment, and the ants get honeydew secreted by the caterpillars.  The color of butterflies may be enchanting to us, but like all the other characteristics of the insect, it is merely an evolutionary tool.  Often males are more brightly colored than females; they are attracted to the drab coloration of females and repelled by the bright males, so that they spend their time with the right group to get the genes into the next generation.  Darker colors help high altitude butterflies keep warm.  Eyespots scare birds.  Bright colors warn of unpalatability.  Edible butterflies mimic toxic ones, and toxic ones mimic each other, just to make sure the birds got a clear message.<br />It isn't just butterflies that are examined in this book; humans are pinned here, too.  Lady Glanville sent cases and cases of butterfly specimens in the early eighteenth century for the naturalists to record and keep.  When she died, the will was voided because she was thought to be insane over butterflies; she would beat the hedges for &quot;a parcel of wormes,&quot; neighbors reported.  One entomologist admitted, &quot;None but those deprived of their Senses would go in Pursuit of butterflyes.&quot;  Among those similarly deprived of their senses was Lord Walter Rothschild, who hired an army of professional species-stalkers to collect butterflies from all over the world.  He donated over two million specimens to the British museum.  His niece Miriam was famous for producing a six-volume inventory of her father's flea collection, but she demonstrated how Monarch caterpillars become toxic by storing the poisons of milkweed plants.  She wrote that butterflies are like dream flowers &quot;...which have broken loose from their stalks and escaped into the sunshine. Air and angels.&quot;  We have pinned these angels, collected them, categorized them, and studied them for hundreds of years, and they are still full of surprises.  Russell's book, too, is full of surprises; did you know that the male Tiger Swallowtail has eyes on his genitals to guide them into just the right slot on the female?  Readers of Russell's elegant and poetic (yet fact-filled) book will have a new appreciation for the insect that humans love.right colors warn of unpalatability.

His niece Miriam was famous for producing a six-volume inventory of her father's flea collection, but she demonstrated how Monarch caterpillars become toxic by storing the poisons of milkweed plants.  She wrote that butterflies are like dream flowers &quot;...which have broken loose from their stalks and escaped into the sunshine. Air and angels.&quot;  We have pinned these angels, collected them, categorized them, and studied them for hundreds of years, and they are still full of surprises.  Russell's book, too, is full of surprises; did you know that the male Tiger Swallowtail has eyes on his genitals to guide them into just the right slot on the female?  Readers of Russell's elegant and poetic (yet fact-filled) book will have a new appreciation for the insect that humans love.	2003-06-30

Most of the time, our gadgets go fairly close to right, and we don't have to think much about tending them, and we almost never think about how they are tending, and changing, us.  Technologies created by people create different sorts of people.  In _Our Own Devices: The Past and Future of Body Technology_ (Knopf), Edward Tenner has considered simple technologies, some so simple and ungadgety that we might not even think of them as technologies: bottle feeding of infants, footwear, chairs, keyboards, eyeglasses and helmets.  His book is full of fun; Tenner has a host of obscure yet relevant facts that he has obvious pleasure in presenting.  He writes, &quot;This book is about the changes we have made in ourselves: how everyday things affect how we use our bodies.&quot;  He has examples drawn from many disciplines in addition to the main ones, like the importance of styles of lacing of shoes or the effect of Taiwanese bowlers taking advantage of light bowling balls with lots of spin on them.  There is a huge range of information within these pages.<br />One of the themes of the book is that the technique of use is an essential complement to the technology involved.  Baby bottles, for instance, involve a technique that must be successfully learned by mother and infant.  They also allow fathers a nurturing role denied by nature.  Tenner does not get into polemics about the bottle versus nursing controversy (nor does he do so for any of the controversial technologies he explores).  We are physically affected by our technologies.  There are millions of people who live literally on the Earth, doing without shoes; of course we evolved to get around without shoes originally.  There is a movement to promote barefoot hiking, but there is always a self-fulfilling problem to overcome: shoes cause our feet to be so sensitive and vulnerable that we need shoes to protect them.  In Japan, many grow up wearing _geta_ (two-piece clogs), which means that their gaits are measurably different from those who wear, say, ordinary sandals, and may be the reason Japan has very few world-class runners.  It was in 1853 that an inventor set up a chair with movable parts and a system of springs that would allow rocking, although the chair rested on a pedestal supported by casters.  The chair was no longer static; &quot;This was the beginning of a new technique of sitting.&quot;  Extensive studies have been done in the water to show exactly what position a body in complete rest takes (although previous evaluation of sleeping positions gave the same information), with chairs engineered to ensure that position.  Piano innards have changed because of insistence of composers, especially Beethoven, on more complicated and louder performances, but although there have been improvements in the keyboard itself, no superstar has promoted them and none caught on.<br />The examples come thick and fast throughout the book's chapters.  The technologies of writing and printing and the technique of reading have actually increased myopia in literate societies, though the explanations of the physiology behind the change are not yet satisfactory.  Eyeglasses that correct the myopia may cause children's eyes to grow differently, increasing the myopia.  The hard helmet of football changed the way the game is played; coaches used to instruct players to wrap their arms around the ball carrier to bring him down, but the helmet made them into human battering rams.  The fans' appetite for aggressive and violent plays increased.  People who sit in chairs that have a backrest suffer from weakening of the back muscles so that they more acutely need a backrest: &quot;The chair is a machine for producing dependency on itself.&quot;  Again and again, Tenner's surprising examples show that technology is often quite wonderful, and of course indispensable, but we only understand what it does to us after close examination of its effects, and the effects themselves often could never have been anticipated.s after close examination of its effects, and the effects themselves often could never have been anticipated.	2003-06-26

Mencken was not on a campaign against religion: \\"I have never consciously tried to convert anyone to anything,\\" he wrote.  Perhaps not, but conversions must have happened as readers sought his columns in the _Baltimore Evening Sun_, the _Smart Set_, and the _American Mercury_.  He didn't write mostly on religion, of course, excoriating Americans for their general stupidity in many spheres.  But his critiques of religion have been collected in _H. L. Mencken on Religion_ (Prometheus Books), edited by S. T. Joshi, and they are a stimulating, wide-ranging attack on various aspects of a particular foe.  Fundamentalist Christians especially will find much offensive here, for they are Mencken's particular game, although Catholics, Methodists, Christian Scientists, spiritualists, and other more moderate sects come into scorn in their turn.  If Mencken were alive today, how he would spring into attacks upon the Raelians, the TV spiritualists, the New Agers, and of course the fundamentalist Christians who are still thriving.  To read these essays is to be reminded of how relatively mild such criticism has now become.<br />Of course Mencken was misanthropic, and of course he was bigoted.  He was careful to express disdain of his own character, often saying that in studying religious ideas, he found \\"soothing proof that there are men left who are even worse asses than I am.\\"  One of his essays is even called \\"Confessions of a Theological Moron,\\" in which he admits that unlike most of the people on the planet, he has no religious feeling whatsoever and that no sense of any divine personality enters into his thinking.  \\"As for the impulse to worship, it is as foreign to my nature as the impulse to run for Congress.\\"  But he also made clear that he was \\"... anything but a militant atheist and haven't the slightest objection to church-going, so long as it is honest.\\"  He thought power grabs by religion dishonest; in his own time, he lambasted religious support of prohibition, the Ku Klux Klan, Sunday marketing laws, and divorce restrictions.  \\"The whole history of the church, as everyone knows, is a history of schemes to put down heresy by force.\\"  Mencken was present for much of the Scopes trial in Dayton, Tennessee, or the trial of (as he repeatedly names him) \\"the infidel Scopes,\\" and his columns are reprinted here.  He does not come out and say it, but he favored the wall between church and state as a means of not just separating but of protecting each side from the other.<br />The wit and erudition displayed in these essays is a real treasure, and ought to be for believers and infidels alike.  Get out your dictionary; you will read here of the roar of the catamount, the boons and usufructs of modern medicine, the pothers of the newspapers, and the head wiskinski of the wowsers.  As an epilogue, here is the famous, funny, and oddly moving \\"Memorial Service\\" seeking the gravesite of the thousands of gods people have believed in, \\"... many of them mentioned with fear and trembling in the Old Testament.\\"  The long list, including Baal, Pluto, Odin, and Huitzilopochtli, is composed of  gods \\"...of civilized peoples - worshipped and believed in by millions.

It is in southwestern Virginia near the Blue Ridge Mountains, and has one anomalous aspect that makes it different from all those other best towns.  It is the site of the National D-Day Memorial.  The memorial does not sit on the Mall in Washington, nor on the shores of Normandy.  It is in this little town because, although thousands of soldiers perished in the D-Day assault, no other town gave as many of her sons.  On 6 June 1944, nineteen Bedford boys died, and three more died in the days of follow-up fighting afterwards.  There have been sufficient histories of D-Day already, but _The Bedford Boys: One American Town's Ultimate D-Day Sacrifice_ (Da Capo) by Alex Kershaw focuses the global events onto the personal level.  Not only does it describe the horrendous slaughter on the Normandy beaches, but it also tells the effects of the losses on the families within Bedford.  It is a sad tale, of course, but full of heroism on both sides of the Atlantic.<br />None of the boys would have said they had particularly volunteered for anything heroic.  They were sons of the Depression, and many of them enlisted in the National Guard simply because of the money.  They got a dollar for the one training day each month, and for each of the fourteen days in the summer.  It was the luck of the draw that the Bedford boys were assigned to a company that had to experience the wickedest fighting of the most difficult assault of the day, on Omaha Beach.  Before that, they crossed the Atlantic on the troop-converted _Queen Mary_, and the months before D-Day they spent in grueling training within England, the longest training of any American infantrymen in the war.  There are good anecdotes here to tell the stories of these boys, many of whom were away from Bedford for the first time, and of course a harrowing account of the invasion itself.  The most heartbreaking account is not of the boys' deaths, but of the reaction at home.  The D-Day invasion was in the headlines, of course, but the families in Bedford knew little of their boys' participation in it.  The letters stopped coming after 6 June, raising tensions in the town.  Then letters to the soldiers started coming back in packs marked undeliverable.  Finally, on 17 July, the telegrams started pouring in.  Elizabeth Teass, on duty at the Western Union office at the rear of Green's Drugstore on 17 July, expected to be getting sad announcements as part of her job, but was in shock as the machine clacked on and on, one official &quot;deep regret&quot; after another.<br />Kershaw was writing about another project when he came across the Bedford story and realized it had not been told in full.  He interviewed as many of the survivors as he could, and the family members still living; naturally, almost sixty years on, he has not gotten to interview all he would have wanted.  He has documented meticulous research into official records and past books on the great assault, to make an account that is memorable for its degree of personal detail.  D-Day was the greatest amphibious attack in the history of warfare.  The Germans and the Allies both knew that the war would be won or lost on these beaches.  It was the Bedford boys, and thousands of their counterparts, who made a difference and quite literally saved civilization.  They deserve commemoration, and Kershaw's fine history brings them home to us again.most heartbreaking account is not of the boys' deaths, but of the reaction at home.

If something is mathematically true, then it is among the most trustworthy concepts we can count on in this uncertain world.  Yet mathematicians have had to incorporate more inclusive number systems, some of which they have originally found intimidating or even revolting.  In Imagining Numbers (particularly the square root of minus fifteen) (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), Harvard mathematician Barry Mazur has given a poetic and absorbing illustration of what it is to imagine mathematically.  It isn't a book for mathematicians, but it has wonderful ideas about mathematics and what it is that mathematicians spend their time doing.  Readers will need to do a few calculations, but mercifully few; the endnotes sometimes take a stronger mathematical background, but the actual mathematics within the text is unintimidating.<br /><br />Some numbers just seem to be part of us; even babies seem to know the small ones.  But big ones, or fractions, or irrationals, take a bit of imagination to understand.  When negative numbers were discovered (or invented), mathematicians could use them  practically in calculations, even though they were originally called _fictae_ or fictions.  But the square root of a negative number doesn't make much intuitive sense.  Think of a square with an area of negative nine; it then has a side equal to the square root of negative nine, which isn't three or negative three.  Mazur explains, &quot;This has more the ring of a Zen koan than of a question amenable to a quantitative answer.&quot;  The square roots of negative numbers would not stay impractical like a Zen koan, however.  By the 1700s, mathematicians were solving equations that called for such numbers as answers.  Ren&eacute; Descartes dismissed them by terming them &quot;imaginary numbers,&quot; and the name has stuck, even though they are really no more imaginary than negative numbers or irrationals.  Mazur does not mention that these less-than-real, more-than-real numbers have been put to practical work in the real world; they have proved unimaginary enough to be useful in understanding electrical circuits, signal processing, and holography.  The complex plane, with real numbers along the horizontal axis and imaginary ones on the vertical (beautifully developed here), is where the Mandlebrot set resides, producing all the resultant hallucinatory colors of pictures of fractals.<br /><br />Mazur has given a history of the idea of imaginary numbers, but he has also tried to explain mathematical imagination in general.  He uses many examples from poetry and literature, so a reader who does not know numbers but has some idea about literary images will feel at home.  Literary analogies abound here, and Mazur winds up comparing them to mathematical analogies, such as how an algebraic context throws light on a geometric one.  Deep structural analogies have always brought impressive understanding in diverse mathematical fields, as mathematicians have striven to make the analogies into equalities.  Readers who stick to Mazur's rich and happy exposition may not start using imaginary numbers practically, but they will gain insight into just why Mazur loves doing mathematics and how imagination can be extended in to previously forbidding numerical territory.name has stuck, even though they are really no more imaginary than negative numbers or irrationals.

It was a \\"Eureka Moment.\\"  He was thereupon inspired to create the new science of motion, discover gravity, form the main laws of physics, and invent calculus.  It is supposed to illustrate how geniuses get their flashes of inspiration, simply thinking deeply on what all the rest of us pass by.  The main flaw in the story, according to _Isaac Newton_ (Pantheon) by James Gleick, is that it probably never happened.  Newton himself, only many years later, told people that he had been inspired by an apple in his garden; he never wrote about it.  It was not necessarily a falling apple, and it certainly wasn't a falling apple that beaned him on the head, as one variant of the story goes.  (Perhaps we like to imagine our betters running into problems like malevolently falling apples.)  More importantly, as Gleick points out, \\"Newton did not need an apple to remind him that objects fell to Earth.\\"  Galileo had seen it and done tests on dropped objects.  If Newton got any sort of inspiration from an apple incident, it was only because he had thought about gravity carefully for years before.  It was as if Newton \\"... had an extra sense organ for peering into the frame or skeleton or wheels hidden beneath the surface of things,\\" Gleick writes.<br />Newton worked in isolation, and was reluctant to discuss his results.  This was to haunt him in the famously bitter quarrel over whether he or Leibniz had invented calculus.  He never married, and though he may have castigated himself for sexual ideas, he did not put them into practice.  He was devoted to alchemy, with all it's legends and lore.  Newton is often held up by fundamentalist Christians as being the kind of scientist that we could have had before Darwinism took over, but this reflects an ignorance of Newton's views.  Newton fulminated against the Trinity, convinced that it was a false god sinfully imposed by popes and monks.  He was irascible, argumentative, friendless, and uncommunicative.  He was also incomparably brilliant, and can be called truly the chief architect of the modern world.<br />When _Principia_ was published, it was thought by many to be impenetrable.  Others thought it was a step backward to some sort of demon.  Scientific thinking had quelled some of the importance people attributed to invisible spirits, but Newton invoked an invisible force called gravity, a force which ruled the apple, the Moon, and the Earth, and which caused the tides.  Newton could only maintain that it was not occult.  The essence of gravity was not something that he or anyone else understood, but it was demonstrated by mathematics.  \\"It is enough,\\" he wrote, \\"that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth and is sufficient to explain all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.\\"  For Newton, the numbers mattered, and Gleick's biography, concentrating as it does on the progression of Newton's thought, is an excellent introduction to the dramatic difference Newton made.  Gleick cannot explain Newton's genius; no one can sufficiently do that.  His brisk and well-researched biography, though, does much to help us appreciate it.popes and monks.

But how do we know that the mannequins are really measuring what real bodies do in a crash?  A crash test dummy which didn't register the break of a knee or of a cranium in the circumstances that would break an actual knee or cranium would be of little use, but researchers cannot ask a real human to do the tests.  Except that they can; for unequalled simulation of reality, use a real human, but for the sake of humanity, use a cadaver.  It is one of the perfectly sensible things that dead people can do to help those of us who are not yet dead.  As such, it forms one of the chapters in a remarkable book, _Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers_ (W. W. Norton) by Mary Roach.  The subject may be taboo, but as Roach says, \\"Death. It doesn't have to be boring.\\"  This funny book crammed with extraordinarily weird information will delight unsqueamish readers.<br />The crash experiments she reports on were conducted at the Bioengineering Center at Wayne State University, where cadaver UM 006 is wired up and propped up to go through a simulated side impact.  Roach takes us to a plastic surgery training session in which forty human heads are placed in forty roasting pans (\\"to catch the drippings\\") so that plastic surgeons at the University of California can learn the skills associated with doing away with wrinkles.  Such cadavers are treated with respect (and those who donate them ought to get our thanks), but here also are stories of cannibalism and human parts used for medicine.  Roach reminds us several times that she is not herself a squeamish person, though this will be obvious to anyone who reads this odd book.  She tells us of the ways that bodies, rather than flight data recorders, can tell what happened to a plane breaking up in flight.  We learn of the tests of munitions on cadavers, shooting them to document bullet effects.  Donated legs are used to test the best shoes to protect legs from mine injuries, and are quite a bit cheaper than the \\"Frangible Surrogate Leg\\" for use where testing of ballistics on cadavers is not allowed.  There have been crucifixion experiments to see what really happens to a crucified body and what sort of weight nailed hands versus wrists could hold up.  (Live people intrude here; strapping, rather than nailing, living people to a cross shows that they don't have particular trouble breathing, as had been previously reported.)  She goes to an outdoor lab where bodies are just left out in the open so that crime pathologists can learn to calibrate their descriptions of the timing of decay.  She watches the instruction at a mortuary science school.  She interviews the pioneers who are hoping to have composting of humans as an accepted practice.  Roach visits the operating room where organs are taken from a brain dead woman for transplantation.  To read this amusing and at times shocking book is to understand that people with personalities are important, and that cadavers are less so, but what we do with them tells us a lot about the living they have left behind.We learn of the tests of munitions on cadavers, shooting them to document bullet effects.

Those of us who browse it out of curiosity rather than sincere shopping can't help but wonder how these attempts at finding love turn out.  Will the beautiful, brainy SJF, earthmother, find her sweet, brilliant, companionable sexy beast?  Will the adventurous, intellectual, DWM, 47, periodontist, photographer, musician, cat-lover find his full-figured woman for passionate sex and scintillating discussions?  (I am citing real ads from a recent issue.)  Thanks to Jane Juska, we know, quite thoroughly, how one of those ads played out.  Juska was watching an Eric Roehmer film in Berkeley, carefully munching her malted milk balls, when she started writing her ad.  Carefully budgeting the $4.55-per-word prose, she eventually submitted, \\"Before I turn 67 - next March - I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.\\"  Her funny, revealing, and smart book, _A Round-Heeled Woman:  My Late-Life Adventures in Sex and Romance_ (Villard), shows that the old slogan is quite true: it pays to advertise.<br />If you are not \\"of a certain age\\", Juska's title might elude you.  It is an old phrase that indicates a woman who is easy to get to go from vertical to horizontal.  \\"My heels are very round,\\" she writes, \\"I'm an easy lay.  An easy sixty-seven year old lay.  'Twas not always so.\\"  She had gone through decades of not having a man in her life.  This is not just a story of what happened once she placed her ad, but also a memoir of her life so far that led to its placement.  She recounts a Midwest upbringing, sad marriage, divorce, single motherhood, teaching high school (and prison) English, her love for the novels of Anthony Trollope, and much more.  Of course the main fare is how Juska managed her respondents.  She triaged the letters into Yes, No, and Maybe, stacks that proved not to be rigid.  Her first encounter, filled with all the worry that would do justice to any virginal adolescent, could not have been worse; the cad had sent an outdated photograph and steals her champagne flutes and her pajama bottoms.  Good writing paid off for another: \\"... a varied syntax sends shivers up and down my spine.\\"  She fell in love with a man who only wanted a friend.  She had completely successful encounters with a man who was thirty-five.  He wrote her that he realized \\"that there is a somewhat substantial age gap between us (not quite Harold and Maude, but in the neighborhood)\\" but that age didn't matter for people that mattered to him.  He sounds too good to be true, but there isn't any disillusionment at the book's end.<br />There has already been backlash about the book; many would have been better pleased if she had followed the path old ladies are supposed to take and did not admit to any lingering libido.  Of course, then there would not have been any book, and then there would not have been as happy and as fulfilled an author.  Most readers will be rooting for her, as she grins against the disappointments life and men inevitably hand her.  She cannot help loving them, and enjoying in particular their legs, buttocks, and penises, about which she writes with gusto.  She may be needy, but she is also frisky and honest.  She is neither noble nor pitiable, but simply reluctant to let physical thrills be a part of the past, something that only young people savor.

Good writing paid off for another: \\"... a varied syntax sends shivers up and down my spine.\\"  She fell in love with a man who only wanted a friend.  She had completely successful encounters with a man who was thirty-five.  He wrote her that he realized \\"that there is a somewhat substantial age gap between us (not quite Harold and Maude, but in the neighborhood)\\" but that age didn't matter for people that mattered to him.  He sounds too good to be true, but there isn't any disillusionment at the book's end.  <br />There has already been backlash about the book; many would have been better pleased if she had followed the path old ladies are supposed to take and did not admit to any lingering libido.  Of course, then there would not have been any book, and then there would not have been as happy and as fulfilled an author.  Most readers will be rooting for her, as she grins against the disappointments life and men inevitably hand her.  She cannot help loving them, and enjoying in particular their legs, buttocks, and penises, about which she writes with gusto.  She may be needy, but she is also frisky and honest.  She is neither noble nor pitiable, but simply reluctant to let physical thrills be a part of the past, something that only young people savor.  She is brightly appreciative of the intellectual thrills of meeting interesting men, too.  This is a unique memoir by a funny and irrepressible lady, and a sexy one as well.	2003-06-09

With little fortune, no prospects of getting an education, and facing a rigid hierarchy he could not break, his prospects of doing anything else than his father's career were unlikely.  The one limited prospect of advancement was going to sea, which he did at age 13.  It was his place to excel; he was careful, deliberate, and punctiliously neat.  His flight to success worked; even though he had to change his name while he was on the run for a murder charge, John Paul Jones can be counted as one of the Founding Fathers.  In the biography _John Paul Jones: Sailor, Hero, Father of the American Navy_ (Simon and Schuster), Evan Thomas has insightfully examined Jones's ambitious climb, and the other side of ambition's coin, his vanity, which halted the climb from going as far as Jones had aimed.  In balancing both sides, Thomas has produced a model biography of America's most famous sailor.<br />John Paul had to work the lowest levels in the Royal Navy, sailing slave ships.  In 1774, he killed a mutinous sailor off Tobago, and his career was over.  He fled to Virginia as John Paul Jones.  His timing was fortunate; by 1775 the Continental Congress had a starting fleet and needed officers; he was commissioned as a first lieutenant.  Jones proved to be one of the few in the navy who had a strategic vision, one which was recommended by a novelty transcending the orderly set-piece battles between ships: terrorism.  It is perhaps discomforting to think of Jones as a terrorist, but he realized that war could be waged against cities and peoples, not just against professional fighters.  The British had counted on the Royal Navy to keep them safe in their homes, and Jones breeched the shield.  His daring touched on English anxiety about piracy, and he was often depicted as a pirate.  More importantly, the English started wondering if warring to keep their colonies was really worth it.  He won special fame for action against the new, copper-clad frigate _Serapis_.  He was not, however, justly rewarded by his country.  He was denied the rank of admiral because of the machinations of his fellow captains.  His suspiciousness and irascibility did not recommend him, even though his courage and seamanship did.  He took the only job he could get when the Revolution was over, in the Russian navy, but in 1792, possibly weakened by care and by years of exposure to the elements, he died lonely and forgotten in Paris.  He had a small funeral, and then oblivion.  Eventually a laundry was built over the graveyard.<br />Jones was resurrected in 1905; the young President Teddy Roosevelt needed a naval hero, and being a naval historian himself, he knew how the country had slighted its first great sailor.  \\"Every officer in our navy should know by heart the deeds of John Paul Jones,\\" the President orated at the time.  Jones was put at final rest in a magnificent marble sarcophagus beneath the transept of the Naval Academy Chapel.  It would have been just what he wanted: \\"My desire for fame is infinite,\\" he admitted.  Jones would not be so proud of Evan's fine biography, for it makes plain the egotism; John Adams called him \\"leprous with vanity.\\"  For a Founding Father, he had little to say about the importance of democracy and equality, although he wrote plenty against tyranny.  But Evans's biography also makes plain Jones's courage, and explains well the successes that Jones the striver was able to gain.  It is a thorough and thoroughly entertaining picture of a fascinating figure.st the new, copper-clad frigate _Serapis_.  He was not, however, justly rewarded by his country.

Much of the enthusiasm for the games comes from \\"Doom\\" which was released ten years ago.  Every gamer knows about Doom, and every parent who had not already worried about it was able to worry about it after it was blamed for inspiring the Columbine murderers.  Doom was the brainchild of two gamers and computer geeks who are among the army of dweebs changing the way the world does things electronically.  Its huge success merits study and understanding, and in _Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture_ (Random House) by David Kushner, it gets just the sort of exciting and weird history that ought to bring enchantment to gamers, envy to investors, and enjoyment to anyone interested in our modern ways of amusing ourselves.<br />Their many fans call them \\"The Two Johns,\\" John Carmack and John Romero.  They were both products of broken homes, and of the years when video games were enjoyed in arcades only.  Both of them were better at playing video games and writing programs than they were at making grades or making friends.  They came up with real innovations, now taken for granted, like side scrolling for the PC or rooms with skewed walls.  All were steps to make the games look better, of course, but the overall effect was to make them more involving, increasing the illusion that \\"You are not just playing the game, you're inhabiting it.\\"  They also increased the blood; monsters or bad guys that were killed did not simply vanish when brought into the sights and fired upon.  These were not the only innovations; Doom, released in 1993, featured the \\"Deathmatch\\" in which players could play together or against each other.  There might be mutants afoot, generated by the game, but players could also plot with or against each other, and blow each other away.  Doom (and their follow-up, Quake) proved to be so addictive and involving that players would be glued to their computers, even if they were suffering motion sickness induced by the realistic visions on the screen.<br /><br />The book's concentration on the tale of the two gamers, Carmack the programmer and Romero the designer, will make it a pleasure to read even for those who know nothing about computers.  The eventual split between them, fuelled by millions of dollars, is, of course, a classic business parable.  Their company changed computer games, and in some ways, the computer industry, forever.  _Masters of Doom_ is an impressive documentation of how games got to be the way they are now, as well as a social history of the lives and times of two key game makers.  Kushner wisely does not go into deep sociological examination of the effects of the games' violence, but of course the two Johns weren't interested in any moral implications of their wares.  \\"Doom was cowboys and Indians with better special effects,\\" Kushner explains, and though this might be too light an analysis, it is much more fitting than blaming Doom for Columbine.  The games may be suitable subjects for moral disdain, but that will make no difference to those who get a rush from spending time in this way, and more importantly, it will make no difference in the millions of dollars spent on games that will probably get more and more like being in a movie, and thus will continue to push computing limits.  Carmack and Romero have forever changed people's ability to live out dreams of escape and power, and have changed people's ideas of what computers can do.r computers, even if they were suffering motion sickness induced by the realistic visions on the screen.  <BR> <BR>The book's concentration on the tale of the two gamers, Carmack the programmer and Romero the designer, will make it a pleasure to read even for those who know nothing about computers.

Chaucer knew this, of course, and his crew is composed of all from the reverent to the venal.  Some of his pilgrims, like the Wife of Bath, were journeying just for the fun of it, but none of his pilgrims were confessed skeptics, out to see what they could see and write a book about the experience.  That is what Rosemary Mahoney has done in _The Singular Pilgrim: Travels on Sacred Ground_ (Houghton Mifflin), not just once but within six of the most celebrated pilgrimages, and not just Christian pilgrimages, but a Hindu one, too.  She has a fine eye for detail, an attraction to odd people, and a smooth way of telling a story, so that the armchair pilgrim gets to go vicariously on these jaunts with little risk except perhaps laughing at people who ought to be solemn, and questioning the purpose of pilgrimages and of worship itself.<br />Every year in May, there is an Anglican National Pilgrimage to the shrine of the Virgin Mary in Walsingham, an English village.  The procession is attended not only by pilgrims, but by protesters.  Methodists, Presbyterians, and others who think that the procession is too close to Catholicism shout down the parade and put up signs like &quot;This procession &amp; mass denies the Word of God which forbids it.&quot;  Lourdes is very Catholic and very kitschy.  Mahoney's first physically demanding pilgrimage was to the city of Santiago de Compostela in Spain via walking El Camino de Santiago, hundreds of miles across northern Spain.  Mahoney's view of the pilgrims here, as she hobbles with crippling tendonitis, is the most cynical; as befits a &quot;new&quot; ancient route, the pilgrims on it are New-Agey secular seekers, taking the hike during some free months in between jobs, to find a spouse, to heal a karma, or to lose weight.  Mahoney's Hindu pilgrimage was to Varanasi, the ancient city on the Ganges where the very best cremations happen and where reverent Hindus go to bathe in the fetid waters.  In the Holy Land, she is amused by how different churches insist that they own, say, the authentic place where the water-into-wine miracle.  The struggle for authenticity has manifested itself in different religions or different branches of one religion trying to claim possession of particular sacred sites, and Mahoney notes, &quot;Everyone was fighting to own a piece of the man who lived for peace and said, _Own nothing_.&quot;  The final pilgrimage is to Saint Patrick's Purgatory on Station Island in the middle of Lough Derg, a rigorous pilgrimage including sleep deprivation, cold, midges, and mind-numbing recitations of rigid prayers, perhaps in anticipation of purgatory's entertainments.<br />Mahoney is a wonderful guide to these strange locales, practices, and people.  She examines her own beliefs throughout, and contrasts them with those of her mother, a staunch Catholic.  Conversations with her mother are remembered frequently throughout the book.  There is serious introspection here, and serious inquiry into a form of human activity that has many participants, but she has conducted the research with irrepressible humor.  At the end of the Camino trip, she reflects that although she was still unsure why she had walked all that way, &quot;... I felt I had accomplished something strange and monumental.&quot;  Yes, and that can be said of her book as well.fetid waters.

We all take our pleasures where we find them, and everyone is different, with different sources to draw upon.  It will seem peculiar to many people that others could take pleasure in mathematics.  Children usually learn to be bored or frightened by math, but there isn't any reason for this, other than incompetent teaching.  As an attempt at remedy, husband and wife team Robert and Ellen Kaplan in 1994 began the Math Circle, Saturday morning sessions for kids who just wanted to find out more about mathematics.  (The sessions were changed to Sunday morning when soccer practice interfered).  Some kids (especially those who were pushed into the classes by their parents) dropped out, but some have come back, year after year, and the Kaplans have found that posing questions, inviting conjectures, asking for examples, and even suggesting ways towards proofs can be something children can enjoy.  Mathematicians have been telling us for centuries about the beauty of the objects and systems that they have explored.  The Math Circle seems to have taught math in a way to at least some kids who have caught the spirit of the quest for mathematical beauty.  In _The Art of the Infinite: The Pleasures of Mathematics_ (Oxford University Press), the Kaplans have put some of those lessons into book form, concentrating on infinities of various kinds.  This is a book for adults, or kids who hanker to think about math like adults ought to, but it is full of a sense of play.<br />As you might expect, things start simple and get very complicated, and this is true right off in the first chapter, considering more and more complicated numbers.  The Natural Numbers are introduced with patterns, as if you had stones to position on a table.  1, 3, 6, and 10 stones make pleasing equilateral triangles, and 1, 4, 9, and 16 make pleasing squares.  We move from these to zero and negative numbers:  &quot;Certainly zero and the negatives have all the marks of human artifice: deftness, ambiguity, understatement.&quot;  Are these numbers invented or discovered?  The profundity of this question is plumbed throughout the book.  Rationals, irrationals, and finally the complex numbers are all included.  As the numbers mount up, the irregularity and regularity of the primes is considered, one of the most fruitful arenas of number theory.  Euclid had to make an assumption about the infinite, his famous fifth postulate; but it is only an assumption; assuming that parallel lines meet eventually produces also a worthy geometry that tells us much about how the Einsteinian universe works.  But there is no need to look into these strange worlds to find wonders; before leaving Euclid's terra firma, we are reintroduced to the triangle, and are presented with some astonishing revelations of secret points within and around the simple three sides that will remind you that no matter how simple things look, or even how simple things are, everything is more complicated than you can imagine.<br />And if you want your infinities more complicated still, the final chapter has to do with Cantor's work.  Common sense tells us there must be half as many even numbers as there are whole numbers, but Cantor showed that the infinity of both was equal.  He showed that the infinite number of points in a line as long as your finger was equal to the infinite number in a line as long as from here to the Sun.  In fact, the number of points on a line is equal to the number of points in a plane.  And yet, some infinities are bigger than others.  This is strange territory indeed, and requires some concentration to understand and enjoy, even with the Kaplan's literate, witty, and clear explanations.  This is a fine introduction to different aspects of serious mathematics; true to its subtitle, it is a book full of pleasures.tement.&quot;  Are these numbers invented or discovered?

The story of the doomed ship _Struma_ might be one of those stories, except that one of the nearly 800 people on board survived the sinking of the vessel.  _Death on the Black Sea: The Untold Story of the Struma and World War II's Holocaust at Sea_ (Ecco) by Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins, is not just a survivor's story, but a full accounting of a shameful atrocity that has been largely overlooked, even in histories of that bleak time.<br />The history begins with an account of pre-war Romanian history, and the brutalities that occurred even before the country joined the Nazis.  Only the desperate would have paid the shamefully exorbitant cost for passage on the leaky, filthy cattle boat _Struma_, with the hope of getting to Palestine.  The British controlled such immigration, however, and restricted it so as not to bother the Arabs and their oil supplies.  The ship left Romania in December 1941, with intent to sail out of the Black Sea, through the Bosporus Strait, and on to Palestine.  The engine failed on the first day, was patched, and failed three days later.  The ship was towed by a Turkish tug to Istanbul harbor.  There the ship stayed for almost two months, while bureaucratic nonsense was conducted to seal the fate of the passengers.  They slowly withered due to disease and lack of fresh food and fresh air.  There was even bickering over a plan to let the children leave the ship, a plan that never happened because Turkey, following a suggestion from the British, cut the anchor of the engineless vessel and simply set it adrift.  Stalin had ordered Russian submarines to sink all ships in the Black Sea to prevent them from getting to Germany.  A day after being set adrift, the helpless _Struma_ was torpedoed, and quickly sank.  Nineteen-year-old David Stoliar miraculously was rescued by Turkish fishermen, but was imprisoned in Turkey thereafter; much of the book is his story.<br />The horrific story of the _Struma_ is here told in a plain and unsensational way.  The authors have rightly sensed that there is no need to try to make the account more dramatic by artificial recreations of imagined conversations or thoughts of the people involved.  There is some heroism, like that of Simon Brod, an Istanbul businessman who selflessly devoted constant efforts to helping refugees of various kinds and from various sources.  Such lights are few in this, one of the darkest episodes of the war and one that took longest to be seen clearly.  There is a portion of blame to go to the U.S., which parroted the British line about the importance of limiting emigration, and did not want to get further involved.  The evil of the Nazi purge is to blame, of course, in its Romanian variant, as is the ruthlessness of Stalin's blanket order to clear the Black Sea of shipping indiscriminately.  Those on the _Struma_ died, however, because of the joint efforts of the British and the Turks, from veiled anti-Semitism to indifference to outright murder.

She had heard how her horrid grandfather, Dr. William Macbeth, poisoned two of his sons.  She determined that she would get the facts.  There was no one in her family who had first hand experience of Dr. Macbeth except her great-aunt Rose.  From her, Bell did get the facts, or at least enough of them to provoke further enquiry.  The facts become as plain as they can be (not very plain, but surprising facts, nonetheless) by the end of the book, but that is only partially the book's point.  For the most part, it is a series of handsome digressions about the history, literature, and celebrities of poisoning.<br />Bell's grandfather (\\"the one we never spoke about\\") died before she was born.  Rose's ghastly story was supplemented by the report of a narrative that Macbeth fancied Rose until he married Rose's sister.  By the time it came to do research, all the participants were dead.  What solutions arrived came from persistence, luck, newspaper clippings, death certificates, and bureaucratic files.  But most of the pages here do not have to do with solving the case, which is merely an excuse (a good one) for a book of essays on aspects of poisons and poisoners.  \\"The underlying narrative in all poison murder stories is a betrayal of trust,\\" Bell reminds us.  There are many stories of poisoners here, and the punishments meted out to those who were discovered.  The particular role of females is examined, as is the folklore regarding snakebite.  Along with anecdotes of famous, infamous, and nameless poisoners, there are tales of antidotes.  The Australian blue-ringed octopus exudes a toxin for which there is no antidote, but there are antidotes for all the others, although they are not necessarily specific or effective.<br />The death by hemlock of Socrates is examined when Bell looks at Jacques-Louis David's painting of the subject and can't take her eyes off the cup.  She notes that this is a non-Socratic reaction which reflects her life of pharmacological study \\"... and puts me in the category of the pedant who can't see past her own learning.\\"  Madam Bovary's self-inflicted death is here, and Cleopatra, Juliet, Van Gogh, Eva Braun, and many more.  There is hemlock, sure, but belladonna, arsenic, Spanish fly, carbon monoxide, and others from the wealth of poisons are described here, along with sometimes grisly details about how each throws a spanner into the biochemical or organic gears that we need to keep ourselves going.  Horses get arsenic because it gives their coats a shine, but eating arsenic has been a family hobby, too.  Pigeons are almost immune to the effects of opium.  The FDA continues to have to warn that mandrake and other roots and plants are better at killing people than they are at sexually stimulating them.  There is nothing morbid in the many facts and stories here, but much macabre.  Bell does tie everything together with a satisfying twist at the end.  Her scholarly and entertaining miscellany ought to be examined at leisure with good cups of cocoa nearby.  Be careful who makes them for you.ct and can't take her eyes off the cup.

He has a right to the title of \\"Father of Geology,\\" though, and it was through his efforts that we started scientifically assessing the age of the Earth, rather than relying on interpreting the Bible as a geological text.  But he was no religious iconoclast; in fact, he was even made a saint.  In _The Seashell on the Mountaintop: A Story of Science, Sainthood, and the Humble Genius Who Discovered a New History of the Earth_ (Dutton), Alan Cutler has not exactly brought Steno back to life; there is too little documentation of his life to do that well.  But he has given basics of the life, and more importantly has examined the originality of Steno's thinking and put it in the context of his times.<br />Steno, born in 1638, was raised in Denmark as a Lutheran.  He became a famous anatomist, but in his travels, he took particular interest in the land he traveled through.  The great puzzle of the time was how could seashells be found, far from the sea, embedded in rock, and at the tops of the mountains?  The prevalent explanation was that shells actually grew inside the Earth; they were not seashells, but the product of some mystical force, the same sort of thing that produced the manifestations of magnetism or made flowers grow.  Steno produced clever and well reasoned arguments against shells growing inside rocks, and he laid out principles of geography which have stood the test of time.  Steno well knew the persecution of Galileo by the church, and he worried that his ideas would receive the same condemnation.  For instance, merely supposing that rock layers were formed gradually from sediment might be heretical to those who insisted that God had made the Earth all at once.  Cutler shows that Steno paid attention to the evidence he could see on his travels, at the same time paying close attention to the scriptures.<br />Steno was a pious man who after much thought gave up Lutheranism to become a Catholic; he also largely gave up his scientific endeavors to do so.  He became a priest, took up a vow of poverty, and stuck to it, destroying his health and bringing about an early death.  He had risen to Bishop within the church hierarchy.  Pope John Paul II praised both Steno's faith and his scientific work when he beatified Steno in 1988, although the scientific work was really all that had made him famous.  The Catholic Church had long since stopped insisting that seven days of creation were of twenty-four hours each, and geologists were using Steno's principles every day.  Cutler, himself a geologist, has written a useful book to bring a forgotten thinker to our attention, as well as documenting the beginning of scientific rather than religious explanations for the forces that formed our planet.r much thought gave up Lutheranism to become a Catholic; he also largely gave up his scientific endeavors to do so.

The dodo is universally acknowledged as a symbol of extinction, not just a dead bird, not just a dead species, but an emblem of wipeout.  Although everyone knows the dodo, we know almost nothing about it.  It was discovered and wiped out long before the days of scientific observation.  Errol Fuller has told us just about everything there is to know about the bird in _Dodo: A Brief History_ (HarperCollins).  It is not as big or lush a volume as the one he produced on another goner, the great auk, but it is beautiful and fascinating.<br />The facts about the birds are slim.  They came from the small island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.  They were actually large pigeons.  They weighed more than fifty pounds, according to an observer from 1634.  They had ridiculously small wings that were a parody of flight.  We don't know what they ate, what they sounded like, or how they mated.  &quot;But of one thing we can be sure,&quot; he writes, &quot;There are now no dodos.&quot;  Europeans arrived on Mauritius when the Dutch navy landed in 1598 (there had been transient visits by Portuguese and Arabs before then), and only fifty or so years later, there were no dodos.  The dodo had no predators before encountering humans, so it had slipped into a flightless existence, and also did not flee when approached.  They were easy prey.  After the bird's extinction, no one much cared about it.  In 1755, there was exactly one stuffed dodo.  It was within the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.  It was in such a decrepit state that it was consigned to the flames.  The head and right foot alone were saved, and &quot;these pitiful fragments&quot; still exist and have been used for DNA samples.  Of course they are depicted here.<br />After more than a century of oblivion, Fuller explains that one simple event caused &quot;... the general public to take notice of the dodo, and the bird itself to enter the ranks of universal celebrity.&quot;  In 1865, Lewis Carroll published _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_, with an episode of the &quot;caucus race&quot; which the dodo decides &quot;Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.&quot;  Prizes, he also decides, have to come from Alice herself.  Sir John Tenniel illustrated the episode, with his image based on first-hand depictions.  Fuller explains that the dodo, like the book, &quot;... was suddenly in vogue and - again just like the book - it has never since been out of it.&quot;  Dodo poems followed, and &quot;Dodo&quot; as a nickname for girls, dodos on teapots, tea towels, stamps, coffee mugs, advertisements, table service, and more.  We will never forget the dodo.  Fuller's handsome, beautifully illustrated volume of all this dodo lore helps in the cause of dodo remembrance.

Most of that time, also, they were very simple (single cell animals, sponges, and soft-bodied animals).  The famous Cambrian explosion was the sudden boom in animal diversity that happened between 543 and 538 million years ago.  It is when teeth and armor appeared.  It is also when eyes appeared.  It is easy for us to imagine the drama of, say, the destruction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, but according to Andrew Parker the Cambrian explosion is &quot;the most dramatic event in the history of life.&quot;  Other dramatic events have their explanations (an asteroid wiping out the dinosaurs, for instance), but there has not been a satisfactory explanation of the Cambrian boom.  Until now, according to Parker, and he has come up with it.  _In the Blink of an Eye_ (Perseus Publishing) is a convincing explanation that he first announced seven years ago: the Cambrian explosion was caused by the evolution of vision.<br />What happened in the explosion is that animals acquired armor, hard body parts, and a huge variety of different shapes.  Parker explains that the shapes and armor came along because eyes came along.  In the blind pre-Cambrian world, creatures took in sensation by smell / taste, sound, or touch.  It did not matter what the creatures looked like, because no other creature could see them.  It didn't matter if creatures had no armor, because predators weren't chasing them.  Creatures scavenged upon dead animals, but did not need claws or jaws to catch those; catching prey was unlikely for a creature that was blind, so predation was not the rule.  And then there was light!  Parker thinks that a soft-bodied ancestor of the trilobite was the first creature to get a light sensitive patch that eventually differentiated into different units of an eye.  The trilobite that could gradually see better could gradually become a better predator.  Not only does vision power a diversity of the trilobite itself, into such skills as agility and efficient use of muscular propulsion, it powers changes in prey.  In the dark, an animal has no need to care what it looks like.  Pursued by creatures that can see, an animal has many avenues of change that it might follow, like making camouflage, developing its own armor, swimming faster, growing bigger, or gaining its own eyesight.  And then the predators can become modified to overcome those tactics, and the familiar evolutionary battle is enjoined in earnest.  Vision started diversity, and has powered it ever since.<br />Parker's book is a rich account of how he came to these conclusions, with a wide-ranging gathering of supportive evidence.  He writes clearly, and with a witty understatement.  When, for example, he describes examining seed-shrimps and dissecting them under the microscope, he says, &quot;The seed-shrimps tend to roll around and fall in exactly the positions that are not required of them.&quot;  Any scientific theory is open to question, and surely the very simplicity of Parker's explanation will make it a target for other theorizers with new data.  Right now, though, in considering the Cambrian explosion, the Light Switch Theory is the way to see things.does vision power a diversity of the trilobite itself, into such skills as agility and efficient use of muscular propulsion, it powers changes in prey.

The joke goes that one of the members of such a sect declared, \\"If it was good enough for Saint Paul, it is good enough for me.\\"  The truth is that the KJV is good enough for any English speaker, more majestic than any other version, and that it is a foundation of the English-speaking world more than even Shakespeare is.  How this astonishing book came to be composed is Adam Nicolson's story in _God's Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible_ (HarperCollins).  It is a successful account of how diverse personalities, European history, and religious fashions produced a timeless classic.<br /><br />There were English Bibles before 1611.  The KJV grew out of a conference at Hampton Court where the new king took up grievances of the Puritans; the Bible was a byproduct of the conference.  James was heartened by the idea of a new translation.  He distrusted the widely used Geneva Bible because it had marginal notes about how people ought to view kings, notes he viewed as seditious.  Less self-servingly, he thought an authoritative translation might bring religious peace to his conflicted land.  The translation was his personal project.  There are plenty of jokes about how committees invariably complicate rather than solve problems, but Nicolson shows that in Jacobean England, individuality was distrusted and \\"Jointness was the acknowledged virtue of the age.\\"  The KJV was a product of 54 translators, broken into teams and organized in a fashion that would befuddle a modern CEO, and they followed general or specific rules laid down by King James.  The notes and directives generated by the translators have been largely lost, but Nicolson is able to tell us about a few of the translators themselves, a mixed bunch.  A combination of puritans, prudes, drunkards, scholars, libertines, hotheads, and other eccentrics were perhaps just the crew to be involved in translating a work of such breadth. Among the most interesting parts of Nicholson's book are comparative translations.  He gives a history of Luke 1:57, for instance, to show how it was rendered as \\"Now Elizabeths full time came that she should bee delivered, and she brought forth a son.\\"  Nicholson points out the richness of \\"full\\" meaning plump, perfect, or overbrimming.  He also gives us another committee translation, performed over three centuries after the KJV, the New English Bible: \\"Now the time came for Elizabeth's child to be born, and she gave birth to a son.\\"  There is nothing at all remarkable in these flat words; they might have come from a social worker's report.  Nicolson says of these translators, \\"Wanting timelessness, they achieved the language of the memo.\\"<br /> Recently we have been treated to gender-free translations of the Bible, or the Ebonics Bible, as attempts to make the book relevant or up to date.  There are also \\"modern\\" translations into American English that are as dull as they are easy to read.  Such translations will quickly themselves be out of date curiosities, but the KJV will never be antiquated.  _God's Secretaries_ is a fine tribute to the imperishable majesty of its words, and to the particular Jacobean circumstances that brought it about.nvolved in translating a work of such breadth.

She was present at the dawn of DNA testing in her industry, and when she heard about the newly patented method of DNA fingerprinting, she told the directors of her firm, \\"This DNA fingerprinting is going to be big.  I think we should get into it.\\"  She was just the person to influence the firm in that direction, but in 1985 she was murdered in the front garden of her home.  There was a suspect, but no witnesses, no fibers, no fingerprints, and the homicide department put the murder in the archive for more than a decade.  Then a resourceful investigator found physical evidence in the file, and, ironically, used the same DNA testing on it that Greenwood had been promoting.  The history of this case, and the results, are told in a fascinating detective story, _Pointing from the Grave: A True Story of Murder and DNA_ (Miramax) by Samantha Weinberg.  The book does not simply relate the facts of the case and profile the personalities involved, but it also gives a satisfying and useful history of DNA research and the effect of that research on forensic investigations.<br />Weinberg intercuts her murder story with visits to labs and descriptions of the history of DNA going back to before Watson and Crick.  One of Weinberg's digressions is to the Innocence Project, which has used DNA evidence to free wrongly convicted prisoners.  The Project's efforts have shown that courts and juries are more badly flawed than anyone had previously suspected, and have increased the importance of DNA for fair legal investigation.  But the useful digressions in _Pointing from the Grave_ all hang on the story of Greenwood's murder, and that story is very well told indeed.  In 1998, an investigator found Greenwood's fingernail clippings taken at the autopsy, and thought that perhaps under the fingernails would be skin samples for investigation.  When Greenwood had been murdered, such evidence was useless; fifteen years later, it provided the basis for the arrest of a charming sociopath who at the time of the murder had had been out on bail for sexually assaulting her.  His lawyer attempted to use the defense that the science was untested, to \\"persuade the jury it was voodoo,\\" but in 2001, juries had heard enough about DNA successes, and prosecutors had had enough experience with demonstrating the reliability of such evidence, to make a difference.<br />Weinberg has interviewed many of the scientists whose work she mentions, and has had jailhouse interviews with the accused.  She has become friends with his family, who are sad figures (\\"they were the essence of the American suburban family\\") trying to understand how a nurturing and non-abusive upbringing could have turned out so.  There are vital portraits of all the players at the trial here, and a summary of the proceedings that is exciting.  Unforgettable is Greenwood's father; he was proud of his science-inclined only child, and devastated by her death.  \\"There's enough sadness in the world,\\" he said, \\"without people killing each other.\\"  He compared it to stones thrown in a pond, \\"... the ripples as they grow outward bring misery to everyone.\\"  When he said this, prostate cancer was painfully killing him in England, but he had hung on to life for years hoping to have his daughter's death resolved.  He heard the verdict relayed to him by telephone, and died only hours later.ifteen years later, it provided the basis for the arrest of a charming sociopath who at the time of the murder had had been out on bail for sexually assaulting her.

It may be surprising to learn that bubonic plague has made its mark on modern America.  In 1900 in San Francisco's Chinatown, Wong Chut King died of a precipitous and horrifying illness, starting with a rush of fever and chills, continuing to agonizing back pains, painful lumps in the groin and armpits, bleeding, coma, and ending in death.  It seemed to be the plague, and it seemed to city government the worst possible news, not because a resident of Chinatown had died, but because it meant bad economic prospects if the cause of death was found out.  The amazing story of the arrival of bubonic plague in America and the difficulties involved in its eventual control is told in _The Barbary Plague: The Black Death in Victorian San Francisco_ (Random House) by Marilyn Chase.  It is a surprisingly exciting tale, with lessons for our own century.<br />The thousands of citizens of Chinatown were worried that discovery of the plague in their midst would only increase the considerable discrimination against them.  They were right; the city quarantined Chinatown, eventually with barbed wire, arbitrarily zigzagged to exclude white stores and churches.  Joseph Kinyoun, the federal medical officer for the city, tried to impose the quarantine and force vaccines, but Chinese community groups were able to have them struck down as racially discriminatory.  Kinyoun was opposed by civic leaders fearing an economic impact if the plague became well known, and was eventually run out of town.  His successor, Rupert Blue, had a little more effect, with some control of the plague before 1906, but then came the earthquake.  It shook thousands of rats from their dens, rats which flourished in the broken sewer systems and the mounting garbage, and which successfully colonized the refugee camps.  It was after the earthquake that Blue was at his most active, mercilessly driving his team of doctors, diggers and rat-catchers.  He replaced wooden structures with concrete ones.  He put a bounty on rats, ten cents apiece (afterwards twenty-five), and used tons of cheese every month in traps.  He knew rats became disinterested in boring bait, so he included the cheese in Welsh rabbit lures, and gave them rye sandwiches with bacon.  He enlisted women's organizations in lessons of housecleaning with city-cleaning in mind.<br />The author is a San Francisco science reporter for the _Wall Street Journal_, and knows the city's history and attitudes well.  She has managed close-up views of Chinatown, the rats' importation by steamship from the infected port of Honolulu, and the rattery where rat autopsies and flea combings were done.  There are lessons here for the next inevitable scourge.  Racializing the disease and scapegoating its victims was a complete failure.  The wide broadcast of scientific knowledge is our greatest epidemiological weapon.  Unbiased reporting of facts without unnecessary terror but with necessary alarm enlists the aid of the public.  It is probably not a coincidence that when hit with another plague almost a century later, when AIDS struck, San Francisco was, compared to the rest of the country, unafflicted with denial or discrimination, and gave swift and compassionate care.most active, mercilessly driving his team of doctors, diggers and rat-catchers.

We have barely begun to understand the brain, the most complicated object we know of.  And yet, some researchers are not only trying to understand the brain, but to understand it as it does the strangest things in conditions of mystical or altered states of mind.  In _Rational Mysticism: Dispatches from the Border Between Science and Spirituality_ (Houghton Mifflin), an entertaining informal review of such attempts, John Horgan tells of his visits to shamans, gurus, neurologists, and philosophers.  There are plenty of contradictions and paradoxes here (often fundamental differences between mystics, for instance, but also sometimes from a singular source), but there is also a great deal to think about, and on big, big subjects.<br />There has always been an idea that some sort of mystical experience, a direct connection to an ultimate truth, would get us wonderful benefits.  Horgan himself has had trouble with metaphysical ideas for decades, and the discomfort helps him ask the right questions and present the reader with plenty of puzzles.  He visits Michael Persinger, the Canadian psychologist who experiments with blasting people's brains with electromagnetic pulses.  He tries on the \\"God Machine\\" and gets only vague geometric shapes.  Persinger says that the machine doesn't work well on skeptics.  Horgan interviewed Albert Hofmann, the discoverer the effects of LSD in 1943.  An expert in psychedelic shamanism, Christian Ratsch, told Horgan that it is a bad, exploitive lie that decades of meditation or spiritual practice are needed for enlightenment; it only requires \\"the right molecule to hit your brain.\\"  Susan Blackmore, formerly a believer in parapsychological affairs and now a professional skeptic, continues to practice Zen Buddhism.  She thinks religions are something like very successful chain letters, but credits her meditations with helping her abandon ideas like God, an afterlife, and free will.  Buddhism teaches the illusory nature of the self, and so do certain cognitive scientists.  The climax of the book is Horgan's trip to California (surprise) to participate in an ayahuasca ceremony.  Ayahuasca is a psychedelic used for religious services in Brazil.  There were plenty of pretty patterns, vertigo, worry about incipient madness, affection for the strangers he was with, and eventually existential dread: \\"The flame of consciousness had flickered out in the eternally expanding cosmos, and it had reverted to dumb, blind, painless, meaningless matter, as it must.\\"  Not very comforting, but the best parts were his interactions with others.<br />\\"So what is the final lesson?\\" he wonders afterward.  \\"What is the point of all our mystical searching?  Where does it get us?  What truth does it give us?  What consolation?\\"  Those looking for particular answers ought to have known beforehand that, given the subject matter of the book, particular answers for all the big questions will not be found here.  In a section mockingly titled \\"Science and Mysticism Reconciled!\\" Horgan finds some comfort in a point of convergence between the two.  Science is never going to answer finally the question, \\"How did something come from nothing?\\" any more than mysticism will, but people will continue to pursue both and those who are wise will continue to admit that there is a paucity of answers from all sources.  He quotes Voltaire: \\"Doubt is not a very agreeable state, but certainty is a ridiculous one.\\"  The reader may not have doubts extinguished by this exhilarating look at complicated matters, but the trip is one to enjoy.ng her abandon ideas like God, an afterlife, and free will.

On 17 December 1903, a couple of brothers from Dayton, Ohio, managed to get their &quot;aeroplane&quot; in the air, and we haven't come down since.  There are plenty of biographies of Wilbur and Orville Wright, but in _To Conquer the Air: The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight_ (Free Press), James Tobin has told mainly their story of intellectual discovery, and made it clear how much work the brothers did in making their dreams come about.  As such, it tells a great deal about the others who were thinking about flight at around the same time; the Wrights were not experimenting or flying in a vacuum.  The upcoming centennial celebrations ought to be worldwide, and readers of this engaging and detailed chronicle will have a much better idea of just what we will be celebrating.<br /><br />The other main potential aeronaut was Dr. Samuel Langley, president of the Smithsonian Institution, and he hung his hopes for flight on a powerful but light engine.  The Wrights, on the other hand, started out with the shape of the craft, especially the wings, to lead to flight.  It was to get good wind for their kite and glider experiments, and unobstructed landing points, and also secrecy, that they went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, for their trials.  The developed the idea of warping the wing to control the machine, and invented &quot;Kitty Hawk in a box,&quot; the wind tunnel, to do scientific lift experiments.  When they discovered that wing warping would not allow full control without the kite yawing into a skid, they added a vertical tail, and it worked; such things could not be taken for granted back then. After successful flights of increasing length on 17 December 1903, the brothers walked four miles to send a telegram home about their success, ending with &quot;INFORM PRESS.&quot;  However, the press either printed exaggerated stories, or for the most part, ignored them.

It is wonderfully simple to understand, and interesting to spend time doodling on.  Mapmakers like to take a map like, say, the states of the U.S. and color in the states with different colors so they are easily told apart; the theorem states that any such map (or any imaginary map of contiguous regions), no matter how complex, only requires four colors so that no state touches a state of the same color.  This is not obvious, but if you try to draw blobs on a sheet of paper that need more than four colors (in other words, five blobs each of which touches all the others along a boundary), you will quickly see that the theorem seems to be true.  In fact, ever since the question was mentioned, first in 1852, people have tried to draw maps that needed five colors, many of them very complicated, but no one succeeded.  But that isn't good enough for mathematics; it's interesting that no one could do it, but can it be proved that it cannot be done?  For over a century, there was no counter-example and yet no proof, but in 1976 there was a proof that has held up, but is controversial because it used a computer.  The amazing story of the years of competition and cooperation that finally proved the theorem is told in _Four Colors Suffice: How the Map Problem Was Solved_ (Princeton) by Robin Wilson.  This is as clear an explanation of the problem, and the attempts to solve it, as non-mathematicians are going to get, and best of all, it is an account, exciting at times, of the triumphs and frustrations along the way, not just with the final proof, but in all the years leading up to it.<br />Surprisingly, mapmakers aren't very interested in the problem.  It was first mentioned in writing in 1852, and in 1879, Alfred Kempe published one of the most famous proofs in mathematics, famous because it proved the theorem and famous because, although it was accepted for about a decade, it was wrong.  Kempe's work was useful, as it was an attack on the problem that others eventually used in different ways, but it did not stand.  Percy Heawood published a paper in which he included a diagram that Kempe's method could be used on and for which Kempe's method failed.  (Not that more than four colors were needed for the map; it simply showed Kempe's method didn't cover all possibilities.)  Heawood built on Kempe's work to prove a five color map theorem, but the four color version proved elusive.  There was so much data developed in proofs in the 1960s that computers became essential to handle them.  Wolfgang Haken worked on the theorem, and was told by computer experts that his ideas could not be programmed, but programmer Kenneth Appel disagreed.  In 1972, Haken and Appel teamed up to work on a computer-aided solution, and in 1976, they announced it.  They were rushing, as other map-colorers were coming close to a solution themselves.  The proof required a thousand hours of computer time, a hundred pages of summary, a hundred pages of detail, and seven hundred pages of back-up work.  The computer printouts for it stacked to four feet high.  The long hunt was over, but it was not satisfactory to everyone.  The problem is that the computer did so much work on the proof that humans cannot check everything the computer did; some mathematicians, especially older ones, have not accepted this proof, although no significant error has been found.<br />_Four Colors Suffice_ not only explains the theorem and historic attempts at proofs in a clear fashion, it is an inspiring look at something that is really rather lovable in our species, the pursuit of mathematical knowledge for its own sake.  To be sure, the theorem does have practical interest, if not to actual mapmakers, then to road, rail, and communications networks, but it has mainly inspired other aspects of pure mathematics like graph theory and algorithms.  There are many stories of cooperation between mathematicians here that make the final conquest of the problem seem like a team effort that has been conducted for over a century.  One example: when Haken and Appel needed referees to check their paper, one of them was a mathematician who was bitterly disappointed that his own proof had not scooped them.  His work as a referee proved to be conscientious and constructive.  This may be a tale of a proof that only a computer could crack, but it is a handsome human success story.make the final conquest of the problem seem like a team effort that has been conducted for over a century.

Evelyn Waugh admired him, and his books were at the bedside of Eudora Welty.  P. G. Wodehouse's enormous output of books can be found in castles and cottages, and have been translated into dozens of languages; the Russian versions are particularly adored.  It is true that he doesn't appeal to everybody; I have run into many who think he just put out the same silly comedy with interchanging characters.  They are completely wrong, but we can't argue about tastes.  Barry Day and Tony Ring are two Wodehouse enthusiasts who had the bright idea of taking bits and pieces from Wodehouse's amusing letters, inserting parts of his work, and tying it all together with a very few notes as a small biography.  Their book, _P. G. Wodehouse in His Own Words_ (Overlook) is a great success, but it must be said (and they would agree, I am sure) that its success derives from page after page of quotations from the master.<br />Woodhouse had a happy early life, and loved school.  His public school values of fair play, loyalty, and honesty stuck to him all during his life, and may easily be found within his stories.  A dip in his father's fortunes made college impossible, and he entered commerce for which he was completely unfit.  He had trouble in the basics like getting to work on time.  If his supervisor was as good at dry understatement as Wodehouse was, Wodehouse might have gotten the following warning, which comes from one of his books: \\"I must ask you in future to try and synchronise your arrival at the office with that of the rest of the staff.  We aim as far as possible at the communal dead heat.\\"  What he did do with fervor was to write stories.  It was tough in the beginning, as he took a while to acquire his tone now familiar.  \\"I wrote nineteen short stories in three weeks, I just sent the stories out... (all of which, I regret to say, editors were compelled to decline owing to lack of space.  The editors regretted it, too.  They said so.)\\"  But once he found his voice, magazines and book publishers in England and in the U.S. were enthusiastic.  He crossed to the U.S., working in the theater and in Hollywood.  After being imprisoned in Nazi Germany, he settled into working his last decades in America, writing constantly, and tending his dogs and cats.  When he died in 1975, he was in the middle of a novel, and he was writing new lyrics for a musical _Kissing Time_ that he had written in 1918.  And less than two months before, he had been given his knighthood.<br />Wodehouse was not Shakespeare.  (\\"Shakespeare's stuff is different from mine, but that is not to say that it is inferior.\\")  His plots can be clever, his characters unbelievable dolts (as is Bertie Wooster, but as is not the invaluable Jeeves), but his expressions guarantee a smile, and possibly a guffaw, on every page.  \\"The Sergeant of Police... was calm, stolid and ponderous, giving the impression of being constructed of some form of suet.\\"  \\"I don't suppose he makes enough out of a novel to keep a midget in doughnuts for a week.  Not a really healthy midget.\\"  \\"I've seen worse shows than this turned into hits.  All it wants is a new book and lyrics and a different score.\\"  \\"I was in musical comedy.  I used to sing in the chorus, till they found out where the noise was coming from.\\"  Day and Ring seem to have read every Wodehouse book with total recall to find comments on butlers, golf, America, clubs, and the clergy.  Even displaced from his daffy plots and characters, the many quotations here provide spiffing entertainment, and will remind even the best of fans that it is always a good time to get reacquainted with Lord Emsworth, Gussie Fink-Nottle, Aunt Agatha, Psmith, the Mulliners, and all the rest of the balmy crew.nes and book publishers in England and in the U.S. were enthusiastic.

The painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was one such legendary achievement, one that is momentarily glimpsed by the thousands of viewers who file beneath it every day.  There is too much to see on one such visit, of course; the painting took four agonizing years of work, and is full of detail that could not be appreciated from floor level.  The most famous modern tribute to the work was the 1965 film _The Agony and the Ecstasy_, in which Charleton Heston was depicted spending months in solitary labor, flat on his back on a scaffold.  Don't believe all the history Hollywood teaches.  In _Michelangelo &amp; the Pope's Ceiling_ (Walker), Ross King has corrected the image, and has done a great deal more.  Michelangelo was literally a Renaissance man, and also dabbled in architecture.  He himself designed the platform and scaffolding that would bring the chapel ceiling into his reach.  It was fastened to the chapel walls, so that masses could continue unobstructed beneath it, and it was not so close that he had to scoot around on his back in a narrow crawlspace.  He stood on the platform, head back, arms up, to paint; it still sounds remarkably uncomfortable, and Michelangelo even wrote a poem about the torments.  Another myth is that he worked alone; he did paint much of the huge fresco himself, but he had assistants working on other parts, not to mention handling the jobs of conveying materials up and down and plastering.<br />There is still plenty heroic in the achievement, though.  As the title suggests, there is a good deal here about the artist and his relationship to the patron for this particular project, Pope Julius II, who was not an easy man to work for.  Known as &quot;_il papa terribile_&quot; by his contemporaries, he might well be classed among the bad popes.  Julius advocated getting funds by the selling of indulgences.  He was vindictive, irritable, and addicted to fine food, wine, and women.  Michelangelo was an accomplished sculptor, not a painter, and fled to Florence when Julius wanted him to do the ceiling.  Eventually he relented, and had to learn from the start the difficulties of fresco technique (well described here).  As the years of work progressed, his technique progressed, too, so that his final scenes are masterpieces of dramatic foreshortening.  A case can be made that Michelangelo's work changed painting forever.<br />King has described the interplay between these two titans well, and makes the argument that one of the reasons they so often clashed was that they had matching temperaments of being headstrong, cocky, and pushy.  The book is excellent in giving the history and atmosphere of the tempestuous times they lived in, following Julian off to war and Michelangelo off to visits with his forever troubling family.  There is, however, another partner in the drama.  Raphael was also hired by the pope for frescos of panels in the papal apartments while Michelangelo did the huge, elevated, more public chapel ceiling.  Raphael was charming, cultivated, handsome, upper-class, pleasure-loving, and sociable.  Michelangelo was suspicious, surly, ugly and uncouth; he did not care about food, and his personal habits and cleanliness were atrocious even in a time when a once-a-week bath was thought overdoing it.  Needless to say, they didn't like each other, but once the Sistine ceiling had been unveiled, Raphael understood immediately the mastery it displayed.  Raphael was good at composition, at depicting details of faces and gestures, but with a sculptor's eye, Michelangelo had produced figures that were full of power and realism.  Raphael thereupon depicted Michelangelo within his own fresco, _The School of Athens_, where he presides as the philosopher Heraclitus, the disciple of eternal change.

Fields is, \\"Any man who hates dogs and children can't be all bad.\\" The trouble is, it wasn't said by him. It was said about him by, of all things, an anthropologist who was studying the motion picture industry. And it was not close to true about Fields. Among the many pleasing revelations in _W. C. Fields: A Biography_ (Knopf) by James Curtis is that Fields was not inimical to children. Oh, he didn't like dogs very much, but he owned a few and didn't put up objections against the species. And he didn't like Baby Leroy, the child co-star most associated with him. The [child] was terrified by Fields's appearance and could burst into tears at any scene, and it does seem to be true that Fields spiked the nipper's orange juice with gin to make him more a trouper. But throughout Fields's life he was partial to children. Will Rogers's son remembered Fields as a guest for dinner, both because he took time to talk to the boy, and because he juggled the brand new imported glass plates for his entertainment; his mother was not as well pleased. Watching kids at an Indian reservation play ball, he saw them using a wad of tape for a ball and a stick for a bat; he had an Indian pal buy full equipment, but warned, \\"If you tell a soul I did this, ...I'll never supply you with any more booze.\\" He ingratiated himself to young Freddie Bartholomew, who played David Copperfield as a boy, by asking, \\"Tell me, son, are you a midget or am I overgrown?\\"<br />The stories about Fields and children are scattered throughout this large and detailed volume. It might be that they were a reaction against his own childhood, but that childhood was not as bad as he liked to make it seem. He early discovered he had a genius for juggling, and began imitating the comic tramp juggler acts he would see on the vaudeville circuit. He began talking more during the performances, conquering a stammer and forming a habit of ad libs that was to be a blessing and a curse throughout his career. He did less juggling as he worked in more legitimate theater, like the Ziegfeld Follies in which he performed from 1915 - 1925. He concentrated on sketches that emphasized physical comedy and his perpetual warfare against inanimate objects, like the family car, twisted pool cues and floppy golf clubs. Such performances were incorporated into his films, the best of which often were only excuses for a series of sketches. He had done some silent films, but worked in Hollywood full time starting when he was all of fifty-one years old. He had strong friendships, but a terrible marriage. His death at age 66 in 1946 was hastened by the alcohol he loved; he had drunk very moderately while his juggling act depended on superb coordination. His intake became legendary, and a part of his persona, and a recurrent joke that he himself enjoyed. He did not, though, play drunks on screen, however much the characters imbibed, and he was ashamed of those who let alcohol degrade their film work.<br />This is a thorough and engrossing biography of an American character who still matters. Not only are there detailed descriptions of life on the theatrical road and the difficulties of motion picture production in the 1940s, but there are insights into many of the characters with whom Fields worked. Memorable among these is Edgar Bergen, a shy and reticent man, who used his wooden alter ego, Charlie McCarthy to insult others and fight battles. The famous Fields - McCarthy radio duels are here shown to be surprisingly personal. There have been few Hollywood performers who have deliberately perverting such American ideals as industriousness and generosity; screen comics now may be tasteless, but they are not subversive. Fields risked pushing his audience away with all manner of not just exaggerated shortcomings but also vices, and allowed his comic creations to be held inseparable from his own personality. There is no one else who could have put the holiday advertisement in _Variety_, as he did in 1928: \\"Happy New Year to almost everybody.\\"y_, as he did in 1928: \\"Happy New Year to almost everybody.\\"	2003-04-21

It is the first time you will be able to find the book in English.  Moulton has heard claims that the book was published under the titles _The Love Academy_ and _Dialogue on Diddling_ (the latter credited to \\"Sir Hotspur Dunderpate\\"), but he has found no copies, and says that the mere titles indicate the translations were faulty.  Here is his explanation of the title, an interesting view of the translator's problems, and although the book is full of earthy language, this is as raw as it will get in this review: \\"The dialogue's title is deliberately rude and provocative: it comes from the Italian word _cazzo_, a slang term for 'penis.'\\"  He goes on: \\"The closest English rendering is probably 'cockery' - but that is too close to 'cookery' to be useful in translation.\\"<br />Moulton's introduction and notes are an enormous help, as _La Cazzaria_ is a peculiar production.  As in the fashion of so many academic writings of the time, from Galileo to Aretino, it is in the form of a dialogue.  The elder participant, the instructor, and probably the alter ego of the author, is Arsiccio, who takes the youth Sodo under instruction, as Arsiccio has been embarrassed by a public display of Sodo's lack of sexual knowledge.  The problem is that Sodo is not going to gain a great deal of factual knowledge from the words here.  Vignali presents a mock-scholarly book, whose humorous lessons will remind many of Erasmus's words in praise of folly.  (The other writer who comes to mind is Rabelais, although this flamboyant book has him beat for consistent crudity and fascination for sexual themes.)  The dialogue has marginal headings, like any good scholastic work, to introduce major questions, only here they are ribald; among the less profane are, \\"Why It Is Dishonorable to Attack from Behind,\\" \\"Why Women Are Disproportioned and Fat Below the Waist,\\" and \\"Why Women Take Little Steps.\\"  Arsiccio is, to put it mildly, a misogynist.  He also doesn't think much of the church, or the practice of confession.<br />Vignali was obviously a highly educated man; his references to classical texts are frequent, even if sometimes they are jovial or deliberately fraudulent.  The latter half of the dialogue is devoted to a classical (if facetious) form of argument in which the body is seen as the analogue to a political state.  We speak of the \\"body politic\\" and the \\"head of state\\" because these analogies have been present for a couple of thousand years, but it is significant that in Vignali's parable, there is no head; the body parts involved are, as may be guessed, significantly lower.  The meaning of the political allegory in reference to Siena in the 1520's is explained by Moulton in his introduction, but can be enjoyed for its pure silliness and ribald fun.  _La Cazzaria_ is a unique text, full of oddities and erudition, and we are lucky to have it available after all these centuries.here they are ribald; among the less profane are, \\"Why It Is Dishonorable to Attack from Behind,\\" \\"Why Women Are Disproportioned and Fat Below the Waist,\\" and \\"Why Women Take Little Steps.\\"  Arsiccio is, to put it mildly, a misogynist.

Science also needs theoreticians to make comprehensive explanations of the data.  In _Tycho & Kepler: The Unlikely Partnership that Forever Changed Our Understanding of the Universe_ (Walker), Kitty Ferguson has given a duel biography of exemplars from both aspects, two who founded modern astronomy.  This was a peculiar and unlikely partnership, more of shared data than of friendship or cooperation.  The story, however, is a fascinating one of detail within the Copernican revolution, and of the difficulties of doing science within the religions and politics of the time.<br />Tycho was a Danish nobleman, and was not supposed to have a career, much less a scientific one.  His pursuit of documentation of the heavens was a rebellious break with the traditions of his society.  He began keeping a logbook of astronomical observations when he was sixteen years old, and complained even then of the inaccuracy of the tables which were supposed to tell planetary positions.  He also railed about the imprecision of the cross staff by which angular distance between stars was measured.  Tycho was not satisfied with the Copernican system, although he knew the Earth-centered Ptolemaic one was wrong.  He proposed the \\"Tychonic\\" system, wherein the Sun orbited the Earth, and the other planets orbited the Sun.  He was welcomed by Emperor Rudolf II of the Holy Roman Empire, who supported him in making a new observatory in Prague, but he died only four years later.  Kepler's start was far different.  Born near Stuttgart in 1571 into a peculiar and unnurturing commoner family, he was essentially rescued by the church.  The Protestants were urging the importance of schooling, and he originally wanted to become a Lutheran minister.  However, he became interested in the ideas of Copernicus, and became a mathematician and mathematics teacher in Graz.  Religious persecution drove him out of Graz, and Tycho extended an invitation to join him in Prague.  The invitation resulted in a year of stormy misunderstandings.  The odd couple argued constantly, and Kepler at one point walked out.  Tycho did not always show magnanimity, but in this case he relented, and became a little more generous with data.  Only after Tycho's death did Kepler get all the data he needed, to start making his epochal laws of planetary movement.  Kepler, building on Tycho's data, was one of the giants on whose shoulders Newton was to stand, giving us calculus and modern physics and cosmology.<br />Both Tycho and Kepler were largely working in a vacuum; there was no set scientific tradition for them to be working in, and at times they were more highly valued for their expertise in astrology; though both of them knew astronomy was more valuable, astrology sometimes paid the bills.  Getting financial support from kingdoms was difficult and unreliable; at one point Ferguson writes, \\"Rudolph lavished praise on Kepler and granted him a bonus of two thousand talers, which would have been splendid had it been paid.\\"  Not only were they working against a religious tradition, but they were operating in societies ruled largely by religion and superstition.  Kepler was extremely devout, but was chivied from place to place in his later years because he refused to insist on religious requirements for others.  Kepler's mother herself was tried for witchcraft.  Locating Tycho and Kepler firmly within their religious and political milieus, and demonstrating the enormous difficulty of doing science in their time, and in getting appreciation and support, Ferguson has given a wonderfully complex picture of the partnership of two main founders of astronomy.The invitation resulted in a year of stormy misunderstandings.

We celebrate athletes of strength, agility, and skill.  We do not celebrate nerds, who not only do not win, but do not compete.  As the twentieth century was closing, though, nerds who had a special fascination for electromechanical gadgets had a previously impossible sport in which to show creativity, cunning, and a killer instinct.  &quot;Gearheads&quot; these particular nerds were called, and their games were played under the names of &quot;Robot Wars,&quot; &quot;Battlebots,&quot; &quot;Robotica&quot; and others.  While it remains to be seen if this revolutionary form of competition will be long-lasting, the sport has had a colorful beginning and plenty of people interested in it as spectacle.  _Gearheads: The Turbulent Rise of Robotic Sports_ (Simon &amp; Schuster) by Brad Stone is a funny, sad, and weird account of how these metal crunching monsters compete, and how greed and litigation ruins dreams.<br />It is important to realize that the robots described herein are not necessarily machines that we would think of as robots.  The gearheads' robots are manipulated by a controller in the same way that hobbyists operate radio controlled cars.  But for competition, RC Car Joust didn't sound nearly as good as Robot Wars, and so the inventor of this competition,  Marc Thorpe, expanded the definition.  He was interested in starting a commercial venture that would give his family a sound future, and had been intrigued with machines that did performance art and some primitive mechanical jousting.  Unfortunately for Thorpe, he had to find a backer.  His partner, Steve Plotnicki, surely had the money; he was a record executive who had been responsible for such acts as the seminal rappers Run DMC.  The eager but naïve Thorpe didn't check much into Plotnicki's record, which included vituperative litigation against his former stars.  _Gearheads_ is largely about the legal battles that followed, and they are as vicious as any of the buzz saw, pneumatic ram, and knife battles that took place in the Robot Wars ring.  The legal battles are long, and sad, but more entertaining are the description of the gearheads themselves, and the way they participated in a hobby that turned into an obsession for many of them.  One of them says, &quot;The thrill is hard to describe.  It's better than fishing, a whole lot better than baseball.  It's fighting and it's not fighting.  It's just boys at play.&quot;<br />Along the way, Stone describes the decades of violent and very noisy, not to mention illegal, robotic performance art spectacles arranged by Mark Pauline and his Survival Research Laboratories.  Pauline was much more interested in the dadaism of destruction (and troublemaking in general) than in rule-bound competition.  Also here are Woody Flowers, the MIT teaching genius who teamed up with Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, to start FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), robot competition for high schoolers that stressed cooperation as much as competition (and thereby seems to have lost much of its entertainment punch).  Combining portraits of some very peculiar inventors, a troubling tale of lost fortunes and litigation, and amazing descriptions of battles between Spiny Norman, Blendo, Biohazard, Thor, Ziggo, Ginsu, Mechadon, and others, _Gearheads_ is fine entertainment, and might be an important documentation of a new sport's genesis.es that took place in the Robot Wars ring.

There is no more &quot;terra incognita&quot; on the maps, and ballooning, sailing, or crossing Antarctica are often reduced to webcasted stunts.  If you long to go through jungle, battling snakes and mosquitoes, to find previously undiscovered ancient sites, Hugh Thomson can tell you were to go: Peru.  In fact, twenty years ago, he was working in a pub, and a drinker there told him a story involving an Inca fortress that had been discovered, but was so poorly documented, it had gotten lost again.  &quot;Not only was it a glamorous idea, it was, unlike most of those told in the pub, a true story.&quot;  Finding that ruin seemed more attractive than continuing to tend bar: &quot;I had nothing to lose.  So I went.&quot;  This is the start of the story of Thomson's _The White Rock: An Exploration of the Inca Heartland_ (Overlook Press).  It is no surprise that in this lively and intelligent exploration memoir, Thomson does re-discover the re-lost archeological site, but it is surprising that this is only the first part of the book, not the climax.  By the time the book has finished, he has hiked to many lost cities in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, and reviewed the remarkably complicated Inca history all along the way.<br />Of course the book is full of recountings of mistakes and scares, from embarrassingly split pants to humorous misunderstandings between the gringos and the natives (including a young girl who precipitously falls in love with the author).  This is not a how-to manual, but those preparing to explore the area would do well to heed Thomson's words on snakes, guinea pigs, gnats, pack mules, and especially, guides.  Much of the book is not just a history of the Incas, but a history of exploration of Inca sites.  There are fine summary portraits here of an assortment of strange characters who have trekked some of these paths before Thomson.  A prime one was Hiram Bingham, the discoverer of Machu Picchu, who thought erroneously that it was a religious monument to the Virgins of the Sun.  This has sparked a lot of New Age nonsense.  It was a winter camp for the Inca court, and Thomson's own view of the exalted position of Machu Picchu is simply that the Incas had a fondness, just as we do, for magnificent mountain views.<br />Thomson's exhilarating and self-deprecatingly humorous account of his own travels vies with the ancient history and modern history revealed here.  All are expertly told.  Thomson follows a trail of Inca history to the almost forgotten site of Vilcabamba, still unexcavated and obscured by thick vegetation.  It was the last remnant of the great Inca Empire.  Digressions of descriptions of the modern towns he goes through, and a welcome appreciation of the great Cuzco photographer Martin Chambi, are easy bypaths on the way.  The book has excellent maps, a glossary of terms from the Spanish and the local Quechua language, and an genealogical chart of the Inca emperors.

If you want to spend a little time learning how mathematicians think about the lowly subject of knots, there is now a little book with good illustrations and explanations that may go over the heads of most people, but nonetheless demonstrates the high degree of effort in this mathematical field.  _Knots: Mathematics with a Twist_ (Harvard) by Alexei Sossinsky (who is a professor of mathematics at the University of Moscow; this work is translated by Giselle Weiss) demonstrates well the complexity of a field that might at first seem unpromising but actually has important relevance to the real world.<br />The diagrams here, and there are many of them, are a great help.  You could make your knot cross over and under an infinite number of different ways.  But how different, and how can you tell the difference between one knot and another?  There is, according to Sossinsky, no algorithm that works in every case of classification, not even an algorithm that can be taught to a computer.  This is true even though the attempts at classification, with graphic or symbolic notation which cannot be reproduced here, are quite complicated.  So, being able to tell one knot from another is the as yet unattained Holy Grail of knot theory.  Interestingly, if you tie a knot, however simple, into a string, you cannot tie another knot, however complicated, into the string so that one knot will, when it meets the other, untie the string.  The proof of the impossibility of one knot canceling out another is nicely sketched here.  The chapters here are written more-or-less independently of one another, so that if one stumps you, you can try the next with a clean slate.  For needed relief, Sossinsky has put in digressions (and labeled some of them as such) which any reader ought to be able to enjoy, like the one about the slime eel that knots itself for defenses (left trefoil knot).  Some of the coincidences between knots, algebra, quantum theory, and other disparate lines of thought are really quite lovely, and indicate once again that no one knows where research in pure mathematics may lead or how practical it may turn out to be.<br />Sossinsky has a witty style, and acknowledges how strange this mathematical world must be for visitors.  At one point in demonstrating the procedure for composing a knot from primes, he parenthetically says of the task of making a rigorous definition of what he has described intuitively, \\"I will leave to the reader already corrupted by the study of mathematics the task.\\"  He is a genial guide to a strange land.er ought to be able to enjoy, like the one about the slime eel that knots itself for defenses (left trefoil knot).

However, it can be argued that the films made right after the advent of sound provided more realism and more to think about than movies before or since.  In a vital and entertaining study, _Dangerous Men: Pre-Code Hollywood and the Birth of the Modern Man_ (Thomas Dunne), Mick LaSalle lovingly analyzes the films and movie heroes from around 1929 until 1934 when censorship took over.  Those interested in the history of film, and in learning more about giants like Cagney and Gable, as well as about important but forgotten former stars like Richard Barthelmess and Warren William, will find this book irresistible.  After 1934, it was a long while before American films were made without a censor able to clip scenes, and LaSalle demonstrates that the pre-censorship (or \\"pre-Code\\") era was a time for realism as well as idealism in the movies.<br />LaSalle demonstrates that silent films were really productions of the Victorian era; men were expected to have sobriety and character.  World War I, Prohibition, and the Great Depression changed all that.  There was a deluge of pre-Code gangster movies, and every major actor played a gangster, even Spencer Tracy and Boris Karloff.  The gangster movies, and the war movies, provided a new look at how a person might live in the world and live with himself; there was a good deal of introspection within the characters displayed on screen that would vanish when the Code came into force.  Along with serious evaluation of such moral matters, pre-Code movies were full of pacifism.  Repeatedly the young idealistic heroes go into battle only to be shocked at the destruction they themselves have wrought.  These movies exalted individuality and distrust of governments that led citizens into pointless wars.  Pre-Code films emphasized the heroism of getting wise and taking care of oneself, not the heroism of battles and bugles.  There is a good brief history of Code censorship here, showing the role of the Catholic Legion of Decency and its regrettable effects.  Not only did the Code enforcers impose wholesomeness on future movies, they insisted that when the pre-Code films were re-released they be re-cut into more acceptable form.  Sadly, sometimes the censored version of a pre-Code film is all that remains.  It was not until the ratings system came in 1968 that the Code was dismantled.<br />Partly LaSalle's book is a warning, and one especially pointed now that certain forces within the government find censorship in various forms appealing.  LaSalle has enormous admiration for the films described here, but says, \\"Even vitality such as this can be squelched if a close-minded faction is obsessed, pernicious, and willing to organize.\\"  He has seen a lot more of these pre-Code pictures than his readers have, but anyone who enjoys the movies will be eager to take a look at these films after reading this book.  Pre-Code films showed war brutality, governmental corruption, and harnessing courage to subvert the system.  LaSalle writes, \\"These may be healthy things for individuals to know, but they aren't what governments like to see pumped into the public consciousness.\\"ship here, showing the role of the Catholic Legion of Decency and its regrettable effects.

Darwin made them famous, of course, as a spark for his initial insights on evolution.  The specks of land on the equator, off mainland Ecuador,  have continued to perform as observatories for evolution.  The tiny islands, burned by volcanoes and equatorial sun, have far more life than such an environment might seem able to support, but besides the famous and unusual bird species, there are hundreds of species of starfish, eighty species of spiders, and many others.  If you watch TV documentaries or leaf through photo books, you get a flavor of just how rich and strange the life there is.  You might know that the animals are so unused to humans that they have not learned to flee even hunters.  You might have the idea that the deserted islands harbor but a few scientists and the ecotourists who come to see the unique offerings. _Plundering Paradise: The Hand of Man on the Galapagos Islands_ (HarperCollins) by Michael D'Orso offers a different view of the islands, specifically about one of its newest and most intrusive species.  There are about  20,000 humans who make the Galapagos their home, or at least their workplace.  They are not just scientists, but hoteliers, nightclub owners, poachers, beggars, religious proselytizers, law enforcers, and more.  The title of this eye-opening book isn't a surprise; all these people are not doing the islands any good.<br />\\"These islands were simply not made for people,\\" D'Orso writes, but he has interviewed a lot of them for this book to portray humans that are making a go of it anyway.  Some of them are eccentric, some admirable, but the islands are few, and have desirable properties, and surpassing written law, the law of supply and demand holds sway (just as Darwin knew).  Humans have a poor record of improving the lands they have inhabited everywhere, but D'Orso is withering in particular scorn for the corrupt Ecuadorian government, colloquially called \\"Absurdistan.\\"  Such an environment only encourages people to grab any profits they can, and makes impossible long range planning for conserving the islands' resources.  Global agencies are reluctant to invest as they can predict how little money would make it to environmental improvement.  There has been a proposal that the Galapagos should be under UN trusteeship; after all, it is one of those sites that requires little imagination to view as belonging to the heritage of all humans.  From time to time someone suggests banning tourism.  Neither proposal is likely to impress those who are currently gaining incomes from things as they stand.<br />D'Orso's book brings an important problem to light.  It is written as an entertaining profile of different members of the human species who have washed ashore on Galapagos.  There are the ex-hippie who has run a hotel there for thirty-five years, the German recluse, the park ranger who endangers himself by hunting poachers, the charmingly corrupt mayor, the Jehovah's Witness naturalist guide, and more.  In describing their activities, he has given a human profile to the islands.  It is a sad look, nonetheless.

Chances are you can't name a thing the kings Aethelred or Alfred the Great did in their reigns.  Chances are you never heard of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, or his wife Godgifu.  Undoubtedly, though, you have heard of Godgifu under the name by which she has come down to us, Godiva.  You might know her chocolates better than her legend these days, but even on the chocolate box, she rides naked on her horse; a legend like that can never die.  The life of the legend is traced in _Lady Godiva: A Literary History of the Legend_ (Blackwell Publishing) by Daniel Donoghue.  Godiva has been, and will continue to be, more than a hawker of confections, and this summary of the life of the real Godiva, the origin and transformations of her legend, and the use to which her story has been put, makes clear Godiva's importance.<br />Godgifu was pious and generous, especially to the local convents and monasteries.  She did nothing that would have made her famous; there is no history that hints of anything resembling the legend, which was only first written down over two centuries after her death.  She saved the people of Coventry from taxation by fulfilling her husband's \\"impossible\\" condition that she ride naked through the town.  The tale that the villagers agreed to keep their windows shut and not look, except for Peeping Tom the tailor who was thereupon struck blind, is a later addition.  Peeping Tom didn't even get that name until the seventeenth century.  Godiva became a star of processions through Coventry, processions that had previously featured religious items like transubstantiated bread.  Donoghue takes us through bad ballads and Tennyson's poem, to Victoria's enthusiasm for the legend, and to the takes on Lady Godiva by Dr. Freud and Dr. Seuss.<br />It is clear that Godiva still rides, but her identity has changed for our times.  Donoghue shows how the legend has lost the story that concentrated on Godiva's virtue and generosity.  There is now no heroism and no coercion.  She paraded herself naked, and is understood these days as an exhibitionist.  Peeping Tom is only infrequently associated with her legend, and is more a part of legal issues than folklore.  Donoghue also explains the attraction of medieval legends in general; Dungeons and Dragons and Harry Potter are part of popular medievalism, which is booming.  Serious medieval studies, concerning how this part of our past has been viewed by successive centuries, are still vibrant in academia.  This study of a particular legend, clear, serious, and comprehensive, lets Godiva ride on in new intellectual exposure.a's virtue and generosity.  There is now no heroism and no coercion.

In the early 1990s, there weren't many rules, and commercial use of the Web had not taken it over.  In 1995, an anarchic group of seven Swiss artists started the site [...]  In 1997, a billion-dollar firm to sell toys via the internet started up, registering as [...]  Two years later, eToys sued etoy for damaging the eToys trademark.  The resulting fracas is told in an entertaining story that is not just a dot-com bust parable, _Leaving Reality Behind: etoy vs eToys.com & Other Battles to Control Cyberspace_ (Ecco) by Adam Wishart and Regula Bochsler.  The earnestness and foolishness and greed herein described are universal; the contemporary surroundings of this tale, however, have much to tell us about the founding philosophy of the internet and its commercial future.<br />The artists involved in etoy had worked on collaborative digital art projects, and developed their site as a parody of internet business.  They issued shares, and strangely, the share certificates were art works on their own; etoy did not manufacture toys or anything, but it did sell shares, and the shares (or art) did sell.  They mocked executive appearances, adopting orange flight jackets, black pants, and shaved heads as uniforms.  They intended to be \\"the First Street Gang of the Information Super Data Highway.\\"  Official company communications were signed, \\"etoy, leaving reality behind.\\"  Of course, commercial dot-coms were leaving reality behind in their own fashion.  The story of eToys is told just as fully in this book as that of etoy, and it is just as strange.  eToys was one of the first companies that emerged from idealab!, a business that was going to produce businesses just like McDonald produced hamburgers.  eToys was supposed to beat Toys-R-Us by making it easy to shop without the brats.  In 1999, the all important Initial Public Offering of eToys stock was made, amid furious excitement built up over the previous months, but eToys was in big trouble.  That didn't stop it from trying to crush the annoying etoy gang.  Even after a judge granted an injunction to shut down etoy, etoy wasn't weren't going to give in, and netizens all over began a \\"Toywar\\" to \\"Save etoy now!\\"  A year after doing all the bullying, eToys was bankrupt.<br />Wishart and Bochsler not only have written a fun and rather exciting tale full of interesting characters, but they have also given a capsule history of the internet.  There are detours here to explain the origins of the Web itself, and how different coding standards were developed to tie all our computers together.  The first search engines are here, and the mechanics of the organizations who are supposed to control web names.  This is an amusing story, and the book will be an excellent reference for those in the future who want to understand what the beginning internet was like and what the dot-com boom-and-bust was all about.blic Offering of eToys stock was made, amid furious excitement built up over the previous months, but eToys was in big trouble.

If you know one cartographer, it is probably Mercator, and you probably only know his last name because of his ingenious projection to make a flat map of our spheroid Earth.  Gerard Mercator was a mild and modest man, less interested in making a name for himself than in improving knowledge of our planet.  It was for others of his era within the bustling sixteenth century to cross the seas and bring back riches, and more importantly, geographical data.  Mercator himself never even approached an ocean, his exploring restricted mostly to libraries and obscure reports from those who made the voyages.  He never had a biography in English until Nicholas Crane produced _Mercator: The Man Who Mapped the Planet_ (Henry Holt).  The life of the cartographer is integrated with the tumultuous military, political, and meteorological events around him, for an engaging look at an original thinker.<br />Mercator was born as Gerard Kremer to poor parents (his father was a cobbler) in Flanders in 1512.  He was fortunate in being helped in his education, and became an apprentice to a maker of instruments and globes.  His engraving into copperplate was beautiful and influential.  In 1537, Mercator published his first map, a portrait of the Holy Land.  Four years later, he made his first terrestrial globe, and Crane makes understandable how huge such a project was.  Making the lens-shaped map papers to glue onto the sphere may have inspired Mercator to calculate his projection, a map that was to be an aid to navigators ever after.  Mercator lived in a tumultuous time, and his moderate views, shared with the humanists, about such things as faith in Christ being more important than ritualistic ceremony, were considered heretical by others.  In 1544, he was actually imprisoned for seven months for alleged Lutheran sympathies (charged with &quot;_lutherye_&quot;).  He remained busy until the end of his long life, during the final three decades of which he worked on a book of maps of lands all over the world which was only completed by his grandsons.  There had been other such books, but Mercator's was more comprehensive.  It was also more influential; he named it after a Titan of Roman mythology, and ever since, any book of maps has been called an atlas.<br />We are less surprised by maps than those in Mercator's time; we have instantaneous satellite pictures of the world, whenever we want them, and _terra incognita_ continues to dwindle.  Everyone recognizes the true silhouettes of continents.  There was a time when such knowledge was still new, and tentative.  Crane has written about the many influences on his subject within this complicated historical period, and has produced a remarkably full portrait.  Mercator assimilated information and made a new picture of the world, a picture now familiar to us all.  His influence is not even confined to the Earth he served so well; when the Mariner missions mapped Mars, the resultant charts were Mercator projections.of which he worked on a book of maps of lands all over the world which was only completed by his grandsons.

Crane has written about the many influences on his subject within this complicated historical period, and has produced a remarkably full portrait.  Mercator assimilated information and made a new picture of the world, a picture now familiar to us all.  His influence is not even confined to the Earth he served so well; when the Mariner missions mapped Mars, the resultant charts were Mercator projections.	2003-03-24

This is the surprising assertion compendiously documented in _Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation_ (Zone Books) by Thomas W. Laqueur.  Of course, that's an exaggeration, because since our primate cousins masturbate, we probably did so from our earliest beginnings.  But in 1712, there was a shift in thinking about masturbation which brought it to the forefront of reform by moralists, physicians, and other do-gooders.  Laqueur's book scrupulously documents the writings on the subject before, during, and after the big change.  He admits, \\"Potentially autarkic solitary sexual pleasure touches the inner lives of modern humanity in ways we still do not understand.\\"  This may be so, but this large and yet sprightly history must increase the understanding of a covert but universal activity.<br />The ancients were nearly silent on the subject.  Galen said that masturbation was a method of simply getting rid of excess sperm.  In Jewish law, spilling seminal fluid was much debated by the rabbis.  The only reference in the Bible that could relate specifically to masturbation does not.  Christianity has sometimes used Onan's crime as an injunction against masturbation, although the wiser commentators note that masturbation was not Onan's violation (coitus interruptus, and thereby refraining from being fruitful and multiplying, was).  Early Christian teaching was that masturbation was nonreproductive, and was thus to be avoided, but it was not a big source of worry.  But then John Marten produced his masterwork; his authorship is revealed here for the first time.  Marten was a quack who had written on venereal disease and had been clapped in irons for such an obscenity.  In 1712, he published _Onania; or, The Heinous Sin of Self Pollution and all its Frightful Consequences_, and masturbation was never to be the same.  Marten's book was a big advertisement for Marten's potions, which would cure the horrid vice.  Marten's new anxiety filled a need, which Laqueur shows was due to the philosophy of the enlightenment.  It was not until well into the twentieth century that physicians stopped blaming masturbation for all sorts of illness, and now it is advocated as part of self-discovery.  The famous sex shop Good Vibrations declares every May to be National Masturbation Month, and the poster last year had the slogan, \\"Think Globally, Masturbate Locally.\\"<br />Those who want warnings on the evils of the practice can still find many religious leaders who will oblige them.  Laqueur closes this comprehensive study, which is academic but entertaining, with the incident of Joycelyn Elders, who was surgeon general until 1995, when she answered a reporter's question saying that sex education should include teaching about masturbation.  In the minds of some moral persons, this seemed equivalent to teaching techniques of masturbation.  She had not previously pleased them with her outspoken views on AIDS or pre-marital sex, but she used the M word, causing a rift with that moral beacon, President Clinton, who said that her view of the benefits of masturbation reflected \\"differences with administration policy.\\"  While it amused many that there was an administration policy on masturbation, Elders was out, and the two century legacy of quack John Marten continued.a need, which Laqueur shows was due to the philosophy of the enlightenment.

Colonel John Boyd was an American who is not famous and ought to be.  In a time when we are fighting a war on terrorism (and I am writing this as it seems inevitable that we are to have an active push into Iraq), all Americans ought to read a splendid biography of a patriot, warrior, and philosopher of war who made a difference, _Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War_ (Little, Brown) by Robert Coram.  John Boyd isn't going to have statues and memorials (although Boyd Hall at Nellis Air Force Base has been named for him), and he didn't write books.  As he would have said, he was far too busy getting things done than making a name for himself.  It is worth contemplating all that he got done.  He was the best fighter pilot in the Air Force.  He developed a theory that revolutionized air-to-air combat.  He wrote the Air Force's manual on it.  He inspired the F-16.  He read deeply on the philosophy of war, and his teachings transformed the most fighting of the services, the Marine Corps.  He was responsible for tactics in the Gulf War.  He hated the failings of the military-industrial complex, and many of those who nestled within it hated him.<br />Boyd emerged from a tough, fatherless upbringing in Erie, Pennsylvania, and entered the military as an enlisted man, taking part in the occupation of Japan immediately after World War II.  He entered the Air Force, going to Korea just at the end of the war.  At Fighter Weapons School he did so well he was invited back as an instructor.  He was known as \\"Forty Second Boyd\\": with an opponent fighter trailing him (thus all advantage to the opponent) he bet \\"forty seconds or forty bucks\\" that in forty seconds he could reverse the positions.  No one else ever won the bet.  He boned up on calculus and thermodynamics that would enable him to really understand what fighter planes do, and developed the innovative \\"energy - maneuverability\\" theory to explain fighter flight mechanics, and to compare one fighter to another.  Coram explains, \\"While still a junior officer, John Boyd changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights.\\"  Assigned to the Pentagon, he made lots of enemies, and made secure friends, men proud to be called his \\"acolytes.\\"  It is a tribute to Coram's brisk writing that even the parts of the book that have to do with Boyd's \\"Fighter Mafia's\\" iconoclastic views of fighter design and battles for funding are fun; of course, part of the energy comes from the unconventional way Boyd fought such battles.  After he retired, he became a consultant, but not the sort of consultant that signs on to a lucrative spot within the suppliers of materiel to the military.  Having been a fighter pilot, and engineer, he moved himself into becoming a scholar, deeply reading in Sun Tzu and Clausewitz.  His philosophy of war has changed the Marine Corps, and won as a convert then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who implemented Boyd's recommendations into the Gulf War.  Over the objections of the generals, of course.<br />This astonishing man, like many others who put all their efforts into their work, was a terrible father and husband.  Coram admits that the \\"part of his legacy that concerns his family is embarrassing and shameful.\\"  This biography is admiring, but unfawning.  Coram has wonderful anecdotes to tell, and often slips for effect into the sort of profanity that Boyd favored.

For the rest of us who live in a Newtonian world, all sorts of weird things happen at the atomic scale, things that are too weird ever to be explained.  A photon, the basic particle of light, when fired at a screen with two holes in it goes through both holes at once.  Not only that, the photon particle isn't a particle at all, but a strange amalgam of particle and wave.  A quantum entity can not only be two places at once, it can have two opposite characteristics at once (like opposite directions of spin), and it only settles on one of those characteristics when you look at it closely.  Einstein had imbued the universe with his own share of weirdness related to speed of light travel, but he could never accept the weirdness of quantum theory.  As physicist David Greenberger remarked, &quot;Einstein said that if quantum mechanics was correct then the world would be crazy.  Einstein was right - the world is crazy.&quot;  Crazy or not, quantum theory has turned out to be correct, experimentally demonstrated over and over again in the last decades, and if we aren't going ever to get used to it, we might try to get to know it better nonetheless.  At the heart of quantum physics is the mysterious phenomenon of entanglement, and in _Entanglement: The Greatest Mystery in Physics_ (Four Walls Eight Windows), Amir D. Aczel has valiantly attempted to make the phenomenon plain, and has had good success.<br />Entanglement is one of those quantum happenings that doesn't make any sense.  It involves an instantaneous change in a particle once there is a change in a another particle with which it is entangled.  The change is instantaneous, and would be even if the particles were on different sides of the solar system, or even of the universe.  Somehow one particle &quot;knows&quot; that the other is changing, but this is not information that is transmitted one to the other.  If it were information, it could not travel faster than the speed of light, but the change happens at exactly the same time.  Einstein mistrusted the idea, calling it &quot;spooky action at a distance.&quot;  He would have been amazed that such a thing was not just theoretical, but experimentally proven, and much of this book is the history of how such a experiments came to be.  The considerable physics in the book is lightened by anecdotes about the scientists involved.  Along with the anecdotes are vignettes of model cooperation between scientists helping each other try to understand, even if their views were in opposition.  Entanglement has a colorful history, well told here.<br />_Entanglement_ ends with a description of some practical applications; this is not just empty theorizing.  Teleportation, the dream of science fiction, if it ever occurs, will be done by transferring quantum states of one particle to another.  More immediately, using entangled photons as a means of sending an encoded message can reveal if anyone has tried to listen to the message.  And quantum computing may change our ideas of the limitations of what computers can do.  I predict that I, along with most people in my generation, will continue to see the world in Newtonian terms, but as future generations start using the ideas which are shown in this engaging and challenging history, perhaps they will find quantum mechanics a little less weird.er than the speed of light, but the change happens at exactly the same time.

The village within the Basque region of northern Spain was without any serious strategic import, but it was less than twenty miles away from Bilbao, a Basque stronghold, and Francisco Franco wished to threaten the Basques. At the request of Franco's rebel army, Luftwaffe planes poured bombs, percussion and incendiary, onto the village for three hours, and strafed the people trying to flee. The event was to inspire possibly the most famous painting of the twentieth century, and the painting was to sear the events in Guernica into the world's memory. The story of the history that made the painting and the painting that made history is dramatically told in _Picasso's War: The Destruction of Guernica, and the Masterpiece that Changed the World_ (Dutton) by Russell Martin. It is a great story of art and history, and it is told here with earnest verve.<br />Picasso didn't like the idea of a commission for a big mural, and although he fully supported the Spanish Republican forces in their efforts against Franco's fascism, he was not interested in making what he knew would be a piece of propaganda. He had never visited the Basque country, but once he heard of the attack, he began sketches for the commission. It was not immediately accepted as a masterpiece, although the partisans of the Spanish Republican cause were, of course, enthusiastic. It wound up at the commencement of World War II in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it would be a showpiece for more than forty years. Picasso made clear that the Spanish Republican government had paid for the painting and it thus belonged to the people of a democratic Spain, but he stipulated that democracy and freedom had to be restored before it returned. After Franco's death, and after serious legal tangles, possibly because the museum wanted to hold on to the painting as long as possible, the painting was sent to the Prado museum in Madrid in 1981. The national newspaper had the headline THE WAR HAS ENDED.<br />That might have been so, but controversy over the painting and the locale it deserves has not ended. It was moved to another Madrid museum, probably its permanent home, but many Basques believe that it needs to be closer to the rebuilt Guernica village. Hope for such a move peaked when the Bilbao museum was built. The architect, Frank Gehry, even showed the Spanish king and queen the wall on which _Guernica_ should be installed. Having the painting return to Spain helped to heal the years of repression, and perhaps sending it to Bilbao would heal the wounds between Basques and Spaniards; it is not impossible that the famous painting still has work to do. But Martin reminds us that Picasso said, \\"Wars end, but hostilities endure forever.\\" Martin was researching his fine book, and looking at the painting himself, when other museum visitors hinted that as an American he ought to get to a television. It was 11 September 2001, and the world has not fully learned _Guernica_'s lesson.museum in Madrid in 1981.

The convent had been one of the grandest of thirty-odd Venetian convents.  There is a plaque below the arch that reads, \\"Hope and love keep us in this pleasant prison.\\"  Convents were like prisons, in many ways, and many of the inhabitants were reluctant prisoners, rather than volunteers for God.  In an amazing account of convent existence and day-to-day life within, _Virgins of Venice: Broken Vows and Cloistered Lives in the Renaissance Convent_ (Viking), Mary Laven has expanded upon insights hinted at in Dava Sobel's _Galileo's Daughter_, wherein the daughter showed herself interested in science and in sending her father shirts and cookery.  Some of the nuns may have been devoted to God, but even they had to be busy with laundry, cooking, and herbal remedies to keep the convent going.  They were also not immune from gossip, laughing, friendship, and sexual intrigue.  The convents in the 16th and 17th centuries were supposed to be islands of sinlessness walled away from the outside world, but Laven shows that sinless or not, the nuns had to participate in a larger society, and inescapably took on that society's characteristics.<br />Convents were supposed to keep nuns from the outside world and vice versa.  There were veiled and grated communion windows where the nuns could line up and receive the host from the priest, without actually entering the church.  There were walls to keep nuns from public view, and to keep them from looking out upon the sinful world.  For passing things in and out of the convent, there might be a _ruota_ or wheel, a sort of revolving door that would prevent glimpses in and glimpses out.  Convents were vital to the Venetian nobility.  If a daughter could not be married, or could not be put on the marriage market with the enormous dowries Venetian law required, the convent was the one place she could go.  Most of the nuns had the \\"forced vocation\\" of the convent imposed upon them, and others were tricked into it by relatives, some within the convent, who had misrepresented the benefits of such a life.  There was stratification within the convents that mirrored society without.  The aristocratic nuns could dress as they were used to, and they kept their family names, indicating a secular identity.<br />Of course there were sexual violations; Boccaccio's tales of convent hanky-panky might have been satire, but he knew that sexuality would show itself.  _Virgins of Venice_, despite its lurid subtitle, is certainly not about sensational sex stories.  This is a work of serious scholarship, but it is humorous and compassionate.  Laven has drawn from contemporary sources, including the reports of inspections of the state magistracy that had been set up \\"to enforce the new laws that aspired to obliterate all contact - from the most innocent and inconspicuous to the flagrantly sexual - between the city's nuns and the outside world.\\"  Laven cannot support the feminist view that these enclosed women had resourcefully found a means of self-expression within their society; they were prisoners, who although they might be making the best of a bad situation, were under life sentences.  The convents were brought to an end by Napoleon; one of the remaining ones had just the architecture to serve even now as a women's prison.cation\\" of the convent imposed upon them, and others were tricked into it by relatives, some within the convent, who had misrepresented the benefits of such a life.

The drug is alcohol, and although it has been around for millennia, it was available in eighteenth century London in a new way. A history of the \\"Gin Craze\\" might seem to be an unlikely topic to produce a learned and funny book, but _Craze: Gin and Debauchery in the Age of Reason_ (Four Walls Eight Windows), by Jessica Warner, not only is full of surprising facts and statistics (peak gin use was in 1743, 2.2 gallons of gin per person, per year), but it brings a light to a murky little corner of human history that may be reflected usefully into our own times.<br />Clearly, the ruling classes of Britain realized that gin was a social evil. Of course, it was a social evil for the ruled classes, for gin became a craze among the poor of the city. Such reformers as members of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge could not fathom why gin had any appeal. Reform had to conquer inertia. The landed gentry were only too happy to have distillers as eager buyers for their surplus grain. The London Company of Distillers had friends in Parliament and was willing to keep them friendly by dishing out money. The government was glad to get excise taxes and license fees from the sales of gin. Over a 22 year period, reformers persuaded Parliament to pass eight different laws, generally ineffective, to suppress the consumption of gin. Monetary rewards were given to informers who squealed for a fee. Informers were not popular. Some were beaten to death by angry mobs, who resented that members of their own circle betrayed them. The reformers failed, because they had it backward; Warner writes, \\"It was not gin that made people poor. It was poverty that made them drink.\\"<br />As the book draws to a conclusion, the reader is likely to have reflected many times during it that it is not really about gin. Warner calls her fascinating distillation of court reports, newspaper articles, and contemporary statistical tables \\"a parable about drugs, about why some people take them and other people worry when they do.\\" Gin was merely the first urban drug, cheap, available, and able to neutralize the misery of poverty, at least temporarily. It made cities frightening to the upper and middle classes that did not live in them. Reformers exaggerated the tales of just how bad gin was, and pamphleteers were ready to spread the exaggerations. In her final chapter, she makes the breadth of her parable plain. We are \\"too easily seduced by the notion that the complex problems that come with complex places boil down to a simple and single source, be it gin, heroin or crack cocaine.\\"  Declaring a War on Drugs is facile and futile. No war on poverty has yet been universally successful, but unless something is done to relieve the poverty that makes drugs seem attractive, warring on drugs is just window dressing.Warner calls her fascinating distillation of court reports, newspaper articles, and contemporary statistical tables \\"a parable about drugs, about why some people take them and other people worry when they do.\\" Gin was merely the first urban drug, cheap, available, and able to neutralize the misery of poverty, at least temporarily.

Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876	Books	5	29	34	N	N	The Most Corrupt Election	Americans all over the country went to bed after election night thinking that the Democrats had won the White House.  The Democratic candidate won the popular vote, and while this was conceded by all, the antiquated Electoral College system made the popular vote of decidedly secondary importance.  There were races in such states as Florida where the balloting was contested, and outright fraud at many levels was claimed.  Election officials headed south to try to provide trustworthy re-counts, but more important were the deals made secretly between the press, the state officials, and the eager Republicans who intended to put their man in office.  Only after a Republican member of the Supreme Court cast his vote was there a certified Republican victory, but the outcome will ever be suspect of polling chicanery.  So it was that Americans elected a president in 1876.  The parallels to the 2000 election are often surprising, but those coincidences are not the point of _Fraud of the Century: Rutherford B. Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876_ (Simon & Schuster) by Roy Morris, Jr.  The election was indeed stolen, but Hayes's eventual victory and its cost to public confidence in governmental capability meant that Reconstruction was ended and Jim Crow came into power.<br />Both Hayes and Tilden went to bed on election night assured that Tilden had won.  Final returns showed that Tilden had won the popular vote by 250,000, and had 184 of the 185 electoral votes sewn up; there were four states which were late in reporting, and one electoral vote from any of them would have given Tilden the election.  It seemed a done deal, but Republicans refused to give up.  Alternative counts were produced, and Congress set up an Electoral Commission of fifteen members.  Southern Democrats started making deals with Hayes's men, and were promised that federal troops would be withdrawn from the states still under reconstruction governments.  Blacks who had helped bring the Republicans into office were cut out of the deal, which ensured that black Americans in the South would be held back from participating in politics until the modern civil rights movement.  Four months after the election, and just before swearing in, Hayes was declared the winner.  It was the most corrupt election in our nation's history, and yet Morris shows that the two candidates were decent men forced by circumstances to play roles in it.  Tilden, especially, shines; he clearly saw what would be good for the nation, and acted unselfishly, even though he had been defrauded by the Republicans.  Morris says, \\"It was an act of supreme patriotism on the part of a man who had won, if not the presidency, at least the election.\\"<br />_Fraud of the Century_ is a rousing story, full of dirty tricks and rascals.  Certainly it has relevance to recent events, but the 1876 election has been mostly forgotten.  Morris has dramatically brought it forward as an example of how the Electoral College previously complicated and reversed popular will, with serious repercussions for subsequent history.

But silicon technology cannot reduce forever; it is still based on atoms, and it cannot get smaller than an atom.  There is no law, however, that says we must forever be dependent on silicon, and so entirely new technologies may be developed.  The technology, undeveloped but promising, which has interested physicists and computer scientists the most is quantum computing.  We don't have quantum computers yet, and they aren't a sure thing, but the possibilities are tantalizing.  George Johnson, a science journalist, has tried to make the new technology plain in _A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to the Quantum Computer_ (Knopf), and for those of us who aren't mathematicians, physicists, or computer scientists, he has done an admirable job at making a very strange, not-yet-practical technology understandable.  Few of us need to know how silicon chips work, and fewer still will ever understand how quantum computers will work.  Indeed, the quantum world is so vastly strange and counterintuitive that no one really can understand it.  But Johnson's book is a good introduction to the strangeness, and a good vantage point from which to watch the upcoming revolution, if it comes.<br />Johnson's book is about a real quantum leap.  The classical physics of our silicon computers does not hold within the tiny spaces inside atoms.  Single particles at that scale can _really_ be in two places at once, and similarly, a quantum bit of information (known as a qubit) can be set to 1 and 0 at the same time, known as a &quot;superposition.&quot;  Qubits could be set to perform almost instantaneous calculations of huge programs, and there is no part of physics that says such computing should be impossible.  Indeed, on the smallest of scales, primitive quantum computing has already been accomplished.  Qubits are temperamental, and current research has to be done at supercold temperatures without the possibility of disturbance.  Still, there is enormous intellectual interest in the prospect of quantum computing.  One researcher in the field said that he and his colleagues are &quot;writing the software for a device that does not yet exist.&quot;  If quantum computing works, for instance, we will have to rethink all our current encryption methods, which are based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers; quantum computers do such things with ease silicon never can.<br /><br />You aren't going to understand quantum computers by reading this book; Johnson knows that he is trying to describe the undescribable, and  he makes it clear that he is no physicist, just someone trying to understand what all the fuss is about.  His book is lucid and his descriptions do not bog down in technicalities (at times he gleefully hurtles over them).  The book is also brief, but has enough substance to give even those who know little about current computing some basic understanding of where quantum computers may take us.  He has successfully conveyed the excitement these potential gadgets have sparked, and readers will be able to participate in the excitement themselves.ge programs, and there is no part of physics that says such computing should be impossible.

These had the good fortune to be found by humans and raised by humans.  But there are other myths, some as modern as Tarzan, about abandoned children who are taken up by animals.  Romulus and Remus were raised by wolves, and Semiramis, who founded Babylon, was raised by birds.  Such stories seem to be of intense interest to humans, and when a real \\"wild child\\" is produced, it can cause curiosity, sympathy, and sensation.  The stories of six such wild children are recounted in _Savage Girls and Wild Boys: A History of Feral Children_ (Thomas Dunne Books) by Michael Newton.  The individual stories, full of contradiction and wonder, are all intriguing, and the responses to the children and their fate have something to tell us not so much about feral children, but about ourselves.  These poor children lacked human contact when they should have been learning how to talk, eat, and behave; the result of such deprivation brings up profound questions about what language means, and what it is to be human.<br />Peter, the \\"Wild Boy\\" came naked out of the forests of Hanover, and became an attraction at the court of George I.  He lived on for sixty years, described in 1751 as \\"more of the Ouran Outang species than of the human.\\"  He could say only three words, \\"Peter\\" and \\"King George.\\"  Memmie le Blanc was lured out of a tree in France in Champagne in 1731 when she was about ten; she seems to have been a Native American dropped for some reason by the slave trade.  She could run and swim well, used a club to kill prey, and lived on roots and raw meat.  She eventually learned some French, and made artificial flowers for her living.  Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron was captured in the woods and lost twice over the years before being finally taken in 1800.  His development is among the best documented, as a young doctor set out to make the wild boy social.  Victor learned to say the French word for milk.  Kamala was about eight years old, suckled by wolves in the Indian jungle, until she was captured in 1920.  She lived nine further years, and learned a few words.  The famous Kaspar Hauser had a strange tale of being kept prisoner in a cellar for sixteen years.  He is the one feral child here that might be fraudulent.  The most modern example, the sad Genie who was tied to a chair in Los Angeles until she was about thirteen, acquired lots of words but no grammar.  What was going on in the minds of these children?<br />Probably no one knows with any confidence, but that does not stop curiosity or speculation.  One of Genie's caretakers found her \\"unsocialized, primitive, hardly human.\\"  By the time we get to her case, we can see that the same thing was said of all these wild children, and that their suffering struck cords in those around them.  But like Victor, Hauser, and Le Blanc, Genie was rescued, received intense caring attention, became a celebrity, and then was consigned to oblivion.  The pattern happened over and over to the wild children who lived long enough, and seems to indicate that bringing such creatures happily into human society is almost impossible.  Those who thought about these children, and they thought long and hard, were eager to examine humanity uncorrupted, as completely blank slates, but no one came close enough to understanding the children to make them social.  We fantasize that we can reclaim such lost humans, or that they have the intellectual power to reclaim themselves; look at Mowgli or Tarzan.  It must not be forgotten that these poor children survived under appalling conditions, and that can inspire some admiration.  But humans need each other, and Newton's serious and earnest book is best at showing this simple truth in a new way.d for milk.

According to Greg Critser in _Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World_ (Houghton Mifflin), 61% of Americans are overweight, overweight enough to cause health problems, and 20% are obese, obese enough to shorten their lives.  (Actually, Critser admits that his subtitle is not quite right, for a few South Sea Islanders surpass us in girth, but are by population numbers not comparable.)  Our Founding Fathers were not fat, nor were our grandparents, mostly, but our parents were, we are, and our children - well, they are the saddest part of this report.  Critser's book is a dismal, if entertaining, look at the history, economics, and biology of just how we got fat, and like any good muckraking tome, it has some suggestions of how we can make things better.<br />Critser's indictment is largely of the nutritional disasters of capitalism by which we have been persuaded to supersize all items.  Basic foods are cheap enough that there is little cost in making portions bigger, and people will pay for the biggie size, at the fast food joint where more and more meals are being consumed.  It's good business, and especially in the current political environment, what is good for business has to be good for America, even though Critser shows figures to demonstrate that in _every_ state of the Union, the incidence of obesity has increased by half since (get this) 1991.  Agricultural policies by fun-loving Earl Butz, Nixon's Secretary of Agriculture, got us plenty of Malaysian palm oil, also known as \\"tree lard,\\" and high fructose corn syrup, both of which can also be particularly implicated in type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes used to be called \\"adult onset diabetes,\\" but that name became a misnomer as it now afflicts millions of children.  Gluttony has been de-emphasized by the churches, and sloth is not always unfashionable.  Children of the poor have a particular problem (and throughout this book, poverty is shown as a cause, not just an association, of obesity), for they have little access to soccer leagues, adequate public recreation, or good gym programs in school.<br />There are answers which Critser cites.  Unfortunately, they always come down to the basics: take fewer calories in, burn more calories off, and neither of these endeavors are matters of delight for most people, let alone most obese people.  Helping the children is especially productive, and in the past couple of years there have been noticeable efforts to try to make school lunches healthier and to get fast food and vending machines out of the schools (which can be reluctant to do so, since the food manufacturers pay to have them there).  A Stanford study shows that simply restricting kids' hours of TV and video games causes weight loss; kids find other things to do besides sedentary snacking.  It cannot be that the food industry will reform; the recent obesity suits against fast food outlets have not only lost, but are ridiculed in this epoch that President Bush has called \\"the era of personal responsibility.\\"  \\"Snack less, jog more\\" ought to be what our personal responsibility requires us to do, but up against poverty and profits, our personal responsibility may merely lead us to hunt a little harder for the television's remote control.n of the poor have a particular problem (and throughout this book, poverty is shown as a cause, not just an association, of obesity), for they have little access to soccer leagues, adequate public recreation, or good gym programs in school.<br />There are answers which Critser cites.

It sounds like a stretch to claim that the man who definitively answered the question of whether a trotting horse ever completely leaves the ground also changed the world.  However, Rebecca Solnit has written an original biography of the photographer Eadweard Muybridge, _River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West_ (Viking) which centers on how Muybridge, by splitting motion into split-second bits, changed the nature of our perception of time and space in a way that brought us inevitably to Hollywood and to Silicon Valley.  She writes, \\"Muybridge was a doorway, a pivot between that old world and ours, and to follow him is to follow the choices that got us here.\\"  As biography, the book is inevitably thin.  Muybridge kept no journals and there are few letters, and details about his remarkable life are hard to come by; the basics, of course, are here.  Solnit says, \\"Most of what is known about Muybridge makes him seem a hollow conduit for his work, with only a few vain remarks to personalize the prodigal accomplishments.\\"  Rather than biography, as a series of essays on the importance of his work, the book is original and fun.<br />Muybridge's life and work are inextricably bound with the brand-new state of California, but he was born in 1830 over a family shop in England, in Kingston-upon-Thames.  He lit out for San Francisco, where he worked as a bookseller.  He made a name for himself in photography, however, which was a relatively new and demanding art.  He was among the first to photograph the wilderness of Yosemite, using huge plates for images that are still dramatic.  Muybridge stepped into fame with a commission from Leland Stanford, one of the famous robber barons who had made his fortune on the railways.  Stanford had a hobby of raising race horses and he wanted to do it all as scientifically as possible.  Some horsemen maintained that trotting horses always had at least one foot on the ground, while Stanford maintained that the horse became airborne in each stride; neither side had any way to demonstrate its position, for although one could stare at trotting horses eternally, the motion was simply too fast to make out.  There is a legend that Stanford had a big bet on the issue, but Stanford was not a betting man, only one who wanted to raise and race horses scientifically.  Muybridge had already had a commission to photograph Stanford's house and properties, and was asked to consider the problem of the trotting horse.  Muybridge was instrumental in technological breakthroughs to make the famous series of photos happen, involving film and shutter speed, as well as the development of a way to trigger a set of cameras at just the right time.  Solving the technology was only a minor part of his contribution; he went on to run the photographs together so that they became a loop of action, the forebear of the movies.  Muybridge's work was so startling that it was denounced .... and cartoon parodies were printed showing a horse's legs in \\"authentic\\" wildly impossible positions.  His subsequent studies of other animals and humans in motion are still in print, still a vital resource for artists.<br />Solnit has used the life of Muybridge to gather information on widely dispersed subjects that she ties into the biography with wonderful facility.  Wyatt Earp, Mary Pickford, and Thomas Edison are all here.  There are digressions about the invention of the time zones, the resettlement and slaughter of the Indians, Hewlitt-Packard, and much more.  Solnit's wide-ranging account makes it feasible that Muybridge was the father of the moving image, and that from his work descends the age of images in film, television, and internet.ssible.

Symptoms are diverse, as all of us have some sort of ache or pain now and then; and certainly all of us have mental symptoms, too, whether these be just ups and downs, occasionally hearing ourselves being called when no one is calling, obsessive interest in an oddity that turns into a hobby, bursts of energy or self-esteem, and so on.  Lawrence Osborne has taken on the task of reporting about Asperger Syndrome in _American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome_ (Copernicus Books) and has filled it with his own symptoms tending toward the condition: he is fixated on the television program _Iron Chef_, for instance, and he is fond of lingering in airports, and as a child he was nuts about playing the lute.  He is willing to call these &quot;Aspergerish&quot; (and he has met people with the diagnosis that share this sort of trait), but he wisely withholds the diagnosis from himself.  He gets along far too well; like so many other diagnoses, Asperger's can't apply if one is unimpaired socially or occupationally, and Osborne shows he can get along socially even with some very peculiar people, and he can write with wonderful clarity and vigor.  His book goes a long way to illustrating the condition, even if the illness, and the philosophy behind diagnosing it, remain largely unexplained.<br />The illness is specific, with a definition of check-off symptoms in psychiatry's standard diagnostic manual.  It is probably a high-functioning form of autism, but not as crippling.  People with Asperger's are often highly intelligent, and although they are frequently preoccupied with one area of restricted interest in which they have sometimes astounding intellectual capacity, they can blend into society with bumbling facility.  However, they can't do things that the rest of us take for granted, like looking at a human face and knowing what emotions are being shown.  Osborne gets to interview or research patients who have, for instance, memorized all of _Babylon 5_, or every fact about hotels in their state, or about vacuum cleaners.  It might be that Thomas Jefferson had the illness, and maybe Albert Einstein and B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k.  The main Asperger poster boy is the famous pianist Glenn Gould, who gets a chapter here.  Gould certainly had the concentration on a limited sphere of interest; his recordings, especially of Bach, are among the most famous of any classical records.  Gould displayed (or perhaps harnessed) the social inability of Asperger patients in an unusual way; retiring from the concert hall, he tirelessly argued for the virtues of electronically recorded performances.<br />This is not a book of firsthand experience with the illness, although Osborne wisely lets us in on enough of his own idiosyncrasies to show how close to normal Asperger people are.  And it is not a book by a medical expert or specialist.  Osborne is simply a curious person and a gifted writer who had an opportunity to investigate something that took his fancy, an interesting illness, and was able to interview some interesting people who suffer, or who thrive, from it.  (One of them told him, &quot;Normalcy is highly overrated, you know.&quot;)  _American Normal_ is mostly his personal observations, and it is very entertaining, as well as sympathetic and informative.what emotions are being shown.

It was only after the work of Karl Landsteiner, who won the 1930 Nobel Prize for it, that we knew about blood groups and who could swap blood with whom.  Transfusions, however, had a history going back to 1490, when Pope Innocent VIII was in deteriorating health and his physician determined that he needed the blood of three healthy boys.  No one knows exactly what happened, but the boys died, and the pope did, too.  In the increasing rationalism of the seventeenth century, Jean-Baptiste Denis, a French mathematician and astronomer, began to wonder about swapping blood.  It is a strange episode of inchoate scientific investigation, related in _Blood and Justice: The 17th Century Parisian Doctor Who Made Blood Transfusion History_ (Wiley) by Pete Moore.  The author, a British medical journalist, has looked into the peculiar history of beliefs about blood, and described vividly the scientific environment in which some very unusual experiments were made.<br />It is important to realize that the approach of looking for evidence to support theories was something quite new when (especially) the English philosopher Francis Bacon advocated it in the early seventeenth century.  There were centuries of precedent, supported by the church, of sticking to Aristotle, who did not have much of a record as an experimentalist.  The experiments described here involved infusing animals with the blood of other animals, often of different species.  Denis was the first one to try transfusion on humans.  In 1667, having transfused a couple of patients with sheep's blood, he was called in to see a madman named Mauroy, and it was suspected that his impure blood could be replaced by pure calf's blood and the calf's placidity would overtake the patient's madness.  Mauroy died.  Denis said he died before he could begin the transfusion, while Mrs. Mauroy said it was soon after the transfusion began.  The Parisian faculty of physicians distrusted novelty, and didn't like an upstart making the sort of talk that Denis's successes had won, and arranged to ensure that Denis was tried for murder.  Convenient evidence came up that Mrs. Mauroy had used arsenic on her husband; whether or not she was a murderer, Denis certainly wasn't, and he went free.  He had hoped that his name would be made by his blood work, but he tended to stick to math and astronomy thereafter.  The Catholic Church banned transfusions in 1675.<br />Transfusion is a good idea, but all those centuries ago, science had not developed sufficiently to make it a good idea.  Moore's book is good at setting scenes, and explaining the rationale of the experiments of the time.  It is a good instruction on experimentation done just for the sake of seeing what happens, without any real theory as guidance.  It is also good in comparing the feelings of the seventeenth century public, who were fearful or enthusiastic about the new treatment, with the feelings of the twenty-first century public, who have fear and enthusiasm for, say, genetically engineered corn, or for cloning.  The old worries of \\"Who has the right to play God?\\" were present then and now, and representations in the popular press were and are often less than helpful.

Rachel Holmes has done so in _Scanty Particulars: The Scandalous Life and Astonishing Secret of Queen Victoria's Most Eminent Military Doctor_ (Random House). Barry's story would have been worth retelling anyway; he was a crusading medical reformer who insisted on novel ideas about health and the running of hospitals that we now take for granted. He made plenty of friends and enemies, many highly placed, and no one seems to have known his secret when he died, although there were those who came out afterwards to say they had known all along. Holmes hints at it throughout her fully researched biography, but does not reveal it until after she has told all that can be known of Barry's eventful life; there will be no explicit spoiler in this review.<br />Barry was born about 1790 in Edinburgh, the \\"about\\" being necessary because his origins are murky and part of his secret. He was a precocious medical student at the University of Edinburgh, which was then at the height of its international prestige for its practical and academic study of diseases. He graduated from the university in 1812, and then served his apprenticeship in London. He was a fashionable dandy, dying his hair red, sporting the longest dress sword he could find, and wearing boots with the highest heels. He was a flirt with all the ladies, and he never seems to have courted any of them. He never married. He was posted as an army doctor in a series of far-flung outposts of the British Empire. He eventually became a medical inspector, with the power to report on the treatment of prisoners and lepers; he refused to accept the hellish accommodations offered such outcasts and would not back down in his reports. His reforms included an insistence on fresh air, good diet (he advocated vegetables especially, as he was a vegetarian), and cleanliness. He extended his protection to slaves, prostitutes, children, and the mentally ill. Holmes says that he was \\"a radical and progressive modernizer in an age of quacks and mountebanks.\\"<br />In 1865, afflicted by diseases he had himself picked up during his long battles against them, he died in retirement in England. His tutors before him had decreed that their bodies be given up for autopsy and dissection, and Barry would have been expected to have done the same. However, he repeatedly had insisted that he simply be wrapped in whatever sheets he died upon and buried with no ceremony. (A maidservant, however, saw the body, and her report led to sensational, and naturally erroneous, claims in the press.) He had also been reluctant to be examined by any medical men, and had been fussy about being seen while dressing. Holmes's findings on the truth about Barry are consistent with his life devoted to science and anatomy.

He extended his protection to slaves, prostitutes, children, and the mentally ill. Holmes says that he was \\"a radical and progressive modernizer in an age of quacks and mountebanks.\\" <br />In 1865, afflicted by diseases he had himself picked up during his long battles against them, he died in retirement in England. His tutors before him had decreed that their bodies be given up for autopsy and dissection, and Barry would have been expected to have done the same. However, he repeatedly had insisted that he simply be wrapped in whatever sheets he died upon and buried with no ceremony. (A maidservant, however, saw the body, and her report led to sensational, and naturally erroneous, claims in the press.) He had also been reluctant to be examined by any medical men, and had been fussy about being seen while dressing. Holmes's findings on the truth about Barry are consistent with his life devoted to science and anatomy.

It isn't surprising that conservatives, especially religious ones, don't like depictions of sexual activity, and pornography is not an uppermost issue for most people interested in fair dealing for both sexes.  However, in the past few decades, there have been feminist writers, notably Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin (their followers are known as MacDworkinites), who have insisted that pornography dehumanizes women, causes rape and incest, and generally messes up societies.  There are First Amendment issues over the matter, of course, which have been well covered by Nadine Strossen of the ACLU in _Defending Pornography_.  Alan Soble has written _Pornography, Sex, and Feminism_ (Prometheus Books) which with the intensity of a pit bull's attack demolishes the MacDworkinite arguments against porn.  Soble is an academic philosopher who has written several books about sexuality, and his convincing refutation of anti-pornography academic writings is full of footnotes, but it is also full of street-talk and graphic words describing sex and genitalia.  Its style is well suited to its subject.<br />Pornography is dehumanizing, and degrading, say the MacDworkinites.  Soble's most striking response is a resounding \\"So what?\\"  Amusingly, he parades an almost anti-humanist stance.  Humans are often ugly and disgusting, so degradation is not much of an issue.  Along with this stroke, he goes on to critique the anti-porn arguments in detail, drawing upon his expertise in philosophy (mostly Kant) and upon research he has really done in viewing porn on the Internet, research he chides his antagonists for not doing.  They pretend to have some sort of omniscient ability to look into the minds of men who enjoy pornography and to know just what those minds are thinking as they watch it; the viewer always thinks nasty things like \\"Get her,\\" for instance.  Soble demolishes such an argument by first pointing out that pornography comes in so many diverse and unmonolithic forms that to say there is one message involved is a ludicrous oversimplification.  Secondly, it is absurd to say that a particular image has one particular message it conveys to all viewers.  The MacDworkinites are having none of this complexity, because they have little research that shows what men think about when they see porn.  They insist that pornography makes people want to live out what the pornography depicts.  They say that viewing pictures in _Playboy_ causes incest.  They insist that viewing porn sparks rape, but have not addressed such facts as the failure of the extremely violent pornography produced in Japan to bring on a high incidence of rape in that country (indeed, the incidence is very low).<br />The insistence that viewing pornography causes bad actions has not been clinically proven, but that does not stop these feminists from knowing that it does.  Time and again, Soble takes the conservatives and feminists on for constructing straw man arguments that show sexual naivete' and unwillingness to admit that sexual behavior is not as simple as their pigeonholing would make it seem.  They have decided they don't like pornography (and seem to see all sex as having dark and scary issues within it), and having decided this beforehand, they find it easy to make up \\"facts\\" and arguments to demonstrate that porn is bad.  It is bad reasoning, and denies such pleasure as pornography, and as sex itself, might offer.  This sort of view is currently politically popular, and there is plenty of propaganda to promote it.  Soble's appropriately vulgar and withering attack, however, shows just how shockingly totalitarian the MacDworkinites' aims are, and how desperately wrongheaded.tance.

So with our veneer of social custom, we are all duelists underneath.  The other great evidence of our fascination for swordplay is the movies.  Swordplay did not vanish with Errol Flynn, _The Three Musketeers_, and _The Mark of Zorro_.  It endures in _Star Wars_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.  \\"Filmmakers have found,\\" Cohen writes, \\"that for the sheer excitement of pitting hero against villain in one-on-one combat there is still a place for the swordfight.\\"  Cohen's book is a perfect way to realize just how fascinated we are with swords, and to learn more about real dueling, movie swordfights, and competitive fencing<br />The deadly world of dueling takes up many of the pages in this sizable book, but it is relieved by comedy many times.  For instance, a nobleman in seventeenth century Naples fought twenty duels to prove that Dante was a greater poet than Ariosto; finally, he admitted that he had read the works of neither.  Trial by combat was governmentally sanctioned because, as he does in wars, God would decide who ought to win.  The duel of chivalry gave way to the duel for honor, which became fashionable in the sixteenth century, and thousands died as the middle class embraced the blood sport.  Among those who attempted to take dueling from a blood sport to a competitive one was Henry VIII, who set up a royal academy of fencing.  Of course, he was interested in training warriors, but the instructors he licensed as \\"Masters of the Noble Science of Defense\\" organized \\"prizefights.\\"  Thus began the still-continuing reign of the fencing masters.  Among the fencers noted here are Mussolini, General Franco, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and even Harry Truman.  Fencers have remained relatively clear of sports drug abuse, there is a long history of cheating that is a recurrent aspect of the sport's culture.  Swords are jimmied and competitions get bought and sold, fixed, or thrown for the benefit of future concessions.  Such are the difficulties in a sport born of an emphasis on honor.<br />Cohen is a long time editor, and his smooth writing shows it.  He is also a saber champion who has been on the British Olympic team, and his enthusiasm is present on every page of an elegant book whose devotion to an arcane endeavor can be appreciated by those who know nothing of the sport.

There is a new sort of archeology, however, that is changing our long-range view of human pre-history.  Scientists are digging into cells, into the genes that everyone knows make us what we are.  The details from this new research have given revolutionary insight into where humans came from, how they spread, and the origin and superficiality of races.  In _The Journey of Man_ (Princeton University Press), Spencer Wells, a population geneticist, has written a wonderfully clear book of origins, drawing upon not just genes but history, geography, archeology, and linguistics.<br />In part, the book is a summary of refutations against the ideas of anthropologists who maintained that different races were subspecies that arose in different regions at different times.  No such hypotheses could be tested in the time they were issued, and now they can.  DNA in the cells from mitochondria, and the DNA in the male Y chromosome do not shuffle the way ordinary chromosomes do, and thus are very stable from one generation to the next.  Mutations happen, and accumulate, and may be used to see how closely related humans from different regions of the world are.  The genetic results of both mitochondrial and Y chromosome research confirm each other, and are unambiguous.  We are all out of Africa.  We stayed in Africa as humans for generations, and almost all the genetic variation we were going to get was within us at that time.  Then around 40,000 years ago, propelled perhaps because of weather changes, we started our travels.  _Journey_ has good diagrams, but a map showing the flow of different Y chromosome linkages around the world can be regarded with awe, for the history it shows and for the scientific advances that have made such a diagram possible.<br />Our current way of living has wrought changes in plenty of the subjects in this book.  The trail of languages in many ways parallels the trail of genes around the world, but as we develop a global culture, languages are dying out at a faster rate than ever before.  Also, there is greater mixing of genes from different cultures now that easy travel makes possible the meeting of members of tribes that would never have met before.  It could be that we have passed the heyday for the sort of research reported here, as populations swap genes in unprecedented ways.  Nonetheless, Wells's book is full of enthusiasm for basic research, and the results described here are fascinating.  We can look back at our origins with new respect for how long and how strange a journey it has been, and with the increasing realization that that our one species has one shared history.n many ways parallels the trail of genes around the world, but as we develop a global culture, languages are dying out at a faster rate than ever before.

They are an amusing bit of American folk surrealism, recalling the more official artworks of the fur-lined cup and saucer or the lobster telephone.  The furry dice don't clack the way real dice do, and they are too huge and too rotund ever to be useful as mechanisms in games of chance.  Yet they look strange enough that many people fancy them, and assembly lines somewhere are tuned up to produce them for enthusiasts.  Conversely, there are real dice depicted in _Dice: Deception, Fate, & Rotten Luck_ (Quantuck Lane Press) by Ricky Jay, with photographs by Rosamond Purcell.  But some of them are startlingly furry, and all of them are dying.<br />Ricky Jay is a magician, and a historian of magic, in addition to being a stage and movie actor.  He has produced a couple of large books having to do with the history of magic and showmanship, but this is a small book, square like a face of a die, as are the color close-ups of the afflicted dice.  \\"In the attempt to acquire empirical knowledge, I have accumulated thousands of dice over a period of decades,\\" Jay explains.  They are of all sorts of colors and patterns, but most of them are made of celluloid, the same celluloid whose decay has robbed us of countless early movies.  Rosamond Purcell specializes in photographing the entropy that overcomes inanimate objects, like a book eaten by termites or rusting objects from the junkyard.  Most of the large photographs here show the dice larger than life.  The styles of their degeneration are diverse.  The transparent ones show cracks through their mass, as if they have been dropped from a height.  Some of the faces have crystallized, so that they look as if they have been sugared.  Greenish mold seems to grow on some of them, while others seem to be bubbling from inside.  Some of them have become as floppy as Dali's pocket watches, while others cleave crisply, leaving cubic fracture lines.  Sometimes the spots are preserved, and sometimes it is the spots that have been attacked by time.  They are certainly more interesting and more photogenic than they would have been when they were first manufactured.<br />It is to be expected that the text, in twelve small chapters numbered by pips on the dice, reflects Jay's wit and erudition.  Here you can learn a lot of dice history, tales of loaded dice found in Pompeii, or of the conjuring dwarf who had no arms or legs, but manipulated dice in subtle ways.  You can read about how God has struck down sacrilegious gamesters.  Here is the legend of the Scandinavian kings throwing dice for territory, each throwing repeated boxcars until a surprising stroke (consistent with these pictures) gives a throw that beats a twelve.  These are all good stories of the importance which many have felt for dice and their outcomes, and they are made poignant by the handsome photographs of just how chance and time have overtaken these humble cubes.leave crisply, leaving cubic fracture lines.

When Louisa Young's father was recovering from heart bypass surgery, she found herself thinking about hearts.  Her thoughts have been productive, as she has delved into science, art, and history to tell about anatomical hearts, pumping hearts, religious, sacrificial, musical, metaphorical, preserved, consumed, ill, and legendary hearts.  She tells us she could happily have extended _The Book of the Heart_ (Doubleday) into twelve volumes, and while reading through such a mass would be daunting, this distillation of her research is captivating.  There is little about human hearts that she has not covered.<br />Hearts are divided into four chambers, and her book is divided into four sections called chambers.  The first is about the anatomical and physiological heart, and how we came to understand scientifically what it was doing, and how to repair it when it went wrong.  There is a fascinating summary of how the Egyptians, Greeks, and so on, figured the working of the heart, and how Aristotle got it all wrong and confused everyone for centuries.  William Harvey published in 1628 the authoritative and scientific demonstration that the single two-sided heart was merely a pump to serve distribution of a single pool of blood to the lungs and to the body.  Some saints were given new hearts by Jesus, whose sacred heart became a symbol in itself.  The Aztec religion (and other tribal beliefs) promoted eating of the heart, and a thirteenth century mold exists that made communion wafers (which became flesh rather than merely representing it) in the shape of a heart.  The third chamber is for the heart in art.  Young defends kitsch hearts in religious and other arts, but tells us that she is writing in her room full of glitter hearts, tin hearts, Venetian glass hearts, and more, so this might be self-serving.  The final chamber is for the lover's heart.  There is actually not much hearty about St. Valentine, but by chance his feast day coincided with the Roman Lupercalia festival, a sort of marriage lottery.  There is much lovely heart poetry here.<br />This is a wonderful book of heart miscellany, full of fun.  Young says that pursuing her subject in the library has lead to countless spells of laughing out loud.  It is easy to believe this.  She has a sharp and ironic way of writing, and has made unforced connections between cultures and between centuries because the heart is universally central to all.  She modestly compares her curious book to a vegetable soup - &quot;if you find one bit not to your taste, move on, feel free - all the flavors connect up.&quot;  But the whole can be taken easily, except, perhaps, by the faint of heart, and the hard hearted.l, a sort of marriage lottery.

We like a bridge over troubled waters.  We needed a bridge into the new millennium.  Bridges have a hold on us in a way that other examples of civil engineering do not.  And we often don't notice them as we use them.  Although I had traveled on the Natchez Trace Parkway many times, upheld by a bridge in Franklin, Tennessee, I had never looked down and appreciated the span until alerted to it a couple of years ago.  It is a beautiful, big, parabolic concrete arch which I now get off and admire fairly often.  According to _Bridges: The Spans of North America_ (Norton) by David Plowden, I am not alone.  This bridge \\"is unlike any heretofore built in America and has been the recipient of innumerable awards.\\"  Calling attention to the bridges we take for granted, and telling a history of American bridge building, Plowden's book is fittingly big, and displays his beautiful black and white pictures in large format, splendidly reproduced.  It is properly sized for the coffee table, but the text is appropriately comprehensive, and as worth reading as the pictures are worth admiring.<br />_Bridges_ is divided into chronological sections based on the materials used: stone and brick; wood; iron; steel (divided into three time periods, since there are so many steel bridges); and concrete.  Erecting a stone bridge was expensive and time consuming, especially compared to using wood.  There are more miles of wooden bridges than any other type in America, although Plowden has little good to say about the \\"cult of the covered bridge\\" which has obscured the trusswork he thinks is the important part of these wooden bridges.  Iron was used for bridges for only a short time, and iron bridges are the rarest of bridge artifacts.  Concrete bridges are the way to go for the main bridge-building impetus in America, the highway system.  Reinforced concrete does extremely well for piers to hold bridges up, as well as for the flats that carry traffic.  Plowden spends many pages on the most famous type of bridge, the steel spans, and his pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge present them in new ways, and he hurtles through the engrossing stories of their construction because they are relatively familiar.  The stories of lesser known bridges, such as the wonderful Eads bridge in St. Louis (built by Captain James Eads, of few engineering credentials and no bridge experience) bring to light many surprising difficulties and solutions the bridge builders came up with.<br />Plowden's history serves as a demonstration of engineering problem-solving.  Each bridge is unique in purpose, location, and difficulties of completion.  This is true even in replacement bridges.  Many of these beautiful photographs show bridges that are no longer existent.  There have been bridge failures, of course, but usually bridges built in the nineteenth century show signs of distress, and are called out of commission.  Sometimes railroads simply no longer need a particular link.  There are, however, new vistas for bridge building, especially in the straits and bays that have needed bridges and now have proposals for bridges meeting new engineering and economic abilities previously unavailable.  Plowden is confident that utility will continue to be combined with beauty, and his handsome book supports such confidence.ny pages on the most famous type of bridge, the steel spans, and his pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge present them in new ways, and he hurtles through the engrossing stories of their construction because they are relatively familiar.

Everyone knows how devoted dogs are to their owners (for which the word &quot;guardians&quot; is being used by those who do not like to think of such noble and friendly animals as property) and how devoted the humans are to their dogs.  But like anything else that humans do, there are people that mess things up, and in some cases, mess things up horrifyingly.  There are dogs who are mistreated and abandoned, and there are not enough shelters to take care of all the strays.  Countless dogs end up officially killed because culling them is the sad best solution to a problem dogs didn't cause and humans did.  There are people who are making a difference, and in _The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior_ (Thomas Dunne Books), Melinda Roth has given a touching portrait of an unlikely, flawed, and genuinely gifted dog-lover who is getting help for helpless dogs.<br />Randy Grim is the founder of Stray Rescue in St. Louis, a position he describes as being captain of a punctured life raft.  He is a bundle of phobias.  &quot;I have to take one Xanax for driving, one and a half for shopping malls, two for walking through an airport, and three if I have to _eat_ in an airport.&quot;  But he can do things like drive, even over feared bridges, without anxiety if he is on duty rescuing dogs.  There is a good deal of unpleasant but essential reporting here, a good deal about what happens to dogs bred for the &quot;sport&quot; of dogfighting, and dogs from puppy mills.  Grim drives out into the wilds of the city to try to befriend the dogs and eventually corral them into his care.  He meets some cast-off humans as well, and helps them when he can; he knows he should feel more sorry for people, but he knows there are other agencies doing that: &quot;Nobody is worrying about these dogs out here who don't know how to hunt or how to fend for themselves or how to survive.&quot;<br />The dogs go to Grim's basement for basic care and beginning lessons in associating with humans.  A friendly lawyer helped get Grim's efforts certified as a non-profit organization, and some news stories helped get the word out so that he now has a group of dedicated foster parents to nurture terrified, injured, and crazy dogs fresh off the streets.  The dogs are finally adopted out, and plenty of the adoptions work out well for all concerned.  Grim has become a national figure in the dog rescue world.  There is a hilarious account of an Animal Planet crew sent to film his adventures in catching strays (&quot;Look!  I'm being filmed _and_ driving across a bridge, and I'm not freaking out.&quot;).  When the story aired, there was more recognition, which meant more people called him to pick up dogs, but also more donations and more volunteers.  &quot;I'm not perfect,&quot; Grim says, &quot;but I know that if it wasn't for the dogs, I would have ended up a lost soul with a bleak life.&quot;  This is a lovely story of redemption, of lost dogs and a lost man who made a difference helping each other.or how to survive.&quot;  <br />The dogs go to Grim's basement for basic care and beginning lessons in associating with humans.

Native Americans did not enclose or measure land, and thus they could not convincingly demonstrate (to those who wanted to take it from them) that they owned it.  This pattern was true not just in America, but in, for example, South Africa and Australia.  Patterns of demarcation even influenced regional character.  In the South, the legislatures were dominated by landowners who relied upon local surveyors who did not use chains and theodolites, but instead relied on marked trees and memory.  Such a system caused violent struggles, but it also meant that doubts over actual ownership inhibited speculation and transfer of land.  In the North, farmers would settle, improve the land, sell, and move to another measured plat; in the south, owners kept the property for generations, and Linklater refers to the effect on southern literature of such patterns of survey and ownership as being good material for future scholarly research.  The squares laid out in the 19th century did not help efficient farming, but they helped the financier, who could easily track the value of the squares; settlement was based on speculation.

What if a community wanted to support local businesses and charged a chain store a larger licensing fee, and the chain store claimed it was a person who must not be discriminated against?  What if when limits were set on campaign contributions by a corporation, the corporation said that it was a person and as a person it had freedom of expression (and thereby donation)?  These are not \\"what ifs.\\"  Corporations are regarded as people, but _Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights_ (Rodale) by Thom Hartmann shows that this is literally a legal fiction, and one based on a serious misinterpretation of the law.  In addition, he demonstrates that the interpretation of corporate personhood has had ill effects for citizens, the nation, and the world.<br />Corporations originally had very restricted rights; Jefferson, for instance, worried about monopolies taking over the government.  When corporations (starting with the railroads) became powerful in the Industrial Revolution, they were eager to be  granted human rights.  They especially desired to take advantage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had been passed to grant full constitutional protection to emancipated slaves.  In a curious Supreme Court case in 1886, there was a commentary written to say that a railroad was a corporate person.  This \\"headnote\\" was not law and not precedent, but in true irony, the amendment to protect former slaves has been hijacked to promote corporate personhood.  It used to be taken for granted that communities could regulate corporations, but now that they are persons, they are able to dodge many such regulations.<br />Hartmann is not a lawyer, but his research and consultation with lawyers have made his book clear and convincing.  His book lists many assaults on good government, the environment, and human rights overseas that corporations have been able to sustain because they have been able to insist upon their own rights as humans.  A sustained legal attack on the fraud of corporate personhood is what Hartmann would like to see, for the purpose of decreasing corporate influence in politics and restoring the power of community and state government.  He proposes a grass roots movement to achieve this, and makes the results sound well-reasoned and attractive.  He knows the powers which corporations have, and what he is up against, but his book is a manifesto for change.  If you have been concerned that corporations have too much power, you will find it invaluable.onvincing.

But we could expect them to know pi, or the ratio of the weight of a proton compared to an electron; that's a number, about 1836, without any meters or grams behind it, and it is considered one of the \\"constants of nature.\\"  There are other such constants, and they form the subject of _The Constants of Nature: From Alpha to Omega - The Numbers That Encode the Deepest Secrets of the Universe_ (Pantheon Books) by John D. Barrow.  The book, which is the sort to be enjoyed by anyone who liked puzzling through such works as _A Brief History of Time_, paradoxically has a main topic about the constants: What if they are not constant?<br />If, for instance, the proton / electron ratio were all of a sudden a little different, atoms might fly apart instead of maintaining their tiny orbital systems on which matter as we know it depends.  There are other important numbers that we think are constant, like Planck's constant, the charge on the electron, and the speed of light.  These three are linked within another constant, the fine structure constant.  All these constants seem to have turned out just right for humans to have evolved to be investigating their physics.  They all seem to be surprisingly bio-friendly.  As surely as some insist that a conscious designer made the wonderfully baroque varieties of living things on our planet, others (who may admit that evolution rather than a conscious designer was at work) will say some godly entity picked the constants.  But Barrow explains many alternatives, universes with the constants possibly turning out in some other way, and also explains ways that these universes might have come into being.  If there are lots of universes out there, with lots of different constant combinations, it is no longer surprising that we are in one of them with the constants tuned just right to produce life, and intelligent life at that.<br />But in our own universe, are the constants constant?  There have been some very interesting and comforting confirmations of constancy which are reported here.  Barrow himself, however, has been a member of a team using a different technique to spot a shift, over a longer period of time, and, well, a shift seems to be there.  There is not much you can count on in this strange universe; whether our strange universe is more strange or less for having produced us is not a question that science can answer.  There are plenty of others pending; this engrossing and clearly-written book brings lots of them up.  Are our constants linked to an expansive universe?  Do they evolve or cycle?  Are there plenty of other universes out there already, in a multiverse of possible worlds?  The current view of cosmology is clearly presented here, although it is very peculiar; and the answers to these questions will be more peculiar still.nstants constant?

Of all the irrational numbers, the best known is pi, which shows up all over the place.  However, if you read _The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number_ (Broadway Books) by Mario Livio, you will gain an appreciation for the ubiquity of another irrational with all sorts of amazing properties.  You can try this one on your calculator: Phi equals 1.6180339887...  (As an irrational, its string of numbers goes infinitely beyond the decimal point, and you can be sure computers have calculated it to millions of places).  Take the inverse of that number; that is, divide it into one.  You will get 0.6180339887...; in other words, the inverse looks just like phi itself, but with a zero instead of one left of the decimal.  Or try this: start with a 1, followed by a 1.  The next number will be the two previous ones added together, which is 2; the next number, in turn, is again the two previous ones added together, which is 3.  The series goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55...  This is the famous Fibonacci sequence, and is investigated widely within this book as it is intimately connected to phi.  Take any number in the series and divide it by the number before it, and you will get a number close to phi; the higher the number in the series, the closer the result comes.  (13 / 8 = 1.615 ;  55 / 34 = 1.6176....).<br />These sorts of number tricks abound in Livio's book, and the mathematics is not daunting.  It is also a history of phi, which turns out to be a representative slice of the history of mathematics.  Euclid knew the number, but Leonardo Fibonacci in the twelfth century developed the series with its ratio.  It shows up in breeding rabbits; spirals in pine cones, sunflowers, galaxies, and hurricanes; tilings and fractals; and many more surprising places.  Livio has enormous fun giving and explaining all these examples.  Showing up as it does all over the place, perhaps phi is just being seen because that is what is being looked for.  Livio, whose day job is being Head of the Science Division at the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute, is refreshingly dismissive of attempts to try to see a Golden Ratio in everything, which people have tried to do for centuries.  It isn't in the pyramids, nor in the Parthenon, nor in Leonardo's paintings.<br />Without forcing the issue, however, it is easy to see that the Golden Ratio, logarithmic spirals, and Fibonacci numbers are all over the place; there is even a _Fibonacci Quarterly_ mathematical journal.  This leads to larger final issues, which Einstein expressed as the question, \\"How is it possible that mathematics, a product of human thought that is independent of experience, fits so excellently the objects of physical reality?\\"  Do mathematical concepts have a universal and timeless existence \\"out there\\" and are just waiting for us to discover them?  Or is mathematics a human invention that resides only within the human brain?  It can't be surprising that this classic conundrum is not definitively solved here.  Livio's ideas about it, however, well expressed and tied to this remarkable numerical constant, are well worth thinking about., whose day job is being Head of the Science Division at the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute, is refreshingly dismissive of attempts to try to see a Golden Ratio in everything, which people have tried to do for centuries.

Juhnke documents the rise and fall of all three medical conmen, and gives a lesson in the dangers of credulousness.<br /><br />John Brinkley was a licensed doctor, having graduated from a diploma mill.  He latched on to the \\"gland transplant\\" experiments done on animals, and believed that transplanting animal glands into humans was a key for rejuvenation.  \\"A man is as old as his glands, and his glands are as old as his sex glands,\\" he proclaimed.  Male goats were the randiest animals, so they were the tissue donors, but they turned out to be just the thing to boost female fertility and development of the bust, too.  He compared himself to Jesus, gave sermons, and demonized the American Medical Association.  Norman Baker specialized in cancer cures.  He worked as a machinist and in vaudeville before settling down in Muscatine, Iowa.  He persuaded city officials to let him start a radio station that would present honest-to-goodness down home programs as opposed to the high-brow fare coming from the cities.  Baker called Morris Fishbein, the head of the AMA, the \\"Jewish dominator of the medical trust of America,\\" and insisted that his clinic was a bastion for personal freedom and against the evils of urban industrialism.  Harry Hoxsey proved to have the most staying power.  He specialized in herbal cancer cures as well.  Not a physician, he was able to enroll renegade physicians into his service, and he was bankrolled by an evangelist minister.  In Dallas, he enjoyed poker, nightclubs, and womanizing, and his diatribes against interference by the AMA and the government won him friends from the political right wing.<br /><br />Juhnke's tales of these colorful characters are great fun to read, even though the rascals bilked many of their patients of money and sometimes their lives.  The eventual success of the AMA against them is not a pure victory; the shortcomings of the AMA at the time are examined here, too.  Few people remember these quacks now.  The towns that boosted them because they brought in business now view them as an embarrassing part of their histories.  It is important that Juhnke has brought them again to our attention.  We may no longer have such manifestations as goat gland transplants, but anyone who watches television knows that herbal cures, homeopathy, and healing magnets are still taking money from the gullible.  There is still a large group of potential patients who view organized medicine (and governmental regulation of medical treatment) as some sort of conspiracy, and of course there are plenty of faith healers who are glad to have their flocks doubting the efficacy  of regular medical treatment.  People are finding it harder to pay for physicians, and drug costs are up.  Brinkley, Baker, and Hoxsey may have eventually lost their power and their millions, but Juhnke's useful study reminds us that there are always healers ready to take their place.rference by the AMA and the government won him friends from the political right wing. <BR> <BR>Juhnke's tales of these colorful characters are great fun to read, even though the rascals bilked many of their patients of money and sometimes their lives.

His wide range of interests now centers on an object of personal obsession; in _The Founding Fish_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux) he tells us about his own passion for fishing for shad.  As you might expect, he can't help but tell us a lot more, about history, ecology, and human oddities.  If you don't know about shad, and even if you don't know about fishing, and don't care to know about it, you won't feel alienated away from these pages, which contain McPhee's fine prose and wry humor.  (For instance, he is surprised to find a snake in his net: &quot;I lack the sense of companionship that some people seem to have with snakes.&quot;)  Shad is worth knowing about, it turns out, and so is McPhee, who has seldom put himself as a character in his own books.<br />Of course, there is much advice about fishing for shad, which seem to be a particularly elusive fish.  McPhee quotes extensively from his fishing diaries, and starts his book with a funny description of an epic battle with a shad on the Delaware River starts.  McPhee has seventy feet of six-pound test line &quot;suddenly pulled by a great deal more than the current.&quot;  The battle goes on for pages and pages, eventually ending in the netting of a 4 3/4 pound shad.  A fighting fish, to be sure.  Or a clumsy angler.  Shad is not an endangered species, but of course they have been affected by the humans changing their waters.  Beside the problem of pollution, there are thousands of dams on rivers that used to present only milder natural obstacles for the returning fish.  Some of the dams are, surprisingly, coming down, and McPhee takes us to a dam-removing ceremony.  As the title implies, shad have played a role in American history.  George Washington seined for shad on the Potomac.  He didn't eat them; only one shad bone has turned up in the excavation of his garbage pit at Mount Vernon (and McPhee can't help an interesting digression upon &quot;archaeozoology&quot;).  His slaves got them, and he used shad as a fertilizer.  Despite the legend, his men at Valley Forge were not saved from starvation by a providential, unseasonal run of shad up the Schuylkill River.  Thoreau worried about shad in their thousands meeting a new commercial dam, and wrote the lament, &quot;Poor shad! where is thy redress?&quot;  Thoreau advised the fish, &quot;Keep a stiff fin and stem all the tides thou mayst meet.&quot;  Words to live by.<br />Once again, McPhee has picked an unlikely subject and made everything about it vivid, interesting, and important.  If you fish, you will love this book.  If you don't fish, here is a book to give you an idea about why intelligent fishermen go about their often frustrating hobby with such evident pleasure.  _The Founding Fish_ is a delightful small encyclopedia on everything connected with shad.unt Vernon (and McPhee can't help an interesting digression upon &quot;archaeozoology&quot;).

Ask Salman Rushdie.  While it is true that most of western society has a heritage of press freedom, and such a concept has not yet become part of all societies, we did not get to it easily.  In the United States, one can publish whatever one wants about religious ideas, and no legal charge of blasphemy can result; in no small part, this is due to the fate of Michael Servetus, who was burned at the stake for writing about unacceptable religious ideas in 1553.  He became a hero for such lights as Voltaire and Jefferson, and a foundation for the Unitarian Church.  His story is vigorously told in Out of the Flames: The Remarkable Story of a Fearless Scholar, a Fatal Heresy, and One of the Rarest Books in the World (Broadway Books) by Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone.  The Goldstones, who are book collectors, have made this a story of Servetus's physical books and of the history of publishing, as well as a history of intellectual progress against oppressive religious power.<br />The &quot;fatal heresy&quot; in the title comes from Servetus's ideas that were not only anathema to the Catholic church, but were also detested by the Protestants that had adopted doctrine from the Catholics.  Servetus, for instance, abhorred the idea of the Trinity, and being a supremely knowledgeable biblical scholar, knew there was nothing in the Bible about any such Trinity.  He also had biblical arguments against original sin, childhood baptism, virgin birth, and predestination.  Knowing his Bible, however, didn't save him.  He had to hide from both Catholics and Protestants, and under an assumed identity, became a doctor.  In this role, he made discoveries about the circulation of the blood that predated Harvey's by seventy-five years.  John Calvin eventually colluded with the Catholic Church to catch Servetus, there was a show trial, and a horrid burning at the stake.  Calvin also thought that all of Servetus's books had been burned, but three survived.  He also survived as an inspiration for the Unitarian Church.<br />The Goldstones have written a spellbinding biography of an important thinker.  There are digressions here that always circle back to the main theme; an amazing description of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre is here, and appearances are made by many kings and queens, Newton, Liebnitz, Jonathan Swift, Ignatius Loyola, Emerson, William Osler, and many more.  Reflecting their interest in book collecting, the Goldstones, starting with Gutenberg and winding up with the stories of the three remaining copies of Servetus's book, have also given a rousing history of books in western intellectual growth.lso survived as an inspiration for the Unitarian Church.<br />The Goldstones have written a spellbinding biography of an important thinker.

And surely not all religions can be factually correct, since there are fundamental disagreements between them.  So, how is it that all those other, incorrect religions exist and seem to help their members and their societies?  There must be something they offer beyond a factual representation of gods and the cosmos (and when it comes down to it, if you belong to a religion, yours must be offering something more as well).  If religions do help their members and societies, then perhaps they are beneficial in a long term and evolutionary way, and maybe such evolutionary influences should be acknowledged and studied.  This is what David Sloan Wilson convincingly declares he has done in _Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society_ (University of Chicago Press): &quot;I will attempt to study religious groups the way I and other evolutionary biologists routinely study guppies, trees, bacteria, and the rest of life on earth, with the intention of making progress that even a reasonable skeptic must acknowledge.&quot;<br />To Wilson's credit, he has written carefully about both scientific and religious issues, and readers with an interest in either field will find that he has covered both fairly.  His coverage of the science involved begins with an interesting history of &quot;the wrong turn&quot; evolutionary theory took fifty years ago, when it deliberately ignored the influence of group selection.  Especially if one accepts that there is for our species not only an inheritance of genes, but also an inheritance of culture, evolutionary influence by and upon religious groups, especially in light of the examples Wilson discusses, now seems obvious.  For instance, evolution often studies population changes due to gains and losses from births, deaths, and in the case of religion, conversion and apostasy.  The early Christian church is shown to have made gains compared to Judaism and Roman mythology because of its promotion of proselytization, fertility, a welfare state, and women's participation.  There is a temple system in Bali dedicated to the water goddess essential for the prosperity of the rice crops; &quot;those who do not follow her laws may not possess her rice terraces.&quot;  The religious system encompasses eminently practical procedures for promoting fair water use and even for pest control.  Religious morality is shown to build upon the principles of the famously successful computer strategy Tit-for-Tat.  There is a significant problem, of course, in religions' dealing with other groups; it is not at all uncommon for a religion to teach that murdering those who believe in other religions is different from murdering those inside one's own religion.  There is a degree of amorality shown in such competition, no different from the amorality that governs the strivings of ferns, sparrows, and lions.<br /><br />Wilson's many examples are fascinating and easy to take, but _Darwin's Cathedral_ is not light reading; although Wilson wanted to write a book for readers of all backgrounds, he has not &quot;'dumbed down' the material for a popular audience,&quot; and admits that there is serious intellectual work to be done in getting through these pages.  There is valuable and clear writing here, however, and a new way of looking at religion which may become a standard in scientific evaluation.rly Christian church is shown to have made gains compared to Judaism and Roman mythology because of its promotion of proselytization, fertility, a welfare state, and women's participation.

If you are bargain hunting, you can get the caviar from the white sturgeon for $88.  If you are poverty stricken, Petrossian has condescended to sell salmon roe for about a ninth the cost of the white sturgeon, but salmon roe (which the Petrossian catalogue insists is \\"sometimes referred to as red caviar\\") just isn't caviar, and caviar lovers know it.  Inga Saffron is a caviar lover, and shows it in _Caviar: The Strange History and Uncertain Future of the World's Most Coveted Delicacy_ (Broadway Books).  She is architecture critic for _The Philadelphia Inquirer_, and was its Moscow correspondent from 1994 to 1998, when she was able to do a bit of cloak-and-dagger research into the dark alleys of the caviar trade.  Her love is tempered by worry; the surprising history of humans' involvement with sturgeon has not done the sturgeon much good at all, and soon the sturgeon may not be doing any good for connoisseurs, no matter how wealthy.<br />The sturgeon is one of those organisms that Darwin called \\"living fossils.\\"  Some species have remained the same over the past 250 million years, but the past two hundred years that have given sturgeon real problems. Before that, they were not valued as food, but with the industrial revolution came better preservation and also a wealthy class that liked luxuries.  Sturgeon were fished clean from the German Elbe River and the American Delaware River by the early 1900s.  The stock in the Caspian sea rebounded some during the years of revolution and war in the first part of the twentieth century, and the Communists were well aware of the potential of caviar to bring cash.  They controlled almost all the caviar supply by 1927, and they really controlled it, making sure it stayed a luxury.  When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the caviar cartel was ended and poaching began.  Capitalism has been deadly for the last sturgeon populations.  Thousands of poachers who needed the money swarmed onto the Volga, prices tumbled, and so the poachers had to increase their take to keep going.<br />There is at least one researcher who is experimenting with \\"milking\\" the eggs from a live fish without killing it, so that she might bear again.

White sturgeon are being raised in California, and Siberian sturgeon in France.  Sturgeon farming is up against more problems than salmon farming; for one thing, sturgeons take ten years to mature sexually, so investors are looking at ten years of no profit and even no income. An attempt to farm sturgeon on the Volga means that huge quantities of sturgeon manure go downstream, and undoubtedly some of the farm-bred varieties will escape and breed with the wild fish, changing genes and spreading disease.

Saffron writes, \\"In humanity's feeble attempts to protect and preserve the plodding sturgeon, we are reminded that we can't help altering the natural world even when we try our best to rescue it.\\"  This is a detailed, colorful history of a unique product, and a sadly less-than-unique report on human greed and ecological improvidence.for the last sturgeon populations.

That's what Paul Lewis did.  He's a humorist and English professor, and his new word is one of the many reported in _Predicting New Words: The Secrets of Their Success_ (Houghton Mifflin), an amusing new way to look at new words by Allan Metcalf.  Every dictionary which lists Lewis's coinage \\"frankenfood\\" and goes to any detail on its etymology will have to list him as the inventor (author?) of the word.  \\"Frankenfood,\\" meaning genetically modified comestibles, is a clever, funny new word.  It gets its point across clearly, and will probably be around as long as genetically modified food itself is.  Score a big one for professor Lewis, but beware: he has subsequently tried coining other new words, some of them seemingly clever and useful, but none of them have caught on.  Metcalf's book tries to show why some new words catch on and why some don't, and how to make predictions.  Maybe his prediction system is quite good; we will have to wait a couple of generations to see what words stick or fall away as it predicts, but even so, this is a fascinating look at how words come into being.<br />It is surprising that so many new words are created every day.  You might even make a few yourself, like President Bush does; he comes up with words like \\"misunderestimate\\" rather frequently, but it isn't surprising that a lot of other people have come up with that one, all on their own, too.  Often people perceive a need for a word and want to invent one to fill that need.  This seldom works to make a lasting word.  For a few decades we have been pondering replacements for \\"boyfriend\\" and \\"girlfriend,\\" since older people are doing a lot of dating these days.  It would be nice to have a word that meant \\"he or she\\" so that one wouldn't feel pressed to go for the ungendered but ungrammatical plural \\"they\\" as in \\"If anyone wishes to leave, they may do so now.\\"  As the millennium rolled over, we wondered if after leaving the nineties, we would be entering the \\"aughts\\" or \\"naughts\\" or \\"oh-ohs,\\" but the decade still has no agreed-upon name, and maybe we will have to wait for the twenties for an easily namable decade.  Words do not rush in to fill all gaps.  But many of the new words here have surprising stories.  \\"Scofflaw,\\" though it sounds like something Shakespeare could have used, was invented in a contest in 1924.  A member of the Anti-Saloon League offered a $200 prize for a word to mean \\"a lawless drinker, menace, scoffer, bad citizen, or whatnot.\\"  The word was widely publicized, and became immediately popular, although the original aim to deter such scofflaws seems to have failed.<br />Flashy words don't tend to last as well as the unobtrusive ones; in this way, an evolving language is something like an evolving jungle, with the fittest surviving.  Since the American Dialect Society still is picking Words of the Year, Metcalf has proposed a rule that will more accurately predict a word's success.  It is the word's FUDGE factor, an acronym of \\"Frequency of use\\" (popularity), \\"Unobtrusiveness\\" (seems like something we already know about), \\"Diversity of users and situations\\" (whether it is used by people in many different arenas), \\"Generation of other forms and meanings\\" (how fertile it is in creating derived forms), and \\"Endurance of the concept\\" (whether the thing it describes stays around so you need the word to describe it).  This is all well and good, for a professional word prognosticator, but the rest of us can enjoy this new way of looking at our complex and amusing language, with many interesting examples, presented in an original book.e a word that meant \\"he or she\\" so that one wouldn't feel pressed to go for the ungendered but ungrammatical plural \\"they\\" as in \\"If anyone wishes to leave, they may do so now.\\"  As the millennium rolled over, we wondered if after leaving the nineties, we would be entering the \\"aughts\\" or \\"naughts\\" or \\"oh-ohs,\\" but the decade still has no agreed-upon name, and maybe we will have to wait for the twenties for an easily namable decade.

How can we have almost completely forgotten an industry that employed thousands, created millionaires and monopolies, and sent an American product around the world, changing forever the way people dined and drank?  Oh, the answer is artificial refrigeration, but before that there was the commercial ice trade, and before that, people simply did not have ice cream, mint juleps, and fresh fish that could keep in the markets.  Beyond being an exposure of a surprisingly secret history, this book is the story of an entrepreneur, Frederic Tudor, who may never have heard the phrase \\"Find a need and fill it,\\" but who did just that, showing commercial ingenuity and perseverance that ought to make this a textbook case of American business acumen.<br />Tudor, born in 1783 to a wealthy Massachusetts family, was more interested in making his fortune than in getting an education, and dropped out of college.  On a trip to Havana in 1801, he discovered that it was hot, and that no one would sell you a cool drink, for there were none to sell.  But at home in New England, they had ice on ponds and rivers every year, ice that uselessly froze and then melted as the seasons changed.  The ice was mostly a nuisance, restricting river traffic, and there were tons and tons of it.  Tudor merely had to get it from cold lands to hot.  This, of course, was the problem, a problem solved with Yankee ingenuity in design of ice houses and ice cutters and of insulation for cargo ships.  He went through bankruptcy, incarceration for debt, and a mental breakdown in making his dream become a reality.  Originally, people sneered at him; a trade in ice seemed as ridiculous to those who had never heard of it then as now.  But Tudor, having developed thriving business to New York, Charleston, Havana, and New Orleans, hit his supreme mark when his brig reached Calcutta in 1833 with two-thirds of its ice cargo intact.<br /> Tudor's commercial triumph offset his sometimes disastrous speculations in sea salt, graphite, and coffee, so that he ended his life a very wealthy man.  He was the first trader in ice, and others saw the profits he was making and went into the business for themselves, forming an enormous industry throughout New England.  One of the reasons so little is remembered about it is that it seldom figured in any official trade statistics.  It was neither mining nor farming, so it was not taxed or regulated.  It was only by the years of the First World War, over fifty years after Tudor died, that mechanical refrigeration to manufacture what used to be harvested from ponds and rivers, began to make a real dent in the ice trade, although some river and pond ice continued to be traded until the middle of the twentieth century.  As Weightman says, \\"All of this huge industry simply melted away,\\" but the enterprise was so enormous, so complicated, so revolutionary, and so very strange that it is a real pleasure to read his preservation of Tudor's life and works.n his brig reached Calcutta in 1833 with two-thirds of its ice cargo intact.  <br /> Tudor's commercial triumph offset his sometimes disastrous speculations in sea salt, graphite, and coffee, so that he ended his life a very wealthy man.

He had hatcheted his lover to death while she did the dishes the year before.  He was a nobody, unremembered today but celebrated at the time because he was the first prisoner sentenced to die in the electric chair.  Under the terms of the new New York law, the Electrical Execution Act, he got \\"a current of electricity, of sufficient intensity to destroy life instantaneously\\" rather than being hung.  Kemmler's history, and the often bizarre story of how that first execution came to pass, is told in _Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair_ (Knopf) by Richard Moran.  Moran has found that the problems of adopting this novel method of execution at the time mirror our own problems over capital punishment, because of the universally felt ambivalence on the subject.  Although we are all sure that our stances on the death penalty are the right ones, our society acts as if it is not at all sure, and given the recent overturning of capital cases based on DNA testing, it is surely right to be unsure.<br />Electrocution was advocated as a humane improvement over hanging, but it was promoted as commercial propaganda.  Electricity was being wired into homes via two systems, the system of direct current advocated and sold by Thomas Edison, and the system of alternating current pushed by George Westinghouse.  Edison opposed capital punishment, but realized that making Westinghouse's system the basis for execution would reinforce that it was a dangerous current, unsuitable for customers' homes.  Direct current was safe, Edison maintained, but alternating current was \\"the current that kills.\\"  Before the word \\"electrocution\\" was coined, as there was no word for executing by electricity, Edison proposed that condemned criminals be \\"Westinghoused.\\"  No amount of his propaganda could have made direct current easy to transmit or easily transformed from high voltage transmission to low voltage home use, but without Edison's efforts, the push to install electric chairs would not have been nearly so strong.  Most states eventually switched from hanging, despite the botched electrocutions that revolted observers.  Kemmler's was one of these, requiring a couple of jolts before he had ceased breathing, but leaving him frothing at the mouth and stinking up the execution room with the smell of his burned flesh.<br />While there were more successful electrocutions which were quiet, quick, and scentless, no one knew at the time whether the procedure was painless (although many maintained it was), and this is still a matter of some controversy.  No one really knows the details of the internal process, and no one lives to tell us if it hurt.  Moran's exhaustive book traces the legal acceptance of electrocution in our country, with courts at different levels assuring all that it may have been \\"unusual\\" when it was novel, but is no longer, and it was not cruel since it seemed to be fast, at least in some cases, so it is not \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" forbidden by the Constitution.  The electric chair has continued to be used and \\"remains the only electrical appliance that has not undergone major modification since its invention more than one hundred years ago.\\"  When we have to apply euthanasia to our pets, we would never take them to a veterinarian for electrocution, and the system of intravenous injection seems as painless as any could be.  The Gerry Commission examined the use of injectable morphine, but thought that such a painless descent into permanent sleep would unnecessarily rid execution of a needed scare factor.  This fascinating book shows that of such judgments, and corporate shenanigans, was electrocution born.o transmit or easily transformed from high voltage transmission to low voltage home use, but without Edison's efforts, the push to install electric chairs would not have been nearly so strong.

Of course, the military, the church, sports teams, and letter carriers all have their uniforms, but then so do lawyers, doctors, and businessmen.  In these less regimented occupations, there is a universal dilemma: \\"Everyone must wear a uniform, but everyone must deny wearing one, lest one's invaluable personality and unique identity be compromised.\\"  So writes Paul Fussell in _Uniforms: Why We Are What We Wear_ (Houghton Mifflin), a funny look at all sorts of intentional and unintentional uniforms.  Fussell is a historian with plenty of hefty, well-regarded books to his credit, but here he has adopted a perfect light tone for what he admits is \\"unabashedly a book about appearances.\\"  In over thirty chapters, some only a couple of pages, some full of research, some personal essays, Fussell has called attention to the way we dress, something he shows we are already paying a great deal of attention to anyway.<br />Of course, uniforms are most closely associated with the military.  It shows up in surprising ways.  Despite any Bolshevist tendencies, Russian uniforms had style and elegance, perhaps as a compensation for the poverty of the officers.  The tendency for lesser states to compensate by overdress in uniform is cited here repeatedly.  The pictures of the Japanese surrender on the _USS Missouri_, for instance, show \\"the triumphant Allied officers in their informal, unpretentious khakis, pressing forward for a sight of the humiliated, overdressed Japanese officers and diplomats wearing standard hot uniforms and striped trousers, black tailcoats, and silk top hats.\\"  The crisis in current military uniforms is that they are looking the same, in different services and in different nations.  Camouflage patterns have become the style.  \\"The hope was that the infantrymen would look like leaves or some natural flora and thus deceive the enemy.\\"  American commanders can choose between the most popular \\"Woodland\\" version, also favored by hunters, and the alternates \\"Desert,\\" \\"Arctic,\\" and \\"Urban,\\" the last one \\"imitating building surfaces like stucco, concrete, and brick.\\"<br />But this is decidedly not a book about military uniforms only.  The Catholic religion, baseball and basketball teams, the Salvation Army, police, brides, firemen, doctors and nurses, academics in dress robes, chefs, the Mounties, the National Park Service, war reenactors, the Ku Klux Klan, the Boy and Girl Scouts, and many more uniformed services are treated here.  There is only a bit of organization to Fussell's book, though there is plenty of insight and humor.  The subject is a perfect one for some joshing, but it is serious all the same.  He reminds us, \\"Dressing approximately like others is to don armor against contempt. Better to be not noticed at all than noticed and targeted as odd.\\"and the alternates \\"Desert,\\" \\"Arctic,\\" and \\"Urban,\\" the last one \\"imitating building surfaces like stucco, concrete, and brick.\\"  <br />But this is decidedly not a book about military uniforms only.

E. Hotchner.  Hotchner may have done some latrine duty in his time, but it wasn't latrine duty that kept him from getting a Medal of Honor.  It was show business.  It is hard to be a hero, he reflects, but his book is a chronicle of how he sincerely tried to get a chance to show some heroism, and how (though he did his assigned Army Air Force duties with aplomb) he never got that chance.  There are many fine memoirs of World War II service, with the last ones coming out now as that \\"Greatest Generation\\" passes on.  This one is a funny, unique tale of typical military snafus that often sounds as if it was a chapter in _Catch-22_.<br /><br />Hotchner was eager to do his duty, and he knew just what he wanted to do, become a combat Navy pilot, because he admired the naval attire Dick Powell had worn in a movie.  He persuaded a friend to join him in application to Navy pilot training.  The friend got in; Hotchner failed his depth perception test.  He then persuaded another friend to join him in regular naval officer training. The friend got in, and Hotchner was disqualified for flat feet.  But he did get to enlist in the Army Air Force, and was overjoyed to apply to bombardier school.  But somehow, his personnel file indicated he had written a musical in college, so he was required to write one for \\"I Am an American Day.\\"  He wrote as badly as he could, and the troops loved it.  Hotchner got accepted to bombardier school, but General Fickle liked the show so much, he ordered Hotchner to perform it in all the states under his command instead.  Eventually he was going to go into combat, but since he had theatrical experience, his next commander figured he was just the one to make a film about patrolling for U-boats, instead of actually patrolling for U-boats.  When he finally was shipped to Europe, he learned in passage that Germany had surrendered.<br /><br />Hotchner may have turned his repeated disappointments into amusement after many years, but his slim volume reads wonderfully well as one big joke on himself.  He has breezy raconteurship for so many funny stories, but there are some episodes that are serious reflections on his times.  He has a meaningful encounter with Clark Gable, for instance, going through excruciating military training as a way of getting through the pain of the death of his wife Carole Lombard.  He tells us about how New Yorkers wouldn't let a man in uniform pay for his own dinner and drinks, and he shows how women were liberated at the time occupationally and sexually.  It isn't his fault this isn't a memoir full of battle heroism, but the war effort was diverse, and his is a unique story.y was shipped to Europe, he learned in passage that Germany had surrendered.<BR> <BR>Hotchner may have turned his repeated disappointments into amusement after many years, but his slim volume reads wonderfully well as one big joke on himself.

It was not the most significant match of the century, though.  That designation more fittingly belongs to the 1997 battle between Garry Kasparov and the computer Deep Blue.  Now there is an engrossing history of how the match came to be, told by Feng-Hsiung Hsu, who founded the Deep Blue project, _Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion_ (Princeton University Press).  We know the outcome of the final match, but even so, this is an exciting story.  It would help to be at least slightly conversant with chess rules, in order to understand some of the drama of the final battle, but this is not essential any more than knowing about the design of silicon chips, which was Hsu's particular role.  This is less a technical account than a recollection of a very human endeavor.<br />Hsu was a computer science graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, having emigrated from Taiwan in 1982.  A member of the Artificial Intelligence faculty asked him in 1985 to help with the design of a chess machine.  Hsu and his team, approached the task as an engineering challenge, not as an attempt at artificial intelligence.  He took the project with him when he finished academia and moved to IBM.  The engineering challenges spelled out here over a fifteen year period are enormously complicated.  In the eventual machine, \\"...every single one of those 36,000 transistors for the chess move generator was drawn by hand on a computer.  I also hand routed every single wire on the chip.\\"  The climax of the book, of course, is the 1997 six game rematch, played on a Deep Blue that could hunt out 200 million moves in a second.  The excitement before the match was considerable; tickets were being scalped for $500 and a security guard was even punched by a photographer eager to snap a picture of the opponents at the table.<br />At one point, Hsu writes about a shockingly aggressive move made by the computer, \\"Deep Blue obviously had no idea that it was playing Garry Kasparov.\\"  With good humor, Hsu reflects on the paradox of an insensate machine eventually defeating possibly the best human player ever (never having lost a previous match).  \\"Is it intelligent?\\" people wanted to know from Hsu after the famous contest.  Hsu knows: \\"Deep Blue is not intelligent.  It is only a finely-crafted tool that exhibits intelligent behavior in a limited domain.\\"  Nonetheless, this is an insider's view of a fascinating achievement.  Deep Blue may only be a finely-crafted tool that cannot really think, but it has given its humans plenty to think about.le.  <br />At one point, Hsu writes about a shockingly aggressive move made by the computer, \\"Deep Blue obviously had no idea that it was playing Garry Kasparov.\\"  With good humor, Hsu reflects on the paradox of an insensate machine eventually defeating possibly the best human player ever (never having lost a previous match).  \\"Is it intelligent?\\" people wanted to know from Hsu after the famous contest.

Would you like to win it by solving a math problem?  You have entered the right millennium to do so.  There's a million bucks waiting for you if solve any one of seven problems, all of which are something like this: \\"Prove that every harmonic differential form (of a certain type) on a non-singular projective algebraic variety is a rational combination of cohomology classes of algebraic cycles.\\"  Oh, dear.  It is clear that you will be up against a task more daunting than just twisting a Rubik's cube.  Keith Devlin has taken on the daunting task of explaining _The Millennium Problems: The Seven Greatest Unsolved Mathematical Puzzles of Our Time_ (Basic Books) to a lay audience.  He knows it simply isn't going to be possible, and he has plenty of apologies.  \\"Don't feel bad if you find yourself getting lost,\\" he advises for one of the problems, \\"Most readers will.  Like many parts of modern advanced mathematics, the level of abstraction is simply too great for the nonexpert to make much headway.\\"  And don't worry about the difficulty; even among experts, about one of the problems Devlin says, \\"... not only is there no 'smart money' on whether the conjecture will turn out to be true or false, there isn't even a consensus as to what it really says.\\")<br />So, why are these problems at all worth thinking about, by anyone other than eggheads who might have a crack at winning the million dollars for each one?  First of all, the million dollar prizes are just a way of getting some publicity for higher math.  The prizes were announced in May 2000.  The money was committed by a mutual-fund magnate Landon Clay, who just finds math a fun hobby and likes to support mathematical research.  One important reason to understand these problems, even just a little, is to try and understand what mathematicians do.  Abstractions may be piled on abstractions, but these are not puzzles unconnected to the real world; the solutions will bear on communications, cryptography, nautical and aeronautical engineering, and much more.  The announcement of these problems is similar to David Hilbert's announcement of 23 essential problems a century ago.  Not only did he lay out mathematical effort for the twentieth century: it worked.  All of the problems were solved, except for one.  It is no surprise that that one, the Reimann Hypothesis, is one of the current seven.  It has to do with the frequency and distribution of the mysterious prime numbers.  Perhaps in the current century, building on all the previous attempts to solve it, someone will see the problem in a new way and it, too, will fall.<br />Devlin, in a very good-humored book, reminds us, \\"Still, it's important to remember that mathematicians belong to the same species as you.  (Trust me on this.)\\"  The prizes are out there to draw attention to the effort, but no mathematician is going to work on one of these problems in order to get rich.  Anyone who without the prospect of a million-dollar prize would balk at the years of study required to grasp these problems \\"simply doesn't have the requisite commitment to mathematical research.\\"  It isn't hard to imagine that a boffin who works at this sort of problem is just the type to find much more joy in solving it than in adding many more digits to a bank account.  On the other hand, it is hard to imagine that someone would pick up Devlin's book and consequently win one of the million dollar prizes (although there are a good many math kooks out there who are still engaged in follies such as trisecting the angle; this book cannot help but increase their efforts).  Solving the problems can't be done on the basis of the descriptions here, as lucid as they might be.  But that's not the point; trying to understand even in a superficial way the famous puzzles described here is not only a challenge in itself, but enables one to participate a little in the newest frontiers of the oldest intellectual endeavor our species has undertaken.s undertaken.	2002-12-10

But if you open it up and start reading, there seems as if there is something wrong: &quot;Wing Commander G. Leonard Cheshire arrived at the Royal Air Force's aerodrome at Woodhall Spa on the morning of April 24, 1944 ...&quot;  It is a surprising start to an amazing story, written by William Nothdurft, with a co-author credit to Josh Smith, the leader of the most recent expedition to find the Egyptian dinosaurs.  That expedition repeated the hunt in the area in 1911 by Ernst Stromer, a German physician who had caught the paleontology bug.  Throughout the book, Stromer's story is interwoven with Smith's, in a narrative that is more exciting than that about fossil hunting has any right to be.<br />Stromer's makeshift expedition was heroic.  He traveled to the Bahariya Oasis in the Saharan desert, specifically looking for fossils of ancient mammals, and was unprepared to send back the monstrous bone specimens he found.  He got back to Munich, but it was only after years of delay (the Great War didn't help) that he got all his specimens.  Eventually, as a result of British bombing raids in 1944, and because no one would heed his warnings that his fossils needed special protection, the specimens were lost when their museum was bombed.  No paleontologists returned to the uninviting Bahariya for decades, until Josh Smith, a graduate student, got the idea of going.  The book has an excellent account of the trip, the politicking for funds, the dangers of the field, and the excitement of making a scientific difference.<br />Besides being a history, and a personal account, however, _The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt_ tells how paleontology has been done in the past and is done now.  The bizarre roles of good luck and bad run through both Smith's and Stromer's endeavors.  Smith's expedition verified Stromer's findings and made their own, including the second most massive dinosaur known, _Paralititan stromeri_ (note the tribute in the species name).  It also shows the importance of the expedition to paleontology overall.  Smith and his fellow explorers were able to answer Stromer's riddle of how the huge meat-eating dinosaurs of the area found anything to eat; Stromer described mostly predators.  There were discoveries, too, about the ecosystem that is now desert; the geologists on the team (one of them Smith's wife) discovered that the best explanation for the varieties of dinosaur they found in the desert is that millions of years ago, it was not desert at all, but a coastal mangrove swamp.  There are plenty of surprises here, with an attractive cast of eager young paleontologists who take on the roles of fools rushing in where experts fear to tread.Smith's expedition verified Stromer's findings and made their own, including the second most massive dinosaur known, _Paralititan stromeri_ (note the tribute in the species name).

He was the sculptor that put the faces on Mount Rushmore National Memorial.  The enormous heads in the South Dakota rock look calmly out to the great beyond, almost as if they were natural formations.  Their conception and completion were far from calm, however, and in _Great White Fathers: The Story of the Obsessive Quest to Create Mount Rushmore_ (PublicAffairs), John Taliaferro has told the tumultuous story of Borglum's life and life work, as well as the turbulent history of the mountain itself.<br />Borglum was a bigger than life figure who insisted on puffing himself up any way he could.  He insisted that he was the American Phidias, and like many such supremely confident people, he was torn by the idea that others were plotting against him.  He returned from art training in Europe to find that his nation was enthusiastic about commemorative sculpture, and he began entering competitions for such things as the design for the memorial to Ulysses S. Grant.  He did not win that one, and groused that the jury suspected his entry could not have been made by an American, so they disqualified it.  He had similar excuses and similar paranoia in many of his failed endeavors.  The Daughters of the American Confederacy approached him in 1914 to carve a memorial on the side of Stone Mountain in Georgia.  He signed on to do the work, which the Ku Klux Klan supported financially.  And Borglum supported the Klan.  He did not become an officially robed member of the organization, but he attended its rallies and supported its aims.  He was fired from the job, but the boosters who hired him for South Dakota didn't know about any such problems.  He worked for it for decades, dying of cancer in 1941, whereupon Congress declared the monument finished.<br />Taliaferro has not just written a biography of Borglum, and a fascinating history of the big project, but also a history of the mountain.  He includes the Indian Wars of the 1870s, the shameful violations of treaties made with the Indians, and the labor to match the faces of the great white fathers with an even bigger sculpture of Crazy Horse on a nearby mountain.  He covers the demonstrations and protests that have been centered at Rushmore in recent decades.  The Lakota tribe frequented the Rushmore mountain for centuries for specific ritual purposes, and it is not surprising that they should feel a loss from when the mountain was in its natural state.  Taliaferro even includes a description of a recent biker festival, and of course a few pages about Hitchcock's use of the setting in _North by Northwest_.  His book even includes reports of the campaigns to have Ronald Reagan added to the mountain, and Elvis Presley, and the most longstanding and fervent campaign, that for Susan B. Anthony.  It is an entertaining historic, geologic, and artistic tour.n.

It would be nice to bring that chaotic world in to a room, or even into a cabinet, and sort it all out, top to bottom.  There have been those who have tried this, collectors who aspired to gathering parts of the world that would sum it all up, and place them together so that those parts could reflect upon each other.  This quixotic aim is beautifully depicted in a big illustrated book, _Cabinets of Curiosities_ (Thames & Hudson) by Patrick Mauri&egrave;s.  You can look at the lavish illustrations here, and gain a bit of understanding of the obsessions of the collector, and you might look around your own relatively meager curios, and recognize some envy.<br />Mauri&egrave;s speculates that the precursors of such cabinets were the relic collections in medieval churches.  Such collections might have started with supposed pieces of saints or of the True Cross, but eventually included bizarre tangents like a vial of milk from the breast of the Virgin, or the rod used by Moses.  The magical air of such a collection, but these cabinets were secular, built not by monks, but by kings and other wealthy men.  As collectors perfected their assemblies, they sought out rarities, and this tended to make the collections full of idiosyncratic freaks.  These sorts of marvels were to fill the viewer with wonder, but tastes in such things change.  As the eighteenth century approached, wonder itself was regarded as a \\"low, bumptious form of pleasure,\\" a credulousness which was out of place with scientific enquiry.  Mauri&egrave;s demonstrates that even though the collectors tried to emphasize relationships between the items in the cabinets, the surrealists were equally good at assembling items whose conjunctions would be without meaning.  There is a picture of the surrealists' exhibition in Paris in 1936, and although the cabinet is metal and glass, it contains found objects, bones, and mathematical sculptures that any curiosity collector would have valued.<br />Mauri&egrave;s's tour of strange collections of strange objects is great fun.  His chapters about the history and fate of such collections, and the personalities that engaged in them, reflect a deeply intellectual appreciation.  But _Cabinets of Curiosities_ is a picture book.  There are reproductions of old prints showing how the collections used to look, as well as photographs of cabinets which still remain, and the strange objects of desire that filled them.  It makes a good-looking volume.  Pictures here include the cherry pit carved with thirty miniscule heads; ivory worked into seemingly impossible spirals, linked rings, and spheres within spheres; a jeweled cup with dragons horns (which are actually warthog tusks); portraits of \\"cat people\\" abnormally covered with hair; mechanical insects; and much more.  Beautifully laid out, these pages are curious, indeed.s's tour of strange collections of strange objects is great fun.

It's a lot of baggage to load upon a pop song, but it is an amazing little song, and the book has a brisk story told with real love of the music and how it was shaped and how it shaped us.<br />It's a good thing that Irving Berlin didn't write about a Christmas \\"just like the ones I used to know.\\"  He was born Israel Baline in 1888 in a bleak town in Siberia.  Russian peasants, drunk with Christmas cheer, often used the holiday as an excuse for pogroms against the Jews, and his first memory is of his house being burned down.  Berlin got no formal musical training, but produced hundreds of songs.  In January 1940, Berlin worked over the weekend on a song he became very enthusiastic about.  He bustled into his office that Monday morning and said, \\"I want you to take down a song I wrote over the weekend.  Not only is it the best song _I_ ever wrote, it's the best song _anybody_ ever wrote.\\"  Christmas 1942 was the first that masses of Americans, soldiers and sailors all over the world, would spend away from home, and could only dream of Christmases just like the ones they used to know.  Crosby's version was shipped to them in recordings, and it topped the Hit Parade as a patriotic anthem, displacing \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition.\\"  The song signaled that recordings and performers were in and sheet music and songwriters were out.  In 1957, Berlin tried to squelch an Elvis Presley version, but couldn't.<br />Rosen's clear, fully researched book is an essential biography of an American song classic, and will improve your understanding every time you inevitably hear the song again.  It encompasses important ideas about the history of modern music, Jewish influence and assimilation, patriotism in song, and the evolution of celebrating Christmas.  It is not strictly a Christmas book, for it is about much more than just the season.  But it would be fine for those looking for serious and interesting reading for the holidays, or as a gift book for readers who think they have already heard all the song has to say.n.

They didn't get mawkish or act as spokesmen for the downtrodden, as Chaplin did.  On screen (and, let us be grateful, off screen, as well) they were friends.  They may have dumped paint buckets over one another's heads or sat on one another's hats, and they caused an enormous amount of set destruction wherever they went, but there was kindness and caring between them.  A fine, big dual biography now places the two within cinema and world and comedic history, _Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy: The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy_ (Thomas Dunn Books) by Simon Louvish.  The author, who has done previous biographies of W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers, has an intellectual appreciation for Laurel and Hardy films, but his book is relatively free of theorizing about what made the pair such classics.  He has not forgotten the main virtue of the team: they are funny.<br />Laurel was born in Lancashire in 1890, of a theatrical family.  His father was a minor stage star and author of some literally melodramatic plays (and though he turned out proud of Laurel's success and fame, never really took pride that it was done outside of the legitimate theater).  He came to America with the same troupe that brought Chaplin.  Hardy was a southerner from Georgia.  He was fat all through his life, and like so many \\"different\\" kids, he learned to be entertaining as a way of diverting others from mocking him.  He was a gifted singer, and would sing in the theater, his theater when he ran a small-town movie house.  It was his entrance into show business.  The two performed in a film together in 1921, but didn't become a team until 1927.  Unlike many silent film performers, they had little difficulty making the transition to sound.  They were lucky to have as a frequent director the great Leo McCarey, and Louvish pays compliments to the straight men who played with them, like James Finlayson and Edgar Kennedy.  When the depression came, their roles as forgotten men who were ready to take on any work that came their way easily caught the mood of the time.  The splendid _The Music Box_ of 1932 was a version of the Sisyphus myth, with \\"The Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company - Foundered 1931\\") trying to deliver a crated player piano up a ridiculously steep set of outdoor steps.<br />The friendship of Laurel and Hardy is the theme of all their films, and Louvish takes us through all the major ones.  They are childish men in many ways, and they damage each other's pride and step on each other's toes repeatedly, but the friendship always works and continues beyond every exasperation.  \\"Here's another fine mess you've gotten me into\\" is known as their tag line, but the plaintive \\"Why don't you do something to _help_ me?\\" means much more, even though the help might have turned out to be much worse than no help at all.  Louvish gives us plenty of details of the lives of these unforgettable clowns, and it has to be said that their off-screen lives were pretty ordinary.  Perhaps Hardy was right, for instance, when he modestly said, \\"There's very little to write about me. I didn't do very much outside of doing a lot of gags before the camera and playing golf the rest of the day.\\"  But Louvish shows that those gags before the camera, and the friendship on screen and off, have made Laurel and Hardy far more than just geniuses of slapstick.and Louvish pays compliments to the straight men who played with them, like James Finlayson and Edgar Kennedy.

The Mountain Meadows Massacre involved the slaughter of 120 men, women, and children, and although the technology of massacres has now far overtaken it, it was one of the worst mass murders in US History.  No one disputes these facts, but there is a good deal of dispute about the details.  _Blood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows_ (University of Oklahoma Press) by Will Bagley, who writes for the _Salt Lake Tribune_, gives details, but since the book demonstrates the involvement of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the massacre, it will be a controversial effort.  Bagley shows, however, that the church has long campaigned to keep details of the massacre hidden, and he gives documentation that the reason for this is that leaders of the church provoked the killings and members of the church committed them.  Even though stories of Mormon complicity in the massacre were present immediately afterwards, and have been demonstrated by historians in this century, the church has continued to deny culpability.  The deniers will have to contend with this big, well documented book.  It cannot close the issue forever; one of the lessons of Bagley's history is that history itself can never be fully written.  This is to the chagrin of Mormon leaders.  At a memorial ceremony in 1999, president of the church Gordon B. Hinckley declared that it was \\"time to leave the entire matter in the hands of God\\" and ordered: \\"Let the book of the past be closed.\\"  Fat chance.<br />Bagley knows what he is up against.  The fate of the Fancher party's wagon train from Arkansas until its doom can only be reconstructed from problematic reports: \\"Almost every acknowledged 'fact' about the fate of these murdered people is open to question.\\"  However, Bagley has firmly placed the massacre within larger church history.  He demonstrates why the Mormon leaders viewed the presence of Arkansans going through the state as an outrage against them.  He shows how they were already expecting a showdown by the US Army because of their famous polygamy, their refusal to install a reliable court system, and Brigham Young's tendency to make pronouncements like \\"I live above the law and so do this people.\\"  When the Fancher party passed from Salt Lake City into the impoverished southern Utah, interpreters were available to rally the Indians, and the book gives evidence that Young himself had encouraged the Indians to seize the valuable stock of the well-supplied wagon train.  Various church officials of the region organized the Indians, and painted themselves up to look like Indians; this happened without a doubt, though church officials will disagree that it happened to the extent that Bagley has well documented.  All, saving some children under seven years old, were slaughtered in separate scenes of bloody chaos.  The questions about Brigham Young's involvement before the massacre will always remain, and Bagley shows how the Mormons have argued that their prophet could not have committed any such evil.  The evidence he gives here is plain, however.<br />Bagley not only gives a history of the massacre and its aftermath, but also a history of the histories about it, graciously noting how much he has depended on the work of Mormon historian Juanita Brooks.  Bagley has confirmed most of Brooks's findings, and has new material to report. This is not just newly-found fading documents from dusty archives, although there is plenty of that.  He can summarize new forensic evidence, from a dig to make a new memorial at the Mountain Meadows site in 1999; the bones, some of women and children, had not been damaged by the clubs or tomahawks of Indians, but by the bullets of Mormons.  Bagley's smooth narrative makes fascinating reading, and his well-referenced arguments clear up much of what happened at MountainMeadows, before, during, and after the massacre.  He writes that although there is much obscure in the matter, \\"Its causes and effects are not an impenetrable mystery.\\"  He shows that those who think of themselves as God's anointed have chosen to rely on mystery and have failed to admit or atone for crimes that history has made plain.Meadows, before, during, and after the massacre.

In _Sweets: A History of Candy_ (Bloomsbury) by Tim Richardson, you will find these, but you can also find Scottish curlie murlies, gundy, and soor plooms (sour plums); Australian Fizzoes, pollywaffles, and Freddo Frog Chocolate Bars; and candy with a more-or-less international appeal, such as Cowpats which are shaped like you-know-what.  Tim Richardson has, in researching and writing this book, transformed himself into the world's first international confectionary historian, a designation he frequently, with self-deprecating humor, bestows on himself as he tells us about his efforts on our behalf.  It's a wonderful post for him.  He begins his book, \\"My grandfather worked for a toffee company.  My father was a dentist.  So I have always had strong feelings about sweets.  But I have never been confused.  I like sweets.  I like them a lot.\\"  The enthusiasm shows on every page.<br />This is not a recipe book.  Though many of the candies might be made at home, Richardson concentrates on manufactured sweets, and the recipes for them are deeply guarded secrets.  Candy is so complicated that it is virtually impossible to copy a sweet exactly without inside information.  Not only the recipes are closely guarded, but the machines and processes, too, and often Richardson didn't get a peep.  But when he did get admitted to a factory, he was delighted: \\"...every time I entered one I was delirious with joy, ecstatic that the machines were exactly as I hoped they would be.\\"  Comparisons with Willy Wonka's factory are unavoidable.  Richardson covers the long association of sweets and medicines; often in the past apothecaries and confectioners had bitter rivalries.  It was not simply that \\"a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down;\\" sugar preserved medicines and helped bind pills together.  Shaping sweets into fanciful statues has a long tradition.  The Duke of Albemarle a couple of centuries ago commissioned a tower of sugar eighteen feet high, inhabited by gods and goddesses; it was too tall to get into his banqueting room.  These days we have more modest gingerbread houses adorned with candy for the holidays, but marzipan, sugar, and spun sugar used to be carved into ornate sculptures of windmills, temples, and ruins to make table decorations.<br />There are countless sweet plums pulled out here, amusing details about a universal human interest produced with the sort of good humor that the subject deserves.  Richardson's puns are actually worth savoring; in a section on the eighteenth century's low price of sugar and high price for handmade sweets, he tells us \\"A good confectioner could make a mint.\\"  Richardson has informed us of his own favorites here, in a happily personal book of international history, and the boiled sweet known as Rhubarb and Custard is his top choice.  \\"It is said that on his deathbed, the novelist Aldous Huxley called for a dose of mescalin, the hallucinogenic drug.  If ever I find myself in a similar situation I will not call for mescalin.  No, a quarter of rhubarb and custards will suffice.\\".

Probably it is the most controversial of all recreational drugs, as there are few people actively organizing for the reform of cocaine or heroin laws, but many would like to see marijuana laws changed.  The debate on just how the laws should change and how marijuana ought to fit within American society has been plagued with misinformation long before the substance was made illegal by the federal government in 1937.  The history, myths, and facts about the drug are set out anew in _Understanding Marijuana: A New Look at the Scientific Evidence_ (Oxford University Press) by Mitch Earleywine.  The book is extremely useful as a summary of the research that has been done on marijuana; there are twenty-five pages of references at the end to guide anyone who needs further information.  Only a specialist will need the references.  _Understanding Marijuana_ is a broad and fair summary.<br />There is an enormous amount of misinformation about the drug, and while those that favor use and legalization may have spread their share of misinformation, the history of marijuana in the twentieth century and entering this one is a history of one scare tactic after another wielded by government agencies and individuals who wish to suppress marijuana use.  Earleywine's book spends one chapter after another summarizing the experiments and statistics to debunk the most common scare stories.  Cannabis intoxication does not lead to hostility, violence, or a climbing murder rate.  Marijuana is not a gateway drug.  There is no amotivational syndrome from marijuana use.  College students who use marijuana get the same sorts of grades as students who do not.  Earleywine was taught in junior high that marijuana smokers would have Cyclops-like children, but the drug has not been linked to birth defects, nor to a definitive decrease in reproductive function.

Not only has Earleywine summarized a lot of data here, he writes clearly and entertainingly, often with a sly joke as a gift to a reader swimming in a sea of data.  For instance, he writes about interesting studies that show that marijuana users learn to smoke efficiently, gauging their lung capacity and the amount that can be held without coughing, so that they get more out of a joint than new users.  \\"Many eventually learn to inhale and report more impact from the drug.

To be sure, he has many, as befits a writer, printer, scientist, inventor, pamphleteer, statesman, and Founding Father. Now there is a remarkable small one, _Benjamin Franklin_ (Yale University Press) by Edmund S. Morgan. The author has won various prizes for history writing, but it is clear that he loves this subject. The book was begun as a preface to a digital edition of Franklin's works. Morgan writes that scholars have struggled to come up with every scrap that Franklin wrote, and it will all eventually fill around fifty printed volumes. It is all now \\"available on one small disk, a product of those inconceivable discoveries he dreamt of.\\" Morgan has read all the disk \\"but not much else\\" in order to write a purposely short book (300 pages) as \\"a letter of introduction to a man worth knowing, worth spending time with.\\" This is not a standard biography; we do not learn about his forebears and his birth, nor do we attend him at his death. There is no speculation about the mother of his son William, and little about his common-law wife Deborah. This is not because of restrictions of length, but more because Morgan has limited himself to what Franklin wrote and did publicly, and his book works perfectly as introduction, or re-introduction.<br /><br />Morgan says that Franklin is hard to know, in part, because \\"it is so hard to distinguish his natural impulses from his principles.\\" For a focus on his main endeavors, however, especially his political ones, this biography does very well. Those who think all the founding fathers were firebrands insisting on independence at the first unfair tax will learn that Franklin was England's passionate friend. He wanted America and England to stay together and was reluctant to admit that Parliament was not going to change its ways. Although he had had many friends in Britain, the government did not value him at all. Philadelphians and Americans in general had a closer idea of his original genius. But it was in France that he encountered public adulation from all levels. John Adams preferred more traditional power games, and disliked the French lionization of Franklin as a hero and saint. (Adams really had his vanity bruised; he said that Franklin's life in France was \\"a Scene of continual Discipation.\\") Franklin did not like controversy; he thought polemics were wasted energy. He did not join a church (although he was a joiner) for like most of the best-remembered Founding Fathers, Franklin was not a Christian but a deist who, as befits his practical views, knew that gaining morality and virtue was the important thing, and the means by which they are gained (which some said could only be by Christianity) was no matter at all. This was heresy to the religious revival of the time that said faith was everything.<br /><br />Living with virtue was important, but living usefully was Franklin's great aim. (He also aimed to have fun; long after he had retired from the printing business, for as long as he could physically manage the difficult press machines, he remained his own printer, issuing his sly jokes and bagatelles.) It is hard to imagine anyone who achieved an aim of utility more fully. This volume reports mostly on his political usefulness to the new nation, but almost all aspects of his life were committed to making improvements. His classic _Autobiography_ is a record of self improvement, but it is obviously written with the aim of providing means and an example for the improvements of others. His scientific endeavors were not just theoretical sallies; they produced lightning rods and fireplaces that benefited humanity the world over. His founding of a volunteer corps of firefighters and of a public library are legendary. Concentrating on his political thought and social endeavors, Morgan's book is an attractive introduction to one of the brightest and most lovable minds ever.in general had a closer idea of his original genius.

It is still being done, for it is still the best means for getting the exact location of a hurricane and details such as its speed and direction.  In the more than half century of countless such patrols, only one aircraft and crew have been lost.  Their story is told in _Stormchasers: The Hurricane Hunters and Their Fateful Flight into Hurricane Janet_ (Norton) by David Toomey.  Toomey has gone back to look at Navy documents, interviewed members of the former Weather Reconnaissance Squadron to which the flight belonged, and talked with members of the crew's families.  The book has a framework of a reconstruction of the mission of the September 1955 flight, and does so with as much detail as could possibly be gathered so many years on.  The story might in itself be a little thin, but Toomey has as well given a broader picture of the history of hurricane science and general meteorology.<br />Reports of hurricanes at sea began to become practical after ships got radios; the first wireless report of a hurricane was in 1909.  The program of reporting storms was a victim of its own success; ships' captains so well knew the danger of hurricanes that one report would send all ships steaming away from the source, making further data collection impossible.  No one seriously proposed flying an airplane into a hurricane, because no one knew what such a flying environment would be like.  The first flight into a hurricane was performed on a bet, in 1943, and afterwards other pilots wanted to try, and meteorological data started being taken.  By 1955, the Weather Bureau, Navy, and Air Force had been sending official flights into massive storms for about a decade.  The mission led by Navy Lieutenant Commander Grover B. Windham into the dangers of Hurricane Janet in the Caribbean took place in a PV2 Neptune, which looked a little like the legendary B-17, and could take a similar amount of punishment.  Toomey has recreated the flight from its beginning, out of the base at Guantanamo.  He can only speculate about its end; there was a final transmission from the plane, &quot;Beginning penetration,&quot; which meant they were entering the storm.  No trace of the plane or crew was ever found, and Toomey has written three possible fatal outcomes.<br />The details of the flight itself are well presented (and may well remind readers of The Perfect Storm), but the digressions into the important history of meteorology are fascinating.  We are invited to admire that genius of amateur science, Benjamin Franklin, who noted in 1743 that a storm seemed to have tracked from Philadelphia to Boston, and who was the first to speculate that such storms travel along the country but contain winds different from their overall direction of movement.  There were attempts in the last century to track a hurricane by seismograph.  The reduced pressure would lift up the Earth's crust of the ocean floor, and there was some success in triangulating earthquake-type shifts detected at different stations.  We no longer call hurricanes exclusively by women's names, but even in 1955, the practice was not uncontroversial.  Forecasters excused themselves by saying that &quot;like women, every hurricane is different, they are generally unpredictable, and they can make men feel small and inconsequential.&quot;  Besides, no flier wanted to declare that he had &quot;penetrated Charlie;&quot; but in 1979, men's names started being used as well.  _Stormchasers_ nicely contrasts chapters recounting the sad fate of the fliers into hurricane Janet with chapters containing an often inspiring story of scientific enquiry.ary B-17, and could take a similar amount of punishment.

The result, _A Year at the Movies: One Man's Filmgoing Odyssey_ (HarperCollins) is, as you might expect from Murphy, a good deal of fun.  He is, after all, the guy who tells us, &quot;over the course of ten years on the TV series _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, I hefted a fifteen-pound plastic puppet over my head for an obscene amount of money.&quot;  Murphy was not just puppeteer but a writer of the show, in which he (as robot Tom Servo) and his pals made wonderful jokes while really bad films played on the screen.  The bad part of watching all those bad movies was that he started losing his taste for movies in general.  Worse, he noticed that multiplexes were erupting everywhere, and lots of people (including himself) were exiting the movies less happy than when they went in.  &quot;Something had to be done, and I was the man to do it.&quot;<br />To do it, he went all over the world, to metroplexes as well as film festivals and hole-in-the-wall theaters.  He rode theme rides at a Hollywood movie park.  He went to the same date movie six times, with six different women, one of whom was his wife, and another his mother-in-law.  He worked at a multiplex.  He ate nothing but movie theater food for a week.  He even watched the wretched _Corky Romano_ (but he did call upon fellow MST3K buddy Michael J. Nelson, and beer, to help get him through that one.)  He knows plenty about movies, but this isn't really a book about movies; it is a book about watching movies.  If you want authoritative words on why movies these days can be wonderful sometimes but usually aren't, or how to sneak a full Thanksgiving dinner into a theater, or how to pick your seat, or the best theater in Hollywood, or how to creep unauthorized into Cannes Film Festival screenings, this is your book.  Much of the book reads like a very quirky travelogue.  Visit a theater made of snow and ice in Quebec, or the world's smallest commercial theater (22 seats, in Australia, and a moviegoer's paradise), go to the best film festival ever in Lapland, where movies are shown all day, and daylight is 24 hours.<br />Plenty of the metroplex experiences were painful, mentally and physically (Murphy has many complaints about Hollywood), but much that happened to him in his moviegoing year was fun and even sweet.  On 11 September 2001, he was at Raratonga in the Cook Islands, thinking about human suffering and in comparison &quot;my silly little movie project,&quot; and worrying about how his friends in New York were.  The proprietor of the Empire Cinema found the only two American flags and put them out on the street, to show they were mourning, too.  &quot;And the Empire Cinema was fuller than usual, with people looking for some togetherness and a little healing.&quot;  Movies can do it, the good ones (the 11 September showing happened to be the lovely Irish film _Waking Ned Devine_).  And it is pleasing to know that despite all its crankiness against Hollywood and the metroplex system, Murphy's book documents his return to a love for going to films; his epilogue begins, &quot;Wait a minute.  It's over?  So soon?  No, please, so many more things to see, places to see them!&quot;  Murphy's original and funny book is recommended if you love going to the movies, and want to read about someone who did it lots more than you ever will, and who can write with enthusiasm and joking breeziness about a full year of doing so.Visit a theater made of snow and ice in Quebec, or the world's smallest commercial theater (22 seats, in Australia, and a moviegoer's paradise), go to the best film festival ever in Lapland, where movies are shown all day, and daylight is 24 hours.<br />Plenty of the metroplex experiences were painful, mentally and physically (Murphy has many complaints about Hollywood), but much that happened to him in his moviegoing year was fun and even sweet.

His nightclub routines, full of the worst of the four letter words, made fun of stuff which people, especially his contemporaries, were supposed to take seriously: religion, marriage, intimacy.  However, _The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American Icon_ (Sourcebooks) by Ronald K. L. Collins and David M. Skover, makes plain that the iconoclastic Bruce had enormous respect for the law.  His rooms were cluttered with tapes, court transcripts, and legal research efforts, and he wrote letters to judges trying to explain how his comedy was legally protected speech.  He even showed civic respect for the policemen who were so often out to get him.  Bruce saw that it was his job to change the law, and while he never really managed that, he made historic changes by fighting battles that those after him would not have to fight.  The authors of this engrossing book have found that his story is virtually absent from the history of the First Amendment; this is a corrective.<br />Bruce was arrested many times for obscenity, but particularly interesting in this book is the demonstration that what often drove the arrests was irritation about his blasphemy.  Bruce had routines that could bother any denomination.  After mockingly accepting Jewish responsibility for killing Jesus, he roared, \\"We Jews killed Christ, and if he comes back, we'll kill him again!\\"  He had a hilarious routine in which Christ and Moses come into the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral, to the embarrassment of Cardinal Spellman and Archbishop Sheen, who have to telephone the pope to explain (\\"_Of course they're white!_\\").  We have no blasphemy laws in this country (to the dismay, still, of some), but he was literally brought up on blasphemy charges.  Blasphemy could not stick, but obscenity might.  The problem Bruce had was that according to the Supreme Court decision in _Roth_, a work had to be taken as a whole, but the cops and prosecutors always concentrated on the specific words.  The vice squad informers could, during a performance, tally every naughty synonym Bruce used for genitalia or coitus, and then present the list for consideration by the grand jury.  Consideration to the sweep of Bruce's satire was seldom given.<br />As demonstrated in this comprehensive and well referenced volume, by two lawyers who obviously love their subject and enjoy explaining First Amendment issues, Bruce has had a resurrection.  There have been plays and movies, but more importantly, as George Carlin (who was once arrested for attending a Bruce performance) said, \\"Lenny opened all the doors, or kicked them down.\\"  The nightclubs and comedy clubs are now open for anyone, with the sensible idea that if you might be offended by what you hear, don't pay to go in.  A stand-up comic might fear bombing on stage, or getting heckled, but because Bruce has already taken the heat, no comic has to fear getting arrested.  Within this book is a CD of Bruce giving some of his most famous routines, and commentary by admirers and detractors.  On it, Margaret Cho, who continues in the tradition of offering outrageous satirical commentary, says that she knows part of her job, as Bruce's descendant, is to disrupt polite society, but she knows what has gone before: \\"I don't want to end up like him, but I want to be like him.\\"d on the specific words.

Serious stargazers just do it better than most.  In _Seeing in the Dark: How Backyard Stargazers Are Probing Deep Space and Guarding Earth from Interplanetary Peril_ (Simon & Schuster), Timothy Ferris tells about some of the ones that do it best.  A lifelong stargazer, Ferris has his own observatory in the California wine country (he writes about how it was planned and built).  He is not a professional astronomer.  He is a journalist, one who has produced fine books about science before, but this one is close to his heart, and his enthusiasm is easily apparent and beautifully described.<br />As an amateur himself, Ferris is able to describe the importance of amateur astronomy, and the surprising ways in which the big telescopes on mountaintops used by the professionals, and the Hubble, have not put amateurs out of business.  He shows many ways that amateurs are useful, doing explorations and finding objects that throw more light on explaining such serious theories as the Big Bang.  One amateur explains, \\"In how many areas of science can you still make an important discovery without a ton of funding?\\"  There's some prestige in making such discoveries, but one supernova hunter spoke for thousands when he said, \\"I can't really tell you why I do it.\\"  There is a good deal of basic astronomy here, and someone interested in starting in the field will get good advice on doing so.  However, this is only partially an astronomy textbook.  Even better is that Ferris has given interviews and small biographies of amateur astronomers to give us an idea about how their passion affects them.  Take, for instance, John Dobson, who got thrown out of his Krishna monastery because he kept leaving it at night to go use his telescopes.  His vow of poverty meant he had to make cheap ones, but he found ways to use scrap plywood and piping to make large telescopes that amateurs could afford.  He would set up a scope on the sidewalks of San Francisco and call out, \\"Come see Saturn!\\"  If a kid came by and showed real interest, Dobson might give away the telescope and build another one.<br />Ferris's book is an inspiration.  Even if you have no intention of ruining your sleep with this sort of activity, it is impossible to withhold admiration from the ones who do love it.  Ferris writes with clarity and fervor about the endeavors of his fellow stargazers, and puts their efforts into a broader perspective, as part of the human condition.  \\"We observe, and try to understand, and formulate ideas that, if we're honest with ourselves, we will admit to be 'not quite right.'  But we keep trying, knowing that we'll never figure it all out but trusting that if we persevere we shall keep doing better.\\"make cheap ones, but he found ways to use scrap plywood and piping to make large telescopes that amateurs could afford.

Mark Edmundson is a professor of English at the University of Virginia, a contributing editor to _Harper's_, and has a bunch of other intellectual chops.  It might have turned out differently for him if it weren't for one teacher; he had all the makings of a punk, a television addict, and a sports fan who longed for his days of high school football glory.  That he turned out differently he credits to one teacher, and in _Teacher: The One Who Made the Difference_ (Random House), he introduces us to him.  He also introduces us to a bunch of minor teachers and role models (not necessarily good ones), many goofy classmates, and, in a book full of openness and acceptance, his own unattractive adolescent self.<br />For Edmundson says, &quot;When I encountered Franklin Lears, I was a high school thug.  I was a football player, a brawler, who detested all things intellectual.&quot;  Lears looked peculiar and he was.  Unlike the other teachers, he did not have a set lesson plan full of facts that were to be installed into the heads of his students.  He had a capacity to listen and to accept the students' ideas as interesting and worth considering, without imposing his own.  He couldn't make immediate changes in their attitudes, and he couldn't change everyone, but some of them eventually got to accept that thinking was useful, was within the capacities of even football jocks, and above all, was fun.  Lears abandoned the planned textbook, and settled on books that people were talking about at the time, _The Autobiography of Malcolm X_, _Siddhartha_, and _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_.  Besides the booklist, Lears brought the influence of Socrates, and Edmundson makes plain that the analogy of Lears to Socrates and of Medford High students to listeners in the Athenian agora is not forced and not ridiculous.  Socrates (ostensibly, at least), took nothing on faith, questioned everything including what everyone else accepted either unthinkingly or with solemn thought, accepted the thoughts of others as good points of departure for reasoning, and he knew how to laugh.  Lears, too.<br />The book has memorable portraits of fellow students, and especially Edmundson's father.  It is best at demonstrating that the old Socratic method still works, and can still inspire ambition.  Simple questioning, and insistence on introspection and putting answers into words, created something Medford High had not seen before.  &quot;This was a class that people looked forward to going to, that we talked about all the time, nights and weekends.&quot;  There is much about good teaching in this wise book, and much about living well.  Lears only taught a year before going off to law school, and Edmundson has not attempted to keep up with him.  It is nice to think, however, that he will pick up this volume and recognize how much effect he had, and how much erudition and clarity he has inspired in this particular student.analogy of Lears to Socrates and of Medford High students to listeners in the Athenian agora is not forced and not ridiculous.

Hurricanes?  Tornadoes?  Floods?  Add those up and they will still not total the deaths attributed to the real killer: heat waves.  The other phenomena yield good pictures, and that is one reason you don't hear much about heat deaths.  But according to Eric Klinenberg, an assistant professor of sociology at New York University, there is another, more subtle reason.  Victims of a heat wave \\"are primarily social outcasts - the elderly, the poor, and the isolated - from whom we customarily turn away.\\"  In _Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago_ (University of Chicago Press), Klinenberg has looked at the week-long heat wave of July 1995, which killed over 700 people.  (Another comparison: the famous Chicago fire of 1871 killed about three hundred.)  In Chicago, the heat hit up to 106 degrees, with a heat index over 120.  Cars broke down in the streets, and bridges, rails, and roads buckled.  Even with the windows open, brick homes could heat up to 120 degrees.  The heat killed, but it did not just kill randomly.  In clear, objective, but often biting pages, Klinenberg shows the patterns of urban life that brought death to certain regions and certain social groups.<br />One group was the elderly, clearly disproportionately killed by the heat.  This might be attributed simply to their bodies having fewer physiological resources to protect them.  Indeed, the government of Chicago tried to explain the deaths of elders this way; the heat only culled those who were going to be dying soon anyway.  There is no medical evidence that this was the case; they simply were unconnected with society, and when they died alone in their rooms, it was long before absences were noticed.  Klinenberg argues forcefully that the Chicago government, at different levels, did not respond to the disaster as it would have a big fire or a train wreck.  When deaths mounted, Mayor Daley was able to frame the issue as a \\"debate\\" about the rising number of deaths, when there was no scientific controversy about the matter.  Human Services Commissioner Daniel Alvarez did a classic move of blaming the victim, saying, \\"We're talking about people who die because they neglect themselves. We did everything possible. But some people didn't want to even open their doors to us.\\"  The media also come in for criticism.  They took up the artificial controversy generated by the mayor about whether the heat deaths were \\"real\\" or not.  There was little analysis about which regions were being the most affected and why, and the official city version of how little could be done against an act of God was repeatedly parroted.  By the time the reporters did a comprehensive story, it was \\"old news\\" and didn't run.<br />No one was more forgotten than forty-one victims whose bodies no one claimed or cared about.  They languished in the county morgue until August, when they were buried in a huge common trench in a potter's field.  Visiting the site in preparation for the book, Klinenberg learned that a few reporters had come now and then to see it, but no Chicagoans and no family members.

The answer is that they are the only nations not to have embraced the metric system.  Inevitably, they will; their scientists all use it, and cars are made by it, and trading with other nations requires it.  The inevitability of victory of the metric system is something Napoleon himself recognized: &quot;Conquests will come and go,&quot; he declared, &quot;but this work will endure.&quot;  The work he spoke of was the defining of the meter, and it was a task begun in the final days of the French monarchy.  In 1792, two French astronomers set out separately on the quest to make an accurate measurement of the globe, a measurement that would enable people to use the constant of the size of the globe as the foundation for rational weights and measures.  Their plan was to measure enough of the distance of a north-south meridian through Paris that they would then be able to calculate the distance from the equator to the north pole, and one ten-millionth of that natural distance would be the meter.  They aimed for unprecedented precision, and they got it, but they didn't get it exactly, for fascinating reasons all wonderfully told in _The Measure of All Things: The Seven-Year Odyssey and Hidden Error That Transformed the World_ (The Free Press) by Ken Alder.<br />It seems a simple task; a line of longitude from Dunkirk south to Barcelona would be mapped and calculated by triangulating high points, like mountains and steeples, along the line.  In practice, it was devilishly, maddeningly, and lethally difficult.  Weather, disease, the ravages of time, superstition, politics, and war all conspired to make the work of a few months stretch into years.  The astronomer Delambre, heading north, was mistaken for an aristocrat, detained, and suspected of using a church tower as a royalist beacon.  His partner M&eacute;chain, who took the southern route, had similar problems, and worse ones, as war with Spain erupted while he was in Spain.  He had a fiendish obsession with exactitude, and made measurements of Barcelona's latitude by reckoning from the stars.  Unfortunately, they were wrong due to refraction from the atmosphere, and M&eacute;chain knew they were wrong, but couldn't get them right.  The knowledge of the error tortured him for the rest of his life.  M&eacute;chain's error is not the error referred to in the book's subtitle.  All the triangulation work had shown that the critics had been right from before the beginning, for the work could not produce a perfectly precise meter; the world was too irregular for that.  The astronomers' work had produced, however, documentation of the more interesting fact of Earthly irregularity.<br />This story could not have been presented in a more dramatic and entertaining manner.  An epic about the foundation of the metric system might seem to be impossible, but Alder has made the personalities interesting.  He has also made clear the process of triangulation, the equipment required, and the scientific philosophy of what an error actually is.  He has well described the history of the period, and the failures of the French Revolution, such as the calendar containing twelve months of three ten-day weeks each, or the clock with ten one-hundred minute hours in a day.  Beside the origin of the admirable metric system of weights and measures, Alder has also given a brief history of how the world has adopted the system, which Americans ought to know about, since, with reluctance, we are having to use it more and morend worse ones, as war with Spain erupted while he was in Spain.

It is a question that has been argued about ever since, and as with all such big questions there are lots of answers and the sum of them always prove unsatisfactory; a mystery still remains.  Nonetheless, a new part of the answer was published in Germany in 2000, and caused a sensation.  The book, _Defying Hitler: A Memoir_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), was actually written in 1939 and had remained secret.  It was written by Sebastian Haffner, the pen name of Raimund Pretzel, while he was in English exile from Germany.  The manuscript was interrupted by the outbreak of war, at which time Haffner put it away in order to write a more urgent book on how the English might best win the war.  Haffner went on to become a highly respected British journalist and man of letters.  He forbade his son from looking through his old papers until after his death.  He died in 1999, and his son, Oliver Pretzel, found the manuscript in a drawer.  Having published it in the original German, Pretzel has now translated it into English.  A valuable work, it not only throws fresh light on the rise of Nazi power, but gives vivid pictures of how life was lived as the dictatorship progressed.<br />Haffner traces some of the roots of the rise of Nazism come from The Great War.  He was seven years old when the war erupted, and he recalls how invigorating the time was for him.  The schoolboys' experience of war at home, Haffner says, gave them an indifference to lack of food, but more importantly it gave them a taste for excitement, for marching, for militarism.  When Hitler came, his unspoken promise to repeat the great war game, and win it, easily found a receptive audience.  Haffner had lost his jingoism by the decade after the war, though his contemporaries had not.  Haffner began to study law, and became a law clerk in Prussia's courts, with the promise of rising in the legal ranks.  Haffner loved the legal system for many reasons, not the least of which is that the law functioned from day to day, undisturbed by the moral morass caused by the Nazi revolution.  He thought this a triumph over the Nazis.  But one day, while he was going through legal documents within the quiet and solemn library of the court, he heard a growing disturbance in the corridor and doors being banged.  A Jewish clerk packed his papers and left.  There were shouts of \\"Out with the Jews!\\" and a few of the clerks giggled that they were already gone.  A Jewish attorney, a wounded veteran of the previous war, \\"caused a fuss\\" and was beaten up.  Soon a brownshirt was inspecting the nose of Haffner himself and asking if he was an Aryan.  \\"Before I had a chance to think, I said 'Yes.'... What a disgrace to buy, with a reply, the right to stay with my documents in peace!... I had failed my very first test.\\"  It is this sort of detail and introspection that make this book so valuable.<br />Regrettably, this is an unfinished narrative.  How we would like, after such a memoir, to hear about how he became a novelist and journalist, and insisted on writing things he would not be ashamed of when the Nazis were defeated.  He met a Jewish woman and married her, becoming guilty of violation of the race laws but somehow evading prosecution.  He eventually arranged a visa to go work on articles about England, where he arranged to stay, even though he was interned in the camps for Germans.  His son and translator has provided a small amount of this story to add to the truncated memoir, but Haffner's words speak in clear horror of the threat going on around him, and within him.  It is an unforgettable addition to the histories of the time.n the legal ranks.

It's easy to  see an example of this: Las Vegas was built upon the fantasy that one might  walk away from the tables richer than one started.  Of course, it can  happen, but even the fools about to be parted from their money know that the  odds are against them.  It makes little difference.  We think we have an  intrinsic understanding of probability, but we do not.  A little book by statistician Bart K. Holland, _What Are the Chances?: Voodoo Deaths, Office Gossip, and Other Adventures in Probability_ (Johns Hopkins University Press) could improve understanding of some simple and some difficult matters in the laws of chance.<br />For instance, mathematicians evaluated the \\"Hot Hand\\" effect in basketball.  Players and spectators knew that there were times when a shooter was having a good string of hits, an obvious run that demonstrated a flow of particular skill.  But there weren't such runs; we are pattern-seeking creatures, and we can see patterns even in randomness, that is, when no pattern is there.  What's more, we are very likely to think the pattern can be used as some sort of prediction.  This is the basis of the classic \\"gambler's fallacy,\\" that in a random indicator, what has gone before affects what will happen next.  It \\"feels\\" right that if you toss a fair coin repeatedly and get ten heads in a row, that it is more likely that the next toss will be tails, but of course the coin has no memory of what has gone before.  Probability plays a role in actuarial tables, and there is a brief, fascinating history of life insurance; it used to be sacrilegious to offer life insurance (but not, say, shipping delivery insurance) because only God was supposed to roll those dice.  Holland also explains queuing theory basics, and answers the ultimate question:  Why is my line for the supermarket check-out going so much slower than the others?<br />The Voodoo deaths in the subtitle come from epidemiologic studies (Holland is a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology) which show that that patients who believe themselves marked by death for a voodoo curse are actually at greater risk for dying (or at least getting sick).  It can be shown, however, that nothing supernatural is happening.  The hex only works if the victim and his family know about it and believe the voodoo priest has the power to do such a thing; in other words, it has a reverse placebo effect.  The office gossip in the subtitle is a model of exponential spread, analogous to the spread of the plague, or to a nuclear chain reaction.  Holland has picked amusing examples, both esoteric and from everyday life, to illustrate the way probability profoundly affects all of us.  Chances are that any reader will be entertained and educated.the others?  <br />The Voodoo deaths in the subtitle come from epidemiologic studies (Holland is a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology) which show that that patients who believe themselves marked by death for a voodoo curse are actually at greater risk for dying (or at least getting sick).

The War on Drugs has been going on by name (and being lost), only for a few decades, but this represents merely a parochial view of the problem of drugs and societies. It might be better to take the long view, and this is what Richard Davenport-Hines has done in _The Pursuit of Oblivion: A Global History of Narcotics_ (W. W. Norton), a weighty volume that demonstrates that such wars have never been won in free societies, and have been waged at larger harm to their societies than the drugs themselves. A telling theme throughout Davenport-Hines's book is that just about anyone has wished for some sort of chemical aid towards taking the edge off life, towards making pleasure a little easier to get, and most people do indeed go for such chemistry of pleasure in some form. His contention that \\"absolute sobriety is not a natural or primary human state\\" is surprising and is inarguable, given the huge range of legal and illegal and temporarily legal drugs that humans have come up with. This will conflict with those who favor prohibition, and particularly with Americans whose brand of puritanism has always distrusted hedonism.<br />The distrust of drug use _by others_ seems universal, but _Pursuit_ gives, in its monumental length, remarkable stories of use in specific instances. Such details as these make reading _Pursuit_, with all its bulk, a hugely entertaining and enjoyable activity (recommended to all hedonists). It is good to see that the use of drugs crosses all times and all cultures. Davenport-Hines also makes the reading easy because, although there is a definite point of view to the book, it is much more a history rather than a polemic. But he does demonstrate that virtually every attempt to enforce particular prohibitions has increased drug profits and drug use. A president of Columbia explained, \\"The only law the narcoterrorists don't break is the law of supply and demand.\\" Prohibitionists can't break that one, either. Some of the specific tactics of the current war on drugs are shown to be silly and short-sighted. It would be different if these actions were making drugs unattractive, decreasing jail populations, and increasing the overall general health, but we do not see that happening.<br />Davenport-Hines shows the advantages of the Dutch system. Making marijuana and hashish available in coffee shops, for instance, lowered use of the drug, and separated cannabis and heroin suppliers. Intravenous drug use is treated as a chronic, relapsing condition, and social and medical services are made available, such as needle-exchange programs and sale of syringes without a prescription. By such means, the heroin addict population is simply growing older and new recruits are not joining their ranks. It is, of course, not certain that such steps would work in the American atmosphere, and it is even less certain that American puritanism would allow anything like them. But _The Pursuit of Oblivion_, comprehensive and well-referenced, makes clear that anti-drug policy now is little different than what has been tried for hundreds of years, and is just as unsuccessful. This is the sort of book that anyone involved in making drug policy, including those who vote for policy-makers, ought to be reading.of supply and demand.\\" Prohibitionists can't break that one, either.

For a symbol, Amnesty has a burning candle, a token of hope, enclosed by loops of barbed wire.  The meaning is conveyed instantaneously.  Barbed wire is easy to draw; since it is such a simple device with a simple design, only a few lines suffice to make a convincing picture.  Readily identifiable, barbed wire means to us prison and enclosure.  To Olivier Razac, author of _Barbed Wire: A Political History_ (New Press; translated from the French by Jonathan Kneight), it means a great deal more.  His revelatory little book is actually a long, illustrated essay to show how from a ranching tool, barbed wire has come a long way as a tool for brutality and repression.<br />_Barbed Wire_ is not a history of the subject, but of course it is necessary to mention its origin.  It is perhaps ironic that barbed wire had its beginning in the open prairie of the land of the free.  J. F. Glidden was a farmer who invented barb wire for plains farmers who needed a cheap means of fencing in their land.  Even as an invention for cattle control, barbed wire could not help but affect humans, and in unexpected ways.  It ended the classic cattle drive, putting out of work most of the cowboys who have loomed large in American mythology.  They may have lost their jobs, but the American Indians lost their culture, and it can be seen as a weapon against the indigenous peoples.  Barbed wire proved a useful weapon in subsequent battles.  Landscapes of World War One featured trenches supplemented with rows of the stuff.  It was easy enough to cut with simple shears, but of course you had to get close enough to do so.  Land torpedoes, nicknamed \\"wood lice\\" or \\"Schneider crocodiles\\" were invented to tunnel in and blow the wires up.  The best way to neutralize barbed wire was to blow it up with cannon fire, but when tanks arrived, ramparts and bunkers became important again.  It was the Nazis who made barbed wire a staple to represent their cold and brutal regime.  Its eternal advantages, cheapness, simplicity, and easy installation, made it indispensable.  When they built a concentration camp, it was the fence that went up first.  In the camps, barbed wire achieved the severest example of what Razac convinces us is its use in \\"the political management of space.\\"  It became \\"the symbol of the worst catastrophe of the century.\\"  It is still used in Palestinian refugee camps, of course, and our government would rather not show the wire all over Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br />Of course, barbed wire can be found atop fences surrounding factories or prisons, and we do not find this use politically oppressive.  Other uses of the wire within open democracies, Razac argues, have disappeared, because spaces needing control are now being watched by guards, video monitors, and electronic gates, some of which carry an Orwellian aura, but none of which have the immediate fearsome aspect of simple twisted and sharpened wire.  Razac's slim book exposes plenty of history within a commonplace object, one that those who complete the book will not see in the same way again.again.

When James Watson wrote the wonderful _The Double Helix_ in 1968, many of his scientific colleagues were scandalized, even though it was about how Watson and Francis Crick had fifteen years before discovered the structure of DNA.  It was perceived as unseemly to admit that they were racing other labs for the goal.  Nowadays, that's simply the way science is done in many cases.  It can have lamentable effects; the rush to get the research about &quot;cold fusion&quot; into print meant that other researchers did not have the chance to check the credibility of the experiments, and science as a whole suffered.  In the case of the Human Genome Project, the effort to find the three billion letters in the human DNA recipe, it was a race from the start.  In a book that will remind many of Watson's chronicle, _The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, and the Human Genome_ (Joseph Henry Press), John Sulston, who led the British team on the project, joins with Georgina Ferry, a science writer, to tell how the race was won, and by the good guys.<br />It won't surprise anyone that Sulston himself is a good guy in his own memoir.  Sulston and those who worked with him campaigned for money for their efforts, to be sure, but they were committed to making any data they uncovered public.  In the other corner was Celera, a private company headed by Craig Venter, a former public scientist who, as head of a private firm, understandably did whatever he could to ensure the profitability of that firm.  It was Celera's intention to map the genome, sell its data to those who wanted it, and patent genes.  Venter's publicity material hinted that there was slack and inefficiency among the project scientists at the public trough, and he invited them simply to stand down and get out of the way while he finished it up, and incidentally while he made millions from whoever wanted to use the data he uncovered.  Sulston had to speak out against the commercialization of the effort, and this put him squarely against those in America who think that commercial efficiency has every advantage against government stagnation.  The resultant public relations battle is fascinating; Venter was good at it, and the public and politicians early became convinced that public ownership meant little.  At one point Sulston says bitterly, &quot;Once a particular point of view has taken hold in the public imagination, it's extremely hard to offset it.  The only recourse is to compete on the PR front in the first place.  I find that a profoundly depressing thought.  Is it a fantasy that simply being honest will in the end be powerful enough?&quot;<br />This is a great story, one that will be mined in the future by historians of the epochal Human Genome Project.  The book is not a good text on molecular genetics, or even the specifics of sequencing which are the science part of the story, but it is a splendid discussion of how science is done nowadays.  (The &quot;beer-fuelled discussions&quot; between participants are recounted, as well as possible, in their place.)  The difficult aspects of the struggle between public science and private science get a thorough and thoughtful history here.

Uglow has given us a look at London in her fine biography of Hogarth a few years ago; now we have Birmingham, and the boundless optimism of serious scientific amateurs.  Uglow demonstrates that they really did change the world, bringing on the industrial revolution and making science the way to get things done.<br />The locale of Birmingham in the eighteenth century was made for such bustling men, for manufacturing had taken hold.  One of the Lunar Men was Matthew Boulton, who at age eighteen invented just the thing for fashion, the inlaying of steel buckles with enamel.  He became an industrialist whose patronage helped further the inventor James Watt.  Watt was busy as a young man trying to prevent the primitive steam engines from wasting energy, and having done that spent his life perfecting them, installing them around the country, and trying to keep others from stealing his ideas.  Josiah Wedgwood, the great manufacturing potter, also had a practical interest in science in such matters as regulating his kilns.  He also had a particular interest in the Lunar Men's project of the canal system, which was a focus for their technological and geological enthusiasms, as a way of getting raw materials to his factories and finished wares to London.  Perhaps the figure most central within the book is Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of the founder of the theory of evolution.  Erasmus himself had a primitive idea about evolution, and his ideas about competition were similar to those of Malthus, who would inspire Charles Darwin's central thesis.  Joseph Priestley experimented with gases and identified oxygen (under the eventually discarded phlogiston theory), as well as discovering the fundamentals of photosynthesis and inventing soda water.  He was as well a dissenting minister, within the Unitarian church, and his house was burned by the mobs rioting against intellectualism (there were fears that the philosophers would institute changes like those of the French Revolution), and his eventual self-exile to America was a mark of the end of the Lunar Men's most active time.<br />Uglow gives wonderful personal details about these men and a multitude of minor characters.  The amazing detail here represents a triumph of careful scholarship and digging into letters, chapbooks, and forgotten volumes.  The Lunar Men helped form their society in significant ways; Uglow is very good, however, in showing historic influences on them, and a reader will learn plenty here about the American and French Revolutions, as well as the Industrial one, and in science, the revolutionary schemes of Linnaeus and Lavoisier.  Best of all, this is a preservation of remarkable friendships cemented by the happy communal activity of learning things and experimenting.s regulating his kilns.

But the delightful book, _A Thread Across the Ocean: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic Cable_ (Walker) by John Steele Gordon, gives a lively history of an epochal achievement which was only eventually a success despite costly failures, calamities, and mistakes.  It is good to be reminded of just how difficult this beginning of our communications technology was to achieve, for as the title mentions, the story is indeed heroic.<br />The hero is Cyrus Field, a man of enthusiasm, determination, and optimism who would not let his cable idea die.  The appeal of the story is eventual success despite many heartbreaking failures, but as Gordon demonstrates, the failures were mined for lessons learned, and each subsequent attempt to lay the cable was a bit cleverer, a bit more comprehensive.  There were broken cables, unexpected storms, and suspicion of sabotage in the different attempts.  The public was wild with optimism and then wild with mockery when the cables failed.  One laid in 1858 actually worked to send a message from Queen Victoria, but slowly, and then went forever dead.  The final success in 1866 came in large part because of the gigantic ship _Great Eastern_, the final project of the brilliant engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel.  The huge ship was a bit of a white elephant, but was the only vessel capable of carrying all that cable almost three thousand miles at 3,575 pounds per mile.  The coiling it into different levels of the great ship without kinks was an engineering feat in itself.  The ship also took advantage of the perfected paying-out machinery and brake, developed by a wealthy amateur tinkerer, a device so successful that it is still used in laying cable today.<br />There is no real suspense to this story, of course; Gordon has, however, written an exciting tribute to Field, the other entrepreneurs, and the technicians who put an exceedingly difficult project into action.  The cable, after many attempts, many years, and many dollars, worked and became indispensable.  Two weeks after the cable was open for business, for instance, the market quotations in New York and London became equalized, as they could act together.  The _Great Eastern_ went on to lay five other cables, and by 1900 there were fifteen, with competition between the firms that ran them.  Wireless telegraphy, radio, and satellite communication have not made the cables obsolete; most transoceanic communication is still by reliable strands of wire, or of fiber-optics, beneath the sea.  _A Thread Across the Ocean_ vividly tells an important and overlooked story of perseverance and triumph.itten an exciting tribute to Field, the other entrepreneurs, and the technicians who put an exceedingly difficult project into action.

It's an impossible question, of course.  Perhaps one that might get closer to a real answer is, Who is the most influential architect who ever lived?  Witold Rybczynski has an answer, and it is a convincing one: Palladio.  In _The Perfect House: A Journey with the Renaissance Master Andrea Palladio_ (Scribner), Rybczynski looks at the villas Palladio produced around the mainland of Venice in the sixteenth century, not as historic monuments but as useful and beautifully architectured homes.  He places Palladio firmly within his times, but drawing on the classical architecture of Rome and drawn on by Inigo Jones, Thomas Jefferson, and countless others.  It is hard to disagree with Rybczynski's conclusion about Palladio's influence, and after this book, a reader is likely to see Palladian themes not only in grand homes, but in diminished form in modern suburban ones as well.<br />Palladio was merely the son of a miller or maker of millstones; the historical record is not clear.  He was trained as a stonemason, and early showed enough talent that Count Giangiorgio Trissino, of an old Vicenza family, noticed his ability.  This was his introduction to higher things, especially his ticket to Rome, where the ancient buildings proved a continuing inspiration for his villas.  He designed about thirty of them, several of which never were started and if started were not completed; clients of architects then and now faced over-optimism and reversals of fortune.  Seventeen survive, some in excellent preservation and some a bit seedy.  They are Palladio's main legacy, and remain beautiful and durable; most are still lived in.  Rybczynski gives a wonderful introduction to the tools at Palladio's disposal - pediments, porches, entablatures, apses, and more.  These were all juggled and adjusted in each specific case.  And while there is a unity to the composition of the villas, Rybczynski demonstrates that there is no such thing as a &quot;typical&quot; Palladian villa: &quot;Some of his designs incorporate temple fronts, some do not; some have pedimented windows, some have plain openings; some porticoes are supported by elaborate Corinthian columns, others by unadorned piers.  His fertile imagination brimmed with ideas.&quot;  Architects and artists have  been learning from Palladio ever since.  The book has the author's line drawings of each of the buildings, and some reproductions of Palladio's sketches or plans, but they are really not sufficient to understand the massings of space Palladio so expertly managed.  When I read the book, I checked up on various websites to get fuller pictures.<br />Rybczynski has lived for a short time in one of the villas, and his words on what make them special are worth reading, although no one will fully be able to explain it.  He gives enough examples from all over the world (in America, Monticello, the White House, local courthouses and countless southern mansions are Palladian buildings) to make entirely sufficient his argument about the architect's influence.  It is easy to catch Rybczynski's enthusiasm.  Those who don't know Palladio will find this book, which is a capsule biography, travelogue, and architectural appreciation, a fine introduction.  Those who are already Palladians will rejoice in the clear descriptions and the first hand accounts, coming from an experienced observer and an entertaining storyteller.ot;typical&quot; Palladian villa: &quot;Some of his designs incorporate temple fronts, some do not; some have pedimented windows, some have plain openings; some porticoes are supported by elaborate Corinthian columns, others by unadorned piers.

Those who lived on farms had animals of wider acquaintance.  Dale F. Lott was the grandson of the superintendent of the National Bison Range in Western Montana, and his father worked on the range as well.  He writes, &quot;I first encountered bison not as symbols of the West, the squandering of a natural resource, or a conservation triumph.  They were simply the animals I had seen most often when I was a young child - enthralling in and of themselves.&quot;  He went on to get his doctorate in biology, studying the huge animals he had grown up with.  In _American Bison: A Natural History_ (University of California Press), he sums up the basics of bison.  Thirty years of teaching seem to have given him an admirable power of storytelling, and his book is not only good for encompassing all the necessary natural history of the species, but also for his expression of personal encounters and feelings for the beasts.<br />In every chapter, Lott describes with no slight awe how well tuned evolution made these animals for their world, a world which is no longer.  The peculiar bison profile, for instance, the huge mound above the forelegs, the hanging head, and the skinny rump, equips them for quick motion around the front feet &quot;on which they pirouette on the sod like a hockey player on ice&quot;.  A bull has to be able to pivot and twist to protect his own flanks and to dig a horn into the flank of an opponent.  He says of the surprisingly complicated system of rumination, by which bison carry around bacteria to break down grass for their future digestion, &quot;It's so sophisticated that neither bison nor biologists would be likely to think of it, yet it was achieved by the perfectly purposeless, aimless, and automatic process of natural selection.&quot;  Lott has spent a good deal of time in what is left of the wild, watching these animals, and he reports on the complicated negotiations and social systems they have developed.  He has written not just of bison, but of the prairie itself, how it came to be, and how the bison, rather than just being predators of grass, kept the grass vibrant through the centuries before they were ranged in.  Part of the story has to be that the grasslands are no longer home to bison, and that the paying grasses we put on them are taking away the soil the bison helped build up.  Bison are in small herds, with a risk of inbreeding, or being domesticated, with a risk of losing their complex wild behavior.<br />The worrisome future of bison is not the theme of this book, though.  Throughout Lott shows an engaging eagerness to describe anything he has seen in his prairie fieldwork.  Cowbirds, for instance, used to be buffalo birds, roaming the plains with the bison and thus unable to stick around long enough to raise a family.  They can now stick around non-roaming cows, which do a sufficient job of stirring up insects for them to eat, but they still don't raise their own families; they still deposit their eggs in the nests of some other species which gets tricked to raising cowbirds instead of real progeny.  Prairie dog towns are favored by bison, as both animals like closely cropped grass.  The bison wallow around and damage the tunnels, but they also &quot;bring something to the party... Of course, buffalo chips don't produce a fertilizer as quickly as, say Miracle-Gro, so the bison are a little like a dinner guest bringing a bottle of wine so new it must be aged a few years to be palatable.&quot;  Ferrets, wolves, and grizzlies wander through these pages, too.  It is an evocative book, beautifully written, by someone who loves these magnificent and forlorn beasts and is obviously eager for the reader to get to know them, too.have developed.

It would be hard to convince them that such a book could be exciting, or even interesting, especially if it weighs in with the heft of a textbook.  But a remarkable work by historian Emily Thompson, _The Soundscape of Modernity: Architectural Acoustics and the Culture of Listening in America, 1900 - 1933_, ought to be enjoyed by non-specialists and those who know nothing about the science of acoustics.  Thompson has written a comprehensive, well-referenced, but witty and entertaining book about an important subject whose influence is surprisingly pervasive.<br />Thompson briskly reviews acoustic history; before this century, listeners knew there were better auditoriums and worse, but no one really knew why.  To create a new venue for the important Boston Symphony Orchestra, the architect consulted a young Harvard assistant professor of physics, Wallace Sabine, who may be dubbed the Father of American Acoustics.  In 1895, Sabine had been asked by the president of Harvard to improve the terrible acoustics of the lecture hall in the new Fogg Art Museum.  In studying the problem, Sabine learned that the important thing to measure within a hall was the time of reverberation, the dying out of sound echoing through the room.  This seems obvious now, but was the founding insight for all subsequent acoustical thought.  He developed an equation relating the absorbing power of the room and its furnishings to the reverberation time.  When Boston's Symphony Hall opened in 1900, the acoustics were an overwhelming success with critics.  There were carpers who gradually dissented from the praise, but the musicians and the audiences became familiar with the sound, and its reputation remains high.  Making beautiful sounds is but one aspect of acoustics treated in Thompson's book.  Chapters are also devoted to the shielding from ugly sounds which the machine age was producing.  Legal remedies for noise were largely unsuccessful, but there were brilliant successes in architectural use of sound-absorbing material to keep out the din.  Movies changed the way auditoriums sounded, and making them presented its own peculiar problems.  They had to have their camera sounds deadened and their studio lots coated to damp echoes, and the air conditioning (necessitated because the noisy carbon arc lighting had been replaced by quieter but hotter incandescent) had to be acoustically insulated from the production.<br />Thompson ends her fascinating study with the Radio City Music Hall, a progeny of the new electroacoustic science.  The hall was designed for the capture of sound by stage microphones and the projection of amplified sound into the highly absorbent and cavernous hall.  The system worked very well, but ironically, although the audience could hear every speaker as if they were close to the stage, only those physically close could see with equal clarity.  Live spectaculars failed, and the hall became a white elephant, playing mostly movies that people could see cheaper elsewhere.  But the theatrical amplification of sound became a standard; as the century wore on, theaters were designed to be \\"tunable\\" to sound gothic, baroque, or modern, without one \\"best\\" setting.  The soundscape we have become used to will continue to change, but Thompson's volume, full of clear, small essays and biographies, and cheerfully laced with humor and unobtrusive puns, is an insightful description of the origins of the sounds of the future.ted to the shielding from ugly sounds which the machine age was producing.

Our nation is used to hearing daytime talk show chatter about sexual abuse, homosexuality, prostitution, and more, but mentioning this universal and enjoyable practice as something that should be taught about (the religious right twisted her words into \\"should be taught\\") was enough to get Elders fired as Surgeon General.  Why was there such a hysterical reaction to a mention of masturbation?  Horowitz is a historian, a professor of American studies, and the one thing she could do to find an answer is historical research.  She has done a mountain of it, looking into obscure court cases, journals, and newspapers, to produce the monumental _Rereading Sex: Battles over Sexual Knowledge and Suppression in Nineteenth Century America_ (Knopf).  As the title reveals, Horowitz has not just covered ideas about masturbation (although ridiculous fears of that \\"evil\\" seem to have percolated through the minds of every parent and preacher of the time), but has covered the huge topic of what our predecessors thought about many aspects of sex.<br />The evangelical Christian movement sweeping across the country in the first half of the nineteenth century seized upon such worries about masturbators and lustful women, and \\"sinful lust became a chief way of comprehending sexual desire.\\"  The American Tract Society was particularly vehement on such issues, and was aghast at the scientific understanding of sexual function that was beginning at the time.  Especially important was the protection of female virginity, and fear of pregnancy was a vital shield of the nation's maidenheads.  Physiological explanations of birth control were seen as a special danger; unimpeded by fear of impregnation, there was no telling what the women would get up to.  Tractarians saw the freethinkers who promoted sexual knowledge as blasphemers.  Nothing shocked them more than the non-religious (and it was generally the freethinkers who promoted the spread of physiological ideas) insisting that women had similar sexual desires and need for satisfaction as men, or that birth control would promote happiness, health, and economic freedom.  It is surprising that the Young Men's Christian Association looms large in these pages.  The YMCA had as a goal the promotion of evangelical religion, and during the Civil War, it was worried about Union soldiers, displaced from home, and in 1865 the YMCA was able to advocate for a post office bill that would forbid mailing erotic prints and books, the first time the federal government tried to regulate moral content of mailed material.  The anti-sex activities of the YMCA were linked to the famous and foolish reformer, Anthony Comstock, whose censorious aims even kept birth control information out of medical texts.<br />Horowitz has summarized four \\"frameworks\\" out of the confusing discourse about sex during the period.  The Vernacular Tradition consists of sexual information (and misinformation) passed generally by word of mouth.  Evangelical Christianity hated lust and equated most sexual activities with sin.  Reform Physiology looked to the science of the body (often composed of wildly inaccurate assertions) to promote sexual freedom, and sometimes sexual restraint.  And then there were Utopians, who thought sex was the central part of human existence and should be untouched by the government.  These four voices, in the printed works and journals of the time, often overlapped and swamped each other with rhetoric.  The huge number of philosophies and personalities which played a role in the debate, and made a foundation for our current sexual ideas, are brilliantly distilled into this large, well-referenced book, which is an entertaining academic tome without ever being fusty or tedious.sexual knowledge as blasphemers.

Twenty-five years ago, there was a boom in sales of a fist-sized ingenious contraption of plastic, a fractured cube of multi-colored sides, the pieces of which could be twisted so that all the six faces had different colors (easy) or back to the one configuration where each face had only its own color (hard).  The ubiquitous Rubik's Cube came and went (well, it is a puzzle classic in its simplicity; you can still buy it, but the fad is gone), but there will be some other puzzle fad not long from now.  The urge to figure out puzzles seems to be as ingrained in human personality as the urge to make language or art.  In _The Puzzle Instinct: The Meaning of Puzzles in Human Life_ (Indiana University Press), Marcel Danesi, a professor of semiotics and anthropology, tries to figure out the meta-puzzle: life has lots of mysteries and complications.  Why should we want to manufacture more?<br />Danesi's book turns out to be a spirited review of puzzle history, and the history is a long one.  The _Ahmes Papyrus_, nearly four thousand years old, is one of the earliest surviving documents of civilization anywhere, and is essentially a series of mathematical puzzles.  It is significant that its title is _Directions for Attaining Knowledge of All Dark Things_.  Charlemagne, the founder of the Holy Roman Empire, had a puzzle-maker on staff, and King Louis XIII of France had a Royal Anagrammatist.  A description of Rubik's Cube is included, of course, as well as many other puzzle fads.  The popularity of crossword puzzles is undimmed since they were introduced in the _New York World_ in 1913; the original one is reproduced here.  Crosswords became an overnight sensation, and many people still have to do their crossword puzzle every day.  Anyone familiar with puzzle literature will find much familiar here; classics like the Towers of Hanoi, magic squares (the best one is by Benjamin Franklin), the River-Crossing Puzzle, and various optical illusions are all included.  The puzzle that gives us the exhortation &quot;Think outside the box&quot; is here, as is the four-color map theorem, Archimedes's Cattle Problem, cryptograms, and tangrams.  No one reading this book could deny that making and solving puzzles is a universal human trait.<br />But why?  Danesi finally comes to no certain conclusion, but there are some good reasons that he presents.  One is that all of us enjoy the &quot;Aha!&quot; experience, the inexplicable flash of insight that can present an answer to something the likes of which we have never before encountered.  Puzzles are escapism, but of a peculiar form invoking anxiety and curiosity after the puzzle is presented and pleasurably relieved only by finding the solution (or looking in the answer section).  The most satisfactory answer is that like pure science, solving puzzles has been good for us.  It is certainly true that working on puzzles is pleasurable, and can be instructive for the individuals trying to figure them out.  In a larger sense (and this is a theme presented repeatedly here), puzzles have sparked mathematical revolutions.  When Euler set out to solve the K&ouml;nigsberg bridge problem (citizens had known they could not walk around the river town crossing each bridge once and only once), he invented networks, and this eventually became topology.  The paradoxes of Zeno (such as the runner being unable to reach the end of a race because he first has to go halfway, and then half of the remaining course, and then half of that, ad infinitum) were a spur for developing the concepts of limits and calculus.  When Bertrand Russell tried logically to resolve his barber paradox (If a village barber shaves all and only those villagers who do not shave themselves, does he shave himself?), the resolutions themselves had paradoxes, and only G&ouml;del's famous Incompleteness Theorem showed that full resolutions would be forever impossible.  Puzzles are good for us, and this collection provides plenty to think about.at gives us the exhortation &quot;Think outside the box&quot; is here, as is the four-color map theorem, Archimedes's Cattle Problem, cryptograms, and tangrams.

When Euler set out to solve the Königsberg bridge problem (citizens had known they could not walk around the river town crossing each bridge once and only once), he invented networks, and this eventually became topology.  The paradoxes of Zeno (such as the runner being unable to reach the end of a race because he first has to go halfway, and then half of the remaining course, and then half of that, ad infinitum) were a spur for developing the concepts of limits and calculus.  When Bertrand Russell tried logically to resolve his barber paradox (If a village barber shaves all and only those villagers who do not shave themselves, does he shave himself?), the resolutions themselves had paradoxes, and only Gödel's famous Incompleteness Theorem showed that full resolutions would be forever impossible.  Puzzles are good for us, and this collection provides plenty to think about.	2002-09-12

There is more to Martian geography than that, and _Mapping Mars: Science, Imagination, and the Birth of a World_ (Picador) by Oliver Morton, barely mentions the Face, and does not stoop to debunk it.  Once again, real science is shown to be much more fascinating than fringe science.  _Mapping Mars_ provides a history of how we know what we know about the most nearly Earth-like neighbor, and shows how we are actively creating a world in our own image.<br />There have been generations of pre-rocketry astronomers who tried to make sense of our neighbor planet.  Morton gives a history of the English astronomers who named features on Mars after Englishmen, and French, Frenchmen, as well as Percival Lowell's certainty that he could see canals the Martians had made.  The detailed mapping, begun with the later powerful earthly telescopes, was not all done with photography.  \\"The well-trained human eye could seize such brief impressions, understand what was seen in them, and remember it,\\" allowing much more resolution than photographs, and the book is illustrated with examples of different artistic versions of maps and terrain.  Many science fiction books have tried to take in our understanding of the terrain and the ecology.  Movies, however, have not done a good job, disregarding science; \\"... the blatantly ignored scientific advisor on _Mission to Mars_ ... has been stoically bearing the ridicule of his colleagues ever since.\\"  The colors of the terrain and sky have become understood, after much haggling, but the status of water on the planet is still under debate.  Morton covers the debate about going to Mars, and if we do, should we be thinking of hijacking its ecology to transform it into something we could traverse without pressure suits?  Terraforming Mars, transforming it into something like home, sweet home, is on the minds of not just impractical visionaries, but geologists and chemists as well.<br />Morton has given a wonderful history of a very human enterprise, something we have accomplished and about which we can be truly proud.  His summary of what we know about this mysterious planet may need updating after the next lander starts sending back data, but his book will remain an important description of how we got where we are now.  He has a fine balance of a reporter's detachment and engagement with his subjects, and even the detailed scientific descriptions are clear.  At heart, however, his book is an optimistic and inspiring look at how scientists, astrophysicists, and dreamers sustain Mars as the obsession which it will always be.sform it into something we could traverse without pressure suits?

Part of the reason she had picked insects for her field is that they are very much unlike humans; she knows that studying primates, dolphins, or other mammals would be harder for her because of a human tendency to anthropomorphize.  She says that with insects \\"it is harder to see myself reflected in their behavior.\\"  That sort of recognition of how all of us react to animals informs her remarkable book, _Sexual Selections: What We Can and Can't Learn about Sex from Animals_ (University of California Press), which is full of information about the sex lives of our fellow creatures on the planet, what we have to learn from them, and why we can't apply what we learn to ourselves.  She shows that animals have incredibly varied versions of sex, and \\"... if we try to use animal behavior in a simplistic manner to reflect on human behavior, we will, in myriad ways, misperceive both.\\"<br />Zuk is a feminist as well as scientist, and is dismayed by the use of examples in biology to represent either feminism or \\"traditional family values.\\"  As a feminist, Zuk was initially heartened by the merging of environmental concern and women's rights into \\"ecofeminism.\\"  \\"Mother Nature\\" or some other Earth goddess is frequently invoked, but Zuk demonstrates her doubts that biological lessons show that females tend to be more caring, less aggressive, or more empathetic.  She gives examples of, say, reed warbler females who practice infanticide on rivals' eggs, or female wasps that battle fiercely to take control of a colony.  There is nothing wrong with showing that females do not have to be passive, but insisting that nature reinforces stereotypes of any sort will not only be futile, it will keep us from learning what animals are really doing.  Birds look so industrious and caring in their efforts to make nests and nurture their young that we tend to picture them as examples of propriety, and sermons have been written on the theme.  Especially with the advent of easy DNA testing, however, we are learning that males roam around to the territories of other males to intrude upon their females, and that the females were receptive of such attention.  Even in the scientific literature, judgmental terms such as \\"adultery\\" and \\"fooling around\\" have been used for such behavior; perhaps these are simply more fun to say than \\"extra-pair copulations.\\"<br />There are surprising revelations here on many areas of animal and human sexuality, homosexuality, male and female orgasms, menstruation, and much more.  Zuk knows a wide range of peculiar and completely natural animal behaviors, and her persuasive book shows that we habitually look at such behaviors through our own lenses.  We will have to learn our morals elsewhere than from creatures produced by amoral evolution.  In a typical humorous aside (this is a witty book that is a pleasure to read), Zuk points out that female snakes may mate with numerous males, even in writhing balls of mating snakes, and this \\"... must imply what?  Orgies are natural?  Sexually voracious females are to be applauded?\\"  Skip the morals and object lessons, she demonstrates; intelligent watching of what evolution has produced is far more important.ns have been written on the theme.

Hydrogen is the simplest of all atoms.  It is all around us; though hydrogen gas floats out of our atmosphere to join the hydrogen atoms that are in the \\"vacuum\\" of space, hydrogen makes up a large proportion of stars, water, and ourselves.  John S. Rigden has written an admiring tribute to the simplest atom, _Hydrogen: The Essential Element_ (Harvard University Press).  It turns out that hydrogen has played an enormous role in our understanding of matter and energy, and that the simplest of atoms is so complicated and surprising that Rigden's book is a continual source of elemental wonder.<br />Hydrogen is element number one, only a single electron orbiting a single proton.  Repeatedly Rigden shows that this simplicity has been a boon to research.  The lessons learned from this basic atom, in Rigden's story, form a history of physics in the twentieth century.  The refinements to theory have largely been to explain the dark bands in the spectrum produce when hydrogen is made to glow.  Niels Bohr produced the first modern picture of the atom, incorporating the experimental data from Rutherford and the hydrogen spectrum, but recklessly disregarding the historic laws of physics which he felt could not apply within the atom.  He thus began the amazingly successful and fabulously strange quantum explanation for the behavior of matter.  Rigden has not just included experimenters and theorizers, but also appealing stories about them, such as I. I. Rabi developing magnetic resonance in the 1930s to measure the nucleus, but then in 1988 being wheeled into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine.  He said, \\"It was eerie... I would never have dreamed that my work would come to this.\\"  _Hydrogen_ is not just about understanding the inner workings of the atom, but also about hydrogen as the ticker of a clock, as anti-matter, and as a confirmer of big bang cosmology.<br />There are plenty of challenging chapters here, meant for the non-scientist but not necessarily easy reading.  Although the mathematics is not detailed, there are some equations shown that could be intimidating; Dirac's equation, predicting antiparticles and electron spin, Rigden assures us is a \\"little equation\\" that can be \\"written in one line,\\" and while this is true, the line has twenty algebraic symbols in it.  Also, surprisingly, there is little about the hydrogen bomb.  Rigden decided that the bomb did not fit into the theme of how the hydrogen atom has led and will continue to lead to improved scientific knowledge.  His charming and informative book shows how some mysteries have been solved but that we should never come to the conclusion that we are close to knowing all: \\"After all, H stands not only for hydrogen, but also for humility.\\"a clock, as anti-matter, and as a confirmer of big bang cosmology.<br />There are plenty of challenging chapters here, meant for the non-scientist but not necessarily easy reading.

In January 1848, James Marshall was checking on the progress of construction of his sawmill on the American River in California.  In the tailrace of the mill, he found quartz that bore flakes of gold.  It might have meant nothing.  His crew had spent months moving dirt and rocks around for the mill, but no previous shiny yellow specks had shown up.  The discovery was kept quiet for a while, but then Sam Brannan heard about it.  He owned a general store at Sutter's Fort nearby, and he pondered whether to start digging for the gold himself, or to make his fortune selling supplies to others doing the digging.  He went with the latter strategy (the one that more reliably made eventual fortunes from the gold mines) - he filled a jar with gold dust, and paraded it around San Francisco.  The word was out; the Gold Rush was on.  According to H. W. Brands, the effect of the discovery of gold in California was to change local, national, and international history.  He describes the effects in a long, entertaining narrative of individual stories, _The Age of Gold: The California Gold Rush and the New American Dream_ (Doubleday).<br />There had never been anything like this before.  The world had had a long lust for gold, but it was so rare and finds were so haphazard that there had never before been a rush for gold.  The international effects of the gold discovery preceded even the national ones, for the word went out over the ocean to Chile, Australia, and China before it could be carried overland, or via the Panama land bridge, to Washington DC and other east coast cities.  The gold veins of California and Nevada were big and rich, and there were new technologies to bring them out.  There were different variations of the famous panning for gold to start off with, and then miners became true miners by digging for it.  Eventually, large operations were launched to uncover the gold hydraulically, aiming water cannon at the mountains and bringing them low.  The huge population boom was like nothing the world had seen.  It had been assumed that California would slowly fill up with people, just as the lands purchased from France had done, and this was the process up until 1848.  By 1849, however, California overtook many existing states in population, and the new Californians were interested in admission to the Union, skipping the usual territorial stage.  Brands argues that the admission affected the national debate on slavery versus abolition, and may have accelerated the Civil War.  Be that as it may, it is clear that transcontinental railroad was probably the most significant result of the Gold Rush.  There had never been a larger construction enterprise, and it created &quot;the largest unified market in the world, the market that allowed the American economy to grow into the colossus it became by the beginning of the 20th century.&quot;<br />It is fitting that Brands winds up this illuminating and wide-ranging book with Silicon Valley.  Silicon is everywhere in sand, and entrepreneurs are ubiquitous; was the American Dream so exemplified years ago in striking a rich gold vein perhaps fueling again a legendary California boom?  The two booms both had their share of resultant tycoons and bankrupts, resource and hype.  Brands's conclusion about the participants in the first boom may by future historians be seen to apply to the subsequent one: &quot;They went to California to seek individual happiness.  Some found it; some didn't....The men and women of the Gold Rush hoped to change their lives by going to California; in the bargain they changed their world.&quot;om was like nothing the world had seen.

Huge resources are at work to show us satellite pictures of storms; many of us can't get by without taking a regular look at the Weather Channel.  Long before such technology was in place, in 1935, it was clear to forecasters on Labor Day weekend that a storm was coming somewhere around Florida, but none of them could have predicted its course accurately, and none would have known it would quickly build into the most powerful storm ever to hit the US.  _Storm of the Century: The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935_ (National Geographic Press) by Willie Drye tells the story of the storm, the havoc it caused, the surprisingly political outcome, and the fascinating lack of lessons learned.  It is as exciting a book as one about the weather can be.<br />The victims of the storm were largely veterans of WWI, &quot;Forgotten Men&quot; who were sent to the Florida Keys to build a highway linking the Keys and the mainland.  (They were perhaps also sent there to keep them from protesting the effects of the depression on them.)  The men reported to three oceanfront work camps, primitive plywood and canvass bivouacs where they did a lot of drinking and tried to outwit the mosquitoes.  There were storm advisories for Labor Day; the Weather Bureau alerted the Keys to the possibility of danger, but no one could have predicted how much.  Drye shows that the administrators of the veterans' program, through lack of experience with tropical weather, bad communication, and misplaced optimism, failed to take action until the storm was upon the camps and until the train sent to evacuate them was itself beaten off the tracks.  That is only one of the horrors described here as the storm, and the surge of ocean that accompanied it, wrecked the islands and killed over 400 people.  Politicians thereafter tried to pin blame on someone, but a clever congressional ally of Roosevelt kept the administration from being tarnished by tricky lawyerly tactics.  It was nothing but an act of God.<br />Drye's epilogue is called &quot;Next Time It'll Be Worse,&quot; and he demonstrates that this is certainly so.  The Keys have not seen their last monster storm, and since the one of 1935, there has been built a highway linking them all, and there has been a population and property boom, and tourism brings thousands during hurricane season.  Hurricanes, even tracked by satellite, are unpredictable, and no one could foresee a similar storm so rapidly growing from a weak tropical disturbance to a gigantic killer.  In 1935, a few well timed evacuation trains could have emptied the Keys, but now all the residents getting in their cars to head to the mainland would result in just a long traffic jam.  Feasibility studies for making the road a two-lane northbound-only route merely show that cars would run out of gas if tanker trucks could not get south to fill the gas stations.  The next storm is coming, and books will record it.  Until then, this memorable volume detailing not only the natural history but the social history of a great storm is exciting reading.ion from being tarnished by tricky lawyerly tactics.

His work can be found all through American endeavors in the last century; he was an advisor to nine presidents.  He did remarkable humanitarian work for refugees with his International Rescue Committee.  He died in 1999, and his life story reads like a history of the Cold War.  His first biography is now out, _Rescuing the World: The Life and Times of Leo Cherne_ (State University of New York Press) by Andrew F. Smith.  Smith first met Cherne the year before he died, because Cherne supposedly needed advice about writing his autobiography.  Cherne was an accomplished writer, and had started the autobiography a few times.  He certainly had plenty of material.  But it never happened; \\"In the end I concluded that the apparently gregarious, outgoing Leo Cherne simply could not write a book about himself because it was unseemly for him to do so.\\"  This is a biography of his public life; Cherne refused to discuss stories others told of his private life, so subjects such as his marriage are barely mentioned, and will have to be included in the inevitable future biographies.  Cherne was sufficiently busy in the public sphere to make this first attempt a valuable chronicle.<br />Cherne was born in 1912 of first generation Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.  In high school, after a hurricane devastated Puerto Rico, Cherne appointed himself the head of a \\"Hurricane Committee,\\" addressed a special student assembly on the issue, and started collecting the food and money that poured in afterwards.  It was a model for future years: \\"... quick intervention in seizing the public platform, altruistic motives, positive responses of others, and record-breaking results.\\"  After law school, he began advising businessmen on taxes and governmental issues, and became a consultant to companies and to Congress.  He advised business how to gear up for war, and gear up for a consumer economy afterward.  He became interested in working with refugees after the war.  He had humanitarian interest, to be sure, but he also thought of the refugees as political weapons against totalitarianism.  If the regime was so perfect, he would point out, why were refugees fleeing?  Cherne chaired the International Rescue Committee for forty years, seeing the organization through many financial problems and often personally taking part in relief efforts for refugees from Hungary, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Cuba.  Cherne was able to unite diverse talents to support the aims of his International Rescue Committee, and through the book wander helpful volunteers like Rock Hudson, Liv Ullmann, and Joan Baez.  Cherne got to speak up on behalf of Hungarian refugees on the Ed Sullivan Show, not a likely forum for humanitarian efforts.  He was also a songwriter, and achieved fame as a sculptor.  His busts of Kennedy, Lincoln, Churchill and other famous people are known all over the world.<br />_Rescuing the World_ is a record of remarkable public service.  Cherne never had a fortune, and he never held office, but he had passion for freedom and an insistence on liberty for others.  He was able to inspire others to good efforts for the world's refugees.

It is surprising to think that only a few decades ago, no one had studied, much less made commercial recordings of, the voices of whales.  Some, like the eccentric researcher John C. Lilly, had made much of the vocalizations of dolphins, but we knew a lot more about the animals who sang in the air where we could hear them.  Morton has written about her scientific career in _Listening to Whales: What the Orcas Have Taught Us_ (Ballantine Books).  There is a good deal of scientific information in it, often understated and certainly not with the sort of detail Morton must use in her papers.  She can specify that orcas do not use a single sound to match a single behavior, for instance; it is the frequency of the sound that makes a difference, signaling tranquility or the need for a pod to change direction.  Resident orcas, near the shore, could be vocal and splashy, because the fish on which they feed have not learned to listen for them.  Transient orcas, traveling the seas and living on alert mammals that pay attention to sounds of danger, have evolved to be quieter and more stealthy.<br />There's plenty of general science in the book, about how orcas fish, mate, socialize, and raise families.  But Morton's volume is one in a series of an appealing subgenre of memoir, that of the woman scientist.  She was a high school dropout because she wanted to do research on mice more than doing regular studies.  She chanced upon a job with maverick dolphin investigator, John C. Lilly, and then went on to do sound studies on orcas in tanks at Marineland.  In 1979, she began to listen to orcas in the wild, using hydrophones originally developed to track submarines.  At that time, orcas were a mystery; how they socialized, where they wintered, even what they ate could only be guessed at.  Morton helped provide her share of answers, especially those bearing on their language.  She married a man who photographed orcas underwater; he was eyes and she was ears.  They had a son, and some of Morton's most endearing words have to do with how, in an extreme environment and with research duties looming, she handled little Jarret.  She had to deal with widowhood, and primitive conditions in a wild area, but she loved the work.  Sadly, her whales were driven away from her home waters because of salmon farming, which Morton covers in the last part of a the book.  Not only the whales have suffered.<br />Morton is not a pessimist.  Her book shines with hope for her whales and her planet, but she makes it clear that we are going to make mistakes in predicting how we can \\"control\\" nature.  She has become an ecological advocate for her home territory, learning such useful techniques as bypassing local government and talking (via Internet) to an expert she can partner with to do research on the respective individual effects of salmon farming on her world.  Her findings are getting easily published this way without delay or grant-seeking.  She is making a difference; it isn't known if it will be enough.  Her book is a wonderful examination of a life she has lived on her own terms, and lived well.  It is easy to catch her enthusiasm, and this would be a wonderful book for a young person interested in science.was eyes and she was ears.

That the two are deeply connected is not an original theme, but Friedman's book is a superb primer on how the law came to be the way it is in our country, and how it came to be so particularly important here.<br />Friedman goes to the source of our law, the English _common_ law system, in which judges created laws as they decided various cases and set precedent.  (Most European law systems are based on _civil_ law, whose ancestor is Roman law.  A civil law system is based on codes, huge statutes that, theoretically, the judges cannot add to nor subtract from, but only interpret.)  Our local laws were originally made for close knit communities in which everyone knew each other.  They were interested in punishing sin as a crime.  The punishments afforded included branding and whipping, which besides being painful, would mark the recipient as the community saw him; shame and stigma worked for the community better than loss of freedom.  Friedman traces the effects of the Industrial Revolution, and the lack of legal recourse for factory employees harmed on the job.  It was not until the twentieth century that an employee could count on compensation for a job injury.  The protectionism of twentieth law has paralleled the growth in national government as opposed to local government.  The economy unified (a mall in Florida looks the same as one in Alaska), and styles are national rather than local.  The Rehnquist Supreme Court has shown some interest in &quot;breathing life into the corpse of the dead doctrine of state's rights,&quot; but given the grants that the federal government enjoys overseeing and the huge body of federal regulations covering minute areas of enterprise, and given the spotlight that the president himself enjoys, it seems unlikely that the center of attention will shift back to the states.<br />Friedman's examples and his brief explanations of important decisions are excellent.  He includes capsule histories of such phenomena as slavery and the civil rights movement, as well as the increasing rights given to women, Native Americans, and homosexuals.  His discussion of divorce then and now along with the philosophy concerning common law marriage is an engaging summary.  His smoothly-written book is valuable for anyone who is curious about how our laws and enforcement got to be so important and so distinctly American.f twentieth law has paralleled the growth in national government as opposed to local government.

These were a visual hit; moths came in light colored and dark colored (melanic) forms.  The light colored were hard to see on natural trees covered in lichen, and the melanic ones were hard to see on trees darkened by decades of soot from the British version of the Industrial Revolution.  Research in the 1950s showed that as the trees darkened, so did the moths; predator birds couldn't see the melanic forms as well, so their race prospered, produced progeny, and overtook the typical light colored ones.  (There is an important subtext to this manifestation, that of human degradation of the environment.)  The great problem with the theory of evolution by natural selection is that it describes changes over thousands of years, but the moths' changes over decades was an example of rapid environmental change that proved Darwin right.  The problem was that they did no such thing.  There were quiet objections to the research as it was being done, but it was such a hit that only in the past few years have biologists seriously cried foul by showing its many flaws.  Now a clear and informative book, _Of Moths and Men: The Untold Story of Science and the Peppered Moth_ (Norton) by Judith Hooper tells the story of the personalities involved, how the mistakes came to be made, how they were eventually uncovered, and what the outcome of the affair was.<br />In 1953, Bernard Kettlewell started the experiments to give numbers to the speculation that melanic moths were being naturally selected.  He was a brilliant amateur moth expert, a tall, loud man, full of boisterous enthusiasm for his work, but the loudness hid deep insecurity.  This was seized upon by the villain in this piece is E. B. \\"Henry\\" Ford, a misogynic and overbearing dandy who personified a type of Oxford academic.  He was known for grabbing moths and eating them, for he said that was the only way to test its palatability.  He strongly believed in classic Darwinism, and took Kettlewell under his wing as he realized that the experiments were a perfect field demonstration of Darwin's ideas, a demonstration that had been lacking.  He leaned on Kettlewell for more results, and got them, and made them the centerpiece of his own book.  When Kettlewell later took his own life, Ford unkindly pronounced him a coward.  Ford and Kettlewell initially heaped scorn on anyone who challenged their work, and there were few challenges.  The most formidable challenge came from American lepidopterist Ted Sargent who showed in the 1970's that Kettlewell's work had serious problems.  The debunking didn't take, because the peppered moth was too entrenched.  It has only been in the past five years that there has been serious and accepted opposition to evolution's shining example.<br />Not letting the peppered moth go are the creationists, who are delighted with this story.  \\"If this is the best the evolutionists can do,\\" they seem to say, \\"Darwin must have been wrong all along.\\"  It is not so simple, of course.  Those who worked on debunking the peppered moth story are all evolutionists, as is almost every single biologist in the world.  There are religious objections to evolution, but although its details may be subject to argument, it is as well founded as any other scientific theory.  Hooper's lesson is decidedly not that evolution is somehow science called into question.  It is instead that scientists are humans, that without proper supervision and checking and repeat experiments by others, they may see just what they want to see, and they may play power games that advance themselves rather than scientific truth.  Hooper tells of science derailed by very human failings.  Her descriptions of the personalities involved and the history of their interactions are detailed and entertaining.  It may have taken too long in this spectacular case, but it is the duty of scientists, rather than religious enthusiasts, to steer research right when it goes wrong.spectacular case, but it is the duty of scientists, rather than religious enthusiasts, to steer research right when it goes wrong.	2002-08-19

Books	5	6	6	N	N	Living Under The Volcano	We are used to having to deal with changes in the weather, but twenty years ago, meteorologists were having to deal with a new atmospheric manifestation.  Mount Saint Helens had blown up in the state of Washington, and had affected air quality, air travel, and emotions in the region, and had world-wide weather consequences.  It certainly was not the first time a volcano shaped the weather, for volcanoes have had major effects on weather and even history.  _Volcanoes in Human History: The Far-Reaching Effects of Major Eruptions_ (Princeton University Press) by Jelle Zeilinga de Boer and Donald Theodore Sanders takes nine famous or obscure volcanoes and demonstrates that volcanoes are an active part of our lives.<br />Surprisingly, volcanic effects are not all bad.  Volcanic soils are very fertile, and we use plenty of minerals of volcanic origin.  The gases from volcanoes made the Earth's atmosphere before photosynthesis took over.  Many geologists think that all the water on earth was originally released by volcanoes.  The book shows a very interesting aspect of Hawaii, in that it is in the middle of the Pacific plate, not near the edges where the plates are barging into each other and which are the usual sites of volcanic activity.  The plate carrying the islands is floating slowly over a particular hotspot, which pokes up as the plate floats over it, and gives rise to the familiar Hawaiian Island chain.  Iceland is on such a hotspot, too, and besides that, it straddles the Mid-Atlantic ridge, where the ocean floor is being split apart as the plates separate at about two centimeters a year.  The Bronze Age eruption of Thera in the Mediterranean directly weakened Crete, which permitted the Greeks to expand into the area; Mycenaean Greece was given the boost that made it the ancestor of classical Greece, with incalculable effects on the entire Western civilization ever since.  Mount Pel&eacute;e's explosion in Martinique in 1902 stopped an election that would have furthered the political advancement of black and mixed-race people on the island, and throughout the French colonies.  The list of contingencies is fascinating.<br />All of the volcanoes described here are still active; we have not heard the last of them, and perhaps there is someday going to be a blast like that in Toba in the Pacific 74,000 years ago, which was thousands of times bigger than Mount St. Helens, and may have affected human evolution.  This surprising, informative book is a useful look at how volcanoes effect land, sea, humans, and society.

Tahir Shah was \\"desperate to start a collection of my own,\\" and so he showed up at a secretive, invitation-only auction of eleven such heads under the auspices of a \\"learned British society.\\"  To his dismay, within fifteen minutes, the whole set of heads was knocked down to a Japanese collector who had been \\"trying to corner the shrunken head market for years.\\"  The evening was not a total loss, as an elderly Frenchmen advised Shah to go to Peru.  For the shrunken heads?  Why, no, for the birdmen.  This didn't make any sense, and the Frenchman would not elaborate, but a week later an envelope came from Paris, bearing an old feather and a quotation from a 1638 book that said Incas flew like birds over the jungle.  Shah was launched onto research and travels recounted in _Trail of Feathers: In Search of the Birdmen of Peru_ (Arcade Publishing), and they make for frequently hilarious reading.  He is a different type of explorer, pursuing an idea rather than going to regions no one has ever seen, and has endured with good humor atrocious travel arrangements and louche characters that would make other people scream.<br />After some research, he starts, of course, at the current hotspot for archeological tourism, Machu Picchu, which he finds looks from above like a condor.  He goes to Nazca, the region of the famous patterns in the desert that only make sense when seen from high above.  He is pursued by a Parisienne who is looking for a father for her children, and who comes equipped with a dried lama fetus which can be made, she says, into an aphrodisiac soup.  In the village of Trompeteros, he attends with all the citizens the beauty contest sponsored by Inca Brand Condoms.  (The master of ceremonies declares that the beauties on the stage were \\"clean-living girls who always used an Inca condom.\\")  The crowd goes wild over every entrant, especially number six, who for the talent portion performs a dance which includes sucking live tree grubs from the floor and eating them.  The search loops around into the upper Amazon regions, when Shah is convinced that rather than physical flight, the birdmen were psychic, or psychedelic, fliers.  The experts in such flying were the Shuar tribe, the headshrinkers themselves.  He finds a Vietnam vet who is only at home in the jungle, to act as guide and to hire a boat, which turns out to be rotten and full of rats and wolf spiders.  After a trip of hellish tortures, they wind up in Shuar country only to be shocked: the Shuars have not only given up headshrinking and other tribal rituals, they have not only become Christians, but they have become evangelists.  The missionaries have not, however, taken what would have been the fatuous step of trying to make the tribesmen abstain from ayahuasca, a hallucinogen.  Shah's trip on it is the climax of the book.  Yes, there were Inca birdmen.<br />This is a hilarious, picaresque tale which is not without its scholarly moments; Shah has done a good deal of research, and even has appendices to tell about hallucinogens and the theory of shrunken heads.  There is a good deal of more-or-less practical information; read this book and you will ever after be able to perform a simple check to tell a good shrunken head from a bad one.  His Vietnam vet dispenses the Five Rules of Jungle Travel:  \\"One: chop stems downward and as low to the ground as possible; then they'll fall away from the path.  Two: go slow, as speed only snags you on fish-hook thorns.  Three: rest frequently and drink liquid.  Four: love the jungle, don't hate it.  Five: check your groin for parasites twice an hour.\\"  Words to live by.

1450649:US	50895620	R3UWV4B64CFYEK	0385482221	860979869	Shadow Mountain: A Memoir of Wolves, a Woman, and the Wild	Books	5	34	36	N	N	A Memoir of Working For Wolves	Wolves were eliminated from Yellowstone National Park by 1926.  They were the only creatures banished from the preserve, because humans unrealistically feared them and the cattle damage they might do.  As Americans became aware of what ecology was, more were able to accept that the missing wolves ought to be restored to the nature preserve, for they should have been preserved along with all the other creatures.  Ren&eacute;e Askins would certainly not claim that she was the one to effect their restoration into Yellowstone, but she certainly deserves much of the credit.  Her lovely memoir, _Shadow Mountain: A Memoir of Wolves, a Woman, and the Wild_ (Doubleday) not only tells about her involvement in this huge project, but also is her autobiography, taking in her upbringing, her lovers, and in many pages, her dogs.  It is sweet and compelling reading.<br />In 1980, Askins was a college student working at a wolf research facility in Indiana.  She had a wolf pup thrust upon her to raise, and although she had plenty of experience with wild and domestic animals before, this was &quot;the first time I truly began to face and fathom the capacity of another species.&quot;  When the pup was taken from her, she was heartbroken.  She sobbed, and (this is something she does quite a bit throughout the book), she howled.  And she was answered by the pack, which &quot;one by one, called out in the long, graceful wail that is the code of their species.  Their own had been taken.  I had no doubt they knew.&quot;  (Also throughout the book is this sort of mystical anthropomorphic speculation, which may put some readers off, but which has served the author well.)  In 1986, she founded the Wolf Fund.  Returning wolves to Yellowstone was its one and only purpose.  Much of the book is devoted to how she lobbied and cajoled bureaucrats and donors.  It is a complicated story, but wolves were returned to the park, and the Wolf Fund, having achieved its goal, in contrast to other bureaucracies, simply shut itself down.<br />Askins's delightful writing includes many non-wolf topics.  She writes with feeling about a friend and a sister who died of cancer.  She describes with amusement the activities of her dogs, and winds up at the Westminster Dog Show in New York, looking for an &quot;apricot, teacup, powder puff Chinese Crested.&quot;  She faces feral dogs in West Africa (by howling).  In these episodes, and all others she includes here, she gracefully ties the themes back to her life with wolves and the lessons she has learned from working with them and for them.  She has the good sense to realize that reinstating the wolves was a hopeful symbolic act, and that compared to other protections of endangered species, it was biologically insignificant.  She is open about losses; some of the wolves have been deliberately killed, some in response to cattle depredation, although such instances have been few.  And she realizes that with electronic monitor collars strapped on them, with a population &quot;managed&quot; rather than entirely wild, the wolves are not truly free.  The ironies of managing wilderness permeate this fine volume of heartfelt memoir and reflections on successful environmental action.mply shut itself down.<br />Askins's delightful writing includes many non-wolf topics.

These soldiers were not the scary Nazis or the Klansmen who killed those they styled their enemies and who robbed and burgled for the good of their cause.  They were not like the Unabomber, but were social beings united in a movement.  They were also not like Timothy McVeigh, although McVeigh did have some dealings with them, for they never really got down to action.  They were the Washington State Militia, part of a \\"movement that has come, grotesquely, to be called the Patriot movement,\\" and they were armed for Armageddon.  They were the Paul Reveres, ready to ride through the nation under attack by its enemies.  They had explosives, they had camouflage, they had their beloved guns, they had God on their side, and they were rebels without a clue.  If you enjoy laughing at the folly of others, _Lone Patriot: The Short Career of an American Militiaman_ (Pantheon) by Jane Kramer, will do nicely.  It does, however, tell a darker tale.<br />Kramer's main subject is John Pitner, a former ship-painter, unemployed, the self-described \\"founder, promoter, banker, quartermaster and commander in chief\\" of the militia.  Kramer describes his beliefs and those of the militiamen around him in some detail.  Pitner's mentor was John Trochmann, the leader of the Montana Militia.  Trochmann, unlike most of the Patriots depicted here, made a good living from the movement.  He sold hate literature and military supplies, and recruited men like Pitner to be the market for them.  His credo, Christian Identity, \\"involved the conviction that God had made Negroes on the fifth day of His creation, along with the other beasts of the field, and not on the sixth day, when He made people.\\"  Pitner became expert at using the internet to learn the dark strategies of his particular enemy David Rockefeller, and the Rothschilds and the other Jewish bankers who ran everything.  He knew about the vile machinations of the mysterious black helicopters which had hovered over his headquarters.  He knew the unconstitutional nature of the income tax.  He could rant about how the New World Order, with special help from former president Clinton, was closing lands to Americans in the name of ecology, and how they had sent \\"communist evolutionists\\" to the schools to teach biology.  He could even manage to reveal these secrets after 44,000 volts of lasers had been fired into his brain, causing a blackout.<br />Pitner somehow had an Amway salesman's gift for getting people involved in his movement.  However, their style of paranoia cuts both ways.  When his men became dissatisfied with the long wait for those UN troops to invade, and with only promises of hidden weapons rather than real weapons, they began to wonder if Pitner was perhaps on the side of the feds.  No, he wasn't, but a couple of his recruits were.  He went to jail for three years on a charge of owning and transferring a machine gun (not, as the government had wanted, conspiracy).  Pitner was saved by his wife more than once, and was bonded out by his sister Susan, who had a lesbian partner in the sort of relationship the religious militias would have strongly disapproved of.  The sister's take on this delusional and charismatic man is key; she says that despite his desire for his militia to be taken seriously, the only ones to believe him in the end were the FBI.  This is a tale of bumblers, told by a reporter with a novelist's flair for displaying comic characters.

Dawidoff's charming biography of his grandfather, _The Fly Swatter: How My Grandfather Made His Way in the World_ (Pantheon) starts with his own memories of Alexander Gerschenkron.  For instance, Gerschenkron, known as \\"Shura\\" within his family, had an arsenal of fly swatters, each of just the proper color and heft for its particular target.  The baby blue flyswatter was just the thing for his particular enemy, the wasps, because they were vicious, and the mild color would make them let down their guard.  If he were successful in swatting the wasp (not often), he would give \\"lengthy disquisitions on swatting technique.\\"  He would never allow the insect body to be cleaned up, for he \\"claimed they were deterrents, that other yellowjackets would encounter their unfortunate colleague and feel inclined to keep away themselves.\\"<br />Shura was, to be sure, a character.  But he was also brilliant in an obsessively academic way.  He mastered some two dozen languages, but his field of expertise was not language.  He was able to discourse on (and write academic treatments of) _Hamlet_ and _Dr. Zhivago_, but he did not teach literature.  He was an economist, a quintessential Harvard professor who left a lasting mark on economic thought with his theory of \\"economic backwardness.\\"  He had a rather exciting early life, fleeing the Russian Revolution, and then fleeing the Nazis, before he found himself in the economic department of Harvard that was to be his academic home.  He was a natural show-off.  He could certainly be obnoxious and overbearing, and his students often felt they were not measuring up to his superhuman standards, but none of them forgot him, and he left a strong mark on the next generation of economists.  Dawidoff makes the case that his standards were so exacting, and his sense of the overwhelming complexity of history and economics so complete, that he constantly spent time in library stacks gaining more information, but was intimidated about committing himself in print.  He did, however, play chess with the artist Marcel Duchamp, disparage Vladimir Nabokov for an inept translation of Pushkin, and charm Marlene Dietrich to give him her phone number.<br />One of the great strengths of this engaging book is that it makes Shura's wide-ranging academic endeavors almost as exciting as his flights from political oppression.  The love of reading and the love of learning just for the sake of exercising one's mind could not have a finer exemplar.  And while most people would regard a life in libraries as unexciting and unromantic, Shura was fond of living his life as fully as his capacious mind would allow.  After he had recovered from a cardiac arrest in the foyer of the Harvard Faculty Club, he used to bring his students to the very spot where he had temporarily died.  \\"You know, there was nothing.  No beautiful colors.  No castles.  No bright lights.  Nothing.  So, if there are things you want to say and do, don't wait.  Say them and do them.  You won't get the opportunity after you're dead.\\"  During decades devoted to learning, this comprehensive biography makes plain, Gerschenkron drove himself to a life which for all of its time in an ivory tower was full of exuberance and courage.exity of history and economics so complete, that he constantly spent time in library stacks gaining more information, but was intimidated about committing himself in print.

Melville was well acquainted with the madness that might be found at sea, and he knew the literature touching thereupon.  One of the quotations that are included in the mammoth collection that starts off the great novel is from the _Life of Samuel Comstock (The Terrible Whaleman)_: \\"If you make the least damn bit of noise,\\" replied Samuel, \\"I will send you to hell.\\"  The accounts of Comstock's mutiny on the whaleship _Globe_ were well known at the time; the stories were wild and made for popular reading.  Now Thomas Farel Heffernan has scrupulously studied the accounts to produce _Mutiny on the Globe: The Fatal Voyage of Samuel Comstock_ (Norton).  His account of the grisly mutiny and its aftereffects is a fast-moving and suspenseful account of the 1824 disaster which should satisfy sea history buffs, Melville fans, and anyone interested in a good yarn.<br />Samuel Comstock was born into a decent and prosperous Quaker family in 1802, but that didn't seem to have much to do with even his boyish activities.  He was headstrong and disobedient, and at twelve, he was packing pistols and daggers under his pillow at night.  He tried to run away to sea at age fourteen, and his father gave up, allowing Samuel to begin his seagoing career.  As can be imagined, he had the usual drunkenness and brawling that are the hobbies of sailors, but he had sexual and romantic conquests, too; he seems to have been the archetypal bad boy that some ladies cannot help falling for.  He learned plenty about going to sea, and he learned that he particularly did not like whaleships, but during his first whaling cruise, he formed the plan to spend the rest of his life as the white king of the natives of a Pacific island, which he would make a pirate center, capturing any vessel that came near.  When he signed up on the _Globe_, Samuel put into his sea chest some unseamanlike possessions.  He included pistols, daggers, a medicine chest, surgical instruments, and agricultural seeds.  It is clear he was going to put his plan into action.  He ingratiated himself to the captain, who thought he was an especially competent mariner.  Samuel was able to convince a handful of other sailors (not including his little brother George who sailed with him) that his plan was feasible.  The gory mutiny occurred, and the ship was guided to an atoll in the Marshall Islands.  Samuel was never able to put his plan into affect, because his fellow mutineers realized they would have to be put out of the way to make it happen.  Much of this book is spent telling what happened after his plan was thwarted, especially to the remaining two sailors left for two years with the natives until being rescued by the US Navy.  The resolute and meritorious action of the rescuers and the rescued nicely contrasts to the bloody mutiny itself.<br />Heffernan knows his whaling history.  He has been president of the Melville Society, and has written about the _Essex_, whose seemingly deliberate sinking by a whale inspired the climax of Moby Dick.  Melville and his work are cited but a few times in the current volume, but Melville has to loom over any recounting of the whale fishery.  Comstock possesses not a little amount of Ahab, and the themes of a mad dream and of death in his story Melville obviously turned full blast into his own work.  There is some hope, though, in the current volume - not all is lost, and many of the sailors who lived managed heroically to save themselves and their fellows.

Well, not directly, perhaps, but there is a surprising connection drawn in _Sisters of Salome_ (Yale University Press) by Toni Bentley, an examination of four women who interpreted Salome around the turn of the last century.  Wilde took his story from legend (not the Bible story), and invented the famous \\"Dance of the Seven Veils\\" for his French play _Salome_.  It initiated the craze for \\"Salomania\\" and there was even a school for Salomes that churned out dancers to go into the variety halls.  Bentley's introduction inserts herself into the history of striptease, and she gives a good account of ending her career as a ballerina and going onto the stage (just once?) as a stripper.  She felt power; \\"... there was no victimization on either side of these footlights.\\"  It was a revelatory experience: \\"I was unmasked and, for a miraculous minute, thrilled in my body, unafraid of my life.  I was in - for me - Paradise.\\"<br />Her research into how striptease originated centered on four women who had initially interpreted to the theatrical Salome.  Maudie Durant was the sister of a serial killer, and escaped to Europe and to the stage as Maud Allan as a way to free herself from disgrace.  She became \\"the least dressed dancer of our time,\\" and she then portrayed Salome in 1906.  She became involved in a ridiculous trial which she lost in large part because it was shown that she knew what a clitoris was.  Ida Rubenstein was the child of Russian aristocrats, and the only Salome here who had few worries about money.  She liked expensive, self-aggrandizing shows and ended up derided for her vanity.  She did, however, sponsor artists of real ability; Ravel composed _Bolero_ for her.  Everyone knows the name of the spy Mata Hari, but everyone knows wrong.  She performed all over Europe, and took lovers; she had a special weakness for those in uniform.  As a result, she did take money for spying, but didn't do any.  She was framed and executed in France in 1917.  With Colette, perhaps Bentley is guilty of over-application of her theme, because Colette never played Salome, although she did once perform on the same billing as Mata Hari.  Unlike the other three women profiled here, Colette had a genuinely happy and long life.  She graduated from virgin bride to lesbian, to happily married housewife, although she did seduce a former husband's son.  She used her success in scandals, including her stage nakedness, to become an author whose fiction and memoirs have inspired far more readers than just Bentley.<br />This is a book of a peculiar history, not only of four dancers, but of one period of the dance itself.  None of them were very good dancers, but nakedness and scandal made up for that.  All four reinvented themselves and used the Salome role for gains in power and money, although such gains were mostly temporary.  None had a conventional life or marriage, and perhaps there is some sort of lesson in the sad ends most of them experienced.  Bentley has not forced any didacticism from the four stories and her own.  Her research and bibliography are good, and she has a light and amused way of telling the stories, full of detail.  \\"Why did these women dance naked?\\" she asks, and the answers she gives, far from simple, but satisfying while undoubtedly incomplete, are wise and fun to read.uted in France in 1917.

But pot somehow is a much bigger deal than anyone had thought, a world-wide obsession over a simple weed that millions find fun or useful, and others find perilous.  So Brian Preston, a Canadian journalist, decided he would do a worldwide survey of the international marijuana scene.  It was a perfect self-assignment: he likes vagabonding, and he likes getting stoned.  The result, _Pot Planet: Adventures in Global Marijuana Culture_ (Grove Press) is a hilarious travelogue through smoke filled rooms, with a subtly serious message: \\"What's more likely to destroy the earth, pot or pollution?  And there's a war on pot?\\"<br />Preston is a dedicated journalist, or at least he loves his subject so much that he is happy to go to enormous lengths to investigate it.  \\"For much of the research and most of the writing of this book, I was high on marijuana. Now then - it can't be _that_ amotivating.\\"  He becomes a judge of the Cannabis Culture Cup, with the difficult task of rating all these strains, and more, in the categories of appearance, fragrance, texture, taste, aftertaste, and stone (and he remarks on the difficulties of evaluating that last category after you have already judged other entrants; he can't, like a wine taster, just spit it out).  He has funny stories from all over.  \\"If you want to score anywhere in Asia,\\" Preston advises, \\"just find a place where they're playing Bob Marley music.\\"  In the town of Nimbin, Australia, there are \\"grass palaces,\\" houses paid for by pot cultivation: \\"They were hippies; now they're middle class.\\"  One wants to franchise pot restaurants in the shape of a giant bong, the Big Bong Burger Bar.  In Switzerland, searching out contacts, Preston asks a city employee, a tourist helper, \\"Do you know where I could by _hemp_ products around here?  Like clothing and stuff?\\"  She thinks a minute.  \\"Hmmm.  Hemp clothing... No... But we have three stores where you can buy grass!\\"  In Morocco a shady tourist guide assures him about purportedly fine hashish, \\"Half a kilo, Brian!  Very easy to hide in a suitcase for the flight home!\\"  In Canada, backwoods growers have given death threats to those who wish to introduce hemp production for fiber, because of the fear that the low-stoning hemp will cross pollinate and ruin the intoxicant varieties.<br />In every chapter, Preston shows that American politics have affected global marijuana in ways that not even the most rabidly anti-pot politician would favor.  Naturally, Preston knows just what the US and the world ought to do with marijuana laws, but he usually withholds proselytization  on the issue.  He is an amusing writer with clever comparisons; a stoner holds in his toke so deeply that he eventually disgorges \\"a cloud of smoke huge and heavy enough to show up on a satellite weather shot.\\"  He withholds most of his serious arguments until his last chapter, which is quite accurately titled \\"Pot Polemic.\\"  And he has graceful ambivalence about what legality might bring, having seen a bit of it in Amsterdam, pushed like booze and tobacco: \\"Is this what legalization would be like? Would pot become just another consumer product, marketed like any other line of goods in Babylon?\\"  Maybe there would be disadvantages, yes, but this book is indispensable for anyone who wants an amusing survey of the current world marijuana situation.  Americans, especially, would do well to catch this bigger picture.Hmmm.  Hemp clothing... No...

And, as the boat was built and the crew shifted, he happened to have one opening for an extra crewman.  He was very lucky that Nick Thorpe, a Scottish travel writer, happened by chance to hear about the voyage while going through South America, for Thorpe became the expedition's chronicler, in _8 Men and a Duck: An Improbable Voyage by Reed Boat to Easter Island_ (Free Press).  Thorpe inflated his novice sailing history in order to get the job, but in his funny tale, his ineptitude is about equivalent of that of his companions.  Among them were a French Lothario, a Chilean master-of-none, and a Texas tree surgeon.  Of course this was a \\"ship of fools;\\" Thorpe himself uses the phrase, but it is an engaging brand of foolishness.  For this \\"oddest bunch of misfits ever to set foot on the high seas,\\" it would not be a laughing matter if they had all drowned, and they did come close, but danger related here only heightens the humor.<br />Thorpe's account is full of things that did go wrong, many of which were not at all funny at the time.  There were the trials of getting the twenty-ton ship to the ocean, and how she was stuck on her launching ramp for five days.  When Thorpe's sails were finally raised, they were backwards.  The electronic navigation and weather system did not work (\\"So far we would have been better holding a straw in the wind and guessing\\").  There is a shameful \\"Power Bar scandal - a chilling indictment of human behavior in an unregulated economy of confectionary snacks.\\"  A crew member snores \\"like the death rattle of a walrus.\\"  Of course there is a storm that is frightful to read about, and then just as frustrating, a time at the end when the opposite dread of sailors, a windless ocean, becalms the _Viracocha_.  There are sharks.  Throughout the book, the strangers on board do manage to become a sufficiently competent crew, and learn some valuable nautical lessons about depending on one's team.<br />Of course, there isn't much history here; ethnographers will not be readjusting their estimation of Pacific history based on this crew's voyage.  There simply isn't much reason to have accomplished this feat (although after it is all over, Thorpe and the captain do manage a reverential visit to Thor Heyerdahl, who died two months before the book came out).  Phil Buck has written an appendix here on how to build a reed boat, but readers will not be inspired to emulation. Buck had wanted to make such a trip ever since he was a kid, and whatever meaning there is in the attempt must be simply in the accomplishment of the task.  That, and this resultant chronicle, a happy account of a mad voyage.s on board do manage to become a sufficiently competent crew, and learn some valuable nautical lessons about depending on one's team.<br />Of course, there isn't much history here; ethnographers will not be readjusting their estimation of Pacific history based on this crew's voyage.

Books	5	101	115	N	N	A Fine Memoir, If Read for the Right Reasons	It is always fun to have an erotic work presented in a serious way and have it become popular.  This was the case with Nicholson Baker's fictional _Vox_ some years back, and of course the short stories of Anaïs Nin.  Good old Grove Press has been seriously printing erotic books for decades, and now has produced _The Sexual Life of Catherine M._ (note the ironic homage to _The Story of O_) by Catherine Millet.  Millet is the editor of the Paris magazine _Art Press_, and has written several serious books on contemporary art.  When her memoir was published in France last year, there were many intellectuals who were nfuriated that she was somehow trying to purge her sexual demons by publishing such a frank memoir about some extraordinary sexual adventures.  In the US, her book won't infuriate intellectuals as much as it will infuriate the prudish and those who are offended by a woman of broad sexual appetite satisfying that appetite; but it also may well offend those who buy it thinking that every page will have words to inflame the passion and excite the imagination.  This isn't a book for them.<br />Let us be clear: there is plenty of sex in the book.  What Millet likes is men, lots of men, often in rapid sequence and simultaneously.  Her lifelong hobby seems to have been orgies, swinging clubs, and being passed from one satisfied man to another.  She describes plenty of episodes of men, more or less unknown to her, penetrating, licking, caressing; if this is disturbing, one only has to recall that she was enjoying it as were they, and that one has one's own sexual peccadilloes to nurture.  The prose here is in translation (by Adriana Hunter), and so it is hard to tell how much to praise Millet for the words themselves, but in this edition they are vivid but also detached.  She is not a seductress.  She was simply available: \\"...this note that a friend put in a diary, which still gives me a glow of pride: 'Catherine, who deserves the highest praise for her calmness and availability in every situation.'\\"  She writes often with sly wit; doing a particular stroke on a partner, \\"With my back bent and my frenetic arm movements, I must have looked very like a housewife desperately trying to stop a sauce from curdling, or someone proudly finishing up a home improvement.\\"  Her availability must have served her well: \\"I have never had to suffer any kind of clumsiness or brutality, and I have generally been lucky with the attentiveness of my partners.\\"<br />Only fleeting parts of this book could serve as sexual stimulants.  Millet has obviously enjoyed her sexual life, and has reflected intelligently on it in a non-euphemistic and frank way.  Many of the activities described are exhausting, some depressing, but some are as exhilarating as exploring uncharted lands.  To have achieved her status in her career, she must have skills in communicating and getting along with people in other than sexual ways, but little of that is on display here.  She has had relations with hundreds of men, and can count only 49 whose faces she would recognize.  There is no feminist harangue here, no claim of victory.  She does not have the way most women would want to conduct themselves, nor is hers a model to which to aspire.  But unapologetic, and lucid, her book gives a fascinating look at woman fulfilling her life in a unique way.nd availability in every situation.'\\"  She writes often with sly wit; doing a particular stroke on a partner, \\"With my back bent and my frenetic arm movements, I must have looked very like a housewife desperately trying to stop a sauce from curdling, or someone proudly finishing up a home improvement.\\"  Her availability must have served her well: \\"I have never had to suffer any kind of clumsiness or brutality, and I have generally been lucky with the attentiveness of my partners.\\"  <br />Only fleeting parts of this book could serve as sexual stimulants.

He has read extensively in the _Malleus Maleficarum_ and similar documents, and has written a scholarly, large, comprehensive, and well referenced work demonstrating that such books were written to prove that demons were real, and by so doing prove that God, Jesus, and the other articles of faith were inarguably true.  Stephens has turned customary reasoning about the _Malleus_ and other writings about witchcraft on its head, but lucidly provides enough evidence to prove his case.<br />\\"Witch theorists\\" wanted some sort of physical demonstration of the existence of demons, but had no recourse but to rely on the testimony of experts.  Unfortunately, the experts were witches.  Their testimony was inherently unreliable, not only because it was often obtained under torture, but because they were, well, witches.  The most material manifestation of demons would be not just that they appeared to witches, nor flew them through the air, but that they actually had physical sex with them.  \\"If demonic copulation had been an obvious and axiomatic fact of life, it would not have received the minute, voluminous exposition and vehement defense that these writers devoted to it.\\"  The enquiries about demonic sex were not an ethical effort, but rather a scientific one, although the science was rudimentary and full of error.  Pope Innocent VIII had issued a bull which proclaimed the naughtiness of those who \\"...transgressed with incubus and succubus demons,\\" and so the witch theorists were therefore on firm ground in maintaining that demonic sex was happening, and happening often.  There is a wealth of curious detail in this book, about the nature of souls, exorcisms, how witches flew, and why they stole men's penises.<br />What is not to be found here, despite its amusingly lurid title, is much in the way of titillation.  Even the illustrated section wittily called \\"Filthy Pictures\\" is composed mostly of weirdly comic artistic visions of demons.  Casual curiosity will not do, as this is a massive and serious study by an author with extensive erudition.  (It does not keep him from writing amusingly at times, which is welcome in such weird subject matter; he writes, for instance, that confronting demons with such sacramentals as holy water or signs of the cross represents resorting to a sort of \\"demonic pest control.\\")  Although this book deals with issues of centuries ago, they are still active issues.  Stephens doesn't mention all the modern parallels, but shows how adepts of creation \\"science\\" make similar attempts to force the physical world to follow a spiritual belief.  He also demonstrates that UFO believers and abductees are still flying through the air and being sexually violated just as much as their predecessors were, and with as little physical evidence.  He does not mention the millions of people who are convinced that they are watched by angels, or the demons one can see cast out daily on religious television programs, or the witches recently killed in Africa for stealing men's penises.  We may no longer look for demons in exactly the same way that churchmen did six centuries ago, but people are still the same, and demons still afflict us.le, is much in the way of titillation.

He writes: \\"I love the Shiants for all their ragged, harsh and delicate glory and this book is a love letter to them.\\"  It is one of the most persuasive love letters ever written.  He knows the islands better than anyone ever has, and has conveyed what he knows in one fascinating chapter after another.  There is plenty of intense pleasure he conveys about living on the islands themselves, but his love is not blind; within the pages about his season here are also large quantities of battering waves, rain, cold, inconvenience, and the droppings of rats and sheep.  It is all described with a passionate attention to detail.  He writes lovingly of other people, like the boatwright who builds him a Viking-inspired sailboat in which he can commute the 16 miles to his island, or the friends he visits on the mainland who insist on cleaning his clothes and his person when he visits, or even the local press that caricatures him as a bowler-wearing aristocrat supremely out of place.<br />For further details on his islands, he has enlisted the help of various experts.  For instance, from Czechoslovakia comes a team of archeologists to study one of the ruined houses on the islands.  When they find a carve stone, he trucks it all over the British Isles, so that we  get to learn the geology of the stone, the philosophy of hermits a millennium ago, and how such a stone might do for either a grave marker or a pillow.  Within the excavation is also a binding strip, probably from a Bible, but Nicolson shows that \\"the replacement with a printed Gaelic Bible of a nurtured ancient stone was a symptom not of godliness but of empire, imposition, control and a sort of shrinking of life.\\"  People farmed on the islands for two millennia with a relatively good living.  Nicolson's meticulous gathering of as much as can be known about the islands' history, however, shows that the insularity which was no obstacle for Vikings and hermits became a liability in the modern world where the Shiants had no closeness to markets and no access to the materials of modern civilization.  Self-sufficiency was enough before 1600, but after 1800 there was no permanent inhabitation.<br />Nicolson writes with humility about his ownership, which he realizes is due to chance.  His father bought the islands, and gave them to him on his twenty-first birthday, and he will in turn give them to his son on his twenty-first.  He displays the contingencies of theft, war, and murder by which we claim a parcel of earth as our own.  He knows that in a larger sense the shepherds are closer to possessing the islands by gaining a living from them than he is having a simple deed of ownership.  But he makes the case that his islands can do very well in an enlightened private ownership which recognizes that they are the possessions of the area and of the world.  I wrote that he invited us to the islands, and this is a literal invitation.  Read through this book and you will find his e-address (and for use after 5 March 2005, the e-address of his son) by which you can ask him for the key of the primitive little house he uses when he himself goes there.  After reading this winning report on the islands that possess him, I bet he gets plenty of takers.the islands' history, however, shows that the insularity which was no obstacle for Vikings and hermits became a liability in the modern world where the Shiants had no closeness to markets and no access to the materials of modern civilization.

When reassigned in 1967 to join ships already supporting the war in Vietnam, she had never seen a day of combat. Captain John Beling had assumed command of the ship the year before, an assignment that was the pinnacle for any naval aviator. For four days the _Forrestal_ joined in adding to the bombing missions over Vietnam. And then a horrible accident happened, which is now getting its first sufficient book length description. _Sailors to the End: The Deadly Fire on the USS Forrestal and the Heroes Who Fought It_ (William Morrow) by Gregory A. Freeman, a clear, three-part account of a disastrous fire at sea: what preceded it, the fire itself, and the aftermath. It is a dramatic and riveting account which at some points may have you in tears.<br />Freeman carefully explains how safety measures were overridden, causing a rocket from one on-deck fighter to be fired into another. More importantly, he shows how the Navy was using long-outdated bombs left over from before WWII in order to make it seem as if the administration had enough bombs to fight the Vietnam War. Not only were the bombs outdated, but they became touchy and more unsafe as the years passed. Beling knew of the problem, and insisted that he needed better bombs; but he had a job to do, and the old ones were the only ones he was going to get to do it. Newer bombs could stand a lot of heat, and the old ones could not. Much sooner than anyone expected, one of the bombs blew up, a thousand pounds of explosive impacting at zero range. Of the 35 crewmembers nearby, 27 were killed instantly or got fatal injuries, and among this number were the expert firefighting team. It was merely the start of the larger disaster, for eight more of the old bombs were to go off. Most of the crew below decks thought that enemy bombers had found the _Forrestal_ and were attacking.<br />There are horrific and at times inspiring stories are told here with enormous sympathy for men pushed beyond all limits. Slowly the large fire was brought under control, although for days afterwards there might be rekindled fires to fight. The rear of the ship was so torn up that access could only come by lowering sailors into the compartments, and bodies were still being found weeks after the fire. The ship limped home to Norfolk. Freeman explains the aftermath of the disaster and the ruination of Beling's career, but more importantly explains how it affected the many other veterans he interviewed. The voluminous reports on the disaster neglected the importance of the faulty bombs but placed most of the blame on the firefighting deficiencies of the crew, a point of view emphasized in the firefighting training all sailors now get. This has been an unfair burden surviving crewmembers have had to bear, but Freeman has found that they are still proud of their service and of their ship, which was decommissioned in 1993, having seen a total of those four days in combat during her entire time at sea. The veterans want to turn her into a museum. The 134 men who died have their names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and those whose bodies were never recovered have a monument near the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington. Now, too, they have an unforgettable volume that in recounting the horrors and the heroism of the incident will be among their most lasting and fitting monuments.off.

I bet you know someone who collects elephant sculptures and pictures.  (If not, perhaps you know a Republican.)  Elephants are the number one attraction in the circus, something that circus managers realize very well.  Pandas might be a bigger draw at zoos, but they are really hard to get, while there are plenty of zoo elephants.  Many people worship Ganesha the elephant god, and others have a soft spot for Horton or Babar.  They are big, which always impresses humans; but we are not equally impressed by, say, giraffes.  Despite their size, elephants are relentlessly cute; they are obviously intelligent and active, and those trunks do impish and clever things.  They are social beings among themselves, and they do form important bonds with humans; though it is an exaggeration that they never forget, they do have capacity to remember those who treated them well and ill, for a long time.  It is the bonds with humans that Eric Scigliano treats in _Love, War, and Circuses: The Age-Old Relationship Between Elephants and Humans_ (Houghton Mifflin), a book that well captures the awe, delight, and sorrow we hold for the pachyderms among us.<br />Scigliano confesses himself addicted to &quot;elephalia,&quot; and the evidence is all here.  He has traveled to distant lands, and to zoos and circuses to learn about the captive version.  Scigliano's book winds up being an amiable miscellany of elephant lore.  There is the Bangkok developer who built a skyscraper in the shape of a deco cartoon of an elephant.  There are other smaller elephant buildings as novelty architecture in, say, Coney Island.  There has been a ballet for elephants, the Circus Polka, and before you think that this was some seedy novelty act, the choreography was by George Balanchine, and the music by Igor Stravinsky.  It ran for a season in 1942.  Elephants in Kenya dig deep caves to get to the salt.  Others dig wells, which benefit all the animals around.  But elephants have not generally fared well at the hands of the humans who ostensibly adore them.  Thai elephants, for instance, are worked illegally on protected reserves, and because the furtive work has to be done with speed, it is literally done with speed; the elephants are tanked up on amphetamines to work all through the night (whereas a three to five hour period is considered the maximum safe working day).  Circuses and zoos may try to treat elephants humanely, and perhaps are better at it than they used to be, but some of the horror stories here are truly disheartening.  The big beasts need plenty of room, and simply cannot get it in captivity; and there are fewer wilds for them to return to, as farming takes over their lands.<br />There are good conservation programs in elephant homelands, and Scigliano makes the case that the efforts now going to breed and raise elephants in captivity would be better directed to indigenous conservation.  There are other things we could do, but it will take the humans to get involved and do them.  This may be a book about elephants, but it is also specifically about humans who supposedly care about them.  Scigliano's book tackles all aspects of this puzzling relationship.  &quot;Each inquiry into the elephant-human tangle leads to paradox, even after thousands of years of undomesticated domestic partnership.  While we prop up our civilizations, literatures, and faiths upon its broad back, the animal remains untamed, and in many ways unknown.&quot;  His valuable book can help us understand how important elephants have been to us, and how impoverished the world will be if they are not given the room they need.lly fared well at the hands of the humans who ostensibly adore them.

The extent of his accomplishment and his peculiar and likable personality are well shown in _The Man Who Deciphered Linear B: The Story of Michael Ventris_ (Thames &amp; Hudson) by Andrew Robinson.  Ventris's accomplishment was an intellectual breakthrough ranking with the victory of Champollion over hieroglyphics, and unlike Champollion, he had no Rosetta Stone guide him in translations.  His victory was over the squiggles on clay tablets unearthed at Knossos on Crete.<br />Ventris became intrigued by the decipherment as a schoolboy, even furtively studying the language by flashlight under his bedsheets at school.  He modestly explained years later, &quot;Some of us thought it would be a change from our set lessons to try and decipher the tablets, but of course we didn' t get anywhere.  Somehow I've remained interested in the problem ever  since.&quot;  He did not then, of course, have the academic credentials to tackle such a task, but he never got them.  He was a brilliant linguist, picking up languages quickly and speaking like a native, but he had no training in language or the classics; he never even went to university.  He trained as an architect, and for all his short life, he split his endeavors between architecture and Linear B.  Robinson maintains that the decipherment was helped by Ventris's training in architecture.  The book is excellent at showing the difficult assignment Ventris gave himself, using good analogies with English words to make the puzzle as plain as possible for non-linguists.  It shows the importance of hunches and inspiration, as well as cold logic. Ventris solved what is probably the greatest challenge in deciphering any ancient language, and though the achievement was magnificent, the fruits were meager: there is no literature in the language, no epic poetry, no sparkling civilization.  The tablets are inventories and lists of possessions such as urns and goats.<br />Ventris was a gently humorous but private man who remains an enigma in many ways, and was so to the people who knew him.  Having abandoned further work on Linear B, he also abandoned the assignment he was pursuing in architecture at the same time.  He died in a car crash at the age of 34. Robinson is full of admiration for Ventris's astonishing accomplishment, and this book shows just how remarkable an achievement it was.  It is not only an excellent small biography, but an introduction to a magnificent intellectual triumph.rns and goats.<br />Ventris was a gently humorous but private man who remains an enigma in many ways, and was so to the people who knew him.

Taner Edis has the answer to the big question, and he is qualified to submit an answer, given the amount of thinking he has done on it. A physicist, he has for years run the cerebral and entertaining e-mail Skeptic Discussion List...which is devoted to the discussion (read 'debunking') of such topics as astrology, psychic powers, creation 'science,' miracles, and more. So you can probably guess where he stands: There are thousands of gods you don't believe in, and chances are he believes in even fewer than you. In _The Ghost in the Universe: God in the Light of Modern Science_ (Prometheus Books), his first book, he tells why he thinks that a naturalistic view, based on science, is a better explanation for what we experience in the world than any reach for spiritual answers. It is clear, wide-ranging, and intelligent, and it brings in topics from philosophy and science explained at a level accessible to readers with no expertise in those fields. It perhaps will swing no one from the spiritual camp, but those who wish to stay within it with intellectual vigor will do well to examine the arguments here.<br />Edis starts with philosophical proofs of God: 'A perfect being must exist, since if it did not, it would not be perfect. Having made God pop into existence by sheer force of logic, we now break out the champagne.' They carry little weight, even among believers, who are more likely to favor stories of a God who created and maintains the universe. Even the argument that there has to be a first cause God is a strong one that withers under quantum physics. We are used, in day to day life, to examining causes and effects, but we are guilty of looking only in our own scale of neighborhood. In the quantum world, things happen without being caused, and the Big Bang was a quantum event; the chain back to the first cause is broken. Of course Evolution is covered, in only a chapter, which shows that Edis's book is about much more. Edis shows how the physics of the universe has a random foundation, and randomness can be harnessed to ratchet up to increasing complexities. No designer, intelligent or otherwise, is needed. He critiques the scriptures, including the Quran, as human creations. He shows that psychological and neurological evidence indicates that our brains are engaged in examining an unmagical world, and spirits, souls, or direct contact with some ultimate reality are all equally unlikely. He sees no transcendent moral reality, no good and evil 'out there'; morals instead are a product of our genes and our social, collective effort to live together and incorporate conflicting interests.<br />Believers should be grateful that they have such a gentle critic. It could only be a fundamentalist of insecure faith who would accuse Edis of trashing religion. In fact, in intelligent opposition, Edis has shown a great deal of respect for the religious view. He also reveals himself to be a fan of the stories religions tell, because they can explain a good deal about ourselves. Most will think that this will be giving the stories too little credit, but as he repeatedly says in acknowledging how little certainty we have, it is good enough. His book is certainly good enough to benefit believers and nonbelievers alike.the universe has a random foundation, and randomness can be harnessed to ratchet up to increasing complexities.

It is hyperbole; he spent one good year there in 1988 and 1989, but he was a college graduate at the time.  He was, as a Greenwood friend reminds him throughout _Confederacy of Silence: A True Tale of the New Old South_ (Atria Books), an \\"Ivy League Yankee Jew,\\" who came in from New York and left again for New York.  His growing up during that year could have consisted only of disillusion and disgust, and while those were not absent, for Greenwood and its citizens he developed a compassion, a clear understanding, and even love.  The year incidentally was one of the steps that turned him into a very fine writer, as this, his first book, shows.<br /><br />With the job market for a non-typist, liberal arts degree graduate nil in New York, he was looking for work, and responded to an ad seeking a sports reporter for the Greenwood paper.  Throughout the book, he shows how Greenwood citizens were almost universally interested, kind, and accepting.  The rare instances when he was not welcomed were generally because he was a reporter, not because of his origins.  Of course he ran into racists, such as the one who refused the paper because it had too many pictures of blacks in it (although of course the word \\"black\\" was not used).  Rubin formulated the plan that while in Greenwood, he would maintain a courteous and genial appearance, and keep his outrage to himself.  While this is probably mere reciprocation of what the Greenwood citizens did toward him, it worked, in a way: \\"...while it would indeed protect my job, it would do something quite different to my conscience.\\"  Much of the delightful memoir within this book has to do with a foreigner adjusting to a strange land, and would do as a guidebook.  He learns what tea, fire ants, and chewing tobacco are, and that sports means football.  He was able to write about the Greenwood football team which had a glorious year, quarterbacked by a black, Handy Campbell, who, among other achievements, capped his season with a magnificent seventy yard pass against arch-rival Tupelo.  Campbell had all the makings for a fine college quarterback and a career as a professional, but it did not happen.  In fact, he wound up on trial for murder.  When Rubin, back in New York, heard about the charges, he returned to Greenwood, six years later, to find out what had happened.  He makes a good case that Campbell's college career was deliberately derailed because the universities could not at that time have accepted a black quarterback, although he does not leave out the mistakes Campbell made.  The outcome of the murder trial, meticulously reported here, reinforces much of what Rubin learned in his time in Greenwood, but it is a surprising outcome nonetheless, and not to be revealed here.<br />Rubin's digressions on his visits to Confederate graveyards, or meeting with Jews who lived in the town, or dating southern girls, are important to relaying the atmosphere of his second home town.  Though the latter part of the book is an examination of the sad case of Handy Campbell, the book overall is an affectionate portrayal of a Delta town and the friends he made there.  It has a gripping story, and brilliant pictures of singular characters.

Remember - it's no more difficult than a hard day's shopping.\\"  An invitation to go watch birds would strike most of us with the distinct notion that there was a movie we had to get to instead, or a daytime television drama to watch, or a headache to sustain.  And Mark Cocker can tell you that it is often much harder than shopping (his line is a bit of self-parody), for in _Birders: Tales of a Tribe_ (Atlantic Monthly Press), he has collected many stories about British birdwatching fanatics at the top of their form.  There are growing numbers of people who deliberately set about watching birds, doing more than just looking at birds in the garden, and in many ways Cocker's book is an apologia, but it is also at times an exceptionally funny look at a hobby that may be something more than a harmless way to pass time pleasantly.<br />There are different types of birders.  To be shunned is the \\"dude,\\" who not only is a beginner, but a beginner with pretensions.  There are the \\"robin-strokers,\\" who do their watching from the living room window, of birds who come to the feeder.  Neither term is what one friendly birder would use toward another.  \\"Twitcher\\" is a perfectly good word, but it is probably used more by non-birders than birders, to refer to birders in general.  Twitching, however, is more properly used to denote the pursuit of rare birds, and many of the funny stories in this book have to do with the twitching urge.  Finding a rarity, being the first one to report it, is one of the ways a birder can make a reputation.  We non-birders think that birders rank themselves by the length of the list of birds they have seen, but this is not so.  Just seeing lots of birds to make a high list signifies that you have merely spent money, time, and mileage to tally up the numbers.  A reputation among one's birding peers, however, is formed by being good enough at the endeavor to have a record of reliably spotting rare birds in the field, and subsequently providing the service to one's brethren of reporting the find so that others may participate, may verify, and may, incidentally, issue praise for a job well done.  Though many of the stories here are funny, some are inspiring, and then there are shocking ones of birders who have actually lost their lives in various and surprising ways, pursuing their harmless hobby.<br />There are also fond portraits of the experts in the field.  Birding is now practiced by millions, but it was not always so, and one of the profiles here is of Richard Richardson, who took a then socially unacceptable decision: \\"that birds are what mattered in life and that he would spend _his_ life birding.\\"  And that is what he did, to his own satisfaction and the improvement of the craft in others.  In a surprising way, Cocker shows Richardson to have lived with \\"Courage _and_ imagination - now there are the coordinates for a life worth living.\\"  I would not have previously thought such terms would well apply to the life of a mere birder.  While Cocker's account of his passion, and that of the many British birders described here, may not persuade you to share it, this brightly written summary can only promote understanding and even admiration for what birders do.subsequently providing the service to one's brethren of reporting the find so that others may participate, may verify, and may, incidentally, issue praise for a job well done.

It has been brought back into modern consciousness now by a surprising book, _A Poisoned Chalice_ (Princeton University Press) by Jeffrey Freedman.  The crime was poisoning of the communion wine at the Zurich Cathedral in 1776, and there were clues that someone with access to the church interior had done the foul deed.<br />The crime created a sensation in the German papers (not the Swiss ones, for they were forbidden to report on local matters.  The story swelled until it was reported that many communicants had died from the poisoning (none had).  There had been no eyewitness, and chemical analysis of the wine was contradictory, but the crime was so diabolical that a culprit had to be found.  He was a local gravedigger, but even though torture was used to get evidence, he was eventually freed because there wasn't any against him.  Libelous handbills were pasted up in the town accusing magistrates, not the gravedigger, of the crime.  Four years later, a whistleblower was charged with it, again with no evidence.  Johann Caspar Lavater, an influential Zurich pastor, orated and published sermons that blamed the rationalists and freethinkers for the crime.  He insisted that a depraved mind had carried out the poisonings, and such depravation could only have happened by inspiration of Satan himself, through the agency of those who favored more liberal religious views.  Lavater was opposed by Friedrich Nicolai, a leader of the Enlightenment in his region.  He and his fellows insisted that Christianity, whatever its merits, was not the only antidote to wickedness, that humans could form their own rational dictatesabout morality, and that Satan was a humbug.  Specifically in the poisoning case, Nicolai published a lucid refutation of Lavater, showing, for instance, that no one had complained about effects of the wine until allegations of the poisoning had become widespread.<br />Freedman has his own theory about whether there was a poisoning or not, and who did it, but without revealing it here, it is safe to say that the case was not solved at the time nor will it be in the future.  More importantly, he has connected this peculiar incident to the history of ideas.  The nature of evidence, the limits of scientific testing, the existence of Satan, the credibility of original sin, and the degree to which reason may bring morality all were examined at the time in the mirror of the communion poisoning.  _A Poisoned Chalice_ is a readable, entertaining account of a bizarre and mysterious little case, and the larger issues that were tied to it.	2002-06-25

Sure, I knew that in between relaxing at the firehouse, they got to go out and have some excitement, and that they did good work, and it was all commendable in a very manly way.  But with all the losses to the New York Fire Department (343 killed), and the vigil over the site of the World Trade Center as their bodies were finally unearthed, and the heartfelt mourning of their brothers at one funeral after another, my admiration for fireman has increased to something around the level it had when I was a kid and like all kids I wanted to be a fireman.  David Halberstam lives on the West Side of Manhattan, and had a distant admiration \\"for firemen, for their courage, for the highly professional and immensely good-natured way they go about their jobs, and for the fact that they constantly have to deal with terrifying fires in the high-rises that surround us.\\"  He had, before September 11, never been in his neighborhood Engine 40, Ladder 35 Firehouse.  The firehouse lost twelve of the thirteen men sent on the engine and ladder to the World Trade Center, and Halberstam, in _Firehouse_ (Hyperion) tells us of their lives and work.  It is a small, graceful, moving, eye-opening homage to firemen and their values.<br />The values are a family matter.  Not only are the members of a firehouse family to themselves, for they literally depend on each other for their lives.  Significantly, however, firefighting runs in families.  Some of the men lost that dreadful day were third generation firemen who, sometimes against the advice of their fathers, never wanted to be anything but firemen.  Halberstam tells a good deal about the inner life of the firehouse, such things as the tension felt on both sides as a new firemen on a probationary period (a \\"probie\\") is assigned to the station, the refusal of some firefighters to take the steps that would make them officers, the deliberate distance and respect between officers and men.  Among the stories here are many of firemen who had swapped shifts or just went off shift so that they were not among the ones to answer the first call.  Halberstam gives brief biographical portrayals of all twelve men, the one who was an expert at putting up wallpaper and did it for the homes of all the others, the one who was a former auto mechanic who kept all their private vehicles running smoothly, the golfers, the cooks, the one who had just shown up for his first workday at the firehouse, suiting up among strangers for the run five minutes later.<br /> Halberstam writes quietly, with admiration and even awe, but he describes his tale as one about \\"the nobility of ordinary people.\\"  He says that there \\"are very few stories that I have written in my 50 years as journalist that have been so personally rewarding,\\" and the story shines because unlike his previous books on Vietnam, the American press, or professional sports endeavors, this is one on heroes in a profession anyone can unabashedly admire.  \\"Even with elite combat units, when a soldier runs across a field of fire to carry off a wounded buddy, he is doing it for a pal;... [firefighters] perform acts of exceptional courage to save complete strangers.\\"  They were doing it before September 11, and they do it still, but we have more reason to be grateful, and less to take them for granted.ce and respect between officers and men.

They are all networks.  They conform to surprising mathematical laws which are only now becoming clear.  Albert-Laszlo Barabasi has helped discover some of those laws over just the past five years, and though they are some pretty abstruse mathematics, he has written a clear and interesting guide to them, _Linked: The New Science of Networks_ (Perseus Publishing).  Not only has he attempted in this book to bring the math to non-mathematicians, he has shown why the work is important in down-to-earth applications.<br />It is important for those multitudes who have no taste for math to know that this is not a book full of equations; Barabasi knows that for most of his readers, doing the math is not as important as getting a feel for what the math does.  He explains the basic history of network theory, and then shows how his own work has turned it into a closer model of reality, a model that most of us will recognize.  Networks are all around us, and they are simply not random.  Some of our friends, for instance, are loners, while others seem to know everyone in town.  Some websites, like Google and Amazon, we just cannot avoid clicking on or being referred to, but many others are obscure and you could only find them if someone sent you their addresses.  Barabasi calls these \\"nodes\\" with such an extraordinary number of  links \\"hubs,\\" and he and his students have found laws of networks with hubs, showing such things as how they can continue to function if random nodes are eliminated but they fragment if the hubs are hit. Barabasi is currently doing research to show what intracellular proteins interact with other proteins, and true to form, some of them are hubs of reactions with lots of others.  Finding the hubs of cancerous cells, for instance, and developing ways of taking them out, show enormous promise in the fight against cancer.  And finding the hub terrorists in Al Queda in order to take them out would be the best way to eliminate the network.<br />Barabasi obviously enjoys drawing examples from all over, and because of his ability to link them, his book is a pleasure to read.  He also shows how this type of mathematics is being done, by conference in obscure European locales and by e-mail.  He shows how \\"eureka\\" insights by his students have propelled the new science, and he is full of good stories from a teacher.  In fact, he is a good teacher, and those who follow along here will have reason to be glad to join, if only in the role of isolated nodes, into this network of mathematical thought.er.

It was 1941, ten days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the people of North Platte, a small town in Nebraska, had heard that a train carrying Nebraska National Guard's Company D would be passing through, carrying soldiers to the West Coast and to war. It would be their very own sweethearts, sons, and buddies, and the town showed up at the station with food to give to the boys. But it turned out that this was the Company D of _Kansas's_ National Guard. The citizens of North Platte may have been chagrinned about their mistake, but they made sure those Kansas boys were sent away as well appreciated as their own sons would have been. After all, they were going to war for them as surely as if they had been home town boys. The idea struck some of them that sending the soldiers off this way was just the sort of appreciation the little town ought to be showing. And so the North Platte Canteen was born, serving soldiers crossing the nation during ten minute refueling stops in a little town of people they didn't know. Serving millions of soldiers and sailors, train by train, day by day, until after the war ended.<br />Bob Greene says he was on a hunt for the \\"best America there ever was,\\" and if there are other nominations in the category, I bet he has them beat. His _Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen_ (Morrow) is the story of his visit to North Platte, research into the history of the Canteen, and interviews with the now quite elderly people who took part, both as donors and recipients of the town's hospitality. Twelve thousand people lived in the little town, and six million soldiers got a sincere greeting on their way through. The members of the town paid for it all themselves, used their rationing coupons, made do somehow, and made sure that the tables set up in a room of the station house were full of fried chicken, cakes, pheasant sandwiches, hot coffee, and chewing gum. They made an unforgettable impression on the young soldiers and sailors, many of whom did not even know, for security's sake, where they were eventually headed and many who would never get American hospitality ever again. One remembered, \\"Those people spent all that time and donated all that money - to get the sugar and all that stuff. They gave up their own ration stamps. They were using their ration stamps for us. We all knew what that meant. I wrote home about it.\\"<br />And their mothers wrote to the town, having read their sons' stories of how well they had been treated at North Platte. \\"Heaven bless you for what you did for my boy and every other mother's boy.\\" The town still gets letters of thanks from the servicemen who came through, but Greene's fine book must be the best thank you written. He has told about the current North Platte, too, and of course it isn't anything like the one of sixty years ago, though his visit to an abortive Bikini Contest is hilarious. His last book, _Duty_, was about patriotism writ large in the crew of the Enola Gay, and this one is about the smaller, home-grown version. It is sweet, and if he gets schmaltzy now and then, that's the right tone exactly, and thank goodness he got some of these old folks to tell this story before it was too late. There are other fine stories of Americans doing the right thing, stories that are current; but the North Platte Canteen was inspiring, and sentimentally fulfilling, and unique, and gone forever.sion on the young soldiers and sailors, many of whom did not even know, for security's sake, where they were eventually headed and many who would never get American hospitality ever again.

And the book _Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Words_ (John Wiley) by John Man has to concentrate on Gutenberg's printing press.  There is not really enough known about his life to make a biography, but Man's readable book makes a stab at summarizing what we do know about Gutenberg's comings and goings; more importantly, it reveals much of the history of his time and place, and explains how very quickly printing took over Europe.<br />Most of the documents we have on Gutenberg come from his business dealings (and court suits), for as Man portrays him, he was nothing if not a determined businessman.  His first business venture involved pressing out mirrors, and perhaps there was a spark that inspired his more famous product.  Somehow, and we will never know how, Gutenberg had the idea of making multiple cheap copies of the metal punch that stamps out letters.  Man can't show the process of invention, but he can show the invention, the \\"hand held mould\\" which was not replaced until mechanical typesetting came along.  The other revolutionary idea was binding the type produced by the mould into a \\"forme,\\" which seems a simple procedure, but is full of complexities detailed here.  Before tackling the Bible, whose printing for common folks was controversial, Gutenberg wisely printed a standard Latin grammar, astrological and fortune-telling pulp, and forms for selling indulgences, quick tickets to heaven.  When it came time to print the Bible, he produced a stunner.  Man rhapsodizes over its type, layout, and the invention of right justification.  The ones that remain are still as readable as when they were printed, and unlike the ungainly first attempts at such things as automobiles or personal computers, they have a beauty that is still worth aiming for.<br /><br />Lacking material for a full biography, Man indulges in many fascinating digressions, like why comparable printing was not invented in China, and why the Muslim world did not start printing until the end of the nineteenth century. Especially fascinating here are the immediate results of printing, which could have unified the church but wound up helping to split it.  Luther probably did not nail his theses on the door of the Wittenberg church; there is no contemporary account of anything like this legend.  But he did write up theses, and as sensitive documents still do today, they got quickly leaked, published, and republished beyond his control.  Before Gutenberg, a monk would have taken days to copy a few pages.  After Gutenberg, a printer could do hundreds of copies of an entire book in a few days.  A dozen years after Gutenberg's death in 1468, there were more than a hundred European towns with printing presses, and by the end of the fifteenth century, there were maybe twenty million books circulating.  We are used to the electronic revolution, but Gutenberg's was more fundamental.  Man's account of a tenacious inventor, entrepreneur, and artisan is a fine guide to just how far Gutenberg launched us, and how quickly.rable printing was not invented in China, and why the Muslim world did not start printing until the end of the nineteenth century.

Or Amazon is happy to take constructive criticism.  You can decide on the best explanation, but Daisey has seen the commercial Internet revolution firsthand, and he doesn't like what he saw.  He worked for a couple of years as a wage slave at Amazon.com, and since everyone there had the habit of changing the period they worked into what is supposed to be the equivalent time in a dog's life, he has titled his memoir.  It is a very funny and rather touching account of his life within \\"Earth's Biggest Selection.\\"<br />Motivated mostly by fear of dental decay, he telephoned an answer to the _Seattle Weekly_ ad which started: \\"CUSTOMER SERVICE TIER 1: LAME TITLE - COOL JOB.\\"  Perhaps he should have been worried when they called back five minutes later, but he had a peculiar hankering in this time of his life for a Real Job.  Maybe he should have wondered when all the desks were made out of used doors.  It turns out he was in love.  He fell in love with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.  Everyone was in love with Bezos, who was supposed to personify the Internet revolution, but especially in the eyes of the Amazon staffers, the resiliently cheerful CEO who dressed like a regular guy, had a receding hairline, and had an unforgettable and frequent laugh, was \\"...a god, the still point around which the Amazonian world revolved.  Religions have their popes and prophets, and we had Jeff.\\"  The love did not seem to translate into efficient service.  \\"The weirdest thing about the entire structure was how totally unnecessary it was.  We never spoke to anyone on our team with regard to our work.  You were surrounded by coworkers but you never needed to have meetings or `interface' with anybody.  The only people you spoke with were four to six hundred customers a shift.\\"  There was a constant monitoring of performance, like how long it took a representative to handle a call.  When their \\"call resolution time\\" needed buffing, they just started hanging up on people for the quickest of resolutions.  When they transferred a complaining customer to higher management, it wasn't to higher management at all, but to the next cubicle over.  There really wasn't time to find love or a life outside the company, and in the New Economy we were learning that enlightened folks slept where they worked - why shouldn't they take all their other pleasures there, too?\\"  As a result, \\"...those who weren't previously attached spent every waking moment sleeping with one another.\\"  (Can it be that those good folks who take care of editing and posting these reviews are putting up with the same environment?)<br />Eventually, dismayed with bureaucratic silliness and a firm that was meaninglessly expanding without making money, and whose stock during those times was fudged to look far better than it was, Daisey had to had to ask himself, \\"... titles aside, pride aside, what was I actually _doing_?  Nothing.\\"  Deciding that being a directionless artist had been no better than being a directionless office drone, and worried to think he had succumbed to dot-com greed, he said goodbye to Jeff and his empire.  Hilariously, he was such a red hot commodity after leaving Amazon that headhunters started calling him all day to sign him on as an e-commerce veteran.  He turned this irony and all the others into a one-man show (which opened the day after his Non-Disclosure Agreement with Amazon lapsed), and this book that grew from it.  It is written in a breezy, joking style that shows the raconteurship which would power a stage performance, but there is plenty serious here about what is wrong with commerce, e-commerce, and the service sector.  And for those of us who like Amazon, and write reviews to help others use Amazon well, we can only hope someone in the organization is taking theserious parts seriously.serious parts seriously.	2002-06-12

And I bet you will not be able to forget him, once you have read _Tuxedo Park: A Wall Street Tycoon and the Secret Palace of Science that Changed the Course of World War II_ (Simon and Schuster) by Jennet Conant.  World War II, more than any preceding conflict, was won by scientific and technological superiority, and one of the allies' successes was radar.  There was no more daring or inventive mind on the project than that of Alfred Loomis, and we can hope that this remarkable book redeems him from obscurity.<br />Loomis was groomed for WASP success.  He went to Yale, and to law school at Harvard, and then on to Wall Street where he made a fortune.  He displayed \\"a high-powered intellect that could cut through a maze of difficulty with dazzling speed.\\"  He was a chess prodigy, a brilliant solver of puzzles, and a keen magician.  He and a partner took over a failing bond firm, and started specializing in utilities.  They realized the volatility of the 1920s market, and were among the few to make money during the crash and after it.  He had one idea in finance after another, and he was dazzlingly successful.  But he wasn't interested in making money.  He was interested in science.  He bought a rambling Tudor mansion in Tuxedo Park, the estate in which he lived, and turned it into a crackerjack private lab, where he did first-rate experiments in timekeeping, ultrasound, biology, and encephalography.  Einstein called it \\"a palace of science.\\"  Loomis not only dabbled brilliantly in many fields, he allowed plenty of the greats to come use his lab, and set up conferences for them all to be together.  When someone had a good idea but no money to pursue it, Loomis granted the money.  He not only had money, but he had contacts.  Having underwritten Earnest Lawrence's efforts to produce a cyclotron, he then squired him around to the princes of industry who thereafter supplied the materials and equipment at bargain rates.  He had an unbelievably useful ability to make networks.  He was at the heart of the development of radar, and the science behind radar (which was devastatingly successful against Nazi planes as well as submarines), and the excitement of successful testing and deployment, are well conveyed here.<br />Loomis loved his anonymity, he loved being able to experiment in his own way unbeholden to others, and he modestly avoided any of the fame that he deserved.  \\"He was, by disposition, an extremely understated man who really did not care for being center stage.\\"  He would have been embarrassed had this summary of his efforts been published in his lifetime, but Conant has had access to his papers and other documents that had previously been unavailable.  This is a great story of an astonishing intellect, powerfully told, bringing to light his many accomplishments and contributions to science and to public service.plied the materials and equipment at bargain rates.

They had been living in eastern Washington for years, and he wanted to see more of the West than Spokane.  His mother understood completely; it is not an uncommon occurrence for a young man to want to roam before settling down to respectable ways.  He hooked up with his best friend Frank Golden, and they figured they would do some prospecting in northern Idaho.  A tough life loomed, but Grigware had no idea that he would as a result be accused and convicted of a crime he did not commit, incarcerated in the toughest prison in existence, escape from the prison, and remain on the lam from his country for the rest of his life.  The astonishing story of Grigware's life is told in _Leavenworth Train: A Fugitive's Search for Justice in the Vanishing West_ (Carroll & Graf) by Joe Jackson, who shows that Grigware was guilty of nothing but naïvet&eacute; when he associated with train robbers.  He was, however, found as guilty as the rest of them, and a quick decision gave all the defendants life imprisonment, at Leavenworth, the first US federal penitentiary.<br />It was only six months into his sentence that Grigware, who the prisoners could tell was not really one of them, was let in on an escape by four other prisoners.  Using the classic ploy of threatening with guns skillfully crafted of wood from one of the shops and blackened with shoe polish, they hijacked a train that regularly supplied the prison.  Grigware was the only one not captured quickly, and for the next 24 years was one of America's most wanted men.  The trail was long cold, even after President Woodrow Wilson commuted the sentence of the other robbers because the evidence in the case was so lacking.  The FBI refused to back down, and it spied on members of Grigware's family, which was sadly fractured by his escape.  Grigware in sorrow knew he could communicate with none of them, but set up a respectable life in Canada, becoming a Canadian citizen and a well-liked member of the community of Jasper, Alberta.  He was not found until 1934, and what happened afterwards is of great charm.  There was a groundswell of Canadian public opinion against any sort of extradition; even the game warden circulated a petition.  The mild Grigware had made many friends, and he was the sort of reliable citizen Canadians wanted.  Grigware's wife (who had not known of his past), when the press reported her simple statement, \\"Nothing will ever break up our home,\\" made up the minds of any Canadians that had doubts on the issue.  It became an international incident, and a clash of redemptive versus retributive justice.<br />Grigware was reunited with his family, which had long thought him dead; the meeting with his aging mother could not have been sweeter.  But he could not return with her to the US, nor return for her funeral.  President Roosevelt waived extradition, but no pardon was ever issued, so if he ever came back to the US, he could land right in Leavenworth again.  That result would seem preposterous as the decades went by, but in 1957, J. Edgar Hoover was still sending out directives that insisted that agents monitor Grigware's relatives in case he were to show up.  Every FBI memo issued about him screamed that HE WOULD KILL OR BE KILLED RATHER THAN BE RECAPTURED, a rumor that had arisen in 1911 and which still headlined Hoover's directives about Grigware, who was then seventy-one years old.  This exciting and frustrating story, crammed with period detail, reminds us that courts are not always right and that as much justice as was available in this case came from the hearts of ordinary women and men.in Canada, becoming a Canadian citizen and a well-liked member of the community of Jasper, Alberta.

With that in mind, he has now written _Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Ancient Mammals from Montana to Mongolia_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), which does not scrimp on scientific information, but still consists mostly of stories about how paleontologists do what they do.  Interested in fossils even as a boy, in graduate school he got interested in extinct insectivores, which are now represented by hedgehogs, shrews, and moles, but which were much more diverse in the past.  Novacek admits that these aren't the showiest of ancient animals: \\"they might be more aptly called vermin than beasts.\\"  But in an evolutionary sense, they have vast importance; from such shrewlike creatures came rodents, bats, elephants, whales, and of course, humans.  He shows us what sort of work he has done on the creatures, and why it has been important.<br />The book's main attraction is his stories of field work all over the world.  They are told with good humor, and occasionally with forgiveness.  He starts as a novice, worried that the graduate students are going to play tricks on him, and eventually ends up leading expeditions himself, to Baja, Mongolia, the Andes, and Yemen.  Reading these tales makes one realize that there truly must be a fantastically strong appeal for this sort of work, if Novacek still likes it after all the difficulties he experienced, from mildly irritating to potentially lethal.  \\"Our hands were swollen and blistered from swinging sledges all day, and our backs were sore from cradling heavy plaster blocks as we climbed the steep slope back to the vehicles.  The work was hard.  But I liked the routine, I felt useful; we were a chain gang in the service of science.\\"  There are a few tales worthy of Indiana Jones, like how his party is ominously detained by the militia in Yemen.  In the Andes, he is tangled in the stirrup of a horse and dragged down painfully, temporarily ruining his legs.  He is bitten in the groin by the world's most deadly scorpions in Baja.  He discovers that a desert can bloom into swarms of insects denser than that in a rain forest because they are attracted to sweat.  There are bar fights.  Shrapnel from a colleague's hammer on a specimen severs one of his arteries.  \\"As some of my college mates would say, `It's a lot of trouble for a few old bones.'\\"<br />Novacek's animated tales and explanations of how he has done his work give genuine insight into his passion.  He has included lots of real science here about plate tectonics, evolution, and much more.  For those who never graduated beyond childhood dinomania, it will tell them what they missed.  Best of all, this book ought to be in the hands of young people who are in the thralls of such enthusiasm, for in its pages are revealed what it is really like to be a paleontologist.a chain gang in the service of science.\\"  There are a few tales worthy of Indiana Jones, like how his party is ominously detained by the militia in Yemen.

It had commies to contend with, and even more seriously, television and the dismantling of the studio system.  The fifties have been regarded as a bland cinematic decade, but there were some astonishingly thoughtful and influential films that became revered by French filmmakers and current Hollywood ones.  The period is reconsidered in _The Bad and the Beautiful: Hollywood in the Fifties_ (W. W. Norton) by Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair.  The authors admit that this is not a comprehensive history of that period in Hollywood; indeed, it is surprising that they have no chapters devoted to westerns or to science fiction.  They call their book instead \\"a kind of archeological dig by two writers too young to have experienced the decade firsthand,\\" and as such, it is a useful reminder of such things as the blacklist, novel and provocative tabloid journalism, influential gossip columnists, and a good deal of scandalous dirt.<br />Plenty of the scandal is sexual, of course, and some of the stories are not at all new.  Rock Hudson had a powerful effect on women, and one actress tried to get him to show proper affection on screen, begging a director, \\"Can't you get Rock to kiss me properly?\\"  The director, Douglas Sirk, \\"declined, knowing why Hudson's kisses seemed awkward.\\"  Lana Turner gets a chapter, including tales of her promiscuity, as does Mae West and her hilarious geriatric sensuality.  The forgotten affair between Kim Novak and Sammy Davis, Jr., gets an airing, too.  Billy Graham's first religious film is included, as are the more familiar biblical epics of the period.  There are excellent chapters here about particular films, like _Peyton Place_, _Sweet Smell of Success_, and _Rebel Without a Cause_.  Did you know that in that last film, director Nicholas Ray hunted hard for the three leads, James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo, and seems to have had affairs with all of them?  And James Dean did, with Natalie Wood, who also was with co-star Dennis Hopper.<br />The book starts with _Sunset Boulevard_, a film it refers to through many chapters.  In it, Gloria Swanson made her peculiar comeback as the bypassed and doomed silent film queen Norma Desmond.  The book ends with the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy, whose father had had an affair with Swanson, and whose campaign had unprecedented ties to Hollywood and its stars.  In between is a wealth of the sort of trivia, titillation, and sleaze that could only come from Hollywood.  Kashner and MacNair love their theme, have picked their subjects well, and have juicy bits to reveal to anyone interested in the movies.them?

There was a real Captain Kidd, and he did sail among the pirates, but we all have the wrong idea about him, according to Richard Zacks, whose _The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd_ (Theia / Hyperion) sets the record straight.  William Kidd was a master mariner who lived in New York, on Wall Street, no less, at the end of the seventeenth century.  He had a wife and daughter.  \\"He was no career cutthroat, no cartoon Blackbeard, terrifying his prey by putting flaming matches in his hair.\\"  Kidd was a respectable sea captain, who had enormously bad luck in his endeavors to hunt pirates for profit.<br />Kidd was no pirate, but a privateer, recruited by powerful Lords and merchants to rob from the pirates that had robbed from the merchants.  He had a secret commission from King William III himself, who privately took a ten percent share of any profits that Kidd might come up with.  Kidd sailed on _Adventure Galley_, a three-master built in England and launched in 1696 specifically for Kidd's mission, with a crew of 150.  Many of the crew had been pirates themselves, and Kidd was putting himself in an uncomfortable management position.  He had nothing but bad luck in finding pirates to rob, but even before he did so, rumors of his being a pirate himself had sprung up.  After his crew mutinied, he tried to return to his home in New York, but discovered to his surprise that he was the most wanted man in America.  He sneaked back towards New York, and in another unpiratical act, sought the help of his lawyer.  He made overtures to Lord Bellomont, his prime backer, but the gouty and treacherous Bellomont, having learned of the extent and whereabouts of the haul Kidd had brought back, put him into jail.  Kidd was shipped in chains to England.  The corruption involved in his jail term and his trial are well detailed here.<br />Zacks has dug into account books, diaries, and forgotten, centuries-old governmental documents to bring out the truth about Kidd, but this is far from a dusty academic account.  Zacks has fun telling us about how pirates really lived, how politics was conducted, the difficulties of shipboard life, and how different the times were from our own.  For example, he writes of a messenger: \\"As he reached the East River, the Manhattan skyline loomed: a windmill and two church steeples towering over a seaside row of three-story gable roofs.\\"  Kidd's was a wild and eventful life, even if it wasn't the life of a pirate.  My guess is that Zacks's book will never overcome the centuries of folklore that have accumulated around Kidd's story, but the true story is still a rousing treasure.r />Zacks has dug into account books, diaries, and forgotten, centuries-old governmental documents to bring out the truth about Kidd, but this is far from a dusty academic account.

In the long-awaited _A New Kind of Science_ (Wolfram Media, Inc.), that particular cellular automaton is the foundation for an astonishingly wide-ranging tour of what CAs can do.  Wolfram thinks that if we had had computers to show us the power of CAs centuries ago, science and mathematics would not have grown up along the lines of equations and calculations which all of us associate with scientific endeavors.  We would have been examining complexity that inherently can come from simple systems, and we would have been a lot further along by now.  He has put out his enormous book so that we can now start doing things right.<br />He has spread his understanding of CAs into a scattershot sweep of intellectual concerns.  He shows that the randomness in physical phenomena, like fluid turbulence or how materials crack, can be better explained by simple programs rather than chaos or complexity theory.  He explains why the Second Law of Thermodynamics (the one that says entropy is always increasing) works.  He shows that while evolution my control comparatively coarse features of plants and animals, the complex ones such as leaf or stem shape, or pigmentation markings, are better explained by simple programs.  Stock market fluctuations, free will, space, time, and relativity all come under his sway.  In fact, the whole universe may be governed by a simple program, and finding it would be a more worthy goal than trying to find a mathematical representation of some Theory of Everything.<br />_A New Kind of Science_ is not light reading.  The book is massive, at over 1,200 pages.  Wolfram knows he is writing about a wealth of new ideas, and has deliberately tried to write so that any interested reader, not just a scientist or computer scientist, can understand him.  To a large part he has succeeded, although I despair of anyone making plain to me the inner workings of relativity or quantum theory.  He has not leavened these pages with humor or with anecdotes, but it is clear that this is a very personal work showing the deepest interests of its creator.  His audacity is everywhere apparent; it is very seldom that he will admit, for instance, that in explaining the fundamental laws of physics \\"there is still some distance to go.\\"  Anyone who reads the whole book will get very used to his slightly tempered observations that \\"I very strongly suspect\\" or \\"I very strongly doubt.\\"  This is one of the best-looking books I have read in years.  There is no use of color, but the diagrams (all produced by Wolfram's famous Mathematica software system) are frequent, perfectly integrated into the text, and often starkly beautiful in their own right.  It could be that Wolfram will rightly be hailed as the Isaac Newton of the twenty-first century, and only time will tell.

Bacteria, for instance, have been around for a billion or so years more than we have.  They are intricately involved in every part of our outer world and our innards.  No one has come close to listing all the microbes we carry around inside us even when we are healthy, but medical journalist Madeline Drexler, in _Secret Agents: The Menace of Emerging Infections_ (Joseph Henry Press) reports that we are \\"walking petri dishes\\" to keep our bacteria and viruses going.  She begins her detailed and frightening book: \\"Infection is an inescapable part of life. All creatures feast on other creatures and in turn are feasted upon, in a kind of Escheresque food chain. When humans are the meal, we call it infectious disease.\\"  Infections have always been our lot, but there are, in the twenty-first century, new ways for them to be particularly worrisome, and Drexler's fine book ought to be required reading for citizens and public leaders the world over.<br />The examples Drexler gives of disasters and near-disasters are chilling.  Microbes never had it so good.  They profit, for example, by the way the world can now share its food supply, enabling bizarre accidents to happen.  A vandal shoots up the water chlorination system of his Mexican village, and causes (via parsley) food poisoning in hundreds of Minnesotans.  Alfalfa sprouts, beloved by vegetarians, are grown in heat and moisture just right for salmonella from the Netherlands.  You no longer have to travel to get traveler's diarrhea; it will visit you at home, and maybe it will be fatal.  Not only are microbes jetting around the world (and not just on food, of course, but also in infected humans), but they are simply outsmarting our ability to kill them.  Microorganisms are beating our antibiotics by the simple mechanisms of evolution.  More patients are dying from infections that were easily curable thirty years ago.  The next world flu is overdue, and because of speed of modern travel and older populations, it will have advantages that no others have ever had.  Legionnaire's disease, tuberculosis, West Nile virus, bubonic plague, AIDS, and more all get their pages here.  Then there is bioterrorism.  There is reason for a good deal of pessimism.<br />It would be wrong to assume that there is nothing but pessimism, though.  Governments are going to have to have to stop putting their own citizens first and start thinking about doing the right thing for the world's humans.  Drexler makes a clear case that the Bush administration's rejection of the Biological Weapons Convention (when all other nations had accepted it), because it threatened national security or the commercial secrets of the drug companies, encourages rogue states to work on their deadly brews.  Bioterrorism aside, at least some nations and epidemiologists are recognizing that any nation's infection is the world's infection.  Health authorities have, in the past, been able to spot unusual clusters of disease and intervene; nowadays, this is going to take swift identification of the germ (there are exciting new gadgets that might do this without the days required to culture the organism) and rapid communication about the threat.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is changing international health measures by pouring billions of dollars into the effort.  It will take money in all nations; even the US federal, state, and local health departments (for instance) are underfunded and ill-equipped.  It may be that the bioterror threat is going to do some good as we enter an age of increased threat from natural disease as well; boosted national systems that are keyed for man-made infection emergencies could help protect us as more powerful infections visit us from all over.  Even if the terrorists stop bothering us, the microbes won't; we might take the heroic measures needed to protect the world, or we might continue the status quo.overdue, and because of speed of modern travel and older populations, it will have advantages that no others have ever had.

Hundreds of slaves told their stories in the nineteenth century, making some money thereby and striking a blow against slavery when their stories were used as abolitionist tracts.  One of the most incredible was the _Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown_ (Oxford University Press).  That \\"Box\\" as a middle name was adopted by Brown in commemoration of the method by which he gained his freedom.  He had himself crated up and shipped from slavery to liberty.  His audacious plan worked, and this is his story.<br />Remarkably, this is the first time this edition has been printed in the US.  Brown writes in his preface, \\"The tale of my own sufferings is not one of great interest to those who delight to read of hair-breadth adventures, of tragic occurrences, and scenes of blood - my life, even in slavery, has been in many respects comparatively comfortable.\\"  Of course the telling word there is \\"comparatively.\\"  The torture worse than any was worry about his family being sold away, and eventually they were, and he never saw them again.  The other main theme in his pre-box narrative is the involvement of the church in supporting slavery, a hypocrisy which revolts Brown, a religious man.  The loss of his family convinced Brown to make his remarkable escape: \\"The idea suddenly flashed upon my mind of shutting myself up in a box and getting myself conveyed as dry goods to a free state.\\"  He arranged to have himself nailed into a wooden crate, 37 by 24 by 30 inches, lined in baize.  He was shipped by dray, railroad car, steamboat, and horse cart, 350 miles from Richmond to Philadelphia in 27 hours.  The box bore the label, \\"THIS SIDE UP WITH CARE,\\" but shipping agents back then paid as little attention to those directions as they do now, and Brown had to survive some jostling and spells upside down.  Philadelphia's Anti-Slavery Committee sent for the box, and opened it nervously at their office.  Brown emerged calmly, said, \\"How do you do, gentlemen?\\" and fainted.  Upon awakening, he sang the fortieth psalm.<br />Brown's narrative ends with his emergence from what could have been his coffin, but the useful introduction by Richard Newman explains that Brown went on the lecture circuit, telling about his slavery experiences and of course his curious escape.  He had to flee to England to avoid recapture, and prospered on the stage telling his story.  His eventual fate is unknown.  However, we have his book now, in as near to his words as we can get, finally published in the land he chastised for restricting it's grand freedoms to slave-holders.  His stark account of slave life makes a poignant memoir, and of course his brave (or foolhardy) and novel way of escaping it is thrilling.  Students of the Underground Railroad already know of Brown, and this new edition of his book should enlarge his merited fame.pened it nervously at their office.

But there is an activity common to all animals that does not always involve behavior that can be seen, and so despite its universality, it is invisible or taken for granted.  It is the need to maintain a comfortable body temperature, and it is one of the great strivings of animals.  In _Body Heat: Temperature and Life on Earth_ (Harvard), Mark S. Blumberg demonstrates just how important regulating temperature is, showing that it is directly connected to anatomy, behavior, human history, language, and much more.  A reader may come away from this book feeling that the drive to stay warm or stay cool explains many of the mysteries of animal and human behavior.<br />Temperature regulation is intimately connected, for instance, with animal size.  Small animals lose heat disproportionately faster than large ones, and so are more likely to have fur, active lives and metabolic rates, and shorter lives.  Birds and mammals make their own heat, but in a way, reptiles do, too, as if they have the chance to wander to different temperature zones, they will keep themselves within narrow boundaries of temperature.  Even lice and nematodes will do so.  Temperature has plenty to do with sex.  (Blumberg repeatedly demonstrates in this sphere and others that our language reflects a basic interest in matters Fahrenheit.  English is not the only language to refer to such things as \\"the heat of passion\\" or \\"I've got the hots for you.\\")  There is literal heating of different body parts during sexual stimulation.  Not only during sex, but at all other times, different parts of the body take on different temperatures.  This is often done with a remarkable mechanism called \\"countercurrent heat exchange\\" which shows up all over the animal kingdom.  Basically it involves sending blood through a pool that can pre-warm or pre-cool it, as is needed by its final destination.  There is an important chapter on fever.  It took a surprisingly long time for people to realize that fever is a good thing, a response of the body that helps in healing, rather than a symptom that has to be cured.  Such a finding was first reliably sparked by experiments on iguanas, of all things.<br />This is a wide-ranging and informative book.  Blumberg explains the many different experiments that have brought us to our understanding of body heat, and draws from many examples in natural history.  He has written a diverting and lucid book, which has good humor throughout.  It is a perfect introduction for the general reader to a vital topic.y its final destination.

We hear less about the loss of deserts.  Let the military test there, let off-track entertainment vehicles bounce there, let toxic wastes accumulate there; they are not good for much else, goes the common view.  They are uncomfortable places to visit, and they can't be turned to agriculture.  Michael A. Mares, in _A Desert Calling: Life in a Forbidding Landscape_ (Harvard), has a completely different view.  Mares has spent his professional life studying the deserts of the United States, Argentina, Iran, and Egypt.  He undoubtedly knows plenty about plants, insects, birds, and snakes of these areas, but he is a specialist in the mammals that have evolved to live in such harsh conditions.  Desert rats, mice, armadillos, and gerbils have been his study, and he has here (note the double meaning of the title) assembled a description of his life's work, as well as an attempted explanation of just why he has spent so much time in places the rest of us could not stand.  His thoughtful and funny stories are a sort of autobiography, and he has much to tell us about the exotic animals that he wants better appreciated.<br />There are some peculiar beasts out there.  The kangaroo rat has a nose exquisitely tuned to find buried seeds, and can filter sixty seeds from sand in a second.  There are penguins in the desert in Patagonia.  There are a few rodents on different continents who can live on the leaves of the saltbush, leaves that have a protective outer layer of cells full of salt.  They have special teeth, or in one case, special dental hairs, that strip away the inedible layer to get to the green below.  There are deadly assassin bugs.  Mares describes staying in some of the most unpleasant regions of the world, and admits that when he is busy with academia and home, he longs to get to the desert, but it works vice versa, too.  He is almost killed by fungus infesting his lungs after climbing through guano deposits in a New Mexico cave.  He is nearly crushed by trees falling during a storm on a bat hunt in Costa Rica.  Some of the most surprising specimens described here are humans, and Mares has plenty of funny stories.<br />_A Desert Calling_ is full of light moments, and near-disasters that are pleasant to recall because they are over.

It was founded on two supports, he said: vanity and greed, and humans could be relied upon for a perpetual supply of both.  It isn't surprising, then, that there has been a multimillion dollar advertising campaign stretching over the last decades to emphasize the happier side, the romance of diamonds.  Romance or not, there is someone eager to steal a diamond from a mine, or to divert rough diamonds from their appointed cutters and polishers, or to jump a claim on a supposed diamond field, or fence diamonds to sponsor a war, or jack up prices artificially.  \\"Malfeasance rustles in the background of the diamond world like a snake in dry grass,\\" writes Matthew Hart in _Diamond: A Journey to the Heart of an Obsession_ (Walker & Co.), a wide-ranging and entertaining look at different components of the diamond business.<br />One cannot tell the story of diamonds without telling about De Beers, which started cornering the market in diamonds over a century ago; but much of this story is about how De Beers is losing control over the diamond market.  De Beers executives do not travel to the United States, because they would be arrested; there are charges, the latest from 1994, for price fixing.  (\\"The most senior managers of the world's preeminent diamond company are thus effectively prevented from setting foot in their largest market.\\")  The main assaults on De Beers have not been legal, of course, but simple economic competition.  Diamond mines in Russia, Canada, and Australia are now profitable, and India, which is not a primary supplier of diamonds, is busy supplying cut and polished jewels which other mines formerly sold only for industrial use.  Hart is best on the skullduggery, large and small, in the diamond trade, which is taken for granted.  He tells about the history of some famous gems, like the Hope Diamond, and describes the complicated process of cutting a diamond in some detail.<br />Hart has plenty of good stories.  He has been the mining editor for the New York monthly the _Rapaport Diamond Report_, and has visited the exotic areas he tells about.  Diamonds in the rough are an annual six billion dollar industry; those same diamonds wind up in the jewelry stores going for 56 billion, and Hart has surveyed the process from beginning to end.  There are summaries here of geology and history, as well as the technology of cutting and polishing the gems we cannot get enough of.  Hart is not a flashy writer, but the many facets of this lucrative and larcenous trade make scintillating reading.in some detail.  <br />Hart has plenty of good stories.

McCloskey's change was devastating to the family of which she had formerly been father, and she was locked out of their lives, but we did not get to read the family's side of the story.  Now,  Noelle Howey, in _Dress Codes: Of Three Girlhoods - My Mother's, My Father's and Mine_ (Picador), has let us hear from the daughter of such a family, but the results are outstandingly different.  \\"This isn't a tragedy,\\" she writes.  \\"It's just nonfiction.\\"  It is a memoir brightly told, often achingly funny, and sympathetic to all concerned.  There will be those who argue that a father who imposes such a change on his family makes a mockery of family values, and it is true that Howey's family had serious struggles and the marriage did not last.  But they loved and helped each other through the crisis and afterwards, and you can't find better family values than that.  Far from being the story only of a man who had to change his gender, _Dress Codes_ succeeds in telling how mother, father, and daughter all came of age and found their true selves.<br />Howey knows this material is strange, but she specifies that learning about sexuality, at least in current mainstream America, is something most of us do in a stumbling fashion.  Her own stumblings are recounted here with good humor, and for the book, she interviewed each of her parents about their own sexual upbringing, a process of hours that she says she will treasure forever.  Of course the father's realization about himself, played over decades, is the main reason for this memoir, and Howey tells the history of her father's coming to terms with herself with sympathy and without psychologizing.  Like most transsexuals, he found it hard to fit in when he was growing up, although he was competent in school and eventually as an advertising executive.  He liked wearing women's clothes, but it must be clearly understood that enjoying cross-dressing is different from feeling that one is in a body of the wrong sex.  Howey has to correct a friend who is incredulous that her father would go through all the therapy, electrolysis, and surgery just to wear a dress.  \\"For what it's worth, my father didn't go through 'all that' to wear a dress.  She prefers suede blazers with pleated slacks.\\"  He was not an ideal father as Howey was growing up - distant, critical, and uncommunicative, there was something wrong with him.  Importantly, as Dick became Christine, her father became more understanding and understandable.  Eventually, after the divorce, the family planned a big coming out party for Christine Howey, and it went very well, with fairly good acceptance from other family members and co-workers.  They did have to undergo criticism, such as one male friend of the family who took the opportunity to inform Howey's mom that if she had been more feminine he would have had more incentive to stay the way God made him.<br />Howey has written the story of a family and its members who have gone through enormous changes and have helped each other all they could.  Her candid, funny writing is a pleasure to read; there are times of sweet sadness revealed here, but also of hilarious irony.  They survived by \\"employing humor, tinted car windows and thousands of dollars worth of therapy... A traditional family - loving father, supportive mother, doting child - that would probably be the right wing's worst nightmare.\\"  Maybe, but it is hard to imagine anyone reading this sensitive memoir and not having admiration for the growth of all its characters.xecutive.

It may be that they are dangerous outlaws who, since they know computers so well, must be put into prison for years away from any keyboard or mouse.  It may also be that they simply know people very well, and that stereotypes of hackers in the media (even in journalism) show nothing so much as our worry over the unprecedented new computer tools piped into our homes and offices.  This last is the view of Douglas Thomas, who, in _Hacker Culture_ (University of Minnesota Press), has written a history of how hackers came to be, and how they came to be seen as villainous outcasts.  It is a surprising look at hackers, but is more about how a society uses computers, and it takes in the entire short history of digital electronics.<br />One of the surprising parts of this history is just how far antipathy between hackers and Microsoft goes, and it starts right at the beginning with the first personal computer.  Bill Gates co-wrote a version of the BASIC programming language that could be run on the Altair, but Altair users had become used to sharing programs, not buying them.  Gates thought of his BASIC as a secret that could be licensed or purchased, and hobbyists that shared it (the earliest hackers) were simply thieves.  Ill feelings between Gates and hackers have continued for almost three decades now over similar issues.  The reputation of hackers, forged in the popular media, is one of this book's strengths.  _WarGames_, the 1983 release about the kid who nearly causes nuclear war by hacking into military supercomputers, gave hacker culture a national audience.  The 1995 _Hackers_ showed hackers as young Robin Hoods, but had a freakish number of technical errors and it tried to promote erroneous hacker language and clothing styles.  The film's website, therefore, became a focus for hacker attacks, with defacement of the photographs and replacement of ad-copy hype with such non-recommendations as \\"Hackers, the new action adventure movie from those idiots in Hollywood, takes you inside a world where there's no plot or creative thought, there's only boring rehashed ideas.\\"<br />The scariness of the depictions of hackers in the media has resulted in strange legal decisions.  The famous Kevin Mitnick was trumpeted as such an \\"evil genius\\" and \\"cyberterrorist\\" that he was denied a bail hearing and was kept in jail for over four years awaiting trial, with the government denying his legal team access to evidence to be presented against him.  (Some fellow hackers redesigned web sites as political pranks to call attention to his plight.)  This sort of basic misunderstanding about what hackers are and what they do is what _Hacker Culture_ seeks to correct.  Douglas Thomas, an academic who is able to use ideas from Plato, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein, kindly does not use this talent too often, but restricts his entertaining depiction of hacker history to the important battles the information age has spawned concerning basic issues of privacy, property, and secrecy.  He shows us that hackers have been at the edge of defining these issues, and in a remarkably well balanced account which refuses black and white labels, he shows that they are not always on the wrong side.refore, became a focus for hacker attacks, with defacement of the photographs and replacement of ad-copy hype with such non-recommendations as \\"Hackers, the new action adventure movie from those idiots in Hollywood, takes you inside a world where there's no plot or creative thought, there's only boring rehashed ideas.\\"<br />The scariness of the depictions of hackers in the media has resulted in strange legal decisions.

It is true, of course, that most people here claiming religion claim one form or other of Christianity, but it is also true that there is no national religion here and that plenty of the Founding Fathers were not Christians or were even anti-Christian.  Given our national history, it is not at all surprising that we should be a religious melting pot.  None of the organized religions had included Kristin Hahn when she was growing up.  Pushing thirty, tired of working in Hollywood, she determined that she would hit the road to see what religions in America had to offer.  The picaresque result, _In Search of Grace: A Religious Outsider's Journey Across America's Landscape of Faith_ (Morrow) came after three years of what was essentially a religious quest.  She was not shopping for a religion she could call her own.  She was looking to find what universal qualities sincerely religious people seek and display.  The broad answers are unsurprising, but the variations in detail of practice and belief in each particular sect are worth reading about.<br /><br />She did not, of course, shun Christianity, there being more chapters devoted to that belief than to others.  She did, however, look into some unusual aspects of different sects of that practice.  She had little luck penetrating Harmony, an Amish community, beyond what a usual tourist sees.  She participated in prayers with nuns and monks in a Benedictine abbey.  Most of us have been visited by Mormon missionaries, but Hahn went testifying with them. The closest she gets to disbelief is at a Unitarian Universalist church, where she is told that although that particular church is \\"Christian-leaning,\\" the last time Jesus Christ's name was spoken inside the church was when the janitor bumped his head on the basement rafter.  In her non-Christian endeavors, she took some peyote with Native Americans.  She kept the Sabbath with Reformed and Orthodox Jews.  She fasted with Muslims during Ramadan.  She used the bogus e-meters of the Church of Scientology.  She tortured herself with the rigors of Kundalini yoga, and of different forms of Hindu and Buddhist meditation.  She went to a Wiccan convention in a Las Vegas casino, of all places.<br />It's a wide-ranging survey.  Sometimes she is exhausted or perplexed, obviously a tourist within deeply mysterious lands, but she is able to convey the strangeness with clarity.  She has been gentle even with the strangest of beliefs, preserving a wide-eyed and seldom critical stance that makes for good understanding and reporting.  For each of the main beliefs she has described, she gives a useful capsule history of the faith and its main ideas before going into her own experience of it.  No, Hahn did not find a religion she could join.  During the time of this intelligent search, she did find a husband, and bore a child, and she wisely incorporates the universal lessons of gratitude, reverence, sanctification of daily events, belonging, and honoring life into her new family.  In examining these universals from the many vantages she has taken, she has simply drawn on the best that all religions, even the daffiest, have to offer.  It is a good, and particularly American, lesson, and it is an encouragement to ideals of American tolerance.Native Americans.  She kept the Sabbath with Reformed and Orthodox Jews.

One thinks that all those Guggenheims were pretty well off, but everything is relative, and there were rich Guggenheims and poor ones.  Benjamin Guggenheim in 1912 dressed in his best formal evening clothes, heroically helped women to climb into the lifeboats of the _Titanic_, and then drowned.  He left half a million dollars to his family, but it was the legacy of a poor Guggenheim, not a rich one.  His daughter Peggy managed to take her share, and independently of the other collectors in her family, made a highly-regarded collection of early twentieth century art.  It was a great accomplishment.  She also took plenty of lovers, many of them famous, which is somewhat less of an accomplishment.  She was a reprehensible mother, and pinched pennies in ways that would make those around her uncomfortable.  She was a contradictory bundle, and now a fun, big, gossipy biography, _Art Lover: A Biography of Peggy Guggenheim_ (HarperCollins) by Anton Gill, has put bright light on all the facets.  It isn't always an uplifting story, but it sparkles.<br />Peggy was fourteen when her father drowned; Gill argues that she was always looking for a father figure after that.  Her sexual enthusiasms may have been driven also by fretting over her looks; she was a good-looking woman with a fine physique, but she had a nose which one unkind friend (and she had many of those) said looked like an eggplant.  She had two marriages, both to artists, the second one to the famous surrealist Max Ernst, but both were painful.  She took hundreds of lovers, most of whom meant little but a night of fun.  Someone asked her later in her life, \\"How many husbands have you had, Mrs. Guggenheim?\\" and the typical, sharp, self-deprecating and self-aggrandizing answer came: \\"D'you mean my own, or other people's?\\"  She was far luckier in her pursuit of art (rather than of artists).  As years went on, she referred to her collection as \\"my children\\" and showed more interest in caring for it than she did for the flesh-and-blood version.  She was able to buy art from artists who are now household names before they became so, and before art prices skyrocketed.  Her sponsorship of Jackson Pollock is a lasting imprint on American art.  Although her famous collection of surrealist and cubist works is now widely appreciated, not everyone felt it was  a success.  When she welcomed the critic Bernard Berenson to it in 1948, she gushed, \\"Mr. Berenson, you were the first person to teach me about painting,\\" to which Berenson replied, \\"My dear, what a tragedy that I wasn't the last.\\"<br />The Tate Gallery in London had enough enthusiasm earnestly to try to acquire her collection (it did do restoration work), but because of her legal and personal problems, the deal never went through.  Tellingly, she could not finally compete with the resources of her uncle Solomon's foundation and museum.  She had made her Palazzo Leoni one of the high points to visit in Venice (where it contrasted with the ancient city to good effect), and upon her death, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation took it over as a public museum.  Peggy died in 1979, and her cremated remains were interred near her collection, and also near her beloved dogs' resting place, but far away from any friends or relatives.  She had done well with dogs and art, and not much more.  It was an eccentric and unique life, often successful, but encompassing a good deal of lost opportunities and sadness.  This generous but by no means fawning biography is a pleasure to read because it is full of fascinating detail, scandalous stories, and coruscating bon mots.my children\\" and showed more interest in caring for it than she did for the flesh-and-blood version.

She is a spectacular sculpture, long regarded as the pinnacle of Minoan art from the sixteenth century BCE. She is of delicately carved ivory decorated with gold, a sensuous figure in a wide skirt of multiple tiers, a narrow, belt-encircled waist, and a bodice cut so low that her ample breasts are visible. She holds snakes in her outstretched arms. She pouts. She is one of the most famous pieces of ancient art in the world, a superb example of Cretan Bronze Age sculpture.<br />Except she isn't. Kenneth Lapatin, President of the Boston Society of the Archeological Institute of America, has been studying her for a decade, and casting doubts on her authenticity. Now he has published a book-length explanation, _Mysteries of the Snake Goddess: Art, Desire, and the Forging of History_ (Houghton Mifflin Company) of how the experts of art and archeology have been fooled, and with the book's exhaustive notes and appendices, this account is devastating. It also tells plenty about how archeology is done, what sort of characters do it, how we view the ancient past, and how wishful thinking, perhaps even more than greed, has perpetrated the forgery. The details of the origin of the statue are still unclear, and probably always will be. But Lapatin has dug into as much as can be known of its shadowy past, and has provided an expert's details. He can write, for instance, \\"Eyes with drilled pupils _and_ canthi have no parallel in Aegean sculpture and do not appear in ancient statuary before the second century A.D.\\" He gives an excellent section on why science can provide only limited evidence in this case (although none of it points to the statue's authenticity).<br />Lapatin does more than just debunk, for in his fascinating and original book, he shows how the Goddess is still important. She isn't the find Sir John Evans, the excavator of Knossos, and others thought she was. However, \\"She has provided a canvas on which archeologists and curators, looters and smugglers, dealers and forgers, art patrons and museum-goers, feminists and spiritualists, have painted their preconceptions, desires, and preoccupations for an idealized past.\\" We may have to admit we know less about Minoan culture, but we can always learn more about human nature.excavator of Knossos, and others thought she was.

It would not be surprising if this polymath has other manuscripts awaiting publication, but _Madness: A Brief History_ (Oxford University Press) was his last production before his death.  It is a remarkable work especially for its brevity, taking in prehistoric concepts of madness and ranging all the way into current psychiatric controversies in less than 250 clear, well-researched pages.  There have been fashions of treatments for the mentally ill, and just a bit of scientific justification for them most recently, but one of the points of his treatise is to show that we aren't any closer to true definitions of madness than Polonius was: to \\"define true madness,/ What is't but to be nothing else but mad?\\"  His own lack of definition enables this brief overview to take in a great deal of territory.<br />Porter examines the imposition of madness by the gods in Homer.  By the time of Hippocrates (around 400 BCE) madness was a medical, not moral or magical, matter.  But supernatural explanations for insanity were advanced again, along with the angels and demons sanctioned by the Christian church.  Around the Renaissance, the concept arose that madness was a special sort of inspiration.  (There remains folk wisdom that geniuses are not at all far removed from the insane.)  Families had originally had the responsibility for lunatic progeny, but the surplus wealth of urban areas encouraged families to buy such services.  At the beginning of the nineteenth century in England, confined lunatics were largely in private asylums under what was literally called \\"the trade in lunacy.\\"  Optimism that \\"moral treatment\\" might cure such cases was disappointed; in the last of the nineteenth century, a pessimism took over, as few were cured and the asylums became clogged with inmates whose needs were severe.  Security and sedation were promoted as the numbers grew.  Armed with new classifications of different styles of madness, doctors continued to be frustrated by an inability to change much; one German asylum doctor said, \\"We know a lot and can do little.\\"<br />With the revolution in pharmaceuticals in the twentieth century, this changed.  Patients were able to leave the asylums, and the medicines promised improvement without long stays in the hospital, long bouts of psychoanalysis, or irreversible psychosurgery, as well as promoting psychiatrists as \\"real doctors.\\"  This is a remarkable book, which is able to take a broad historical view; there are far larger tomes on this subject, and indeed on subjects which here necessarily get only a paragraph or so, but the sweep of the coverage is impressive.  Porter ends his summary with unnecessary pessimism.  It is true that the last century had its share of abuse of the mentally ill (one does not even have to cite the extremes of Nazi and Soviet persecution), and it is also true that there are more psychiatric diagnoses than ever, and more patients classified as fitting them.  Even though the history of the rise of psychiatry and the improvements it can bestow may have had more controversy or backsliding than other branches of medicine, it is a simple truth that those suffering from madness now are better off than they were one or three or twenty centuries ago.were severe.

Even though the history of the rise of psychiatry and the improvements it can bestow may have had more controversy or backsliding than other branches of medicine, it is a simple truth that those suffering from madness now are better off than they were one or three or twenty centuries ago.	2002-04-30

It has been surprising over the past decade or so to find Thomas Jefferson's star falling.  Certainly, he is on Mount Rushmore, and has a lovely memorial in Washington, and his words ringing of independence and freedom will be read forever.  But a recent Jefferson biography was called _American Sphinx_, and we still don't know what to make of his holding slaves and fathering children by Sally Hemings.  Now comes _What Kind of Nation: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United States_ (Simon &amp; Schuster) by James F. Simon.  The book documents the great differences between the two men, their philosophies of government, and the particular court fights that defined the new republic, but it also makes clear that at almost every turn, Marshall snookered or thwarted Jefferson so that the new republic was guided on a course far from the Jeffersonian ideal.<br />The two founders had plenty in common; they were distant cousins, both Virginia slaveholders, who took office in 1801, Jefferson as third President, and Marshall as fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  But they loathed each other.  In summary, Jefferson felt that the American Revolution had freed his country from power directed from foreign lands.  He detested King George III, of course, but he had a high distrust of any strong central power.  It was his idea that the strong unit of government was the state, and that the states had been united under the Constitution only into a loose confederacy.  Marshall felt that the Constitution had made an essential change in the balance of powers, with a strong federal government able to make laws that would apply to all Americans, and also able to compel states to keep within federal bounds.  What Simon has done is to show the specific legal battles that pitted one against the other and made Marshall's view victorious.  He is a fine guide to landmark decisions in _Marbury vs. Madison_, the impeachment trial of Judge Samuel Chase, and the treason trial of Aaron Burr, all of which have effected our current government and even recent headlines.<br />Repeatedly, Marshall's victories harassed and worried Jefferson, who wrote that \\"The judiciary of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working under ground to undermine the foundations of our confederated fabric.\\"  In a way this was true.  Marshall's decisions indeed made the federal government, not a confederation, supreme in ways that Jefferson loathed, ways which would not be settled permanently until the Civil War.  Just as important, his decisions made the Supreme Court an essential third part of the federal government, a role we take for granted today.  Simon is a lawyer, and takes pains to show the legal niceties of the various decisions by which Marshall bested Jefferson.  The ground he covers here is familiar, but in setting up the decisions as battles between the two founding giants, he has brought innovative light on a particularly interesting, not to mention combative and messy, way that our nation was founded.	2002-04-28

Such athletes are expensive, but we have not had the spectacle of their being paid for inseminating other athletes.  _Stud: Adventures in Breeding_ (Bloomsbury) by Kevin Conley centers on this spectacle, though of course his subject is horses, not humans.  There is plenty of excitement on the racetrack, and classic races like the Kentucky Derby get much media play, but the purses of such races are relatively small compared to what goes on in the breeding sheds, and money, of course, is what this game is all about.  Horses that aren't so good at the track may be great at siring horses that are good at the track.  Conley spends a good deal of time describing the complicated, and surprisingly unnatural, ways thoroughbred mares get pregnant.  Artificial insemination is not allowed for thoroughbreds, but coitus is a strange affair involving a \\"teaser\\" stallion to get the mare excited and receptive before the stud comes in, and five human handlers to make it all go as planned.  The costs are so great, and the horses are so valuable, that leaving it all to nature is unthinkable.<br />Conley writes, \\"In the middle of all the rearing and bellowing and heaving of loins, there's one quality that's easy to miss when you visit a breeding shed: how normal it all is to the people who work there.\\"  He even shows them chatting about the politics of the local school board in the middle of the act.  But Conley doesn't do horses for a living.  He is a writer and editor at _The New Yorker_, and had no prior doings in the sport of kings.  He is thus easily able to be surprised, and in fine, lively prose, convey surprise.  He is especially adept at comparisons; about a spinal operation on a horse, he says it \\"requires an unusual mixture of skills: the nitpicky dexterity of a bomb defuser and a carpenter's ease with power tools.\\"  He tells about standardbreds as well, and the small farms which try to have a go in this big business.  He gives a compact history of racing.<br />This is a brightly written look into a world foreign to most of us.  Although it roams into plenty about specific farms, history, and curious personalities, it all centers around money and the particular coital act that makes it all keep flowing.  Such a theme powers a surprisingly riveting book, but perhaps it is not so surprising.  After all, as Conley knows, the thoroughbred stud's life involves enormous amounts of cash, copious sex without any responsibility, and not much else besides eating and sleeping.  It isn't far from standard male fantasy.tells about standardbreds as well, and the small farms which try to have a go in this big business.

Books are usually printed on a fairly high grade of paper (compared to, say, that used in newspapers), paper which everyone knows comes from cutting down pretty and naturally useful trees.  The paper is printed with inks that have heavy metals and other chemicals in them.  You can recycle a book, but those chemicals get to be part of the mess, and are expensive to remove.  Anyway, you don't really recycle it, you _down_cycle it (the authors' term), because the paper in it can only be bleached and chemically treated to turn it into a lower grade of paper, such as for newspapers.  And newspapers can be turned into toilet paper, in further downcycling.  _Cradle to Cradle_ is about breaking out of such \\"cycles\\" and into real cycles.  It has smooth, bright white pages that are heavy, like the paper in the best books.  They are not, however, paper in the usual sense, although you probably wouldn't notice the difference unless your attention was called to it. They are made of plastic resins and inorganic fillers.  Although the pages are designed to last as long as any paper book, these pages can be recycled by conventional means to make more paper of equal quality.  They might even be _up_cycled into resins of greater complexity and utility.  The ink on them can be easily removed by a safe solvent bath, or washing with extremely hot water, and does not contain dangerous chemicals.<br />The authors, one an architect and one a chemist, created McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry in 1995, to consult with companies about designing sustaining products and factories.  They have the ear of such companies as Ford and Nike, and their book is a primer on how they would like to see manufacturing work in the future to take part in natural cycles having little effect on the overall ecology of the earth.  It is a rather thrilling little manifesto, by two obviously bright guys who don't let their optimism get in the way of bringing in real results.  The idea is for products and processes not to be \\"less bad,\\" but like ants or trees, to be positively good for the environment.  \\"Waste is food\\" is the principle.  Making products that can be composted, or can be used again without degrading them or the environment can be done, and it is no dream.  Much of the book shows how the authors, as consultants, have put such principles into action.<br />It can be done.  The words of the authors, clearly concerned about the future of the planet, are enthusiastic and convincing, and given the examples in this surprising book, it is clear that we will be seeing more design of products and processes that are incorporated into natural cycles.

He would see the annual reenactment of the trial, and tell about his encounters with the locals. It would make a funny account of a Darwin descendant, an urbane Englishman, and an atheist, brushing up against rubes and hillbillies (\\"I want to find out if they still believe the world was made in six days, and is only 6,000 years old. It seems incredible that they might, but word has it that they do.\\"). He left his high-pressure screenwriting environment in New York, and traveled by bus to Dayton to make an initial visit to the town, scoping it out before he returned to see the play itself. \\"That the town would re-enact this humiliation each year - presumably to pull down some cash - strikes me as hilarious, and I can't wait to see it.\\" The urbane Englishman, experienced world traveler, and would-be reporter shows up for the play, only to find that he has inexcusably come a week late. He still has a book to write; he makes plain that although he makes terrific money as a screenwriter, he also spends terrific money, and there is potential for financial disaster if he cannot get his book out. Like plenty of resourceful writers before him, Chapman has used the accident of his disastrous timing to bring forth a fine volume of memoirs and attempts to wrestle with philosophical issues, which are nicely intercalated with the other two parts, a history of the Scopes trial and the account of the author's visit to Dayton. His book is a triumph snatched from disaster; the account of his upbringing, sexual awakening, and love for his difficult, acerbic, drunken mother is rich in sadness and laughter, and his use of the Scopes framework turns out to be fitting.<br />He is often the bemused anthropologist among the puzzling natives. \\"As a neurotic city-dweller from the North, I feared the overt violence of the redneck with a banjo in one hand and a pistol in the other.\\" He drives \\"along a highway littered with yet more warnings of Christ's imminent return (it really is astonishing how obsessed they are by this).\\" But he learns a lesson: \\"Compounding the problem of maintaining a snide, superior tone, everyone's been so damned _nice_ to me. For seventy-five years people have been coming down here to mock, from Mencken to me, and all day long I've been running around asking questions and everyone's been 'just as nice as all get out,' which means as open and friendly as you could wish.\\" His encounters with fundamentalists, including \\"creation scientists,\\" are telling. Because of them, Chapman's atheism is cut back just a notch to agnosticism, the same agnosticism that was all the evidence would allow to his forebear Darwin. He cannot hold \\"any conviction in a matter so clearly unprovable either way,\\" though he has new sympathy and understanding of those with faith. The change in view within a smart and funny narrator makes this book a readable, amusing, and pointed travelogue to strange territories, religious, geographic, and personal.ed the overt violence of the redneck with a banjo in one hand and a pistol in the other.\\" He drives \\"along a highway littered with yet more warnings of Christ's imminent return (it really is astonishing how obsessed they are by this).\\" But he learns a lesson: \\"Compounding the problem of maintaining a snide, superior tone, everyone's been so damned _nice_ to me.

In his twenties, he was still living with his parents and had only fantasies about women, not dates.  He had fantasies about making millions in investments, too, and took as heroes Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.  He had a truly encyclopedic knowledge of financial markets, and yet he relied on casting astrological charts to make his millions.  And it is certainly true that he made his millions, and lived a geeky nerd's version of a millionaire's life.  But Frankel was a genius in insurance fraud, and his huge but ephemeral fortune was built on a pyramid scheme of robbing one insurance fund to pay into another.  Ellen Joan Pollock covered Frankel's scam for The Wall Street Journal, and has put together a page-turner, full of socialites, celebrity priests, custom limousines and aircraft, sadomasochistic sex, and of course the boom and bust that was Frankel's career.  The Pretender: How Martin Frankel Fooled the Financial World and Led the Feds on One of the Most Publicized Manhunts in History (Wall Street Journal Books) is not an uplifting tale, but it is exciting, and lots of it is over-the-top unbelievable, except that much of the unbelievable parts come from solid, stolid, financial reportage.<br />For starters, Frankel would never make it as a character in a novel; he and his even temporary success are just too unlikely.  He was, indeed, vastly knowledgeable about the financial world he moved into.  He was good at picking successful trades.  But besides being generally amoral, his great fault as a trader was an almost comic one: he could not trade.  Once he had accounts and investments to make, he froze.  But he must have talked a good game to get financiers interested in him, and women interested in his sadomasochistic hobbies.  Instead of making money on trades, he was essentially making it by looking constantly for new investors so that he could pay off the most recent ones and could continue to produce bogus quarterly reports which showed how many millions he was pulling in.  He used the services of a celebrity priest to try to tap the vast resources of the Catholic Church in what would have been for him a huge money laundering scheme.  Instead, of course, the house of cards eventually fell down, taking Frankel with it, along with real con men and other conned men.<br />Pollack's story is of one spectacular financial crime of the nineties.  There is no pedantry here about how such crimes are to be avoided, but it is frankly amazing that regulators and usually savvy business investors allowed themselves enough laziness or greediness to be convinced by a very unappealing character.  It was a time of the dot.com phenomenon, and \\"the millionaire next door.\\"  There never has been a time when get-rich-quick schemes weren't there, ready to take money from the credulous.  Frankel's story, however, with remarkable details, cameos from famous politicians and businessmen, and silly sexual exploits, represents a unique, diverting, and worrisome contemporary variation on the theme.hich showed how many millions he was pulling in.

He was the seventh child, preceded by six other sons, of a cobbler, born in 1680 in Nether Largo in Scotland.  At age fifteen, he was accused of Undecent Beaiviar in ye Church, the strict Scottish Presbyterian version, but he did not appear to meet the charge, for he went off to sea.  And the sea was the making of him, for without his adventures, we probably would not have had Daniel Defoes _Robinson Crusoe_.  The fictional Crusoe, it is true, is not very much like Selkirk, as Crusoe was pious, kind, contemplative, and law-abiding, and perhaps Selkirks life and marooning on a strange island lack moral instruction.  They are, however, still fascinating, and in _Selkirks Island: The True and Strange Adventures of the Real Robinson Crusoe_ (Harcourt) Diana Souhami has told them as fully as is possible, drawing upon journals, ships records, fictionalizations, and her own visit to Selkirks abode.  She has also given an account of his island which has loomed large in Selkirks life, in literature, and lessons of ecology and human encroachment.<br />Selkirk signed on with a privateering expedition.  England was at war with Spain, whose galleons were bringing gold and other goods from the New World to finance the war.  The English government sanctioned the patriotic theft of such targets in a system of something like legal piracy.  Men sailed in such ventures to get a share of whatever booty their ships could take, risking death by violence or disease.  When his ship went into the tiny island of Juan Fernandez, 300 miles west of Chile in 1704 for refitting the vessel and gathering of stores, Selkirk refused to board again, because he felt it was so eaten-through that it would sink (he was right).  He was left there, and was in isolation for over four years.  He made a sandalwood hut, a wooden bed, hooks to snare fishes, and cutlery out of goat horns.  His realm was invaded by Spaniards one time, but although they destroyed his goods, he evaded capture.  When English privateers came in 1709, they were astonished to find the castaway.  He had so much forgot his Language for want of Use, wrote one, that we could scarce understand him, for he seemd to speak his words by halves.<br />Souhami argues that the time on his island was the best time of Selkirks life.  He might not have seen it that way (he himself left no first person accounts), but before he left home for the sea he behaved badly, and he did so on his return as well, addicted to drink, lying, and violence.  Different authors picked up his story, and Defoe was not the only one to make this misfit into a Christian paragon.  He did so, however, not so much with the aim of uplifting his readers, but to get some money to pay for his daughters wedding.  Human folly continues to play a role in the islands fortunes.  It now belongs to Chile.  Enterprising islanders are campaigning to change its name to Isla Robinson Crusoe.  You can buy Robinson Crusoe tee shirts there.  This satisfying account shows that the island was a better place when only Selkirk was its lord, and Selkirk was a better human when he was confined to it.destroyed his goods, he evaded capture.

The story of the complicated, centuries-long battle against the disease that kills about a million people a year in Africa alone is well told in _The Fever Trail: In Search of the Cure for Malaria_ by Mark Honigsbaum.  It is a story of astonishing human hardship in the effort (not always inspired by riches) to get understanding and control of the disease, but it is sadly clear by the end of the tale that despite the optimism of individual researchers, the tiny parasites borne by mosquitoes all over the world are simply too complicated for us to control any time soon.<br />Much of the effort to cure malaria was sparked as Europeans spread over the world and found their lives in jeopardy from it.  The Jesuits learned (perhaps from the Indians) about the bark from the cinchona tree, and the church recommended its use.  Physicians in northern Europe, however, were deeply suspicious of such a papist and Jesuitical drug; Cromwell, according to legend, refused the \\"Popish remedy,\\" and died. Even-tually the efficacy of the drug triumphed over religious bigotry.  Much of The Fever Trail has to do with the nineteenth century race to steal specimens and get them to plantations owned by Europeans.  In particu-lar, the efforts of three Englishmen, who in independent efforts, suffered unbelievable deprivations on the trail which are well described here.  Strangely, the British efforts amounted to little.  The Dutch bought seeds for £20 from one of the explorers, and they happened to be the very best specimens.  They went to Java, grown in scientifically designed plantations, and the Dutch cornered the market on quinine.<br />If quinine were a real cure, malaria might now be as dead as smallpox.  However, the parasite that causes the disease has a complicated life cycle within mosquitoes and humans, and is not so easily banished.  It has become resistant to quinine and the other antimalarial drugs derived from quinine.  The attempt by the World Health Organization to use DDT to blitz the mosquito forever from the Earth was a failure that showed just how resourceful evolution could be in making mosquitoes resistant as well.  What is needed is a foolproof vaccine, but although we have vaccines against various viral illnesses, no one has been able to invent one that works against a parasite.  The attempts to develop a vaccine, the complicated finances of making drugs that can be used in impoverished countries, and the advantages of the mosquito net (whose inventor, David Livingstone said, deserved a statue in Westminster Abbey) are all covered in a fascinating book that reads like dispatches from a long, losing war.  With the prospect of global warming extending the reach of the mosquitoes, it may be that the worst of the war is yet to come.the World Health Organization to use DDT to blitz the mosquito forever from the Earth was a failure that showed just how resourceful evolution could be in making mosquitoes resistant as well.

Its all very mysterious, but if you read _Consider the Eel_ (University of North Carolina Press) by Richard Schweid, you will quickly realize that almost everything connected to eels is mysterious indeed.  It isnt just that humans deal with eels in peculiar ways; the fish itself is full of paradoxes and unsolved questions.<br />Schweids topic is the Atlantic eels of two species, the European and the American.  These eels reproduce in the open sea, and early development of the young takes place there, but they drift to different fresh water sources to feed and grow to adult sizes, over a period of up to twenty years.  (This is opposite to the life cycle of the salmon.)  Then they stop eating forever and head to sea, changing their eyes to adapt to ocean dark, and changing body chemistry to put up with salt water and the change of water pressure.  It was only in 1924 that a Danish researcher found eel larvae in the Sargasso sea, the huge area of the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Azores.  All the Atlantic eels go there to mate, and then they die, but no adults have ever been seen swimming there; the only two eels found there had been eaten by other fish.  We can only guess at what they are up to deep below the surface.  The larvae look like little oval leaves.  Depending on currents, the larvae float for thousands of miles and for years until they reach estuaries and mouths of rivers.  Once they find a river with a muddy bottom and food sources, they take control of their lives.  They can even cross land to get to a lake or pond over a mile away.  Farming eels is quite possible, and can be lucrative, but must be done under an extraordinary disadvantage which no other farm animal presents.  Eels cannot be bred in captivity.  No one has been able to make them forgo their trip to the Sargasso for reproduction.<br />American eel fishermen and dealers, many of whom Schweid talked to in preparation of this book, have a peculiar business of trading in a product that no one they know likes.  Many of them have been in business for decades, although catches are declining and sales which have to be to Europe or Japan are profitable or not based on exchange rates.  Many are simply revolted by the idea of eating their product.  Schweid offers to fry some for supper, and a woman who has caught eels for decades replies, I would never eat one.  Looks too much like a snake.  Another fisherman, when Schweid brought up the long migration of the eels said, I know what all the scientists say about what they do, and the trip they make.  It may be right, but it aint reasonable.  Whether the facts are reasonable are not, this readable account of a very strange fish and the strange people who make their living from it is full of facts that are entertaining and astounding.even cross land to get to a lake or pond over a mile away.

Erasmus is more famous for _Praise of Folly_ (1511) which is still funny and represents a pinnacle of sly wit and subversive erudition.  His compilation of adages, however, was his most popular work in his own time.  You can still find the full edition all of them, in six volumes, but now there is a one volume selection, _The Adages of Erasmus_ (University of Toronto Press), selected by William Barker.  As an introduction to renaissance thinking and to an astonishingly well-read and retentive mind, this edition of the _Adages_ is excellent, but it is also a reminder to us moderns of how deeply the roots of learning go back into the past.<br /><br />The _Adages_ became influential just as adages themselves are to our way of thinking.  Proof that this particular collection continues to influence us comes most pointedly from a couple of mistakes that Erasmus made.  In his discussion of \\"He calls figs figs, a spade a spade,\\" Erasmus took the Greek \\"skaptein\\" meaning \\"to dig\\" as the source of \\"scapha;\\" he thought it was a spade, but it actually is a small dugout boat, or skiff.  The meaning of the<br />proverb is unchanged; Erasmus explains, \\"It suits a man who speaks the truth in a simple and countrified style, who tells of things as they are, and does not wrap them up in ornamental verbiage.\\" But ever since Erasmus, no one has said \\"to call a skiff a skiff.\\" Time and again, this collection points out very familiar ideas which were first voiced thousands of years ago; Erasmus discusses \\"To leave no stone unturned,\\" \\"Know thyself,\\" \\"The cart before the horse,\\" and many more which, except for translation, are entirely the same as they were for the ancients.  To read the _Adages_ is to find comfort in this sort of scholarly stability.  In addition, there are a good many expressions here, some crude, which didn't make it to modern times, but perhaps should have.  Erasmus, admitting \\"the line is too obscene to give much pleasure to the translator,\\" reflects on \\"In canis podicem inspicere,\\" from Aristophanes: \\"I told him to go and look into a dog's anus.\\"<br /><br />Many of the adages here show a citation and a very brief explanation, but those who wish weightier matter will enjoy reading the digressions.  Sometimes Erasmus apologizes for going far from his source proverb, but by such means he gives us his ideas on the proper upbringing of princes, his own work in scholarly explication, or the futility of war.  It is clear that he delights in pointing out to his contemporaries the continuation of learning from the ancients and the need to adopt the lessons to his own times.  This large and attractive summary of his thought in _Adages_ is just right for those who wish to take the lessons into our own.y expressions here, some crude, which didn't make it to modern times, but perhaps should have.

The story is quite literally incredible.  Dash's previous book, the excellent _Tulipomania_, wittily described the improbable craze of speculating on tulip bulbs in Holland in the seventeenth century, but the tulip madness is relatively well known.  Stories of the fate of the ship _Batavia_ in 1629 in the service of the Dutch East India Company, however, were wildly popular at the time, but have gradually been forgotten.  The story was spectacular enough that there were memoirs, eyewitness accounts, pamphlets, books, and court testimony, all of which Dash has dug through with notable thoroughness.  The bizarre tale of the _Batavia_ reads like a thriller.<br />The main character in the tale is Jeronimus Cornelisz, who had newly joined the Dutch East India Company to make his fortune.  He was probably brought up as a member of the Anabaptists, a small protestant sect with a history of fanaticism and resistance to worldly governments, based largely on the belief that the Second Coming of Christ was just around the corner.  He had also joined a social organization which had dangerous philosophies, and he came to antinomianism, the creed that one can exist in a state of perfection and thereby avoid following any moral law.  \\"All I do, God gave the same into my heart,\\" he explained.  He planned a mutiny to take over the ship and become a pirate, but about a month before arriving at the destination Java, it crashed into a coral reef off Australia's western coast.  Cornelisz, the highest ranking official left on the islands, took charge with real self assurance, eloquence, and charisma, and hell descended.  The sailors seemed to have found his talk and his leadership irresistible, and he frequently spoke of the wealth that could be theirs if they were to take over any rescue ship.  He began to thin the population by the simple means of murder.  He and his loyal henchmen began killing those whom they distrusted, and then those who were unneeded.  After that, although there was sufficient drinking water from rainfall and sufficient food from seals and birds, the killing continued because it was entertaining for those in power to continue it.<br />The scenes of murder and mayhem are unpleasant, but not much more so than those of the legal interrogations under torture and the executions which followed the affair.  There are few pure heroes described here, and the book shows that while the Company got richer and richer, those on the sea who made it happen had brutal lives and little recompense.  That may strike a chord for our own times, as may the picture of a man of God bringing unimaginable destruction for the sake of his own power.  Dash has, however, wisely avoided any parallels to the present, and any didacticism.  He has told an amazing tale, with extraordinary detail for events of so many years ago, and has brought it up to date with archeological and forensic research.  This is as gripping a page-turner as a factual account has any right to be.means of murder.  He and his loyal henchmen began killing those whom they distrusted, and then those who were unneeded.

It will be even more fun for the huge majority of readers to realize how little fun they would have doing the same things.  The minority who fantasize about being chased by a polar bear, sledding in midnight daylight, or camping at 58 degrees below zero Fahrenheit will find lots of useful information in Kobalenko's book, _The Horizontal Everest: Extreme Journeys on Ellesmere Island_ (Soho Press).  The rest of us may shake our heads in wonder, and be glad that reading the book is as close as we need get to one of the harshest environments on Earth.  \\"Where is Ellesmere Island?  Think of the little metal disk that sits on top of a globe: Ellesmere is under that.\\"  It is a Canadian island, just 450 miles from the North Pole.<br />He doesn't live there all the time (he lives in Canada), because he does have to make a living, which he does mostly by taking photographs and writing about his travels on his island and other inhospitable spots.  For the past fifteen years, he has roamed the island in various expeditions, often solo.  He has traveled, by foot, thousands of miles across and around the island, more than anyone alive.  He doesn't use dogs.  He has no radio.  He hikes, pulling a sled full of the stuff he predicts he will need.  He writes about preparing beforehand 54 peanut butter and jam sandwiches (one per day) because \\"long ago, I had discovered that making a sandwich on the arctic trail meant hacking for fifteen minutes at toffee-hard peanut butter with a Swiss Army knife and laying the shrapnel between crumbly pieces of frozen bread.\\"  Coated with butter, each thousand-calorie sandwich was like \\"vegetarian seal blubber,\\" full of energy required for a freezing pack animal.<br />Much of this book tells the story of other travelers in the area.  Kobalenko recreates some of the expeditions from the past, visiting the campsites from the last two centuries which the arctic cold has preserved.  He is delighted whenever he finds cairns, the traditional rock piles set up as commemorative markers.  Sometimes there is a note in a bottle, and he is the first to poke around and bring it back home.  He might turn up rusted cans, matches, buttons, and shell casings, as he did at Starvation Camp, where most of the members of Adolphus Greely's expedition died in 1884.  He feels guilty making his simple meals there.  He sees for himself Crocker Land which was sighted by Perry in 1906.  Perry knew that explorers make names for themselves by finding new territories, and also that they finance their expeditions by flattering those who back them.  Perry named Crocker Land after a backer of his expedition.  A later one sent to find it demonstrated that Perry had only seen a mirage.  Combining history, natural science, and adventure, Kobalenko's surprising observations, written in smooth, calm, sensible prose, are entertaining throughout.ghted whenever he finds cairns, the traditional rock piles set up as commemorative markers.

You have to suspect, though, that if Peter J. Bentley is claiming a revolution, then something wonderful is happening; he is a scientist in the very field of computers, not a reporter, and so his book _Digital Biology: How Nature is Transforming Our Technology and Our Lives_ (Simon &amp; Schuster) is that excellent form of popular science writing, enthusiastic witnessing from an expert in the field.  It is obvious that he loves his work, and that it has far-ranging implications, but it is even better that he can communicate the enthusiasm and let the reader share in it.<br />Digital biology represents a remarkable two way street.  Natural processes such as evolution or ant colony behavior can be modeled within a computer to build stronger problem-solving tools.  In turn, computer programs can illuminate aspects of behavior of systems large and small in nature, showing just how physics, genes, and evolution have accomplished the complexities we see around us.  The best part of Bentley's book is that he has plenty of examples of how these ideas are already at work.  Consider what seems to be an inescapable metaphor for brains and for computers, the ant colony.  Ants are themselves, like all other insects, tiny robots able to take in small degrees of data and perform small feats of manipulation.  One ant is a very limited creature indeed.  (Are you getting the analogy?  One neuron, too, is practically useless as is one flip-flop gate.)  But a mass of ants in a colony starts to show real intelligence.  Put a little food out a distance from the colony, and by laying pheromone trails, and following the stronger trails, the huge numbers of ants will in effect calculate the shortest, most efficient way of getting back and forth to it.  Making digitally simulated \\"ants\\" and electronic \\"pheromone trails\\" is already solving difficult problems; \\"Ant Colony Optimization\\" is already a respected field in computer science.  It has been used to solve the otherwise almost intractable classic Traveling Salesman Problem: A salesman has to get to many different cities on his rounds; what is the most efficient route?  Solving this problem took too long for even the fastest of ordinary computers, but letting the digital ants go at it works.  It isn't just a matter of solving puzzles, either; such optimization programs are already being applied to communication network routing and electronic circuit design.<br />In some ways this book is a primer on evolution of different types, and while some fundamentalists continue to make religious objections to evolution in nature, it is obvious from the examples Bentley gives that evolution really does happen in many ways separate from our world of DNA creatures.  Bentley draws from examples in many disciplines, and is interested in finding commonalities between them.  He demonstrates that from DNA to ants to brains to growth to programming code to evolution to universes, complexity is generated by interactions of similar things, controlled by feedback, and subject to change from the outside.  This pattern is more important than the stuff the system is made of.  This has not quite the clear universal ring of a Newtonian law, perhaps, but it is certainly an illustrative pattern which is played at all sorts of levels.  To Bentley, the pattern is so much more important that the stuff which shows it that he sees no basic difference between biological life and life within a computer.  His quickly paced, entertaining book is a good introduction to one of the new ways computers are changing how we look at everything.ts\\" and electronic \\"pheromone trails\\" is already solving difficult problems; \\"Ant Colony Optimization\\" is already a respected field in computer science.

He insisted he was a loyal American.  He went on, as if in a Horatio Alger story, to become a successful Philadelphia businessman, but he was nonetheless encouraged, because of his heroic service in the war, to apply for the pension that he deserved from the country he had helped make.  He replied that he did not want money from his country.  He wanted only one thing from America, and if any American deserved it, he surely did.  What James Forten wanted was to become an American citizen, and he never in his long life got his wish.  The simple reason was that he was black.  Forten has largely been forgotten, which is too bad, since as a war hero, businessman, and abolitionist, he played commendable roles which one doesn't have to be of any particular race to admire.  He is now rescued from obscurity by a large, detailed, and well-researched biography, _A Gentleman of Color: The Life of James Forten_ (Oxford University Press) by Julie Winch.  Winch has dug deep inside such ephemera as the social history of Philadelphia, the economic forces of the time, and even the trade of sailmaking by which Forten made his living, to give the first complete picture of one of the first outstanding black Americans.<br />After his service in the war, Forten was apprenticed by the white, slave-owning sailmaker who had employed his father.  He did so well that upon retirement, the owner left him the business.  He branched out into real estate and money-lending. As a successful businessman, he became a civic leader, helping to administer his church and assisting in creating schools for black youth.  He administered a mixed-race workforce, with some black managers supervising white workers.  He could not vote, but he had no compunction about telling his workers how they were to vote and making sure they did so.  He knew that he had an easier life in Philadelphia than he would in other parts of the nation, but he endured the contempt of many white people, a contempt that cycled inversely with prosperity; when times got tough, it was easy to blame blacks for taking jobs.  Such blame could easily take the form of violence against the person or the property of blacks.  There was a kidnapping ring that could spirit black children to Delaware and ship them into slavery in the south.  Forten served in the American Anti-Slavery Society and lent his considerable finances and managerial skill to various abolitionist causes.  He lent Garrison the money by which the famous abolitionist paper _The Liberator_ was begun.  He wrote for the paper.  He campaigned against the use of alcohol.  He had a lifetime fight against blacks and whites who were pushing to move black people back to Africa, for he wanted America to be a nation without regard to color.  He was not without controversy, even among blacks, but when he died in 1842, thousands of black and white mourners turned out to the funeral of an American original.  Winch's biography, hefty and academic but not ponderous, brings that original back to us in his proper place in history.adelphia than he would in other parts of the nation, but he endured the contempt of many white people, a contempt that cycled inversely with prosperity; when times got tough, it was easy to blame blacks for taking jobs.

Diamonds of more than two carats have been found, for example, in Ohio and Alabama, and finding them is often just child's play.  Kids are the ones who pick these gems up, because kids are close to the ground and always looking for treasures.  Finding a reliable supply of diamonds is much more difficult; the ones found on the ground are often chance deposits that were dropped when a glacier melted, but the glacier must have carried them from somewhere rich in diamonds.  There aren't many such places, and it was a surprise that over the past decade, the Northwest Territories of Canada were deemed to be diamond mining country.  The eerie, exciting, and disturbing story of how this came to be is told in _Barren Lands: An Epic Search for Diamonds in the North American Arctic_ (Times Books) by Kevin Krajick.  The lure of diamonds has proved inescapable for a certain class of men for centuries, and Krajick's book tells about some of them he met  while he did his research.<br />The Barren Lands (yes, that is the designation you will see on maps) is a half million square mile region as far north as Americans can go.  There are no roads and no people, and it is called barren because it is above the northern limits which trees can reach,  Since diamond exploration has started, however, it could well be populated with workers producing gold, uranium, and other minerals.  At the heart of the story of exploration here is Chuck Fipke, a weird little guy who does nothing to improve the image of geologists.  When Fipke was in charge of a prospecting expedition, he drove his men ruthlessly, especially his own son with distressing ferocity (\\"When you're not eating or sleeping, you're working for me.\\").  Fipke was just one of a long line of explorers to the region, and their history is well covered here.  The unbelievable hardships of traversing the area, or working in it, are well described in many sections of the book; bears, mosquitoes, and deerflies all supply annoyance or danger.  Then there were the people.  Fipke could not keep his operation secret for long, and DeBeers and other mining firms shouldered in.  Fipke's team  painted the plywood cubicles that held the drills with camouflage paint that would prevent detection from the air, and even ordered army-surplus camouflage nets to cover supplies.  This was not paranoia; there were commercial spy planes making regular flights to see what was up.<br />The prospectors faced challenges from the environmentalists, who worried that the caribou, wolves, falcons, wolverines, and bears would get shoved aside by the industrialization of a previously pristine area, and the local tribes worried about water pollution, looting of artifacts left by their ancestors, and \\"perhaps most of all they worried that they might be left out of the profits.\\"  Barren Lands now has a hugely expensive mining factory, and will simply churn out millions of dollars worth of diamonds every year.  There is a pressure to build roads and power lines to the site, which will mean more alteration of a basically natural area, but profits like these cannot be resisted.  While Fipke and his partners are all now unimaginably rich, they are not unimaginably happy.  Fipke alienated many of his crew, and shattered his family during the most intense of the mining preparations.  He admits that putting all his energy into his mine had its price.  \\"But that was _cool_!  To do all that we did?  It was _fun_!\\"  It is not surprising that with this attitude, all the riches and all the family problems haven't made a difference: he is still out there looking for the next strike.sections of the book; bears, mosquitoes, and deerflies all supply annoyance or danger.

There have been a number of good accounts of the work of Alan Turing and the crew at Bletchley Park, accounts that were aided by the memories of the participants and an exciting tale of successful boffins who made a difference against the Nazis.  Codebreaking in previous wars has not had as spectacular a story, but in _The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes_ (HarperCollins) by Mark Urban, we can read about a similar victory through brainpower.  Oddly, Wellington's one-man cryptography staff is only now, almost two hundred years after the fact, getting his recognition.<br />George Scovell was of humble background, a matter that was to bedevil his entire career.  He was a brilliant linguist in school and got his break in the army when he was put in charge of Wellington's communications.  He had a knack for decoding, but then his first efforts were easy.  But when Wellington stepped up his campaign, the French started using their \\"grand cipher,\\" a fiendishly difficult code in which a single word could be encoded in multiple ways, eliminating the easy patterns that made previous codebreaking possible.  Urban describes the decipherment in sufficient detail to appreciate the intellectual challenge; Scovell cracked the code when teams in London could not do so.  By the eve of the decisive Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, Scovell had chipped away enough at the code to be able to tell how big an army Wellington would be facing and how long before it would be reinforced with more soldiers.  It is possible that because he was working with captured documents from many sources, Scovell had such information to give Wellington that it may have been more than the on-scene French general had himself.<br />Possibly because codebreaking is a pretty dry subject, this extensive book covers more than just Scovell's efforts.  It is, indeed a history of the peninsular war, with special attention to intelligence matters.  Scovell is only now getting the recognition within this book because Urban looked up Scovell's papers in an archive; they consisted of his own journal, extensive notes, and explanations of his method.  Wellington owed him a lot, but never really repaid his debt.  He knew how much Scovell had done; he was even able to send a sarcastic note back to London where experts in secret writing had been trying to crack the code with far less success than Scovell had.  But when after the war, Scovell asked for a reference letter, it did not come.  Wellington one evening told fellow diners who were curious about the code victory that decipherment had come because \\"I tried, everyone at headquarters tried, and between us we made it out.\\"  It is quite possible that Wellington wanted to emphasize his own brilliance, or the steadfast character of the British soldier, as the key to victory, without acknowledging the dirty work of espionage.  \\"The legend of his great generalship might have been undermined, however subtly, by revelations that he had been reading his enemy's most sensitive mail.\\"  Nonetheless, Scovell can now be placed in his proper position as far greater than a footnote within the Napoleonic wars, and he has an exciting tale of military history as his commemoration.Scovell is only now getting the recognition within this book because Urban looked up Scovell's papers in an archive; they consisted of his own journal, extensive notes, and explanations of his method.

How much do they form your nation?  Can mere language change society?  Plenty of people have thought so, and in _A Is for American: Letters and Other Characters in the Newly United States_ (Knopf) by Jill Lepore, we look at seven men from the nineteenth century US who, for diverse reasons, thought that changes in language could shape their national culture and society.  Some of the men are well known, others obscure, and all of them wanted to forge or use language to favor their views.  Lepore has given us pocket biographies of each, and while it may not be that there are enough similarities in their lives and endeavors to give an overarching theme to the book, Lepore is a fine writer whose clearly told stories form an impressive look at surprising aspects of language.  Here are the men she profiles who wanted to use language for more than just communication.<br />Noah Webster was concerned that American dialects of English would split society into factions, but he wanted to split American linguistically from Britain by a language that looked different, as in \\"There iz no alternativ.\\"  William Thornton wanted not a distinct American alphabet, but a universal one that would have one letter for every possible sound the human voice could make in any language to bring the world together.  Sequoyah was a Cherokee Indian who aimed for separation from American culture by means of the Cherokee language, which with great success he rendered into a written version adopted by many of his tribe.  Thomas Gallaudet insisted sign language was the universal language, not only for deaf people but for all.  Abd al-Rahman Ibrahima was a noble African Muslim who was enslaved in Mississippi for 40 years, but whose ability to write Arabic enabled him to manipulate Northern and Southern supporters to get him and his family free.  Samuel F.B. Morse was a failed painter whose elegant dots and dashes code was supposed to unite the world, but he supported slavery and saw the North use the telegraph to better advantage in the Civil War.  Alexander Graham Bell everyone knows as the inventor of the telephone, but he never regarded it as important as his advocacy of Visible Speech, his father's notation of tongue, lip, and glottal positions that formed vowel and consonant sounds.<br />These seven men had individual and idiosyncratic struggles with alphabets, codes, signs, dictionaries, and syllabaries.  Some had interaction with the others in intellectual debate, but the only time two of these seven were together was when Morse painted the elderly Webster.  It is indeed surprising that these near contemporaries were so passionate about their particular and often contrasting view of what language had to accomplish, ranging from vengeful nationalism to dreamy universalism.  As Lepore explains in a less-than-unifying epilogue, they were only participating in the paradox that American nationalism is based on universalist origins.  The overlapping stories are themselves the show here, brightly written and fascinating.  Lepore has used her own power of language to generate an academic work that tells seven diverse stories with vividness.world, but he supported slavery and saw the North use the telegraph to better advantage in the Civil War.

His author photo shows him unequivocally smoking his cigar, and so you might expect that he would go easy on the weed in his book _Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization_ (Grove Press).  For those who think that cigarettes are an unalloyed curse, some of his book will be difficult reading.  No history of tobacco can ignore the many social and health costs connected to the drug, and Gately's does not.  But American Indians were using it for centuries, and in the five centuries since the conquest of the Americas, tobacco has insinuated itself into every diverse culture; there must be a reason that the killer drug is regarded by millions as a pleasure and a comfort.  In fact, there are lots of reasons which the plant has exploited, and so it has a rich and complex history.  Gately has researched widely and told the history well.<br />Tobacco has been part of human culture for about 18,000 years.  It was cultivated in the Andes region about six thousand years ago, and only eventually smoked.  \\"That lungs had a dual function - could be used for stimulation in addition to respiration - is one of the American continent's most significant contributions to civilization.\\"  The gift of dried tobacco leaves to Columbus in the Bahamas got thrown overboard; no one knew why the natives were getting rid of their tobacco leaves this way.  The British took to snuff, in imitation of the fashionable French, but also smoked with pipes like the ones North American Indians used.  The British were slow to follow the French in cigarette usage, for they were regarded as \\"a miserable apology\\" for the more manly pleasure of cigars or pipes; Oscar Wilde enjoyed horrifying society in many ways, and chain-smoking his effeminate cigarettes was one of them.  All the nations of the world showed disgust at the particularly American practice of chewing tobacco and thereupon expectorating tinted spittle.  Charles Dickens wrote, \\"In the courts of law, the judge has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the prisoner his; while the jurymen and the spectators are provided for, as so many men who in the course of nature must desire to spit incessantly.\\"  Modern advertising gets a good examination here; surprisingly, the Marlboro Man was originally no such thing; Philip Morris brought out Marlboros \\"Mild as May\\" in 1924, targeted for decent and respectable ladies.<br />Gately's book has not been edited to be turned into an American version, so American readers will note a disproportionate number of anecdotes and facts from Europe.  (An appendix even tells how Her Majesty's subjects can grow the plant in England for their own use.)  He has some limp support of tobacco as a guard against such illnesses as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and too often his disdain for the anti-smoking movement is obvious.  However, this is a great subject.  The effects of tobacco on bodies may be bad, and on society may be bad as well (slavery, for instance, was a New World tradition largely because of tobacco farms), and Gately tells the dark side of the stories well; this is not an apology or an advertisement for smoking, but more of a historical explanation.  For anyone who smokes, or who is interested in a world-wide history centered on one particular plant and the uses to which addicted and habituated people have put it, _Tobacco_ tells an important story in an entertaining way.on expectorating tinted spittle.

Or they collide, and both lose even bigger, or they both swerve and have reciprocal embarrassment.  Before you play this game, you might make a matrix of your actions (stay the course vs. swerve) against the opponent's actions (same two choices), and see what happens with the four different possible outcomes.  But then imagine that your opponent is omniscient.  He knows just what you are going to do.  Surprisingly, this restricts the results of the game in unexpected ways so that you cannot lose.  If your opponent is omniscient, all you have to do is to stay the course.  He will know that you are not going to swerve, and (assuming that he does not want a collision), he will have to be the one to do the swerving himself.  You win whenever you play chicken with an omniscient being!<br />You may not be encouraged by this bit of practical knowledge, but people have thought about omniscient beings for as long as they have been people.  Most religions have gods which are omniscient, and the capacity of omniscience produces some very strange consequences indeed.  A delightful book, _The Paradox of God and the Science of Omniscience_ (Palgrave / St. Martin's), by Clifford A. Pickover, collects a bundle of religious and logical oddities and presents them in a playful and entertaining way.  There are seventeen chapters within the book, all having to do with paradoxes of different types, not necessarily having to do strictly with omniscience.  Each has a whimsical tale to begin it, with \\"Musings and Speculations\\" afterward.  Say you wake up and find yourself in hell.  The devil says you can win his game and get to heaven, otherwise you have to stay in hell.  You can only play once.  \\"If you play on the first day, you have a one half chance of winning.  If you play on the second day, you have a two-thirds chance of winning.  If you play on the third day, you have a three-quarters chance of winning.\\"  And so on.  So, if the reward of heaven is infinite bliss, what is mathematically the best day to play?  The answer is, keep waiting - infinite rewards make infinite waiting in hell the logical move.  Or, if you have heard the question of whether an omnipotent god can make a rock so big he can't move it, can an omniscient and omnipotent god make a person who knows something the god doesn't?  If an omniscient god knows what is going to happen in the future, did he know that Led Zeppelin would be releasing \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" thirty years ago?  Did he know the first line?  The lyrics?  The tune?  If so, what role did the musicians have in bringing the tune into the Classic Rock playlist?  Might it be possible that there are degrees of omniscience, and the god who has omniscience only has it for certain periods of time, or certain subjects, thus allowing us unimpeded free will?  Can an omniscient god be surprised, or be regretful?<br />Pickover knows that most of his readers are going to be familiar with the God of the Bible, and draws a good deal from its lessons.  He also draws upon other religious traditions, as well as inventing different types of gods to illustrate particular points.  The downright peculiar things that the Old Testament God has done, such as aiding mass killing and child sacrifice, get a look, as do the sixteen crucified saviors other than Jesus and the mythological heroes and gods who share many of his traits.  He examines why humans might have a fascination for omniscience and all the paradoxes it brings with it.  After all, we are curious specimens who want to know more and more; the ruler of the universe must already know everything.  And knowing everything, a god would know what each person was thinking and doing, which capacity would give him the ultimate ability to inspire fear in his believers (and fear of the Old Testament God is something that God thought worthy).  Incidentally, belief in his omniscience would coax people to follow the priests more.  This is a puzzling and enlightening book about reasoning that for all it's good humor will repay serious thought.  Those who already have a firm belief in the God of their choice will find puzzles in this book that will heighten the mysteries of their faith, and those who lack such faith will find reason to continue to steer away from the paradoxes of belief.lief in his omniscience would coax people to follow the priests more.

It is useful to look at the original sense of the word \\"asylum,\\" which meant a sanctuary, where those inside could take refuge from the outside.  Such refuge is no longer the fashion, with \\"community care\\" (and plenty of antipsychotic medicines) deemed a sufficient refuge for most.  But the rich are different, as everyone knows, and it used to be that there were posh institutes where a family could house (or warehouse) a dotty cousin and could rely upon discretion to keep the patient quiet and quietly removed from society, or Society.  Now there is a biography of one of these institutions, one which had a reputation among the moneyed as being the best in the business.  _Gracefully Insane: The Rise and Fall of American's Premier Mental Hospital_ (PublicAffairs) by Alex Beam tells the story of McLean Hospital, which had a long guest register of famous and moneyed clients.<br />Beam does not spend much time on the early history of the hospital.  In 1895 it moved to its grand grounds in the woodsy Boston suburbs and it became home to \\"an improved class of sufferers.\\"  It housed a rather amazing cast of characters, and perhaps in tune with the upbeat and upscale McLean atmosphere, they are presented as amusing eccentrics.  Beam does not emphasize the pain of their conditions, but he does show the futility of treatment (insulin shock, hydrotherapy, talk therapies, electroshock) for most of them.  As pharmaceutical therapies and then managed-care became the way to treat psychiatric patients, McLean lagged behind.  Many of the patients stayed on and on, getting expensive care paid in a lump initial sum by families who never wanted to see them again.  The hospital is selling off its grand properties and is also going back to its roots; a new, small facility called the Pavilion will take psychiatric care of those whose families can afford $1,800 a night, and it is proving to be popular.<br />McLean's story is thus part of the larger modern history of inpatient psychiatric treatment, but it is a peculiar one because of its elite patients.  It is a remarkable list who stayed there, and they were not all distinguished only by having wealth.  The poets Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, and Sylvia Plath wrote about their stays, as did Susanna Kaysen, author of _Girl Interrupted_.  John Nash, of _A Beautiful Mind_, was there, as were James Taylor and his brother Livingston and sister Kate.  Ray Charles was there following a drug bust.  The celebrity patients come and go through these pages, which more importantly contain a entertaining history writ small of American psychiatry.is proving to be popular.  <br />McLean's story is thus part of the larger modern history of inpatient psychiatric treatment, but it is a peculiar one because of its elite patients.

Loners are<br />those racist militia men or pedophiles.  We are social creatures<br />and we have intimate relationships with a few, friendships with<br />many, and interactions with a legion.  And yet there have been<br />solitary souls throughout history who are odd but not malevolent,<br />and it is easy to sympathize with them. \\"The idea of the hermit's<br />life - simplicity, devotion, closeness to nature - lurks somewhere<br />on the periphery of most people's consciousness, a way glimpsed,<br />oddly familiar, not taken.\\"  So writes Isabel Colgate in _A Pelican<br />in the Wilderness: Hermits, Solitaries, and<br />Recluses_ (Counterpoint).  As the subtitle shows, there are many<br />variations on the means and reasons by which people take themselves<br />away to themselves, and Colgate has provided a widely inclusive<br />discussion of the phenomenon.<br />Colgate is a novelist, and her ability<br />to write with sympathy about these loners makes her cheerful book a<br />delight to read.  One instance after another of individual oddity<br />spills from her pages.  Gilbert White, the famous<br />clergyman-naturalist of Selborne in Kent, built a thatched<br />hermitage and installed his brother there as a hermit, at least for<br />picnics.  If the owner had enough money not only for a hermitage<br />but also for a hermit, he could hire one.  In the eighteenth<br />century, Charles Hamilton hired a hermit, specified how he would<br />dress, how he must not cut his hair or nails, and how he must never<br />speak.  The hermit would have been paid 700 guineas for a seven<br />year hitch, but lasted only three weeks before sneaking off to<br />the local pub.  Mrs. Pobjoy was Beau Nash's last mistress in Bath,<br />and after his death in 1761 she moved into a hollow trunk and<br />stayed there until she died, perhaps from poverty and perhaps from<br />a broken heart.  A contemporary \\"dendrite\\" was Julia Butterfly<br />Hill, who climbed a redwood in California in 1997 to save the tree<br />from a logging company.  She stayed up it for two years, enduring<br />bad weather, hassles from security guards, and legal battles, but<br />the logging company eventually admitted defeat.  Hermits<br />seek privacy, but often do something useful to make their living,<br />like tending herbal gardens, keeping bees, and (in the case of a<br />contemporary hermit Colgate interviews) painting heraldic<br />devices.<br />The span of Colgate's research is delightful.  She covers<br />celebrity solitaries, like J. D. Salinger, Howard Hughes, and<br />Thoreau.  Notables like Andrew Jackson, Louis XIV, Peter the Great,<br />and the Spanish emperor Charles V built grand buildings called<br />hermitages, and removed themselves there without austerity.  Enkidu<br />was a kind of hermit before befriended by Gilgamesh.  There was a<br />hermit pope in the middle ages, or rather Peitro de Maroni was<br />thought to be such a holy hermit that he was made pope, and was so<br />miserable that he lasted at the post only four years before he<br />was allowed to retire and resume isolation.  The Catalan architect<br />Antonio Gaudi lived as a hermit in the last fifteen years of his<br />life beneath the unfinished spires of his great church of Santa<br />Sagrada in Barcelona; when he was run over by a tram, everyone<br />thought he was just an old tramp and there was no rush to get him<br />to a hospital, so he died.

Yet centuries ago, the balance changed.  The Moslem world was to become a backwater, and to remain that way; even in the twenty-first century, with the rest of the world paying mightily for the oil that happened to be beneath major Islamic states, they remain rich bumpkins out of tune not just with the West, but with much that was good in the modern world.  The 9-11 attacks have not changed this assessment, only reinforced that the Islamic world lags behind.  It turns out that for centuries, members of that world have been asking themselves how it was that they have been so fully surpassed.  _What Went Wrong?  Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response_ (Oxford University Press), written before 9-11, by Bernard Lewis does not so much answer the question as examine it from many sides.  Lewis attempts to look at the problem in a concise, pithy work that cannot solve the current crisis, but ought to be read by those who have a stake in it.<br />After the bustling medieval period, the stagnation in the Muslim countries was capped by repeated defeats of the Ottoman sultanate and cession of lands to Christian powers.  The Islamic powers began thinking the unthinkable - what could they adopt from the Western way of doing things to reverse the trend?  New weapons, and even more revolutionarily, Westerners to teach how the weapons were to be used, became part of the Muslim attempt at entering the modern world.  Lewis pointedly does not make a case for Western culture being inherently better than Islamic culture.  But there is little reciprocity of interest, even now, in Muslim lands for the culture of the West.  Lewis points out that Mozart and Shakespeare and jazz, for instance, are loved all around the world, but seldom pass national boundaries into Muslim consciousness.  There were Ottoman and Arab and Iranian leaders and scholars who called for change in this inward focus, as they saw the advance of the West, but the calls were generally unheeded.<br />Reformers split into two camps.  There were those who wanted to adapt and accommodate modernity, but maintain a generally Muslim order.  There were others who angrily insisted that any decline was due to straying from true Islam, and that traitors within their own societies had caused the decline.  Obviously, these two sides still have their voices currently.  Lewis maintains that the question \\"What went wrong?\\" which has bothered Muslim intellectuals and leaders for centuries is not really important to answer.  It will no longer do to blame, as has been done successively, the Mongols, the French and British colonialists, the Jews, or the Americans.  What is important is for those societies to start making a difference in themselves, \\"to abandon grievance and victimhood, settle their differences and join their talents, energies and resources in a common creative endeavor\\" for their own good and for that of the world.  It is a rousing recommendation from someone who recognizes the historic importance of the Muslim world, and it is sensible (to this Westerner's way of thinking), but whether those called upon to undertake it will read Lewis's cogent words, and having read will act, is doubtful.w the advance of the West, but the calls were generally unheeded.<br />Reformers split into two camps.

It is a great, centuries-long story of a scientific triumph over an apocalyptically powerful disease.  The smallpox virus is easily caught from other people, or even from those it has killed, or their clothes.  It kills a third of those who get it, and if it doesnt kill, it can blind or disfigure.  It has changed history  the New World would not have been conquered so thoroughly, perhaps, if the conquerors were not helped by the virus they brought with them.  The last naturally occurring case was in Somalia, a cook who was thereupon vaccinated and cured.  In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated.  It was a real scientific victory, but as the subtitle of _Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox_ (Atlantic Monthly Press) by Jonathan B. Tucker indicates, victory may have been declared early.  Especially with current terrorist threats, we would be wrong to say we have no reason to worry about smallpox.<br />Tucker is an expert on biological and chemical weapons, and directs a nonproliferation program concerning them.  The first half of his book is a fascinating history of the interaction of humans and the virus, with various vaccination programs eventually wiping out the natural disease.  The battle began even before Jenners inoculation by cowpox, inoculating people with material from others who had a mild form of the illness.  Our technological competence in administering the inoculations improved, but Tuckers narrative takes off in describing the efforts of the World Health Organization to get to areas of the world where the disease was endemic.  This is a great story, with real heroes fighting not only natural forces but governmental and societal inertia.<br />So smallpox was eradicated, and since vaccination was no longer needed, it was halted.  And herein is the problem: vaccination confers only a temporary immunity, and now, if somehow the virus were released into the population, it would find no resistance at all.  Research on the virus stopped, and the institutions that had samples of the virus destroyed them or turned them into the only two repositories, one in the US and one in Russia.  There they sit in cold storage, safe from anyone.  But the safety may be an illusion.  In 1989, a defector from the USSR alerted US intelligence to a huge Soviet bioweapons program.  Tons of smallpox virus had been manufactured, with the idea of sending it to America on ballistic missiles, a devastating blow to the United States, perhaps destroying it as a functioning society.  The bioweapon program vanished with the Soviets (or did it?), and eradication of even the two stored samples of the virus was scheduled for 1995.  But in a blow-by-blow account of how the various involved agencies of the US government faced each other off on the issue, Tucker shows how there was a stay of execution.  There are good reasons for destroying the virus once and for all, but there are good reasons not to, and so the debate is running not on objective data but on emotional fear, made worse in the current atmosphere of terror.  Right now, all experimentation with the virus is to end this year, and thereafter it could be autoclaved into oblivion, but there will undoubtedly be just another round of debate between the destructionists and the retentionists.  Hanging over the argument will be the irony that conquering the illness was just a step along the way to making it a possible agent of biological terrorism.  Tuckers fascinating and scary history shows that for all our scientific competence, and for all our understanding of microscopic life forms, we have not conquered our own baser impulses, and so smallpox is still a danger.somehow the virus were released into the population, it would find no resistance at all.

The purpose was, to be sure, to rid the country of these prostitutes, pickpockets, and shoplifters, and to ease the crowding of the gaols, but there was another reason.  The penal colony at Botany Bay was overwhelmingly male, and the overseers were worried about the irregular means of sexual satisfaction in which the convicts were indulging.  It could be that the cargo of the _Lady Julian_ would provide wives and families and stability to the penal colony, and at least the women could provide a more natural outlet for the mens urges.<br />The story of the cargo of the _Lady Julian_ is told authoritatively for the first time in _The Floating Brothel: The Extraordinary True Story of an Eighteenth-Century Ship and Its Cargo of Female Convicts_ (Theia / Hyperion) by Siân Rees.  On board ship, and within the colonies, informal pairings were made to wives, and in fact it was this sort of wife that the women were expected to become in the colony, although real marriage was of course encouraged.  The women were probably trying to make the best of a bad situation, getting better berthing and protection if they shared the bunk of a sailor.  The women were treated humanely by this particular crew, which did not skimp on their rations to improve profits, and allowed the women to make some money in prostitution when they went ashore at supply ports.  But Rees dwells at length on the environment the ship presented.  Beneath the stinking living quarters were the bilges, where slopped dead rats, dead cats, compost of mounds of vegetable peelings, feces, urine, rotting fabric, and decomposing sick.  When the ship was in port, or adrift in the Doldrums, it floated in a miasma of excrement of its own making.  Sexual diseases were spread freely on board.  There was no soap for washing, and only salt water could be used to dissolve whatever it might of accumulated dirt.  The salt-encrusted clothes caused rashes and infections.<br />The women of the _Lady Julian_, for all the hardships and deprivations recounted in this rousing tale of an eleven-month voyage, found friends and contacts from the old country, made assignations, and took care of themselves.  Many found it was far easier to become, say, respectable shopkeepers, in the colony than it would have ever been in London.  Rees has counted on a faulty narrative by the cooper on board, as well as an enormous amount of contemporary records.  There is no way to be sure of many of the details she has given, as the documentation of the voyage is incomplete, but she has supplemented her description with contemporary reports from other, similar vessels.  She has produced an earthy and entertaining popular history of a unique high-seas adventure.ad freely on board.

Books	5	886	1021	N	N	Laugh, But Learn, and Make Those Changes	_Stupid White Men_ by Michael Moore was supposed to be published in October, but the copies printed in September were going to be shredded, since the publisher thought that humorous attacks on President Bush and his partners would not be welcome after 9-11.  There was a quiet campaign to get it to readers, and HarperCollins eventually did the right thing: it has released the book unchanged and uncensored, and Moore has said he admires the courage it showed in doing so.  You don't have to be a fan of Moore's famous anti-corporate, anti-racist, and anti-conservative views to appreciate that this is a real victory.<br />You would be right to assume that &quot;President&quot; Bush (as Moore likes to call him) will not be pleased by the book.  Some of the chapters now have sort of a quaint ring, like &quot;A Very American Coup,&quot; which explains what really happened to give Florida to Bush in the last election.  It's not a matter of chads or butterfly ballots.  Bush's brother and his aids were able to purge the polls of black voters, who would have turned out for Gore.  It took the BBC to uncover this story, and by the time the American papers got it, no one was very interested.  There is plenty more sleaze to this tale, which Moore obviously enjoys telling, and if you want to check on what he claims, he gives references at the end of the book; there are few humor books with a &quot;Notes and Sources&quot; section.  It may no longer be unpatriotic to poke fun at the current President, but Moore does not restrict himself to Bush bashing, being equally tough on Clinton and Gore.  There are wonderful shots fired here, and a good laugh on almost every page.  Bush's inaugural parade came up against protesters armed with eggs and tomatoes and &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; signs at the point in the parade when the brand new President usually gets out and walks.  &quot;Then, suddenly, the President's car bolted and tore down the street.  The decision had been made - hit the gas and get past this rabble as quickly as possible.  The Secret Service agents running beside the limo were left behind, the car's tires splashing dirty rain from the street onto the men who were there to protect its passenger.  It might have been the finest thing I have ever witnessed in Washington, D.C. - a pretender to the American throne forced to turn tail and run from thousands of American citizens armed only with the Truth and the ingredients of a decent omelet.&quot;  A hilarious letter to President Arafat advises him to initiate mass nonviolent civil disobedience, rather than to keep drawing blood; if this advice had been taken, could the Palestinians be in any worse shape now?  About the conflict in Northern Ireland, his advice takes on that of  Swift's &quot;Modest Proposal&quot;:  &quot;This nonsense has gone on long enough.  I have a solution that will bring permanent peace to the area: Convert the Protestants of Northern Ireland to Catholicism....Naturally, most of the Protestants won't want to convert - but since when has that stopped the Catholic Church?... All you need is a little water to pour over any Protestant's forehead, and then repeat the following words: 'I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen.'  That's it!  It takes longer to join Weight Watchers!&quot;<br />It is going to get hard for Moore if things change to the way he wants, for he will have to make his humor out of less urgent and deadly matters.  But he is pushing.  &quot;If you're finding yourself in a massive fit of rage and start itching to put this damn book down and call your congressman / woman, then folks, do it.&quot;  He then gives easy access numbers and e-mail references, and it is hard to believe that some readers are not going to do just that.  His calls for getting involved on school boards and within other branches of local governments are just what people should be hearing and acting on.  If you want good laughs about serious provocation, and serious advocacy, this book is tops.ation, and serious advocacy, this book is tops.	2002-02-19
1649253:US	50895620	R272JPCI1YRQ3I	0375412832	496342217	Genes, Girls, and Gamow: After the Double Helix	Books	5	13	16	N	N	A Science Giant's Informal Memoir	James D. Watson produced a delightful and frequently hilarious book, _The Double Helix_, his 1968 account of how he and Francis Crick and their fellow researchers managed to jimmy molecular models into just the right positions to reveal the structure of the huge molecule DNA.  It was one of the greatest discoveries science had ever made, announced in 1953 and gaining the Nobel Prize in 1962.  Watson's book wonderfully well recounts the race to get the structure down, and it was a classic scientific memoir exciting enough to make it a best seller.  Watson was only 25 years old when DNA was cracked, and besides biochemistry, he had other things on his mind.  Girls.  Thus he has produced _Genes, Girls, and Gamow: After the Double Helix_ (Knopf) to tell what happened to him after his epochal success.  \\"I felt the need to have more than the double helix below my belt before winning the prize.  I did not want to be overpraised for what was not very difficult science.\\"  That sort of modesty pervades his book.<br />Although genes get the first mention in the title, and there is plenty of science here, the chief part of the memoir is devoted to \\"girls,\\" always on Watson's mind.  It is amusing that a scientist who will be remembered forever for his monumental discovery often sounds like a confused loveless teenager seeking female solace.  He frets when a girlfriend doesn't write, for instance, and stumbles in sexual endeavors.  The final part of the title refers to George Gamow, an amazing physicist who pops up all over American science in the forties and fifties.  His heavy drinking (\\"his idea of a tall drink was a tall glass completely filled with whiskey\\") and uproarious pranks made him disliked by many in the staid science world, but Watson reflects, \\"His role was to have a good time no matter the consequences to the ethos of science.\\"  Pranks were not only Gamow's stock in trade; the book is surprisingly full of them, perpetuated sometimes in official journals, sometimes by Watson, sometimes against Watson.  He writes about the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, \\"I deeply offended several old-timers by giving lectures in unlaced tennis shoes and wearing my floppy hat at night as well as during the day.  My water pistol was also judged inappropriate, even though I generally restricted its aim to a pretty girl from the South taking invertebrate lab work too seriously.\\"<br />It is great fun to see giants of science, like Feynman, Crick, and Delbruck, wander through these pages, usually in informal style.  It is also interesting to see the international nature of serious scientific effort, with competition that is generally friendly.  Watson is a breezy writer; the events described here, especially the details of his personal life, have none of the importance of the discovery of the double helix, and his amused and tolerant attitude comes forth on each page.  It is a fond look back at a happy, busy life.by Watson, sometimes against Watson.

Blee wrote _Women of the Klan_, which covered the 1920's.  Because readers of that work were curious about women in the contemporary Klan, she began researching her current book, _Inside Organized Racism: Women in the Hate Movement_ (University of California Press).  To do her work, she interviewed women members of the Klan, Christian Identity, and other organizations.  This meant sitting uncomfortably with women with skinheads and tattoo swastikas, and also having coffee with women who ran homes and dressed themselves just as June Cleaver did, but who uttered vile declamations about blacks and Jews.  (She found many of them by subscribing to racist mailings sent to her Post Office box; she says, \\"Going to the post office was so embarrassing. I'm sure they were horrified.\\")  She went to the group meetings, which included church services, volleyball, pancake breakfasts, and social hours, like many a harmless community gathering, but were then capped by cross or swastika burnings.  She found out that many of her assumptions about the women were wrong.<br />For instance, the women were generally educated.  Many had joined on their own, not because of a husband, family, or boyfriend.  They were not seeking a hate group to agree with, but came around to racist views after joining.  Learning such views included learning anti-Semitism, for while those who join racist groups often already have antipathy against non-whites, but they have to be taught to hate Jews.  They eventually accepted that Jews control banks, corporations, and governments by means of an amorphous conspiracy that can be blamed for everything from global warming to a family member's case of food poisoning.  They borrow the apocalyptic visions familiar to any student of fundamentalist Christianity, but expect that the \\"last days\\" battle with Satan, just around the corner, will consist of a race war, for which they prepare.  The attitudes of the women toward the groups they are in, however, are less doctrinal than those of the men.  Some differences in belief are due to particular women's issues.  Some resent being excluded by all-male rituals of the historic Klan, for instance, or resent having to play the homemaker role that fundamentalist Christianity encourages.  Many of the women admitted to Blee that they had done such unacceptable acts as have abortions, insisting that such a personal act was to be decided by the individual, not the group.  (Because of fundamentalist Christian beliefs, and eagerness to breed new Aryans, abortion is forbidden as a Jewish plot, but is supported for non-whites.)  Women in hate groups are more likely to bend proscriptions, allowing themselves to be on good terms with at least some homosexuals or mixed-race individuals.  They are more likely to urge action by political means rather than expecting a violent race war to solve the world's problems.<br />_Inside Organized Racism_ is a serious academic work, well referenced and footnoted.  Blee's interviewees spanned the skinhead, neo-Nazi, Klan, and Christian Identity movements, and Blee's appendix explains her methodology for selecting them; this is as full a snapshot of this particular subset of humans as we are likely to get.  In an important final section on lessons for our society, Blee not only defends her study as helping understand this subculture as more than just bizarre or dangerous.  She has suggestions such as using the ambivalence of women as a means of encouraging defection.  After working in the field of investigating racism, Blee is abandoning it, exhausted.  Her next book will be on the effect on community groups of having a place to meet; she will be forgiven if it is not as immediately gripping as her current book.less doctrinal than those of the men.

This is as it should be, given that his theory of evolution is the overarching explanatory force in biology.  Darwin was a keen observer, a model scientist, and a modest, approachable man.  Though the creationists then and now criticize evolution for religious reasons, they have only been able to criticize his life by deceit: Darwin was upright, fair, and generous.  He was also an exemplary family man as both husband and father.  It is this last aspect of Darwin's life that is admirably covered in _Darwin, His Daughter, and Human Evolution_ (Riverhead Books) by Randal Keynes.  There is ample reason for this one more book on evolution's founder: Keynes's grandmother was Darwin's granddaughter, and Keynes had access to family accounts of growing up in the Darwin household.  Seven of Darwin's ten children survived to adulthood, and five of these wrote about their upbringings, and upon these accounts, Keynes has drawn heavily, to provide an intimate picture of life in Down House, and to show how family relationships provided material for Darwin's thought.<br />At the heart of the story is Annie Darwin, who died in 1851 at the age of ten, after a lingering, mysterious illness.  The parents, Charles and Emma, were devastated by the loss of a daughter who seems to have been a particular font of joy for them.  Darwin in his grief sat down to write.  He first produced a moving memorial to Annie, reproduced here with its words of quiet and profound grief.  And then, as he always did when he was emotionally drained, he went to work, at this time on his great species theory.  The sadness over Annie's death pervaded all Darwin's subsequent thinking, but Keynes's book is not a sad one.  Of course Darwin had a triumphant life, but daily life in his household was generally joyous, and the children knew it, and gratefully acknowledged it as such in later years.  The children were raised in happy indulgence.  They learned to read when they chose to do so, and they collected specimens and made notes as their father did.  They learned to think for themselves.  They often made a chaos of the house, invading Darwin's writing room, but were rarely expelled even from that sanctum.  Darwin never dropped his role as investigator, and made notes on the children's development, ideas that were incorporated into his theory.<br />Keynes has reviewed Darwin's upbringing, education, travels, and writings, but this book will not replace any of the fine biographies we now have.  Instead, it gives details about an important spark to Darwin's thinking.  The details about the life within Down House are often linked with Darwin's writing, but more importantly, the archetypal great scientist is poignantly shown as a deeply human, admirable, and quite lovable, family man.when they chose to do so, and they collected specimens and made notes as their father did.

There is a tiny elite of powerful men who run everything, who decide who gets to be president of any given country and who start the wars.  They control Hollywood, the broadcasters, the markets and capital flow.  They operate harems of sex slaves and they go to annual pagan rituals in different appointed regions of the world.  When no one is looking, they change themselves into giant twelve-foot lizards, and any investigator who gets to close to these truths has his credibility, or his corpus, destroyed.<br />Well, can you prove it isn't true?  The great advantage of the paranoid stance is that it can take in anything, and if it sounds too outlandish to be true, \\"That's just what _they_ want you to think.\\"  They?  Who's they?  Learn the truth in _Them: Adventures with Extremists_ (Simon and Schuster) by Jon Ronson, or at least learn the truth as believed, with diverse variations, by different fringe-dwellers all over the world.  Ronson has played Sancho Panza to militiamen, questing reporters, evangelists, Ku Klux Klansmen, and fundamentalist Muslims.  And he really does have adventures.  When hunting for the omnipotent international cabal the Bilderberg Group at its annual meeting in Portugal, he gets pursued by a steely man in sunglasses, and he panics.  He calls the British Embassy to rescue him, pleading, \\"I am essentially a humorous journalist... I am a humorous journalist out of my depth.\\"  He also furtively enters the Bohemian Grove, another center of international intrigue, to find that some of the reports are true, reports of  orgies, nocturnal pagan rituals, and ceremonial peeing rites, and participants dressing like women or like Elvis.  (\\"These people may have reached the apex of their professions but emotionally they seemed to be trapped in their college years.\\")<br />Ronson's reporting is dry and ironic, and often laugh-out-loud funny.  He knows that his subjects are very, very weird, but he is never patronizing, and he is often impressed by their sincerity.  At times, he finds himself imbued with the paranoia they are eager to spread, and has to fight back with some degree of rationality.  A very sensible Bilderberg contact explains that members are getting older and the young newbies don't have much interest in being involved.  \\"Let's face it, nobody rules the world anymore.  The _markets_ rule the world.  Maybe that's why your conspiracy theorists make up all those crazy things.  Because the truth is so much more frightening.  Nobody rules the world.  Nobody controls anything.\\"  Of course, that's just what they want you to believe.ten impressed by their sincerity.

He was reluctant; the story was only that of a dedication of a plaque commemorating the execution by the Germans in World War I of four British soldiers who for two years had been hidden within the village of Villeret.  He endured \\"God Save the Queen\\" excruciatingly played by the band from the local mental health institution, a decrepit honor guard, and some parochial proclamations of self-importance.  One old, old lady in a wheelchair cornered the British representative to tell him how seven British soldiers had been protected by the village, and three had eventually escaped to Britain, and four had been shot.  \\"That was in 1916,\\" she explained.  \\"I was six months old... Those seven British soldiers were our soldiers.  One of them was my father.\\"<br />Thus began Macintyre's research into a tragic romance, which he reports in _The Englishman's Daughter: A True Story of Love and Betrayal in World War I_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux).  It is a sad and almost forgotten episode from the first terrifying days of The Great War, and though he has had to rely on stories filtered through the generations, faulty memories and incomplete records, Macintyre has been able to bring out a fine story of ordinary people within the village.  They are not very great heroes and not very great villains, just rustics trying to live through an intolerable situation.  Private Robert Digby, along with seven other soldiers, was hidden by the villagers in a conscientious show of resistance.  During the two years hiding, fell in love with the prettiest girl in the village, who bore him a daughter.  Although this is a tragic love story, its strength is the picture of stressful and disastrous life under German occupation under the paranoid commandant, Major Evers.  Eventually, the soldiers were betrayed and shot; Macintyre speculates who the traitor was: it could have been a suitor spurned by Claire, or a village woman interested in Digby, or a German sympathizer, or maybe just someone who wanted more food.<br /><br />Macintyre's attempts to find who betrayed Digby, and indeed the slight but touching love story that is the reason for the book, take second place to his description of the grinding brutality of occupation and the response of different villagers to the pressure.  Their novel moral burdens were shouldered or shirked as this independent and willful region, which had always preserved some idiosyncratic separation from the rest of France, was overcome by a war imposed by gigantic outside forces.  The moral ambiguity of the story has been impressed on the descendants of the villagers, who even on the day to celebrate the commemorative plaque for the lost Englishmen eight decades later were reluctant to tell family stories.  There is a fitting symbol within the book: Robert Dessenne, a cousin of Claire's and named for Digby, years after the war \\"was plowing in the fields when he struck an unexploded shell, and was blown to pieces.\\"r spurned by Claire, or a village woman interested in Digby, or a German sympathizer, or maybe just someone who wanted more food.  <BR> <BR>Macintyre's attempts to find who betrayed Digby, and indeed the slight but touching love story that is the reason for the book, take second place to his description of the grinding brutality of occupation and the response of different villagers to the pressure.

Dr. David Crystal, who has produced many scholarly volumes such as _The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language_, uses the internet a lot, and has looked into the many forms of its use by other people.  It is changing things, surely, but it is its own new medium drastically different from anything that has gone before, and Crystal says, \\"It shows language expanding richly in all sorts of directions.\\"  In _Language and the Internet_ (Cambridge University Press), Crystal surveys the language used in different branches of the Internet, and although he admits that some of his findings are going to be quickly dated because of the Internet's extreme rate of change, his book is a useful initial survey of Internet language, one upon which future studies will draw as a foundation.<br />The remarkable function of the Internet in linguistic communication stems from its not quite being speech and not quite being writing.  Communication in chatgroups or MUD's, and to a lesser extent e-mail, is typed but is a good deal like speech, displaying the immediacy and flow of conversation.  This is an entirely new way of communicating.  It means that John's speech is typed one keystroke at a time, but appears to recipients all of a piece, with no way that a recipient can react to it while it is being typed.  Unlike with speech, the sender cannot be clued by an \\"Uh-huh\\" to indicate that the speech in progress is being well received.  The speed of such interactions, dependent on keystrokes and speed of the Internet at that particular time, means that the rhythm of interaction is not only slow, but irregularly and unpredictably so.  If there are multiple users, everyone's speech is displayed along with everyone else's, with little of the ear's ability to tune into just one speaker.  Taking turns in conversation, which we take for granted face-to-face or on the telephone, is disrupted, and no one can get cues from tone of voice.  Crystal reviews many of the responses Internet users have developed to deal with the peculiarities of the new medium.  There is a list of the famous \\"smileys\\" or \\"emoticons\\" which are punctuation marks used to simulate smiling faces, frowning faces, confusion, winking, and so on.  Their linguistic interest is that they could have shown up earlier in written language; only with the immediacy of Net communication did smileys become a useful tool.  He reviews ways in which content of this form of communication may be shaped by the new medium, and is dismissive of the current crop of style manuals that would impose rules on it.<br /><br />This is an academic review, well referenced and footnoted, but Crystal's optimism and good humor abound.  He has clarified many aspects of the styles and abbreviations one is likely to meet in e-communication, and he is documenting them, rather than trying to influence the style.  And sometimes it is all amusingly above his head; check the footnote which ought to translate \\"Hay! Odz r he wen 2 Radio Hack 4 a nu crys 4 hiz rainbow box!\\" and you will find: \\"I don't understand it, either.\\"ith little of the ear's ability to tune into just one speaker.

It has been investigated, reinvestigated, fictionalized, filmed, and solved by different experts who have shown the same sort of unflagging interest in the case as others have for that of Jack the Ripper.  It is astonishing that although the crime was never solved and the murderer never punished, now 125 years after the case made its headlines, a plausible and new solution has been meticulously proposed by journalist and researcher James Ruddick.  In _Death at the Priory: Sex, Love, and Murder in Victorian England_, not only do we get a good look at some of the dark underside of Victorian life, but also we learn that some traces of crime never fade, and effects of it may last for generations.<br />Ruddick's characters, especially Bravo's wife, Florence, are just as colorful as any from a novel of the period.  The inquest after the excruciating death by poisoning of Charles Bravo was a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.  As in any good murder mystery, there were plenty of suspects, all of whom had motive to kill Bravo.  Perhaps Bravo was drinking and suicidal and took the poison himself.  George Griffiths, Florence's coachman, had made what could be interpreted as an actual threat against the man who fired him.  Jane Cox, Florence's housekeeper and companion, had debts, children to care for, and a position with a mistress she truly cared about, and Bravo was trying to fire her, too.  Florence could have done him in because life with him was intolerable for many reasons.  Dr. Gully, her former lover, was suspected (by Agatha Christie, no less) of killing Bravo in revenge for stealing her away.  Ruddick explains how the police system at the time was inadequate, only starting an investigation eight days after Bravo's death and failing to get details right, details that Ruddick himself has uncovered.  Ruddick, in true whodunit fashion, shows how the evidence against each suspect is quite convincing, and then shows how other evidence exculpates each, until he circles around again to the one he has fingered.<br />It is probably wrong to think that this famous case has produced its last bit of speculation, but Ruddick's explanation is clever without being too clever.  He has gone to The Priory and found evidence that the inquest should have investigated at the time.  He has been to Jamaica to discover surprising facts about Jane Cox, and he has interviewed the descendants of those involved.  He has discovered that some descendants could not bring themselves, even a century and a quarter after the scandal, to discuss the events with him, and that some of the families involved never recovered from the shame of it.  His explanation satisfactorily fits into the Victorian atmosphere he has taken pains to describe.  It is a suspenseful puzzle, showing the British world at the cusp of various social changes, and is irresistibly entertaining.ddick himself has uncovered.

He recounts some encounters with humans (\\"craniacs\\") who are trying to save the cranes, which are in trouble everywhere, but most of the extensive travels described in this book can only report trouble.  If we do not, however, learn what the crane has to tell us, it will be despite Matthiessen's efforts, for in him, cranes have a lucid and compelling advocate.He has gone to exotic locales wherever cranes go.  There are plenty of common denominators wherever he travels.  Cranes, like so many other forms of wildlife, are hunted, trapped to sell as exotic specimens, and poisoned as agricultural pests.  Cranes need wetlands in which to feed, and humans need wetlands to serve as repositories for waste and to be built over to make more space for more humans.  It is clear everywhere that Matthiessen goes that humans are winning, and therefore losing.<br />He has produced an unforgettably bleak picture of ecological matters in China, and an optimistic account of our own country's efforts in getting whooping cranes started again.  That we don't know what we are doing in dealing with the cranes is shown in a paradoxically happy outcome for them in Korea.  Wars are, as the posters used to declare, harmful to children and other living things, and the Korean War was disastrous for humans and for cranes.  There is now a Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas, just a couple of miles wide but running from the Sea of Japan to the Yellow Sea.  Human habitation is forbidden in the area, and farming is very limited.  Matthiessen is thus able to visit the DMZ's boundary, accompanied by armed soldiers.  (\\"One may visit a North Korean museum that reveals American atrocities, but we decline this educational opportunity, electing to go birdwatching instead.\\")  He thus gets to watch cranes in the \\"most fiercely protected wildlife sanctuary on earth... an accidental paradise for cranes.\\"  Woe to the cranes if peace breaks out.<br />This volume includes paintings and drawings of cranes by Robert Bateman, lovely renderings that are more compelling than the usual field guide renditions.  They complement Matthiessen's fine text.  Cranes are long lived, and they often mate for life.  Their windpipes are modified like French horns to produce eloquent and distinctive calls.  Their size and their pugnacity, for they are protective birds and dangerous to handle, should make us respect them as fellow-citizens of the planet.  There is no need to invoke anthropomorphism; there is a spiritual bond between humans and these animals which Matthiessen has movingly demonstrated.  He knows, however, that \\"the time is past when large rare creatures can recover their numbers without man's strenuous intervention,\\" and despite his romantic optimism, his stories show we are strenuously bent on something else entirely.sanctuary on earth... an accidental paradise for cranes.\\"  Woe to the cranes if peace breaks out.<br />This volume includes paintings and drawings of cranes by Robert Bateman, lovely renderings that are more compelling than the usual field guide renditions.

The selections here come from Hans-Jurgen D&ouml;pp, who is apparently a famed collector of such things: \\"His important collection of erotic art has been built up over many years by drawing upon sources in various European countries.\\"  As in most such collections of erotic art, here are introductory chapters to put the art into context and explain its importance, and as such essays go, the ones included here are just fine.  But the \\"reader\\" always wonders if the words are just there as justification for the shameful pleasures indulged in by the \\"viewer.\\"<br />The charm of the pictures in this book (and they are charming) is that they were made to appeal to the bourgeoisie who would be buying them by depicting just their sort of people in familiar settings.  There are some rather silly historical pictures here; in one a knight in a suit of armor (well, not the entire suit, just the coat without the pants, so as not to impede the nether regions) raises his glass while fondling his girlie as she fondles him.  For the most part, however, these are contemporaries, showing off the best style of their times.  They are dressed in clothes that are similar to those more familiarly shown in period fashion books.  Oh, they do remain dressed, most of them.  The women lower their blouses to show fashionably small breasts and button aureoles, or raise their dresses just so to show what we would now regard as buns of less than steel.  The men may have their trousers off or down, but generally their priapic displays of eagerness are available for the delight of the ladies involved by means of unbuttoned but undoffed breeches.  Everything is pretty in these rather romantic pictures, which are divided into sections for soloists, duets, trios, quartets, and \\"the noble orgy.\\"<br />This is a delightful book of pretty pictures.  Anyone who likes looking at erotic couplings will enjoy it, and those who need a \\"proper\\" reason to do so can always claim they are looking at history, and their enjoyment will be undimmed.pretty pictures.

1683099:US	50895620	R2JYZUT5E7CGBO	1573928968	910276903	Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Two Giants Clash on Spiritualism	Two of the most famous personalities of early in the last century shared a strong interest in spiritualism, the belief that souls live on after death and can be contacted by the living.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the immortal Sherlock Holmes, was unassailably convinced that spiritualism not only worked, but that it was the religion that all of us soon would practice, once its truth were known.  Harry Houdini, the brilliant showman and escapologist, was convinced of no such thing, but he was convinced that he never found a conductor of s&eacute;ances who used supernatural rather than fraudulent or erroneous means of getting results.  These two domineering personalities became unlikely friends, for a five year period, sharing correspondence, dinners, and holidays.  It isn't hard to believe that the friendship foundered over their differences on the keen shared interest, but it is surprising that the friendship ever existed.  _Final S&eacute;ance: The Strange Friendship between Houdini and Conan Doyle_ (Prometheus) by Massimo Polidoro is a good supplement to the current crop of biographies of both men.  It gives capsule biographies of both, with an extensive and annotated account of the years when they were an item together, and thus provides an excellent picture of spiritualism, rationality, and the will to believe.<br />In many of these pages, Doyle emerges as the more interesting figure because he was obviously a thoughtful and sometimes brilliant man, and it is a puzzle that he kept the belief in spirituality despite what seems to be overwhelming evidence (some presented by Houdini himself).  He abandoned an insistence on proofs of religious ideas, probably in response to grief over the death of his son.  He could not accept that mediums used trickery if he himself saw a demonstration he accepted as psychic.  Houdini was interested in spiritualism probably because of a desire to contact his mother, but such contact never happened in a way that he thought was genuine.  He repeatedly demonstrated evidence that mediums were just magicians to Doyle (who thought even that Houdini was using psychic means for some of his tricks).  It would have easily have convinced Sherlock Holmes, but it never convinced his creator.  When, after a s&eacute;ance with Lady Doyle who supposedly contacted his mother, Houdini maintained that he had never witnessed any sort of psychic phenomena, Doyle took this as a personal insult, and the friendship was over.<br />Houdini went on to organize against mediums, including lobbying for ill-judged laws to ban spiritualism.  He also offered large amounts of money to anyone who could demonstrate \\"psychic\\" powers that he could not explain or duplicate.  As Polidoro shows in an intelligent critique, this was a flawed argument; Houdini's ability to duplicate an effect would not prove that the effect was not originally performed in a psychic way.  However, the offer lead the way for the more comprehensive one by James Randi, who currently offers a million dollars for a demonstration of psychic powers under controlled conditions.  No prize awarded yet.  Houdini died in 1926, and Doyle resumed a solicitous correspondence with the widow of the man who was \\"in some ways, the most remarkable man I have ever known.\\"  Doyle died four years later, believing still.  Houdini did us all the service of a final test; he was, if it was at all possible, to return and give his wife a message agreed between them.  Mediums did try to summon him, and if anyone could have escaped from the reaches of \\"the other world\\" to get her that message, the great escapologist would have managed it.  It never happened.

These were threats, but never had to be deployed into action.  But one weapon that did go into action was hotels.  Hilton hotels.  This is the surprising demonstration in _Building the Cold War: Hilton International Hotels and Modern Architecture_ (University of Chicago Press) by Annabel Jane Wharton.  What is even more surprising is that Hilton hotels did not just participate in the capitalist boom that eventually dislodged the Soviet Union.  They were deliberately placed, designed, and run to make a profit, to be sure, but also to dislodge the Red Threat.  This is not just the author's speculation.  Conrad Hilton made it explicit:  &quot;Let me say right here, that we operate hotels abroad for the same reason we operate them in this country - to make money for our stockholders... However, we feel that if we really believe in what we are all saying about liberty, about Communism, about happiness, that we, as a nation, must exercise our great strength and power for good against evil.  If we really believe this, it is up to each of us, our organizations and our industries, to contribute to this objective with all the resources at our command.&quot;  He was careful not to disparage our country's military, but said, &quot;I will tell you frankly, satellites and H-bombs will not get the job done.&quot;<br />Wharton has done an excellent job of giving a broad history of the overseas Hilton, while giving case studies of specific ones.  The Istanbul Hilton, for instance, had all the usual amenities, like lawns (completely foreign to the area), tennis courts, and a swimming pool.  It had the extraordinary feature, common in foreign Hiltons, of iced water piped into every room.  However, the marquee covering cars that drove up to the entrance was a wavy horizontal structure that was referred to as the &quot;flying carpet.&quot;  The interior lobby had a series of domes in the ceiling, a bow to mosque designs, and there were teakwood screens and Turkish carpets.  Work by local artisans decorated the public spaces.  Nonetheless, you can see in the pictures (and in this book, there are many useful ones) that the Istanbul Hilton is still a concrete, metal, and glass box like nothing else around it.  Old hotels concentrated on public rooms inside; the Hiltons looked out, with lots of glass in every room to supply a view.  The view was carefully chosen.  In Istanbul, it faced East, toward the Soviet Union, daring those Commies to look American modernity and wealth in the eyes.<br />Wharton is a historian of medieval art.  Her family used some of these hotels when she was growing up, and she has returned to them to give an architectural history of the Hilton overseas effort.  (She could not visit two Hiltons now lost, the one in Havana and the one in Tehran.)  It is a remarkable history, no longer active because the Cold War is over, and because others followed Hiltons into the modernism market.  The Hilton hotels still exist, but they are just hotels now, not unique as architecture nor as Cold War armaments.  They shaped the way American visitors viewed foreign capitals, and boosted American economic (and therefore political) policies.  Conrad Hilton may not have won the Cold War, but he did more than plenty of the generals.to mosque designs, and there were teakwood screens and Turkish carpets.

Of course, it never had been eclipsed in the hearts of New Yorkers or Americans.  The building will always be a classic.  &quot;It had the almost magical capacity to fill people with wonder and joy, even jaded Manhattanites long since deadened to the scale and brawn of the city.&quot;  It has been hit by an airplane, back in 1945, an accidental strike that did comparatively minimal damage, but even if it were somehow to vanish, there are photos, brass paperweights, and even _King Kong_ to keep the talismanic building in our consciousness.  It is a huge and spectacularly good looking building, erected by tycoons of huge ego.  It was also owned and run by tycoons of huge ego, and their amazingly messy story is told in _Empire: A Tale of Obsession, Betrayal, and the Battle for an American Icon_ (Wiley) by Mitchell Pacelle.<br />It has to be said that Pacelle does not make the financial ins and outs completely clear.  Teams of lawyers couldn't do that, but it doesn't matter.  Throughout the confusing story, what comes out clearest are the personalities, some deeply flawed, of the millionaires and billionaires clawing to get control of a status property.  It is a shocking soap opera in many ways, and full of spicy gossip.  Hideki Yokoi, a ruthless and unprincipled real estate baron, picked up the Empire State Building as part of a trophy hunting spree including French chateaux and English castles.  He went to jail because of the deaths of people who burned in his hotel in Tokyo.  His illegitimate daughter Kiiko Nakahara was his proxy buyer for a trophy hunting spree that included the building as well as various chateaux and castles.  When his boom went bust, she insisted the Empire State Building had been his personal gift to her, creating a rift from her father and his other children.  She formed a partnership with Donald Trump, with the idea that he could make the dated interiors of the building into upscale condominiums and offices for the elite.  But the biggest part of acting like an owner of the building was Trump's increased ability to pester his nemesis, Leona Helmsley, who owned most of the lease to it.  He called her &quot;a disgrace to humanity,&quot; a &quot;vicious, horrible woman,&quot; and a &quot;living nightmare.&quot;  Leona clearly deserved much of her reputation.  She was foul-mouthed, constantly angry, and wildly intemperate in tongue-lashings to employees over minor infractions.  She also got her licks in against Trump: &quot;I wouldn't believe him if his tongue were notarized.&quot;<br />This unsavory crew, scrambling for finance and status, and trashing friendships and family ties all along the way, make a hugely entertaining spectacle.  It is sordid, but Pacelle is a business reporter for _The Wall Street Journal_, not a gossip columnist; one gets the idea that he himself is dismayed by the lack of business ethics which he has to report.  The confusing story (at times even the participants cannot tell who owns the building) takes turns that would be forbidden in fiction and is intensely readable.  You may still want to be a millionaire, but you wouldn't trade places with these disreputable characters for all the millions they have sifted through.th the idea that he could make the dated interiors of the building into upscale condominiums and offices for the elite.

In the competition for survival, we are winning, beating out competitors, causing havoc, and claiming victory, however short term it may be.  It is only particular aspects of the problem that are news, and we do need to be told of them for the purpose, if nothing more, of keeping our eyes open to the onslaught.  Here is an aspect that you may not know about: green sea turtles are being killed off by a mysterious illness.  A sincere and thoughtful book will tell you of the problem, if you can stand to hear about it: _Fire in the Turtle House: The Green Sea Turtle and the Fate of the Ocean_ (PublicAffairs) by Osha Gray Davidson.  Davidson is a fine storyteller, and has pulled the history of sea turtles together with documentation about their current fate, as well as giving vivid portraits of the idiosyncratic turtle fans who are trying to do something about the turtles' problem.  The particular problem for them is serious, and as Davidson's subtitle tells, it reflects a general and larger disaster.<br />The green sea turtle has survived for over a hundred million years, and it simply may not be around much longer.  It has been overhunted, but as Davidson makes clear, overhunting is so cause-and-effect obvious that it is often blamed as the reason extinctions happen.  However, a hundred years ago we were learning that the indirect methods of ignorance and indifference were far more efficient vectors of biological collapse by means of habitat destruction.  We are also turning coastal waters into a breeding ground for a revolting disease called fibropapillomatosis, or FP for short.  Tumors sprout on the flippers restricting motion, and around the eyes causing blindness, and within the guts causing eventual death.  They are warty or smooth, and leeches live in them for the blood supply, and blood flukes lay eggs in them.  In 1986 researchers were shocked that there were outbreaks of the disease in both Florida and Hawaii.

But luck must be on your side.&quot;  So begins a remarkable memoir of Jewish life under the Nazis in Hungary, _Masquerade: Dancing Around Death in Nazi-Occupied Hungary_ (Arcade) by Tivadar Soros.  Soros was a thoroughly remarkable man who certainly had variety and adventure in his life, and his share of luck.  There are many accounts of the horrors of the Holocaust, and Soros certainly does not minimize the death and terror that he witnessed.  Unlike many such accounts, however, this is a story of optimism and triumph.  Soros and all his family survived.<br />His memoir begins in 1944 when the Nazis occupied Germany.  Soros realized that &quot;Since we can't stand up to Hitler's fury, we must hide from it.&quot;  He and his family hid, but since they had to be seen in order to take care of daily needs, they took on the aspects of Christians.  This involved his forming close relationships with a series of forgers, and once he took care of his immediate family's documents, he took care of other relatives, and then friends, and clients.  &quot;If anyone asked for my help, one of my principles in life was never to say no - if only to avoid diminishing their faith in human beings.&quot;  Amidst narrow escapes and harrowing close calls, Soros kept a sense of humor which frequently emerges on these pages.  As a &quot;Christian,&quot; Soros was able to obtain cigarettes when those were denied to Jews, and since he didn't smoke, he would leave them at a watchmaker's, so that people with stars could get some.  He went to the watchmaker to get his watch fixed, and asked the price.  &quot;How can you ask such a thing?  It's on the house,&quot; the watchmaker said, and then whispered to the woman working beside him, &quot;This is the Christian gentleman who brings us the cigarettes, you know.&quot;  Soros says, &quot;At least the Jews got to see that there were still a few decent Christians.&quot;  Much of the humor is tinged with humane sadness; according to one of his sons, Soros used to say, &quot;It is amazing how well people can bear the suffering of others.&quot;<br />This wonderful memoir has been in print before.  Soros, that practical idealist, as an Esperantist wrote the original in Esperanto in 1965, three years before his death.  In libraries of Esperantists the book has been an outstanding volume from the literature the planned language has produced.  It is here translated by Humphrey Tonkin, a linguist whose name is familiar to all American Esperantists.  It includes brief, loving memoirs by his sons, one of whom, George, has become one of the world's richest and most influential people.  If there is room on your shelves for history with hope, written by a thoroughly humane and lovable man, this book is perfect.is tinged with humane sadness; according to one of his sons, Soros used to say, &quot;It is amazing how well people can bear the suffering of others.&quot;<br />This wonderful memoir has been in print before.

People have always wondered about the place of the Earth in the cosmic scheme of things.  Cosmology, the science of the biggest of all big pictures, has over the past century been one of the areas of science that people have the most curiosity about.  Cosmologists were not always well respected by other scientists; their work was speculative and on the fringe, it was thought.  But then the strange idea of the Big Bang Theory took hold.  In 1965, cosmic background radiation was found all over the universe that had been predicted by the Big Bang Theory.  In 1990, measurements from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite provided a spectacular confirmation that the radiation came from a huge explosion of matter and space 13 billion years ago.  Sir Martin Rees was one of the celebrated circle of astrophysicists at Cambridge that also produced Stephen Hawking, and he is now the Astronomer Royal.  Cosmology is no longer fringe; in _Our Cosmic Habitat_ (Princeton University Press), Rees insists, &quot;The big bang theory deserves to be taken at least as seriously as anything geologists or paleontologists tell us about the early history of our Earth.&quot;<br />Rees's entertaining summary of his stance on cosmological issues serves as a guide to where we live in the universe.  Cosmologists who take up the chore of explaining their work to the public have enormous obstacles against them.  Their science uses more of mathematics than observation, and the extent of times involved and the counterintuitive strangeness of different forms of matter and energy may be data that experts get a feel for, but will always be foreign to most of us.  Hawking's _A Brief History of Time_ is a best seller (and let us be thankful that this is so!), but I have never run into a reader, myself included, who wasn't mystified by big blocks of it.  Rees's book, written as an inaugural to the Scribner Lectures at Princeton, is concise, wise, and witty, and I think most people would find it more accessible than Hawking's.  Rees has written to answer Einstein's famous question, &quot;What interests me most is whether God could have made the world differently,&quot; and this is as good an answer as we are going to get until further facts turn up.<br />Rees has thought deeply about the &quot;anthropic&quot; contingencies that resulted in a planet with human life.  If gravity or various other forces were tweaked only slightly, completely different universes, adverse to the formation of life, would result.  He is not satisfied with the answer that if the contingencies were not just so, we wouldn't be here, and so the world looks fine-tuned just for us because we are here.  The answer of a creator who deliberately dialed in the numbers smacks of a &quot;god of the gaps,&quot; the unsatisfactory explanation of last resort for mysteries, an explanation that is not scientific and actually makes for more mysteries than it answers.  The final part of Rees's stimulating book is devoted to the idea of a multiverse of which our own universe is only one of an almost infinite number.  If there are plenty of other universes, it is not surprising that we would have wound up on one that seems designed or fine-tuned.  He is quick to admit that this is speculation, but also proposes that there may be ways in the future to test if a multiverse might actually exist.  It is an attractive idea.  Is it testable?  It is exciting to think that good minds are working on the problem, and we can wait and see.e accessible than Hawking's.

You have given up your corsets, thrown off the painful cinches which restricted your natural form into a warped male ideal, and refused to comply with yet another imposition of male domination.  Except... you haven't.  We might think of the corset as being an outdated fashion accessory that has no place in the twenty-first century, but according to Valerie Steele in _The Corset: A Cultural History_ (Yale University Press), the corset is still here after hundreds of years.  Her book is a large-format work with plenty of beautiful illustrations (not many that have a direct erotic appeal), but it is also a well-referenced text that gives a broad history of a controversial garment.  It isn't just controversial now; a writer in 1731 wrote, &quot;The Stay is part of modern dress that I have an invincible aversion to, as giving a stiffness to the whole frame, which is void of grace and an enemy of beauty.&quot;  Steele reproduces many funny satirical pictures of tugs-of-war to get the stay cinched up tight (and everyone remembers Scarlett O'Hara's comic fight for a smaller-corseted waist in _Gone with the Wind_).  Corsets were blamed for cancer, circulatory diseases, asthma, ugly children, and death.  Probably corsets did not distort the body permanently; once undone, everything shifted back to natural positions.  Corsets worn for workaday use were probably not very restrictive.  It seems that, despite a wide belief to the contrary, fashionable &quot;wasp waisters&quot; did not have their lower ribs surgically removed; there is no written evidence of such a procedure, which would have to be performed without anesthesia and antibiotics.<br />Corsets have gone in and out of fashion in response to changes in styles, deliberate dress reform, and historical and economic forces.  Steele shows that insisting that men were responsible for inflicting corsets on women is simply incorrect, and how the French Revolution, the industrial revolution, and both world wars affected corsetry.  A rebound after the Second World War was cut short by the hippies and women's liberation.  After that, Steele argues, we have had a run of exercise corsetry, shaping the body by aerobic exercise and weight training, an ideal that still holds sway.  Surgical corsetry via liposuction continues the centuries of bringing women's bodies into agreement with the ideal of beauty, whatever that is.<br />Through all the centuries, corsets have had an erotic and a sadomasochistic pull.  Corseting girls, and even boys, was a theme in literature having to do with their boarding schools, although it is doubtful that such corseted academies actually existed except in fevered imaginations.  One can count on fashion designers to continue to include corsets on their most showy productions.  Such lights as Madonna have taken advantage of the fetishistic potential of corsets, and they seem still to be desired under bridal gowns, reinforcing a sexual link.  Steele has a dry sense of humor to enliven a sometimes academic text; she laments, &quot;Admittedly, we know nothing about underwear in the premodern period,&quot; or puns &quot;The English especially believed that a straitlaced woman was not loose,&quot; and she deadpans her research within a periodical titled _The Corset and Underwear Review_.  One can look at the impressive illustrations she has gathered in this book (the often hilarious Victorian advertisements are the best) and see easily that men and women are going to have to change into entirely different creatures before they have corsets no more.affected corsetry.

The drawings are scratchy, not sketchy, pen and ink visions of a sooty, nightmare London, relieved from time to time by gray watercolor washes. Campbell knows, better than some film directors, that a good vantage and seeing characters acting, rather than hearing characters talking, are what move the story along and provide the allure of full illustration. I don't really know how much of the credit for such &quot;direction&quot; ought to go to Alan Moore, who is the writer of _From Hell_. Moore has done an astonishing job of research. _From Hell_ is, strictly speaking, fiction, but one of its lessons is that there is a blurred line between fiction and history. He writes, &quot;Five murdered paupers and one anonymous assailant. This reality is dwarfed by the vast theme-park we have built around it. Truth is, this has never been about the murders, nor the killer nor his victims. It's about us, about our minds and how they dance.&quot;<br />Moore's &quot;solving&quot; of the crime is no solution at all. Of course, for the purpose of the story, there is an identified murderer, a minor historical figure who actually existed. Moore admits, though, that as clever as his story is made to fit together, it is only a story, and we are no closer to truth than Scotland Yard was originally. This doesn't detract from the solidity and factuality on which _From Hell_ is based. Moore's appendices are full of glorious detail on Freemasonry, architecture, prostitution, police procedures, and of course, the murders themselves. He has great fun bringing on cameos by Queen Victoria, John Merrick (The Elephant Man), Aleister Crowley, Frank Miles, Oscar Wilde, and more; this is the perfect medium to depict such visits. He is careful to show just where judicious speculation and fancy and fact are separated in these pages. Indeed, he has done so much research it has baffled him; about a minor fact, he writes, &quot;I know it's in one of the books that currently surround me in teetering mounds, but its precise whereabouts remain elusive. Either take my word for it or come round to do my housework for me.&quot;<br />_From Hell_ is less about the crime's solution than it is about how we make history and what we make of historians. It has plenty of melodrama, and gore, but it also has social commentary, giving strong condemnation of how the titled Londoners shared the streets with the destitute, and how women were maltreated at the time (not just by a particular murderer). In one chapter, the morning rituals of Sir William Withey Gull, physician to the royal family, are contrasted side-by-side to those of Annie Chapman, the second of the Ripper's victims. The misogyny is most strongly illustrated by a page of various men gleefully forging threatening letters supposedly from the Ripper.

It comes as a surprise to learn, then, that they were essentially confirming the work of a scientist of the early twentieth century, the first to study the aurora and to get the explanation right.  It was a stunning scientific achievement, accomplished with the sort of icy adventure one associates with polar explorers, and he accomplished a good deal of other original work, too, but the name of Kristian Birkeland is almost unknown.  It is a good thing that we now have _The Northern Lights: The True Story of the Man Who Unlocked the Secrets of the Aurora Borealis_ (Knopf) by Lucy Jago.<br />Jago starts with a harrowing description of Birkeland's expeditions to northern observatories to get data, told with a novelist's skill.  He needed the data to confirm his intuitions that the lights were due to the magnetic activity of the sun.  If this weren't enough, Birkeland then went to the lab to design a series of vacuum chambers which could reproduce in miniature the solar system and could demonstrate the aurora artificially.  His work, however, was barely mentioned in England, and then unfavorably.  Birkeland's ideas confounded a unanimous opinion of British scientists, and the Royal Society, that space was a vacuum and nothing more; Lord Kelvin himself had decreed that the sun could have no effect on geomagnetic activity.  Jago speculates that the slowness of acceptance of Birkeland's ideas set back auroral and geomagnetic physics by fifty years.  Confirming his ideas so that even the British scientific establishment would have to accept them set Birkeland to thinking of a grand plan of several observatories around the Arctic which could do such things as triangulation to get a better picture of where the lights were.  Such a plan would take a great deal of money.  One of the strengths of Jago's biography is that she has told a good deal about Birkeland's drive for finance.  He was granted various patents, including the one for pulling nitrogen out of the air to make fertilizer, the one that made him rich.<br />Birkeland's dedication to his work took its toll on his health and his personal life.  A late marriage was short-lived, and he descended into paranoia, probably fueled by overuse of alcohol and barbiturates to calm some sort of mania.  He was successful in his financial dealings, but they brought him into conflict with the director of Norsk Hydro, who may have betrayed Birkeland out of a Nobel Prize.  However, Birkeland was  a likeable absentminded professor, drifting on walks between his tram stop and his office in a preoccupation of technical dreams.  He was unable to keep a diary, remember appointments, or attend to accounting principles.  He had the admirable trait of knowing how scientific knowledge was gained: &quot;You learn more from your mistakes than your victories,&quot; he once said cheerfully, after being thrown through the air by an unexpected massive spark.  He died in 1917, a minor scientific hero to his own Norway, but since his ideas have been confirmed by space exploration, his scientific stature has risen.  A crater on the Moon is named for him, and &quot;Birkeland Current&quot; is now the proper name for the vertical flow of electrical particles which cause the auroras.

A clever new word trades on the fear: &quot;Frankenfood,&quot; which hints that we are in danger of making some new Karloff-like fiend on the farm.  We make new species, the fear runs, and only God can do that; for those who don't believe in gods, there is the worry that this is hijacking evolution in a dangerous and unprecedented way.  Genetic engineering somehow violates our sensibilities about how the world ought to run.  And yet it shouldn't.  The subtitle of Sue Hubbell's book _Shrinking the Cat: Genetic Engineering Before We Knew About Genes_ (Houghton Mifflin Company) captures the idea well.  We have only in the last few years been splicing a snip of flounder gene into corn, say, but for millennia we have altered crops and domestic animals so that their genes are irrevocably changed.  Humans, bless their hearts, are going to try to figure things out and tinker with them.  Hubbell demonstrates that while it is untrue that we have nothing to worry about, we have altered other organisms to our advantage before, and have dealt with unexpected consequences from the alterations.  We are going to fiddle around with genes directly (as opposed to previous indirect fiddling), and we will do the same thing.<br />Only a few species are covered in the book to show how altered we have made them.  Cats were selected from individuals of wild stock who were less frightened of encountering humans, those who were small and controllable, and those who happened to be pretty.  Fearfulness, size, and markings are all controlled by genes, and thus, without gene splicing or recombinant technology, we began engineering the genes of the cat.  Silkworms have become so domesticated that they cannot flea from danger and placidly die if we do not hand them food.  Corn is so husked that its seeds could not disperse without our help.  Apples are cloned (grafted) because their genetics are too complicated and a tree from a seed bears fruit nothing like the apple that bore the seed.<br />Hubble has packed a small volume with much ancient lore and economics as well as explanations ranging from Mendel and multicaulismania (&quot;the dream of growing rich by growing silkworms&quot;) to Darwin and DNA.  She is an enthusiastic and lucid teacher, and includes personal and amusing stories that might hide just how much scientific information is expressed here.  She ponders our new capacity for direct genetic engineering and places it in a historical context.  It might not be persuasive to everyone who worries about Frankenfood, but her optimism is at least well-informed.  &quot;This is an interesting and hopeful time in which to live,&quot; she says, &quot;even more so to be born into.  Our grandchildren are lucky.&quot;ruit nothing like the apple that bore the seed.<br />Hubble has packed a small volume with much ancient lore and economics as well as explanations ranging from Mendel and multicaulismania (&quot;the dream of growing rich by growing silkworms&quot;) to Darwin and DNA.

In Latin, it says, \\"Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you.\\"  Within the crypt is the architect of St. Paul's, and what a monument he has, and how fitting.  But it is not hard, even oceans away from England, to look around and find something that Wren affected.  One of the great lessons of the fascinating _His Invention So Fertile: A Life of Christopher Wren_ (Oxford University Press) by Adrian Tinniswood is that Wren is not St. Paul's, although the cathedral may be regarded as the centerpiece of his life.  He was not even merely an architect.  Wren's astonishingly comprehensive genius reached into many fields, and he was an advocate to encourage the way we do science in the modern world.<br />It was obvious when Wren entered Wadham College at Oxford as a seventeen year old in 1649 that he had a mind directed toward inquiry and practicality - his favorite activity was designing sundials.  The two impulses would continue throughout his long life.  The \\"new science\\" of Francis Bacon was showing that experimentation was better than Aristotle at showing how the universe worked, and as a scientist, not as a builder, Wren initially found fame.  He made discoveries in astronomy and anatomy, and showed practical insights into lens grinding, water pumps, weaving, and submarine navigation.  He was a founding member of the Royal Society which propelled science forward in England in the ensuing centuries.  It is not surprising that this many-sided man would take an interest in architecture.  When London burned in 1666, he was the first with a plan to rebuild the city (nine days after the fire), and although the plan was too ambitious, its centerpiece, the new St. Paul's, became his to work on for over three decades.  He had one chapel finished in Cambridge at the time, and a theater under construction in Oxford; before he was appointed architect of St. Paul's, this was his entire architectural portfolio.<br />Tinniswood has given us a big, thorough biography of an imposing intellect.  The facts of Wren's endeavors must remain as the only real illumination to his personality, because much of his personal life is hidden.  He died at age 91, and had many fights with lesser minds in order to bring his vision of St. Paul's into being.  He succeeded, but it might have been that the battles made him look back with regret as death approached.  He concluded that by being appointed Surveyor General he had been condemned \\"to spend all his time in Rubbish.\\"  He mean such rubbish as the Royal Hospitals at Greenwich and Chelsea, the Trinity College library, or the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.  At the end he lamented that he had eventually let architecture sap his time from being a professional scientist.  Wren did leave behind a scientific legacy, and one cannot second guess history, but read this fine biography and know that he made the right choice.s his entire architectural portfolio.<br />Tinniswood has given us a big, thorough biography of an imposing intellect.

He concluded that by being appointed Surveyor General he had been condemned \\"to spend all his time in Rubbish.\\"  He mean such rubbish as the Royal Hospitals at Greenwich and Chelsea, the Trinity College library, or the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.  At the end he lamented that he had eventually let architecture sap his time from being a professional scientist.  Wren did leave behind a scientific legacy, and one cannot second guess history, but read this fine biography and know that he made the right choice.	2001-12-24

If you had asked an American politician in the post-Revolutionary period, it seems he might have replied, \\"My honor.\\"  After all, this is the bunch that pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to the new endeavor of a republic, and honor was sacred to them in a way that we do not regard it now.  That is not to say that we (and our politicians) are less honorable these days, but rather that honor had a special culture and meaning in the new nation that it no longer has.  This is the main theme of _Affairs of Honor: National Politics in the New Republic_ (Yale University Press) by Joanne B. Freeman, a surprising look at the codes of honor of that time and how they changed history.<br />The main players are familiar to us all (Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Burr), and Freeman has drawn on the diaries and notebooks of many who had supporting roles.  Politics was at least partially a means to improve the reputations of the participants and to demonstrate their honor.  An attack on the reputation of a political opponent and his rebuttal were the ways the game was played.  The use of the written word had such power that that politicians were careful about what medium to use.  They might use personal letters among small circles of friends to give the lie to an accuser.  They might use pamphlets, or anonymous broadsides.  Dishonor in print was not only seen as a present infliction of insult, but a damnation of a reputation in history, and fear of history's judgement led Adams, Jefferson, and others to bring an outpouring of autobiographical apologias toward the ends of their lives.  The use of such measures in print and eventual duels were, according to the code, by gentlemen against gentlemen; it was dishonorable to use them against a social inferior.  Against, say, a newspaper editor, a gentleman used a cane or a tweak of the nose.<br /><br />It is significant that no one paid more punctilious attention to the demands of honor than Aaron Burr.  Freeman suggests even that in the disputed election of 1800 he was more honorable than Jefferson, who may have engaged in a ploy to mislead a critical congressman to break a deadlock.  After Burr had lost the election to Jefferson, he was particularly alert to attacks on his character.  When offended, a final time, by Hamilton, Burr would have seen himself as having no option but one.  His second in the famous duel wrote that if Burr had dropped the affair, his friends \\"must have considered him as a man, not possessing sufficient firmness to defend his own character, and consequently unworthy of their support.\\"  Freeman demonstrates that understanding honor is essential to understanding Burr and all the men around him.  She also explains that institutionalized parties altered for good the political dynamic of individual honor.  The period when the code of honor was in force was a particular time when the new nation had not clearly thrown off ideals of aristocracy inherited from the old country.  Freeman's book represents a new and instructive way of looking at the history of a vital period.ditor, a gentleman used a cane or a tweak of the nose.<BR> <BR>It is significant that no one paid more punctilious attention to the demands of honor than Aaron Burr.

That so few things really are unique is precisely what gives the word its power.  _Unique_'s veracity has been shaved away by phrases such as _practically unique_, _virtually unique_, _somewhat unique_, _most unique_, and so on, which truthfully mean _not_ unique.  This is not to say that the products or positions or people being touted are not notable, special, exceptional, fabulous, marvelous, worthy, or rare, but it is highly unlikely that they are in fact unique.&quot;<br />This is not a grammar book, but one which looks at current shoddy word use as a human foible: &quot;It is sometimes innocent, sometimes lazy, sometimes well intended, but most often it is a trick we play on ourselves to make the unremarkable seem important... Junk English is the linguistic equivalent of junk food - ingest it long enough and your brain goes soft.&quot;  Smith's book is a compilation of examples which he has spotted in print or broadcast, and he has obviously a good ear and eye for them; Smith admits that he uses such phrases, just as everyone does, and reading this book is an exercise in humility, for sometimes only after Smith points out a common usage does it seem junk.  For instance, under the section &quot;People Reduction,&quot; Smith points out that &quot;people&quot; and &quot;person&quot; are disappearing from usage, replaced by &quot;individual&quot; or &quot;individuals.&quot;  Even worse, we have become not people, but consumers: &quot;The nearly inescapable _consumers_ has become a cold synonym for many more accurate and human terms.  We are gradually being turned into creatures whose only defining characteristic is that we shop: 'Consumers should check their medicine cabinet once a year for medications that are expired or are no longer being used.'&quot;  In a section on &quot;Free-for-all-verbs&quot;, doesn't point out that for years some people have &quot;gifted&quot; presents to others, but his examples go from the almost acceptable &quot;The parents took it upon themselves to see to it that all the kids were journaling every day&quot; to the completely horrid &quot;We're efforting to work this out.&quot;  A relatively new verb &quot;privatize&quot; means to make a previously governmental function into a business to make money.  Everyone likes privacy, and everyone likes smaller government, so there has been a popular push to privatize, but would you not think twice before sending your child to a school run as a business to make money?  It is one of the many examples of Orwellian Newspeak in the book; it would be more honest, Smith shows, to create the word &quot;profitize.&quot;<br />It's a darned shame that _Junk English_ is not going to be read by those copywriters and speechwriters who are the perpetrators of so many of the abuses catalogued herein.  It seems as if pomposity will always trump plainness.  Nonetheless, the book is instructive, and it will put those of us who care about words on our guard.  It is a deliberately short book, and so some of the atrocities that are your own pet peeves are likely to be omitted.  As a picture of how we are using and misusing English at the turn of the millennium, and as an entertaining and funny look at language in need of correction, Smith's book is unique.

You may have heard of some of the episodes contained in _Silent Night: The Story of the World War I Christmas Truce_ (Free Press) by Stanley Weintraub, but this is a recognized historian's review of the soldiers' truce, its origins, incidents, and effects, as well as reflections on what might have been if the truce had been allowed to hold.  It is such a sweet and sad tale full of paradoxes that I think any reader will shake his head in wonder over these pages at just what strange creatures these humans are.<br />It was the first Christmas within a world war, 1914.  All combatants claimed some version of Christianity as a majority religion, and all were thinking of the hearths of home rather than the routine of eating, sleeping, standing guard, and digging in the dripping, rat- and louse-infested, stinking trenches.  And then the German Christmas trees came out.  The _tannenbaum_ was so important to the German soldiers that trees were included within logistic supplies.  Gradually, warriors put up banners to wish the other side the best of the season, and began chants of carols, and under strictly forbidden flags of truce, they emerged into No Man's Land to meet their enemies.  They sang songs together.  The Germans shared their surfeit of beer, the English theirs of plum-and-apple jam.  One soldier wrote, &quot;Where they couldn't talk the language, they were making themselves understood by signs, and everyone seemed to be getting on nicely.  Here we were laughing and chatting to men whom only a few hours before we were trying to kill!&quot;  On Christmas day, soccer balls were produced, and fields laid out among the shell holes.  One soldier wrote that if someone had thought to supply 10,000 footballs at the time, that would have solved the war without bloodshed.<br /> It was not to be, of course.  This was a bottom-up truce, and commands on both sides insisted on renewal of hostilities.  Tradition and discipline demanded it, and just in case, various threats were put into play.  There was still good cheer on Christmas, and in some places on the following day, but eventually the sides parted and got back to business.  A rifleman remembered a German parting from him with, &quot;Today we have peace.  Tomorrow you fight for your country; I fight for mine.  Good luck.&quot;  Any hesitation about firing upon their temporary comrades evaporated when new troops were ordered in.  Anyone who reads this book will be struck with the question of &quot;What If...&quot; which is indeed the title of its last chapter.  This is a fine recounting of the unique episodes of a war that failed to end all wars.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, contemplating those candle-lit Christmas trees erected on the trenches wrote, &quot;It was an amazing spectacle, and must arouse bitter thought concerning those high-born conspirators against the peace of the world, who in their mad ambition had hounded such men on to take each other by the throat rather than by the hand.&quot;ught to supply 10,000 footballs at the time, that would have solved the war without bloodshed.<br /> It was not to be, of course.

Friedman.  Friedman has started with the ancient Egyptians, ended with Viagra, and all along has given an entertaining tale to show that we have always had trouble trying to figure out the role we should allow the penises among us (or the role that they will work out for themselves).  This is by no means an erotic or prurient volume, although it is an intensely amusing and interesting one.  There is power and passion here, relayed with unpretentious and lucid scholarship, and, oh, incidentally a history of western civilization.<br />In Sumerian and Egyptian religions, the gods boasted of the powers of their penises, which were engaged in digging irrigation ditches and ejaculating rivers, not to mention by sacred masturbation bringing the entire cosmos into being.  The Old Testament had a peculiar insistence that believers had to snip off a bit of penis and that only those with working penises could enter an assembly of the Lord.  The Romans had a high value on penises, big ones; a soldier with a big one might expect prompter promotions, and the Forum of Augustus may have had a ground plan layout of a phallus.  A disgust for penises was eventually and definitively expressed by St. Augustine.  Augustine had enjoyed using his own penis with various women until he had a conversion experience.  He then realized that spontaneous erections were the symbol of the powerlessness we had over the flesh, and that the penis was the agent which delivered the semen which contaminated every human with original sin.  The contrast with pagan beliefs could not have been greater; the engine of life and sacred staff had become the corrupter of all humankind.  Augustine used his phallic disgust to put Adam's fall and the supposed wickedness of sex into the center of our intellectual concerns.<br />There is a wonderful chapter here on what Freud and post-Freud societies thought about penises (&quot;These theories have taken as many shots as a rural road sign.&quot;).  There is one about how penises have affected racial stereotypes.  There is one about the use of the penis in feminist literature, especially the hostile writings which insist that penises are horrid battering rams used for the continuing domination of women.  Finally, there is a chapter on the &quot;medicalized&quot; penis.  All doctors are familiar with the longings of patients to have &quot;just a pill&quot; to take away problems; a weight-loss pill, for instance, is one of the most desired of non-existent medications.  There is a realistic concern that &quot;just a pill&quot; Viagra will paper over real problems of desire or lack of lovemaking skill.  Perhaps now the penis will be able to show less of a mind of its own than it used to.  Will this make a difference in how we regard it?  Friedman's fascinating book shows that always half of us have had penises, and all of us spend time thinking about them; and though they are doing the old universal in-out as always, changes in religion and in science ensure that every age has to come to grips with the penis in its own fashion.concerns.<br />There is a wonderful chapter here on what Freud and post-Freud societies thought about penises (&quot;These theories have taken as many shots as a rural road sign.&quot;).

Oliver Sacks has published wonderful stories of his interactions with his neurological patients, like _Awakenings_ and _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for His Hat_, combining scientific teaching with history and with a sincere humanity.  But there were times when the young Oliver went too far, and they are included in his fine memoir of his early years, _Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood_.  It is a lovable account of a curious boy and his eccentric relatives who had professions in various scientific fields or dabbled in them, and a personal history of discovering chemistry from alchemy to quanta  Anyone who has admired Sacks's previous work will find his latest one endearing and instructive.<br />Sacks was born in 1933 in London.  Both his parents were practicing physicians, and took him on house calls.  There was an atmosphere that encouraged interest in books, theater, and music, but mostly in science.  His Uncle Dave ran a company that made lightbulbs, and his admiration for and expertise in the tungsten which made the filaments made him known as Uncle Tungsten within the family.  Many of us had chemistry sets when we were growing up (and one of his chapters is &quot;Stinks and Bangs&quot;), but Sacks seems to have grown up inside one.  He was sent away from bomb-targeted London during the Blitz to a school in the midlands, a removal that scarred him in many ways.  When he returned, he began to do his own experiments in his laboratory (formerly a laundry room).  When the Science Museum opened again after the war, he had a religious vision when viewing its wall-sized periodic table; a two page reproduction of the table is within this book, an illustration of just how much chemistry, as well as memoir, that the book contains.  It also has capsule biographies of the chemists through history of whom young Oliver became a fan (not for him movie stars or footballers).<br />It is extremely strange that in a final chapter, &quot;The End of the Affair,&quot; Sacks tells of Oliver's turn away from chemistry.  To be sure, he had at an very young age mastered much of the field, but gradually at age 14 he began to turn away from it.  The uncertainty and acausality of quantum mechanics played a role, for he realized he was not stirred by the new chemistry as he was the historic version he had pursued.  His parents, loving and encouraging but not always understanding, started to show displeasure at his chemical expositions and influenced him more toward medicine.  (A demonstration of misguided influence is that his mother brought him home malformed fetuses to dissect, a task which disgusted him: &quot;She never perceived, I think, how distressed I became and probably imagined that I was as enthusiastic here as she was.&quot;)  Beautifully written, _Uncle Tungsten_ gives us plenty of chemistry, but also a fascinating portrait of an unusual family.  Sacks's loving understanding and sympathy for the young Oliver and his unusual upbringing has resulted in a yet another case study, just as humane as those of the other human specimens he has treated before, and deeply personal.Oliver became a fan (not for him movie stars or footballers).<br />It is extremely strange that in a final chapter, &quot;The End of the Affair,&quot; Sacks tells of Oliver's turn away from chemistry.

There is one question that tops the existential query, &quot;Where am I?&quot;  The question is, &quot;Where is the _Mona Lisa_?&quot;  This reflects the importance of this particular icon.  A famous cartoon in the _New Yorker_ made the matter sharper.  It showed a middle-aged American couple rushing into the Louvre and asking the guard: &quot;Which way to the _Mona Lisa_?  We're double-parked!&quot;  That's an exaggeration, but not much of one.  According to Donald Sassoon's _Becoming Mona Lisa: The Making of a Global Icon_ (Harcourt), the crowd around the masterpiece, some illegally taking flash pictures, is like a crowd around a pop star complete with paparazzi.  Sassoon has taken on the task of explaining how it is that this work has a reputation as The World's Most Beautiful Painting.  That title, of course, is arguable, but it is certainly the most famous painting, and how this came to be makes a great story.<br />Of course Mona is good-looking, but that doesn't explain it.  Leonardo painted other female portraits of handsomer women.  For centuries, _The Last Supper_ was his more famous work.  It was only when a cult of Leonardo rose among the romantics in the nineteenth century that his work loomed over that of, say, Michelangelo and Raphael, who were far more prolific and influential.  Leonardo was busy doing other stuff, and mostly failing.  His gadgets stayed on the page and his experiment with oils on the _Last Supper_ doomed it to precipitous decay.  In the romantic imagination of a century and a half ago, however, dreaming big and failing was heroic, and he looked the part, although his bearded, god-like visage is probably not the self-portrait everyone assumed.  Gautier and Pater wrote purple prose about the lady, and if she had hired a publicity agent, she could not have achieved greater success.  In 1911 she made headlines because she was stolen, and she has been a steady focus for fiction during the twentieth century.  Sasson has listed many, many references to her, such as Nat King Cole's famous song.<br />When in 1919 Marcel Duchamp drew a beard and goatee on a postcard of her, and exhibited this naughty French postcard under a saucy title, he continued a trend of including Mona in popular art, something that Malevich, Dali, Magritte, and Warhol have all done as well.  There are good send-ups and bad, some that expand our ideas of the realm of this icon, and some that are just gross.  All get included in this remarkably inclusive and wide-ranging book.  Witty and lucid, it is not so much about a painting as it is about fashions and history, and the role chance plays in our search for objects of fame.on during the twentieth century.

They remain the only Americans to get the death penalty for spying in peacetime, which indicates the extraordinary nature of their case.  Current spies might expect prison at worst, and possibly a country club prison at that.  The Cold War is over, and we have new fears, but an examination of the fifty-year-old case is welcome.  _The Brother: The Untold Story of Atomic Spy David Greenglass and How He Sent His Sister, Ethel Rosenberg, to the Electric Chair_ (Random House) by Sam Roberts gives a surprising, fresh view of the case.  Roberts can rightly claim that this is an &quot;untold story&quot; because after years of persistence, he was able to find Greenglass, living under a different identity, and conduct interviews.  True to the nature of a disreputable stoolpigeon, Greenglass started singing for a fee.<br />Greenglass, a member of the Communist Party, somehow got assigned to work on the Manhattan Project after being drafted in 1943.  His brother-in-law Julius Rosenberg persuaded Greenglass's wife Ruth to talk to him about supplying atomic secrets, and David agreed.  He got paid for the information.  When the FBI nailed him, he was ready to implicate Julius.  When Ruth implicated Ethel, days before the trial, David changed his testimony to corroborate his wife's, always cooperating in order to keep Ruth from getting charged.  Playing the wife card again, the feds attempted to get information on Julius's contacts by charging Ethel and then holding the death penalty over her.  The idea was that Julius would sing in order to keep Ethel alive for their two young sons.  This seems immoral today, and indeed, it is now illegal to use the death penalty as coercion towards cooperation.  The eagerness that the feds had to execute the Rosenbergs proved to be a gigantic misjudgment.  Communist sympathizers the world over took advantage of the Rosenbergs' plight, especially of the electrocution looming over Ethel.  The Rosenbergs were more valuable as martyrs than any information about bombs which Greenglass had stolen.<br />It is certainly controversial that Greenglass is getting paid for his participation in interviews, but the new information seems worth it.  Greenglass had no say in what was going to be written in the book, and could not tell what was to be in it until it was printed; the picture Roberts paints is far from flattering.  Remarkably, his wife did not know of his participation in the interviews before the book was published.  Roberts has gone to other previously unavailable sources as well, and the story is fascinating.  There were serious mistakes made in the trial, well detailed here, and as a result the controversy about the outcome will never be settled.  Roberts often gives details that aptly summarize the era; for instance, an FBI account of Ethel's arrest says that she &quot;made a typical Communist remonstrance, demanding a warrant and the right to call an attorney.&quot;  There are other candidates for the nomination of &quot;Trial of the Century,&quot; but it is hard to top this one.  If it does not measure up to a laudable presentation of gathering of evidence, prosecution, and execution, and was eventually more comfort to our enemies than to ourselves, we might, living under the threat of terrorist attacks fifty years later, learn useful lessons here about excessive government zeal.especially of the electrocution looming over Ethel.

It's the lines of ants that are really fascinating, and the colonies that really get things done.  An ant by itself is not only a speck, it is a humble one, capable of little.  It isn't just a matter of getting a lot of ants together so that by sheer numbers they multiply what one ant can do.  Ants organize.  They communicate.  They have tasks, they assign workers, they shift assignments as old jobs get done and new ones come up.  We have tried to understand this sort of organization in our own way.  To get such things done ourselves, we would have to have a leader and subleaders, and in trying to understand ants, we even attributed to the queen of the ant colony a sort of CEO status.  She isn't, of course; she is an egg-laying machine, but she is deep in the darkest parts of the colony, and has no idea about what her workers are doing or how to respond to quality assurance suggestions.  She is not the chief of the bureaucracy of the ant colony.  Something else is.  Who is giving the orders?<br />No one.  The ants are self-organizing, according to Steven Johnson, whose bright book _Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software_ (Scribner) is obviously not just about ants.  Ants are just an easy example.  Johnson's book is full of satisfying analogies.  Take your brain, for instance.  Those neurons don't know anything.  Each one is capably of firing when stimulated, and that's about it.  &quot;No individual neuron is sentient,&quot; Johnson writes, &quot;and yet somehow the union of billions of neurons creates self-awareness.&quot;  Adam Smith posited an &quot;invisible hand&quot; which set the prices in economic systems, some supply and demand force that was completely free of any sort of conscious human control (just as the slime cells didn't have a higher authority).  It wasn't planned, it just happened because of the number of independent actors on the economic stage.  The immune system possessed by each of us gets smarter over the years as its biochemical parts share information, and it responds with individualized defenses, but it isn't conscious and it has no memory.  The host and hostess of that last party you went to didn't decree that everyone would gather in the kitchen, but it happened anyway.  Though cities may have a government, no one has told them to set up offices in the center, and branch off into suburbs and malls around them, and no one designed individual neighborhoods to be havens for artists or for homosexuals.  The silicon circuits in a handheld computer can't do much but flop on and off, but they can learn your handwriting with remarkable skill.  Other electronic stupids at Amazon.com can tell from what you have ordered what might appeal to you in the future, and offer up &quot;your&quot; selections with much more skill than an ad designed for everyone could possibly do.<br />Emergence is being used in video games, and undoubtedly will be a larger part of the software we interact with every day.  There have, up to now, only been primitive and clumsy attempts to allow web sites and browsing to feed back on themselves in some emergent fashion to give users quicker access to just the site they had been long looking for.  Couch potatoes, too, would make great ants, since there are so many of them and they could be simply connected with minimal feedback systems, with emergent miniseries and music videos as a result.  When Johnson enters the ring as a prophet, one can only allow that his schemes might come to pass and we will have to wait and see.  But in explaining a natural system (followed by a technological one) which has been present since before our neurons organized themselves but which has been appreciated by that organization only in the last few decades, Johnson displays enthusiasm and didactic skill.  Some are hailing his book as a milestone on the path to the future, and maybe it is, but perhaps more important, it is an exhilarating and instructive course in a current trend of thought.rating and instructive course in a current trend of thought.	2001-11-20

The contents will be best enjoyed by former midshipmen, but those who know little about Academy life will get to learn something of what the middies put up with.  This is especially true of descriptions of fourth class (freshman) or \\"Plebe\\" year, which seem to be disproportionately represented here.  My own memory (I am '72) of that year is really rather miserable and not much fun at all.  The accounts here are generally upbeat, brightened, I suppose, by many years of chipping away by selective memories.  There is a useful glossary which includes some of the tortures upperclassmen used to put us through, like \\"Shoving out: Positioning one's self in a sitting position without the aid of a chair; also referred to as sitting on infinity.\\"  (...)<br />The most surprising thing about this volume is how similar the tales from fifty years back are to my own memories or to the more recent classes.  Mids were always, it seems, crawling down the steam pipe alleys underneath Tecumseh, zipping back just under the wire at curfew, and thinking up get rich quick schemes.  The great difference in stories, those with no precedent, are those that involve female midshipmen or officers.  Just a hint of sexual scandal is included in these pages.<br />However, an episode like rolling a bowling ball into the Rotunda through the ranks of the Watch Squad while it was in formation is a unique and classic prank for which a member of the class of '63 takes credit (for a \\"mystery bowler,\\" of course).  This tale was a legend even when I was there, and long may it and the other jolly stories in this book be retold and grow in the telling.	2001-11-13

Ashbee had a Jekyll-and-Hyde existence as a successful London businessman, travel writer, and paterfamilias.  He also tended his huge collection of pornography.  It was so large a collection that he rented rooms in Gray's Inn especially to contain it (and perhaps to keep it from being a family concern).  Ashbee was no supporter of the suffragettes, but he liked the idea that women took pleasure in sex and could actively participate in it, ideas that were unfashionable or obscene at the time.  In his own writing, Ashbee railed that &quot;the English nation possesses an ultra-squeamishness and hyper-prudery peculiar to itself.&quot;  He was furious that missionaries were trying to intrude this morality into societies where sexuality was more open.<br />It is clear that Ashbee's books ridicule these notions, even when Ashbee made it seem that he was supporting them.  He is the author of three books, magnificently produced private editions cataloging his own books and those he was interested in.  The titles give away his game: _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_ (&quot;Index of Books Worthy of Being Prohibited,&quot; mocking the Vatican's own catalogue, 1877), _Centuria Librorum Absconditorum_ (&quot;A Hundred Books Worthy of Being Hidden Away,&quot; 1879) and _Catena Librorum Tacendorum_ (&quot;String of Books Worthy of Being Silenced,&quot; 1885).  Ashbee produced his volumes under his scatological penname Pisanus Fraxi; he seems to have enjoyed rebuses of his name, and Pisanus Fraxi is an anagram of the Latin words for &quot;ash&quot; and &quot;bee.&quot;<br />When it is known that Gibson has produced this biography after being allowed the first glance at Ashbee's diary, one might expect that there would be many personal revelations.  Sadly, with some exceptions which Gibson quotes, the diary is discontinuous, and mostly dull.  Ashbee was too busy reading and buying books to spend much time on a diary.  If Gibson is to be believed, he spent a good deal of time writing _My Secret Life_, too.  The final third of _The Erotomaniac_ is an amusing list of correspondences of style, phraseology, and philosophy between the writings of Pisanus Fraxi and those of the &quot;Walter&quot; who wrote _My Secret Life_.  Gibson allows that someday electronic scansion of the texts may make the identification more positive (and perhaps someone will pay literary sleuth Don Foster, of _Author Unknown_, to take the case).  To me, the most compelling evidence is that Ashbee's volumes all have an obsessively inclusive index, just as &quot;Walter's&quot; book hilariously does.  Under the gerund form of the most shocking verb in English, Walter has seven columns of entries, including: in masks / wheelbarrow fashion / modesty hinders complete pleasure / is the great humanizer / in a grotto / in cabs / in a church / in a calf shed / in a cow shed / against trees.  On and on the list goes, a tribute to someone obsessed with sex, with lists, and with compilations.  As Gibson says, if Ashbee didn't write it, who on Earth did?  Gibson's own book, meticulously researched and genially entertaining, has just about as much of Ashbee as we will ever know, as well as genuine insights into Victorian times and morals.uld be many personal revelations.

Seen any effects of demons?  Maybe not, but you have much better chances of seeing them now rather than before 1973 when _The Exorcist_ came out.  Before that time, well, yes, there were exorcisms.  Jesus is supposed to have done them, and told his followers to do them, so one would think that we are only riding our part of a 2,000 year old tradition.  In America, though, exorcisms were essentially nonexistent until the mid-seventies.  Can it be that all the demons were waiting on Hollywood to release a movie they could be proud of before they started infesting everyone?  Michael W. Cuneo, who teaches sociology and anthropology, is an &quot;open-minded skeptic,&quot; and he doesn't find that this is the best explanation.  In _American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in The Land of Plenty_ (Doubleday), he offers the disturbing idea that the popular entertainment industry has manipulated religious beliefs and behavior.  He explains that not everyone will see _The Exorcist_ and be compelled to look up his local exorcist for treatment, but with millions seeing it, only a small percentage need to start taking exorcism as fact before it becomes some sort of social movement.<br />It is a movement with plenty of people behind it and many variations.  There is the Roman Catholic version, which seems to be the sine qua non of exorcisms, the one that is featured in movies and whose enthusiasts get the most time on talk shows.  At a charismatic service,  Cuneo sees a gentleman freed of the demons of shame, rejection, sexual perversion, and so on, with no big drama except for his coughing and jerking his head.  &quot;The whole business is orderly and efficient... a calm, controlled, almost decorous procedure.&quot;  If you are looking for something more dramatic, you might take up what Cuneo calls the &quot;rough and ready school&quot; of exorcism.  Those being exorcised do plenty of dramatic stuff, fighting, swearing, spitting, and vomiting.  In the church auditorium where Cuneo saw this done, there were ample supplies of paper towels and plastic bags for clean up.<br />Cuneo has seen all different kinds of exorcism, and is willing to accept that exorcism can work, at least by means of the placebo effect.  He is also clear that it can kill people; enthusiastic exorcists have pummeled and poisoned and suffocated those they thought were possessed, only to rid them of their lives, not their demons.  And on the big question, Cuneo is far more tentative than I am, even without his experience.  Does it really drive out demons?  He maintains he doesn't know.  In every exorcism he saw, &quot;nothing happened - nothing that reached out and grabbed me by the throat.  At the exorcisms I attended, there were no spinning heads, no levitating bodies, no voices from beyond the grave.  (There was plenty of vomiting, no question about it, but nothing more impressive that what you'd probably catch most Saturday nights out behind your local bar.)&quot;  It is clear he has tried to be fair throughout his wittily-written and entertaining book, but he has given sufficient evidence that there is little in the world of exorcism that is better explained by demons than by simple human idiosyncrasy.ch auditorium where Cuneo saw this done, there were ample supplies of paper towels and plastic bags for clean up.  <br />Cuneo has seen all different kinds of exorcism, and is willing to accept that exorcism can work, at least by means of the placebo effect.

It wasn't the original job of gargoyles to be fun.  One of the explanations of how gargoyles got into their exalted positions in churches is that they were placed there to entice pagans to come and worship at Christian locales.  Those who ran the churches thought that pagan symbols, and scary ones at that, were a good marketing ploy.  Perhaps we American moderns are simply amused by carvings of fearsome dragons, but there are plenty of gargoyles shown here that are deliberately humorous caricatures.<br />The pictures are a treat.  This is not a big, coffee-table book, but there are scores of pictures from many American sacred, commercial, and academic buildings.  Though American gargoyles reflect the traditions of Europe, many are truly American.  The University of Pennsylvania, for instance, has a strictly medieval style of quadrangle, complete with gargoyles, but one of them is a football player.  At Washington National Cathedral, there is a gargoyle showing a crooked politician; he has horns, a big belly, a cigar, and a pocket full of dollar bills.  There are a pair of gargoyles there which were given by a grandmother in thanks for her two grandsons.  One is angelic and one is demonic, and she never said which is which; the grandsons are now grown up and still don't know.  A weeping sea turtle is there as a statement of environmental protection.  Out of the mouth of a monstrous duck stares a tourist with a camera, a payback from the carver who was the subject of thousands of pictures as he worked.<br />_American Gargoyles_ could have been a lot bigger, but Crist has included a reading list for those who want to see more.  It is a good-looking and informative book.	2001-11-12

And almost no outsider has gone up to the far northern reaches of the country, where it shares borders with India, Tibet, and western China.  Alan Rabinowitz has been, and has played a role for the good of the region and for all the world.  He tells about that role in _Beyond the Last Village: A Journey of Discovery in Asia's Forbidden Wilderness_ (Island Press).  It is an intensely personal story about important human and ecological issues.<br />Rabinowitz has been an explorer and an expert in setting up nature reserves in other places, but he was amazed to find the hunters dealing in body parts of rare animals, mostly in trade with China for salt.  In expeditions by foot that sound as tough as the ones Victorian explorers had to face, he was able to come to terms with hunters, planning a park system that would encourage hunters to benefit from the study and the conservation of wildlife, rather than the commercial disposal of it; such a system ran, at least partially, on salt as a reward to the former hunters, making wildlife more valuable alive than dead.  He also had to try to deal with the bureaucracy of the Myanmar government, which seems stranger than most such institutions.  Strangely, Christian proselytizing in the area, teaching that all animals were placed here for our use, was a serious obstacle to be overcome.<br />It is often his attempts to connect with those of other cultures that are the most moving parts of this book.  For Rabinowitz, connecting has not been easy.  He still has the stutter that crippled him as a child, and his book has flashbacks of his upbringing and the difficulty of dealing with parents whom he blamed for it and who blamed themselves.  He has openly described the difficulties being an explorer has posed within his marriage, and the strain between him and his wife caused by his absences and of the miscarriages they had to go through.  The journey through Myanmar was for him also a personal journey dealing with his childhood, being a husband, and becoming a father.  He succeeded in sparking a wildlife reserve that is something we can all profit from, but his success in fighting his own personal demons is laid out here as well.  With good humor, astute observation, passion, and candor, Rabinowitz has provided a book of exotic travel, and something far more.The journey through Myanmar was for him also a personal journey dealing with his childhood, being a husband, and becoming a father.

Kertzer has mined church documents of the past two centuries (many of which, to its credit, the church allowed him access) to demonstrate inarguably that the church of into the early twentieth century was insisting on Jewish racial inferiority, perfidy, and sociopathy.  It insisted on ghettoes and special clothing for Jews.  It revived ancient legends of how the Talmud ordered Jews to mix the blood of tortured Christians (especially children) into the Passover matzah.<br />Such reading is distasteful, but Kertzer is an expert at letting facts speak for themselves, without rage or pedantry.  This was true also of his excellent previous book, _The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara_, which told how Pius IX took a boy from his Jewish family because a Christian servant had supposedly baptized the child years before.  The kidnapping gets a few pages in the current book, which is a much larger and more impressive scholarly feat.  The examples which he gives are unassailable.  Pope Leo XIII, for instance, never objected to the anti-Dreyfus campaign of _La Croix_, the daily newspaper of the Assumptionist Fathers who especially criticized the attempts to reverse Dreyfus's rigged conviction.  Indeed, his official newspaper _L'Osservatore Romano_ insisted on Dreyfus's guilt, and literally defended the anti-Semitism of the mobs &quot;attempting to rehabilitate a traitor,&quot; because &quot;... we find the betrayal of one's country has been Jewishly conspired and Jewishly executed.&quot;  The pope did, however, become distressed by the vehemence of the anti-Dreyfusards, and the paper changed its tone dramatically upon the retrial in 1899, but in a few weeks, it was reporting on the &quot;Judaic ritual murder&quot; of a little boy in Hungary whose blood had been drained by the Jews.  Pius X refused to intervene in a Kiev trial of a Jew on the charge of ritual murder in 1913.  The administration of Pius X (whose secretariat of state was one of the distributors of the rabidly anti-Semitic forgery _The Protocols of the Elders of Zion_) would not deny the myth, allowing it to continue unchecked.<br />This is a revolting record which Kertzer has exhaustively analyzed and set out.  It is certainly true that the church for the past four decades has admitted anti-Semitic wrongdoing and mea culpas, even though it cannot officially acknowledge the role which Kertzer has documented.  Anti-Semitism is now anathema to most Catholics and most Christians.  But Kertzer has made clear that the sorry history of Catholic prejudices against the Jews was resurrected from its medieval roots when the church wanted to be on its guard against change, against freedom of religion or freedom of the press, or against loss of the Papal States.  Thus when fascists came to power they could insist they were doing merely as the church had done.  The Italian Catholic press and Church authorities had warned of the harm done by giving the Jews equal rights, and Mussolini's anti-Jewish campaign could point out that even the Jesuits had for four centuries denied membership to any man with Jewish ancestry as far back five generations.

Magical Numbers in Nature_ (W. H. Freeman), Ian Stewart has managed to write a wonderfully comprehensive and colorful mathematical tour of the universe from top to bottom without putting a single equation into his book.  In fact, there aren't really many numbers.  He gets to show what happens when a mathematician looks at the infinite aspects of the world.  He writes, &quot;I am a mathematician.  I experience these wonders through a mind that has spent a lifetime learning how to detect patterns, how to understand patterns, how to find new patterns... I stand on the shoulders (and lean on the elbows) of giants, on five thousand years of mathematical history that has been groping toward such understanding.  I see what all humans see, and in a few respects perhaps I see more.  I see clues to rules, laws, regularities.&quot;<br />The snowflake is key to his tour, and there is plenty to learn specifically from it, but since Stewart is keen to draw on patterns all over the place, the range of his book is amazing.  In well connected chapters, looking closely at snowflakes takes him to the leafy patterns of frost on the window, the organization of leaves around spirals and Fibonacci numbers, the spiral of the nautilus shell, the stripes and amazing triangle patterns on other sea shells, the patterns of stripes on zebras and fish, the grooves in sand dunes and the lines of dunes themselves, the lines a sidewinder leaves in the sand, the synchrony of a millipede's legs and a horse's at different gaits, the oscillations of the legs of robots, the ups and downs of animal populations, the chaotic variations of weather and of the planets in the solar system, and the shape of the universe.  It is clear that Stewart sees connections everywhere, and is only using the snowflake as an excuse to look at the foundations of physical laws, the nature of time, space, and matter, and why patterns in one field give clues to patterns in something entirely different.  &quot;I'm going on a journey in search of the snowflake's secret,&quot; he says, &quot;and, with it, the deeper secrets of our astonishing universe.  And you're coming with me.&quot;  It's a beguiling invitation from a masterful guide.<br />Naturally a tour of this type, with all it encompasses, is not going to be long on detail, and anyway, one would have to start getting into equations for that.  There is a useful list for further reading at the back of the book, for those who insist on stronger doses of such stuff.  Stewart's book, however, is an exhilarating, accessible, vividly illustrated voyage through classic and current mathematical ideas.  By the end of it, a reader will understand that the snowflake's shape is determined by phase transition, bifurcation, symmetry-breaking, chaos, fractals, and other complexities.

For many, this will be a first introduction to Dr. Hugo Eckener, a remarkable airman who did more for the zeppelins than Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin himself. Eckener was a journalist and private scholar who wrote of the crash of one of Zeppelin's early models, and was critical of the endeavor.  Zeppelin called upon Eckener in 1906 to explain what improvements were going to be made, and then invited him to dinner, and Eckener was convinced.  Eckener was a brilliant publicist first of all, and under his influence Zeppelin became a German folk hero whose magnificent machines embodied German pride and industrial skill.<br />The ships proved unreliable militarily, but between  the world wars, the zeppelin became a sensation.  The centerpiece of this book is the now all-but-forgotten record-breaking flight of the _Graf Zeppelin_ in 1929.  Christened in memory of the count the year before, the ship was a product of Eckener's enthusiasm and all the improvements accumulated by trial and error in the previous decades.  Eckener knew his ship well, and had become a master of meteorological observation and prediction.  He had seen the eagerness with which his countrymen greeted the huge ship whenever it approached their cities, and he wanted to extend the prestige of his downtrodden country into the world.  There was no better way to do this than a feat that could be undertaken by no other craft than his own _Graf_: the first-ever passenger flight around the world.  Funding was offered by William Randolph Hearst, who was prepared to pay for most of the bills in return for rights to the story; his reporter, Lady Grace Hay-Drummond-Hay, a star journalist for the Hearst papers, was the only woman on the flight, and showed herself as having as much pluck and courage during it as any of the other passengers or crew.  There were twenty paying passengers ($9,000 per ticket) and forty-one crew.  Much of the other funding for the expedition came from the sales of special zeppelin stamps and first day covers during the voyage.  It was a luxurious voyage, but often a dangerous one, and Botting tells his story well.<br />The disadvantages of zeppelins eventually ensured that they would be overtaken by the airplane.  They were much more at the mercy of the weather than ships or planes.  And as the _Hindenberg_ showed, there was always the danger that all that hydrogen would explode.  Eckener himself, however, blamed Hitler, for whom he had nothing but disgust.  Eventually Dr. Eckener's beloved _Graf_ was scraped, the metal to go into traditional aircraft to fight the war.  Botting is clear about Eckener's dream: it was little more than a dream, and a failed one at that.  There are, however, good dreams and bad ones, and Eckener's dream was a sweet reality for a short span, many years ago, beautifully recounted in an absorbing book.as having as much pluck and courage during it as any of the other passengers or crew.

In the eighteenth century, he was a figure of considerable esteem, as the new American nation prided itself on its inventiveness and its new ways of doing things.  Perhaps few kids or adults could now name this once-exalted inventor, and that is too bad, for his invention shaped the new nation in ways that still affect us.  A new biography, _The Fire of His Genius: Robert Fulton and the American Dream_ (Free Press) by Kirkpatrick Sale, throws light on Fulton and his invention (or inventions, for he was a constant tinkerer).  It also shows him to be one of the most peculiar and self-destructive of inventive men.<br />Brought up in want, Fulton became apprenticed to a jeweler, and learned to paint portraits.  He got money somehow, and went to England to improve his painting skills, and did indeed exhibit portraits at the Royal Academy.  More importantly, he was fascinated by the British system of canals, and invented a gadgets having to do with them.  In France, he tinkered with submarines and naval mines.  Back at home on the Hudson, he did the work that made him famous.  He made a maiden voyage in 1807 from New York City to Albany, 32 hours in the steamboat _North River_.  (It was not the _Clermont_, an error in Fulton's first biography that has been reproduced in countless textbooks.)  On the very return trip, he took paying passengers.  Though Fulton's boats had a superb record for safety, they caused alarm in those who had never seen anything like them.  One spectator wrote that when villagers saw this &quot;strange dark-looking craft... some imagined it to be a sea-monster, whilst others did not hesitate to express their belief that it was a sign of the approaching judgment.&quot;  Although commercially successful, he spent a great deal of time defending his controversial patent rights and trying to maintain boating monopolies.  If he had spent that time improving his products (which were, indeed, superior boats) and arranging for more commercial incursions into such lucrative markets as the Mississippi River (where steamboats forged the most change), he probably would have been richer, happier, and more famous.<br />Sale has taken such facts as are available and with welcome rhetorical flourishes has built a novelistic and satisfying portrait of an enigmatic man.  He places both Fulton and the steamboat in a larger history, and just as he is enlightening about the darker or shallower parts of Fulton's character, he is ready to tell about the casualties of the steamboat, such as the Indians or the forests.  It is true that America is vastly different because Fulton came along.  Mark Twain, who certainly ought to know, wrote &quot;He made the vacant oceans and idle rivers useful, after the unprejudiced had been wondering for years what they were for.&quot;products (which were, indeed, superior boats) and arranging for more commercial incursions into such lucrative markets as the Mississippi River (where steamboats forged the most change), he probably would have been richer, happier, and more famous.<br />Sale has taken such facts as are available and with welcome rhetorical flourishes has built a novelistic and satisfying portrait of an enigmatic man.

She was approaching marriage, and she knew that for guys, the accepted ritual was to have an anticipatory bachelor party, quite possibly including entertainment by a dancer or a stripper.  &quot;It's a time-honored way of saying, 'Goodbye to all that.'&quot;  That's all fine for the soon-to-be-former bachelor.  Burana's quandary: &quot;But what does a former stripper do when _she's_ about to get married?&quot;  There may be no set answer for this one, but for Burana, the answer was, start stripping again, do it everywhere you can, and write your heart out about it.  A wonderful book has resulted, _Strip City: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across America_ (Talk Miramax Books), a close examination of her life in spandex, thigh-highs, and feathers, and a thoughtful look at what strippers do and what it means in current America.<br />Burana gives us the stripping history of her life, taking off her clothes for pay first as a rebellious adolescent who simply needed money.  She was a punk-Goth kid from a nice New Jersey family.  She started up in Times Square, long before the clean-up, in a sleazy club called Peepland.  She moved up in stripping clubs, but also became a respected writer, and she here gives close access to her interior life.  She also became engaged to a great guy who didn't mind her past or her current quest.  She takes us to a strippers' school, on a shopping spree for costumes, and to The Exotic World Burlesque Museum.  She tells us how her family reacts to her work.  She gives us personal insights about what the attraction is for her.  Grabbing an on-stage pole, just like she learned at stripper school, at Cheetah's in Los Angeles, she gets into an ecstatic state.  &quot;When it feels just right.  Righteous. At times like this, I can believe that I have all the hearts in the room gathered into the palm of my hand.  I will never get old.  I will never know harm.  As long as I stay on this stage under the benevolent auspices of darkness, everything will be okay.&quot;<br />Combining sex, money, and power is dangerous.  &quot;Hunger isn't humane, sex will never be totally safe, and commerce isn't always kind,&quot; she writes, and by the end of the book, she has given an ambivalent but permanent farewell to a big chunk of her life, and she has given her costumes away to an aspiring ecdysiast.  This is a riveting book about what is an essential and unchangeable aspect of American life, and it is filled with details about a world few people know intimately.  For instance, in what other memoir are you going to learn how to perform the stunt of lighting your nipples on fire?f darkness, everything will be okay.&quot;  <br />Combining sex, money, and power is dangerous.  &quot;Hunger isn't humane, sex will never be totally safe, and commerce isn't always kind,&quot; she writes, and by the end of the book, she has given an ambivalent but permanent farewell to a big chunk of her life, and she has given her costumes away to an aspiring ecdysiast.

The first artificial satellite (people were originally calling it an artificial moon) had been successfully launched by the Soviet Union.  It weighed less than 200 pounds and was only as big as a basketball, its batteries died after three weeks whereupon it went silent, and after three months aloft it disintegrated upon reentry into the atmosphere.  This tiny and ephemeral ball made huge differences in science and the world political climate, and in Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Walker &amp; Co.), Paul Dickson has reviewed them all.  He has also given a history of what led up to successful launches of satellites in both the Soviet Union and the US, so that his book is a useful review not just of the first satellite but of twentieth century space exploration in general.<br />The Russians already had a relatively long history of thinking about space before Sputnik went up.  The visionary Tsiolovsky was a self-taught scholar who in 1898 created the first formula to specify what sort of power would be needed to send an object up so as not to fall down again.  He described that this could be accomplished by a &quot;reaction machine,&quot; which we know as a rocket.  He never got to use models, but his first sketch of a spaceship had fuel tanks of liquid oxygen and hydrogen, just as the shuttle uses.  He described the use of booster rockets to attain escape velocity.  Of course, Dickson tells the fascinating story of our own neglected rocket man, Robert Goddard, who made real rockets and gained over 200 patents, but mostly got only posthumous credit for his accomplishments.  And then there was Sergei Korolev, a Red Army Colonel, who, as &quot;chief designer&quot; of the Soviet rocket program, was the man responsible for Sputnik, and for Gagarin's 1961 spaceflight.  Little was known about him at the time, because the Soviets wanted their space efforts to be seen as a communal, rather than an individual, effort, and they thought that if he were known, he would be a target for CIA assassination.  He had also been imprisoned in the Gulag when Stalin came to believe that rockets would be used to overthrow the government.  Dickson reviews the worry with which Americans viewed Sputnik, and how Eisenhower (who was criticized for not worrying enough) actually was pleased that it opened up space for spy satellites.<br />American science and technology were in trouble in some ways.  Dickson details the rivalry between the services to claim space as a theater of operations, and the rivalry between military and civilian agencies.  There were problems of underfunding of basic research.  Science within education needed higher priorities, and for many schools, the Sputnik era was the first time that Darwin could be mentioned.  Sputnik resulted in a meaningful American space program, and Dickson's readable and informative re-evaluation of the repercussions of the little aluminum ball shows that it affects us still.nd they thought that if he were known, he would be a target for CIA assassination.

Ricky Jay, author, magician, and actor, continues the theme of his _Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women_, a survey of strange entertainments through the ages.  This book contains reproduction of his quarterly publication issued from 1994 to 2000, a periodical famous for its production values, rarity, and expense.  The sixteen issues are gathered in one volume here, a good looking oversized book with charming period woodcuts and engravings, amazing tales of very strange human endeavors, and an afterword to bring all the issues up to date.  Even at the listed... price this book is therefore an undeniable bargain, and it is good that it is going to have a reach to a larger audience.<br />For Jay's subjects are so stupefyingly surprising.  They almost all have to do with some sort of performance, and the stranger the better.  There is a chapter on, of all things, crucifixion for showmanly profit.  Tommy Minnock, at the beginning of the twentieth century, gained wildly enthusiastic response from his audiences as, nailed to a cross on the stage in a supposed hypnotic trance, he crooned, \\"After The Ball Is Over,\\" one of the most popular tunes of the time.  \\"I am told by those who saw me,\\"  he wrote \\"nailed to the cross that I presented a weird but impressive spectacle.\\"  Evatima Tardo around the same time was regularly nailed to a cross, suspended there for over two hours.  She seldom had volunteers from the crowd who would come up to run the nails through her limbs, so her<br />assistants had to do so.  The nails were dipped in poison beforehand; she<br />was quoted as saying, \\"There wouldn't be any fun unless I had prussic acid<br />on the ends.\\"  She laughed and sang, and declared that she had never had<br />such a pleasant time: \\"This is so easy, I am going to do it all over again<br />tomorrow night, and three nights next week.\\"  Jay writes that, \\"while no one<br />would claim that Minnock and Tardo inspired a trend of copycat<br />crucifixions,\\" there were successors, including Faith Bacon, who hung nude<br />from a cross and gyrated to Ravel's Bolero.  Some fakirs participated in<br />crucifixions in the spirit of competition, outdoing each other by staying<br />aloft for days at a time.<br /><br /> You  will find here surprising chapters on such thing as the magical amputation of the nose.  You will learn of the surprising, longstanding connection between legerdemain and dentistry. There are trained dogs and pigs, and a description of how flea circuses worked.  There are those who made their fortunes by making faces; the means by which performers were able to dance upon the ceiling (including \\"The Great Philosophical Antipodean Pedestrian from Ohio\\"); the rascally ways in which hustlers would gain the trust and the pocketbooks of novices in ninepins; the adventures of professional fasters; and much more.  The careful, quietly amused way in which Jay tells these odd histories is perfect for his subject matter, and shows a matchless enthusiasm for his themes.  \\"I really do love this stuff,\\" he tells us at the end, and there is easily sufficient evidence here to show that in that there is no deception.Jay writes that, \\"while no one  would claim that Minnock and Tardo inspired a trend of copycat  crucifixions,\\" there were successors, including Faith Bacon, who hung nude  from a cross and gyrated to Ravel's Bolero.

In 1936 she published _The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut_ which, as did many of her thirty-odd books, became a best seller.  It is now republished by the Modern Library, and is a welcome reminder of a brave, erudite, and witty explorer.  The current volume has as an introduction a capsule description of Stark's life by her biographer, Jane Fletcher Geniesse.  Born in 1892, Stark was only able to indulge in travel in her thirties; she realized that there was a hunger for knowledge about exotic Arabia, and she schooled herself in the language and history of the area, through which she traveled by foot, car, donkey, and camel well into her eighties.  She lived to be 101.<br />The explorations of these exotic lands are rendered now more strange and lovely by time.  Few of us will get to see the lands Stark loved, but we will never see them as she did.  For most of the steps along the trail described in this book, Stark was the first European woman to come that way, and that she did so unaccompanied by a European escort gave the Bedouin, the learned men, and the sultans something to admire and wonder at.  One who thought himself a leader of her group attempted to exclude her by bringing her meals to a separate area.  &quot;He was showing a Victorian disapproval of females who do not keep themselves to themselves, a thing I find dull and difficult to do.&quot;  She finds that she very much likes being in the middle of the group, even as an outsider.  &quot;To sit over the fire with one's fellows in the evening, when the work is over and the talking begins, is the only sure way of keeping harmony and friendship.  I never had any difficulties with my beduin and found nothing but friendliness and an anxiety to serve in every way, and I attribute this chiefly to the fact that we had our meals together...&quot;  On the last night being with one group, one of the Bedouin thanks her for sharing food together (rather than keeping separate as he had expected the European traveler to do), and says it has been pleasant traveling with her.  &quot;'Here we are now,' he said, 'all together.  And tomorrow?' - he opened his hand out wide - 'all scattered, where?'  After this question, so sad, ancient, and universal, we looked in silence to the darkness and the stars.&quot;<br />Stark's quest was unfulfilled because of all things, measles.  The discovery of Shabwa awaited a German traveler the next year, for she was too sick to continue toward her goal.  One of her hosts, as she was ailing, reassured her: &quot;Here we have no sickness; we are well or we die.&quot;  She was carried off in a plane of the Royal Air Force, to whom in gratitude she dedicated her book.  Her work is a perfect illustration that journeying well, and not achieving the destination, is the better accomplishment.  It is impossible to come away from this volume without admiring this spunky, amused and amusing woman, nor to share in her admiration for those among whom she traveled.  &quot;The magic of Arabia,&quot; she writes, &quot;which so many have felt, is due perhaps less to the sun-wrinkled arid land itself than to the innate peculiar nobility and charm of its people.&quot;y to the fact that we had our meals together...&quot;  On the last night being with one group, one of the Bedouin thanks her for sharing food together (rather than keeping separate as he had expected the European traveler to do), and says it has been pleasant traveling with her.  &quot;'Here we are now,' he said, 'all together.

Their book happened to come on the shelves immediately after the terror attacks of 11 September, and in the middle of various anthrax scares.  We are getting used to living in a world where zealots want thousands of Americans dead however they can arrange it, and where the use of biological agents was only formerly considered unthinkable.  This disturbing book, with convincing research, alarming anecdotes, and useful analysis of US policy, is a fine overview of a worrisome and all-too-essential topic.<br />There has been a biological attack on America before.  The book starts out in Oregon in 1984 with a mass poisoning carried out by (surprise!) an extremist religious group. The devotees had the tools but did not have all the biotechnical expertise they needed.  Other nations don't.  Experts in the field say &quot;they could teach a terrorist group how to make devastating germ weapons from a few handfuls of backyard dirt and some widely available lab equipment.&quot;  And a few steps up in technology, and they can use gene modification to make even deadlier germs.  Much of the book has to deal with how our government has imperfectly dealt with the biological threat, doing its usual dance of money allocations to those who could manage to convince the right people that their particular program was the worthy one.  President Clinton was intensely interested in biological arms, and insisted that his staff members think about the unthinkable, rehearsing how the government might handle biological attacks.  Such &quot;tabletop games&quot; proved that logistics, legal authority, and medical capacity would all break down as thousands of sick and dying victims exhausted local and national resources.<br />While the authors pay close attention to the verification protocols imposed upon Iraq and the history of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo, Al Qaeda gets little attention, something that would have been quite different, one assumes, if the book were published after 11 September.  Nonetheless, the authors conclude, &quot;The world's response to the growing dangers of germ weapons has fallen far short of what is needed.&quot;  This is not an alarmist book but one which has obviously been carefully researched and brightly written.  The authors warn against our thinking that the germ threat is a hoax, which we are now unlikely to do; and show how the investments against a real threat have up to now been &quot;too haphazard and diffuse.&quot;  Those who read this troubling book will be well informed just how outdated such efforts have become only in the days of its first publication.sed upon Iraq and the history of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo, Al Qaeda gets little attention, something that would have been quite different, one assumes, if the book were published after 11 September.

With our predilection for blood and guts (and scary movies) we are likely to answer sharks, or lions and tigers and bears.  This is wrong by a factor of millions.  You yourself have hunted, and sometimes killed this most dangerous animal, but most of the time it has attacked you in stealth and escaped to attack again.  It is the tiny mosquito that endangers us far more than the big, scary beasts.  They caused 500 million cases of malaria last year, and a million deaths from it, and that's just malaria.  We can swat a few, but for all our knowledge, large-scale control of the scourge eludes us.  Just how big a problem mosquitoes pose is made clear in _Mosquito: A Natural History of Our Most Persistent and Deadly Foe_ by Andrew Spielman and Michael D'Antonio.  A good deal of the book is told in the first person, for Spielman is a tropical disease specialist and a particular expert on mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit.  (He has been bitten so many times he no longer gets welts.)  D'Antonio is a journalist who has won a Pulitzer.  The combination of the two has resulted in a surprisingly readable, scary, and humbling  volume.<br />The first section of the book is entitled &quot;The Magnificent Enemy.&quot;  It is clear that Spielman, after decades of trying to understand mosquitoes and battling them, holds them in admiration as finely tuned specimens produced by the pressures of evolution.  (He is also able to refer to them as &quot;the little devils&quot; when they turn up where they are not wanted.)  You knew that only females draw blood (this is to produce the eggs of the next generation), but did you know that they mostly eat rotting fruit?  Much of the book is concerned with the illnesses that mosquitoes convey, and the symptoms make unpleasant reading.  Mosquitoes have changed history, and many instances are included here.  DDT saw wartime use in the WWII Pacific, and scientists thought we could have eradicated mosquitoes by now, but here are the war's results: &quot;Today, a map colored to illustrate the worldwide distribution of malaria does not look much different from one drawn in 1955.&quot;  The authors argue against the ban of DDT which various ecological groups are calling for.  It is no longer dangerously overused, it is cheap, and it saves lives.  It can't work very well if we keep transporting mosquitoes to new populations, as international travel is making it easier to do.<br />The book gives a useful summary of what works against mosquitoes and what doesn't.  Repellants work, especially those with DEET, as does any oily substance spread on the skin.  Screens are one of the main ways malaria was expelled from the United States.  Bug zappers kill very few mosquitoes; ultrasonic devices do nothing; and sadly, culturing bats and mosquito-eating birds seems to have little effect.  We are, for all our knowledge, making little headway against this tiny, dangerous enemy.  This book effectively sums up the problems, and in an entertaining way brings us up to date on an important war we are far from winning.dicated mosquitoes by now, but here are the war's results: &quot;Today, a map colored to illustrate the worldwide distribution of malaria does not look much different from one drawn in 1955.&quot;  The authors argue against the ban of DDT which various ecological groups are calling for.

If you know little about the creature, you can learn plenty here, but more important is the story of how humans attempted to capture, understand, and classify the animal and how it came to play a role in the great debate over evolution.<br />The platypus was such an oddity that at first no one believed it could actually exist. With an animal that was an amphibian quadruped with webbed feet, fur, and the beak of a duck, it is not surprising that some suspected a hoax. Central to classifying the platypus were the two questions concerning reproduction: did it produce live young, and did it produce milk for them? Richard Owen, the most influential naturalist before Darwin and who had an encyclopedic knowledge of anatomy of many species, was able to confirm the stories that the reclusive platypus did suckle its young, but the question of birth proved more troublesome. The obvious way to settle such a question would be to find a platypus home and see, but the retiring and removed nature of the creature prevented this for decades. Instead of suspending judgement on the question until this could be done, naturalists formed ranks on different sides, and argued over the issue in what seems now a useless and puzzling manner. Owen, originally a friend of Darwin and then a fierce opponent of evolution, tended to examine evidence to show his own view that the platypus had live birth, but it was not until 1884 that a naturalist shot a platypus which had laid an egg and had another coming down the cloaca. The long controversy was ended, and the aging Owen must have heard the news, but unfortunately his views on the discovery are unknown.<br />Moyal's book is beautifully illustrated, with pictures of the platypus as envisioned by naturalists through the centuries. It is full of interesting facts about one of the most peculiar creatures on the Earth, one which has yielded surprising findings even after the big controversies were settled. For instance, although there is no placenta to connect the young with the mother platypus, the egg within the uterus is nourished by absorption into its shell, a process which egg-laying birds and reptiles do not share. Another surprising finding, and this only in the last couple of decades, is that the distinctive bill of the platypus (and it isn't hard like a duck's, but soft and flexible) contains a battery of electroreceptors which are so sensitive they can detect the tiny muscle discharges of the shrimp and worms on which the platypus feeds. The platypus, as revealed in this well-written and admiring volume, is not a primitive throwback as researchers from the nineteenth century believed, but a fully evolved creature of surprising beauties and complexities.s ended, and the aging Owen must have heard the news, but unfortunately his views on the discovery are unknown.<br />Moyal's book is beautifully illustrated, with pictures of the platypus as envisioned by naturalists through the centuries.

In fact, the script pays tribute to one of its main sources.  After studying up on shark attacks, the police chief (who is worried about them) tries to convince the mayor (who is worried about his town's tourist income) by explicitly referring to the rogue shark attacks of New Jersey in 1916.  In _Twelve Days of Terror: A Definitive Investigation of the 1916 New Jersey Shark Attacks_ (Lyons Press), Richard G. Fernicola, MD cannot help drawing parallels between the movie and the historic attacks.  His reassembling of the story is fascinating.  Fernicola has published about them before, but they seem to be an abiding hobby for him, as the current book represents a couple of decades of research.  He has also researched television documentaries on the subject, and on killer sharks in general.  He might not make his enthusiasm completely contagious to the reader.  It is clear that he is not a professional author, but he has marshaled his facts and presents them as might a congenial avuncular story teller, with a tale to chill your blood.<br />No one in the 1916 waves was worried about sharks.  Before that time there had been no documented shark attacks in temperate waters.  Fernicola describes the increasing doom as a shark (and he gives evidence that the havoc was produced by just one) makes its killing way north along the coast.  The climax of the killing (as in the movie) was when the shark swept into Matawan Creek, a small tidal inlet where it was spotted by the crusty old salt Captain Thomas Cottrell.  He did all he could to warn his fellow citizens, who didn't believe him, and were surprised that he should be showing such a splendid sense of prankish humor.  The most exciting writing in _Twelve Days_ is the Captain's dash of warning the town, and it's limited success.<br />It must be said that _Twelve Days of Terror_ is on the most part not an exciting book.  Once the twelve days are past, there is a good deal of scientific information and speculation.  For instance, Fernicola, who practices pain management, gets to explain why being dismembered by a shark may not be the most painful of deaths.  He has described in detail the wounds of the five killed by the shark, and the one person who lived.  He describes the surprising theory of the time that U-boats of Germany (with which the US was not yet at war) had disturbed the waters or the sensing systems of the sharks to bring them in close, perhaps deliberately.  He has often injected himself into the story, telling about his interviews and how he got to see newspapers of the period; while this might be distracting from his story, it also helps note that as history, it is fading into a past of imperfect documentation.  For instance, he explains how excited he was to find a woman who was an eyewitness to the attack on the second victim, and how he scheduled a taped interview for the very next day, by which time she had quietly died in her sleep.  This theme is throughout the book.  The hero of the Matawan Creek attacks, who himself died from shark wounds, had only days before taken a out a life insurance policy, giving as payment a suit from his shop rather than cash.  His parents used the money to buy a stained glass window in his memory, but the church has since been torn down, and no one knows where the window has gone.  The area around Matawan has changed irrevocably.  There were no further deaths after the twelve days, and soon America had a war to worry about, and shark fever subsided.  It has not really gone away, and novelists, moviemakers, the nightly news, and even historians can tell us shark tales, and make us shiver.of scientific information and speculation.

Even more deeply and disturbingly, they show that we don't respond to or make judgements on an objective reality &quot;out there,&quot; but only upon how our particular neurons process information.  From France, _The Science of Illusions_ (Cornell University Press) by Jacques Ninio (translated by Franklin Philip) collects lots of visual illusions, describes auditory and tactile ones, and attempts to make sense of what it all means.  There is not deep science in this book, and that is of necessity.  You may remember the optical illusion of two parallel lines that are actually the same length, but because of something added to them, one looks definitely longer and one is definitely shorter.  There are different reasons that have been proposed for this illusion, most of them complicated, some of them no longer tenable, several far-fetched but as yet unrefuted.  It is probably better for us laymen to wonder at the puzzling pictures and let the neuroscientists sort out all the circuitry, and when they get it all down, they can get back to us.<br />Ninio has indeed covered many sorts of illusions, including magic, but also such things we now take for granted as movies.  It used to be that people shown a movie of a train coming at them would scurry out of its way, but we have seen enough movies by now to know that illusion for what it is.  Ninio has concentrated on visual illusions because, of course, they can best be shown in a book.  But also, as he points out, visual input is supreme, trusted more than other senses.  People shown a film of someone saying &quot;ga-ga&quot; while the soundtrack says &quot;ba-ba&quot; will wind up hearing a hybrid &quot;da-da&quot; with their eyes open and &quot;ba-ba&quot; with their eyes closed.  Everyone has had the experience of sitting in the old-style movie theater with one speaker behind the screen, and finding that the sound seemed to come from the location on the screen of whatever person or thing was shown making it.  A ventriloquist, of course, easily makes visual cues of origin overcome auditory ones.  The optical illusions here represent some of the old classics, as well as new ones, because new ones are being invented all the time.  One of them was so strong that I believed there was a misprint when an explanation claimed that two parallelograms were the same size, so that I had to measure them, and even after that, I had to copy the page and cut the parallelograms out and compare them that way; they still do not look nearly equal.  Other illusions here present obvious but invisible white shapes, or scintillating black spots that are not there, or even circuits that seem to have matter flowing around and around their printed images.  This book is a wonderful funhouse.and finding that the sound seemed to come from the location on the screen of whatever person or thing was shown making it.

No one had ever before heard a radio play, and television, well, let's not get into a discussion about whether that is art or not.  But the same discussion about movies has been going on for a long while.  It even seems to make a difference as to whether you regard them as \\"movies,\\" \\"film,\\" or \\"cinema.\\"  Let's use movie, for that is what Raymond J. Haberski, Jr., uses in _It's Only a Movie!: Films and Critics in American Culture_ (University Press of Kentucky).  If you like thinking about movies, rather than just sitting for some entertainment, and are interested in the American history of film criticism, this is a book you will enjoy.<br />That movies are an art form is a proposition that has been long debated.  It would seem to me that if one simply considers the films of theatrical productions (like, say, _Rope_ or _A Long Day's Journey Into Night_), it becomes very easy to answer the question in the affirmative, but none of the players in Haberski's volume seems to have performed this exercise.  But even if we allow that such efforts are truly art, does that make _The Mummy Returns_ art, too?  I would say yes, but perhaps a better answer is \\"Who cares?\\"  Even so, there are lots of people who have cared about the issue, from the beginning of the movies.  The first critics of film recognized that movies were taking up a space in culture somewhere between fine art and mindless amusement, and movie criticism has hovered in discussion over where they should actually go ever since.  Haberski gives a fine summary of how critics looked at the silent movies, and how (when the Supreme Court decided they were products, not free speech), criticism was used in formation of censorship boards.  It has an excellent chapter on Theodore Dreiser's attempt to get his novel, _An American Tragedy_, filmed in what he thought was a proper fashion.  Dreiser took Paramount to court; like critics if the time, he wanted studios to \\"get serious\\" about art uncorrupted by commerce.  He lost.  Here is also an excellent summary of the famous Sarris / Kael feud over \\"auteur theory.\\"<br />Haberski obviously cares for his subject.  Painstaking research into this narrow field of endeavor is easily apparent in all his chapters.  He has a sense of humor, and does not take these battles (or himself) with excessive seriousness, as his title indicates.  There is a good deal to be enjoyed here by anyone interested in 20th century culture and film.time, he wanted studios to \\"get serious\\" about art uncorrupted by commerce.  He lost.

The visit to this world is exhilarating.<br />Delbanco tells of the history of the cello, one of a few dozen that Stradivari built. It eventually came down to Bernard Greenhouse, who has owned the cello for almost forty years.  He says, \\"I've traveled the world with that instrument. It's been my companion for 40 years. It was my career, my friend.\\"  He played in the Beaux Arts Trio, two hundred times a year.  He was never separated from his dear instrument.  But as he got older, and concertizing became less pressured and less frequent, he thought he owed his instrument and posterity a favor.  In 1998, he turned it over to the luthier, Ren&eacute; Morel in New York City, who took it apart and reworked it, over almost two years.  Morel says, \\"To start with, we take it apart.  Even so fine a lady as the Countess of Stanlein must be opened for examination; you insert the knife carefully, carefully just here into the glue - you must know how to do it - and then you just go _pop_!\\"  You can believe he was that cavalier about it, if you like.  Delbanco details the incredibly complicated steps in the renewal, and Greenhouse's fretting about being without his old friend and fellow performer.  The restoration complete, the instrument was just as good as he wanted it, which is unexcelled.<br />A charming little book, telling of the mastery of the luthier and the musician, _The Countess_ is obviously written with love by a fan, but the awesome story of the history of the cello and its dismemberment and resurrection is full of quietly told facts.  It is a fine work for general readers who know nothing of this world, and it is a delightful introduction to two elderly artists at the top of their form, and whom it is hard not to love.tery of the luthier and the musician, _The Countess_ is obviously written with love by a fan, but the awesome story of the history of the cello and its dismemberment and resurrection is full of quietly told facts.

A wonderful book, _The Tapir's Morning Bath: Mysteries of the Tropical Rain Forest and the Scientists Who Are Trying to Solve Them_ (Houghton Mifflin) memorably shows what the scientists are up to.  Elizabeth Royte is a journalist, not a naturalist, but she was not just taking notes but taking part.  She ingratiated herself into the society of strange eggheads who loved fieldwork by simply making herself available as an extra pair of untrained but willing hands.  Because of this we get to follow her on all sorts of recondite forays to coax the jungle to give up its secrets.  She follows spider monkeys in order to catch their feces, which she bags so that they can be analyzed for hormones.  She climbs out branches to hang insect traps, and counts ants.  She drives a Boston whaler zooming around the lake so that a biologist perilously hanging off the front can net migrating moths, and she learns to sex the moths by squeezing their thoraces.  She triangulates to find out where bats fly around in the dark.  She climbs trees to help monitor the behavior of creeping vines that modify the forest.  At one point, a newcomer naturalist comes into Royte's room, mistakenly thinking she has found a fellow naturalist: &quot;Oh, hi.  Hi.  Do you happen to have a syringe smaller than 1 cc?  I'm trying to inject some solution into a butterfly's ear canal and what I have is way too big.&quot;  Royte is excited about all these tasks, and her enthusiasm is on every page of her book.  In addition, she has humorous descriptions of the men and women working on the island, but playing as well, with Ultimate Frisbee one of the least controversial amusements.  But it is their work that makes the book.  One of them explains that if he were intent on conservation, he'd be doing other work to promote it directly, and that he is attempting something like pure thought: &quot;I'm setting up this experiment as an exercise in thinking. I don't want a utilitarian reason for everything. Why do we need art? I feel the same way about basic science: It's good for us.&quot;<br />Reading Royte's book is good for us, too.  There is a wide array of scientific information presented here, and plenty of good humor, raconteurship, and insight into how science is done and what makes scientists do it.  It is also a deeply personal document, as during the year Royte married (to someone back in the States), became pregnant, and found that her reflections on nature and on evolution were deepened by the embryo growing with her.

But maybe it isn't really that clear; in his autobiography, Mark Twain includes the quip, but attributes it to Disraeli.  In fact, there is a lot about statistics that is not clear, and Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware, wants to clarify it for us.  In _Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists_ (University of California Press), he addresses the statistically impaired, which all of us are, more or less.  We can judge statistics better, and he has written clearly and enthusiastically about how to do so.<br />The problem is that we are ready to treat statistics as facts.  The media like to report them, for they are regarded as little nuggets of truth.  The public tends to be receptive of numerical claims, and indeed, some statistics are true, if limited, and useful.  But plenty of statistics are bad statistics.  It is reasonable, when seeing a statistical claim, to ask who made it and why.  An activist group may select a statistic that highlights a social problem, while a government agency may select one that shows there is no need to worry.  No matter the origin of the statistic, how it was created needs to be critically evaluated.<br />Best's examples are great fun.  Thirty years ago, no one had heard of the crime of stalking, which loomed into importance in the 1990s.  There was not a Stalker Information Bureau compiling statistics on the issue, so when an initial news report said that \\"researchers suggest that up to 200,000 people exhibit a stalker's traits,\\" it was not really an arguable number; but it was a number, a nugget, a \\"fact.\\"  Then a television talk show declared that \\"there are an estimated 200,000 stalkers in the United States, and those are only the ones we have track of.\\"  Then _Cosmopolitan_ modified it upwards to \\"Some two hundred thousand people in the U.S. pursue the famous.  No one knows how many people stalk the rest of us, but the figure is probably higher.\\"  A statistic has a life of its own, and mutates, just like any story passed by word of mouth, or nowadays on the internet.  Activists calling attention to the problem of anorexia estimated that 150,000 American women were anorexic, and noted that anorexia could lead to death.  Sure enough, reports based on this began to say that 150,000 women per year were dying of anorexia (the correct figure is about 70).<br /> _Damned Lies and Statistics_ will inevitably invite comparison to the classic _How to Lie with Statistics_, but it concentrates more on the social value and advocative use of statistics, as well as how to start to tell the good ones from the bad ones.  It is an accessible and amusing book which counsels us to be neither naïve about statistics nor cynical, and helps us steer through the numbers so many groups ceaselessly throw at us.e famous.

The impressive and rather sweet story of how Luke Howard bequeathed clouds to scientific discussion and study is told in _The Invention of Clouds: How an Amateur Meteorologist Forged the Language of the Skies_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) by Richard Hamblyn.  You may not have heard of Howard, but you have spoken his language.<br />Howard was born to a Quaker family in 1772 in London.  Perhaps the greatest influence in his life was his stern father, who would give advice like \\"What does idleness produce but mischief of every kind?\\"  This advice he must have thought especially needed by his son, who had a lifelong passion for staring out the window and looking at the sky.  Fortunately, Howard found work that allowed him to associate with other young men in a scientific improvement society, and he gradually developed his classification system.  From his long hours of loving observation, he defined and illustrated three main cloud forms, now familiar to us: cirrus, cumulus, and stratus.  There were intermediate forms, for a total of seven, which he also defined and illustrated.  He presented his system in a lecture in 1802, at a time when popular lectures on chemistry and electricity would excite crowds into swooning enthusiasm.  The drab, undramatic Howard, attired in his unadorned Quaker garb, modest and full of trepidation, managed to give a presentation of his categories illustrated by his watercolors.  It was found thrilling first by the audience in the theater, and thereafter by those who found his essay in print.  It is to the credit of the scientific ardor of the times that Howard's simple, effective, comprehension-amplifying definitions and classifications were a sensation.  Howard, to his dismay, became \\"the well-known meteorologist Mr. Howard,\\" a worldliness of fame that was in conflict with his strong Quaker convictions.<br />Howard's work went on to inspire Francis Beaufort to classify wind speed in a comparable objective fashion, and we still use a version of Beaufort's scale today.  It seems that the landscape painter Constable studied Howard's system and used it in his depictions of sky.  It inspired Europe's greatest intellectual icon, Goethe, aging but rejuvenated just at the contemplation of Howard's system.  In fact, we know little of Howard's life, most of his personal details coming from a biographical letter the admiring Goethe asked of him.  In _The Invention of Clouds_, Hamblyn has taken the facts of Howard's life, made some justifiable and tantalizing speculations, and produced a fine history of the scientific tenor of Howard's time.  But it is above all the inspiring story, brightly and clearly told, of a dreamer who could not keep from staring out the window at the skies.his dismay, became \\"the well-known meteorologist Mr. Howard,\\" a worldliness of fame that was in conflict with his strong Quaker convictions.  <br />Howard's work went on to inspire Francis Beaufort to classify wind speed in a comparable objective fashion, and we still use a version of Beaufort's scale today.

Amir Aczel makes that case convincingly in _The Riddle of the Compass: The Invention that Changed the World_ (Harcourt), an entertaining look at an invention most of us don't use every day but which has gotten used on our behalf for centuries.  He starts in Amalfi, home of Flavio Gioia, the inventor of the compass.  Well, he wasn't really the inventor, as the Chinese were using it, sometime before 1040 CE, and Flavio lived around the fourteenth century.  What he invented was the nautical compass box, with the familiar star on the disc with the elaborate arrow that always points north.  Actually, he probably didn't even invent that.  He probably didn't even exist.  It is a funny story as to how he came to be regarded as the inventor of the compass, and even got his statue in the center of Amalfi, when he probably was a nonentity.<br />The Chinese had trade only by land and river, so there was little reason for the compass to be developed as a navigational tool.  It was, essentially, a mysterious toy.  They used the compass for feng shui.  The practical use perfected in Amalfi was passed, when Amalfi lost its power base, to the glory and enrichment of Venice.  With a compass, Venetian ships could sail during clouded winters, and could become huge transports.  When other nations began using it for transoceanic trade, they put Venice into eclipse, and brought on our modern world.<br />Aczel covers the long era of pre-compass navigation, showing how sailors were dependent on clear skies and on the lead-weighted sounding line, which could tell the depth.  They also used seasonal knowledge of winds and currents, and even looking for the traveling patterns of birds and sea snakes.  He spurns the idea that they only piloted by \\"hugging the shore,\\" which would never explain how they managed when they left sight of land, and which represents taking on the greatest of navigational risks, running aground.  The compass, when we got around to using it, changed all that: \\"A great invention can lie dormant or be used for secondary purposes for a very long time and then suddenly be discovered by the right people - individuals with vision and an entrepreneurial spirit - and be exploited to its fullest extent. When this happens, such inventions can change the way we live.\\"  Aczel, a fine popular science writer who has most recently written on Fermat's Last Theorem and on the mathematical search for infinity, has here combined national histories, sea lore, and personal insight to make an absorbing history of an underrated tool.\\" which would never explain how they managed when they left sight of land, and which represents taking on the greatest of navigational risks, running aground.

She is now a medical resident, but while she was a medical student, she spent time at the Ranch.  Whats a nice girl like her doing in a place like that?  Well, she has this interest in prostitution.  Its a clinical interest, one which started when she was an outreach worker for Streetwork, which helped homeless adolescents in New York.  So she was curious about how Nevada might have come to the conclusion that prostitutes ought to be in business and legal.  She was eventually allowed into the Ranch in order to do a public health project.  She wanted to study how condoms got used, because it seems that legal prostitutes in Nevada, who use condoms by law, never spread HIV.  She had to collect condoms, but she also got to collect stories from the working girls, and the stories and her experiences at the Ranch have become _Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women_ (Random House).  It is an informative look into a strange, unique, but legal endeavor to provide a historically and socially inevitable service.<br />She got to know the Ranchs routine intimately.  She describes the process by which men are brought to the ranch, select a prostitute, and negotiate a fee.  She was surprised that brothels werent repulsive.  They appeared to be clean, legitimate workplaces, and the women were not shackled hostages but self-aware professionals there of their own free will.  It seemed a cheery atmosphere overall, although there were cliques and distrust.  Over and over, however, the women called themselves family, and referred to any friction between them as just what youd expect now and then between sisters.  One said, I love these women here, even my enemies.  Even if we dont like each other, were still on the same team.  Well protect each other, because were all working girls.  Albert is able to give plenty of fascinating details about how the Ranch functioned.  Much of what she describes is simply a busy business, with work relationships that are often strong and supportive.<br />Thus it is sad when Albert tells about her last visit to the Ranch, a last visit because it was being closed.  The rascal that ran it from afar lost it to the government for back taxes, and the women all had to leave, through no fault of their own.  Albert has given a picture of a unique business, populated by workers and customers who are simply people.  As she says, it is easy to overlook the humanity thats at the core of this complex and timeless profession, but she has reported that humanity in fascinating detail.ribes is simply a busy business, with work relationships that are often strong and supportive.<br />Thus it is sad when Albert tells about her last visit to the Ranch, a last visit because it was being closed.

If you learned a name for this invention, it was probably William Thomas Green Morton.  He turns out to be the most colorful and rascally character in the wonderful _Ether Day: The Strange Tale of America's Greatest Medical Discovery and the Haunted Men Who Made It_ (HarperCollins) by Julie M. Fenster, but he isn't the only one.  The invention of anesthesia was one of the most divisive issues in medicine in the nineteenth century.  Fenster has dug up an amazing story of the origin of the first great advance in modern medicine, and told it in a lively and dramatic fashion.  Opium, alcohol, ice, Mesmerism, and even bleeding into a faint had been used to avoid the horrors of surgery on a conscious patient, with little success.  Reliable anesthesia was the first great advance in modern medicine.<br />Nitrous oxide, laughing gas, used to be a party and theatrical intoxicant.  After an exhibition of its use, Horace Wells, a dentist, realized it cut pain.  He began to use it in dental extractions.  Morton met Wells in 1842, after a youthful career of spectacularly defrauding creditors in various big cities, and decided to take up dentistry under Wells's tutelage.  Morton later met Charles T. Jackson, a chemist, who maintained that he had suggested to Morton the use of ether for dental extractions.  Morton was eventually invited to administer ether before a rapt audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital on 16 October 1846, which is known by historians of anesthesia as Ether Day.  It went perfectly.  Morton tried the shocking precedent of patenting ether, and when that didn't work, he spent his life petitioning Congress for a reward for his invention, an award opposed by Jackson and Wells.<br /><br />Indeed, Morton got medals and fame for what he had done, but it never made him rich, and rich was what he wanted to be.  Wells experimented with chloroform, which was an effective anesthetic but more dangerous than ether, and became addicted to it.  He was arrested for throwing acid onto prostitutes while he was chloroformed, and killed himself in jail.  Jackson never got the recognition he was sure he deserved for the invention of ether, which only compounded the bitterness he felt that he had also given Morse the idea for the telegraph.  He spent the last seven years of his life in an asylum.  None of the inventors got what he wanted.  This is a complicated tale, wittily told.  We have no one hero on which we can bestow the title \\"The Inventor of Anesthesia\\" (and Fenster reports a competing and prior claim by Dr. Crawford Long in Georgia, who used ether to removing a swelling on a patient's neck in 1842).  It is a messy history, entertainingly told.e was arrested for throwing acid onto prostitutes while he was chloroformed, and killed himself in jail.

It could have happened.  The plans were drawn up for a computer that would have been very much like those of today, except it would have run on cogs, gears, levers, springs, and maybe steam power.  We only got around to computers a hundred years later, but things could have worked out much differently, if the work of Charles Babbage had taken off.  Doron Swade knows just how well such an engine could have worked.  He built one.  Or rather, his team within the London Science Museum built a calculating engine that Babbage had designed.  It worked, just as Babbage knew it would.  Swade tells the story of Babbage and his amazing machines in _The Difference Engine: Charles Babbage and the Quest to Build the First Computer_ (Viking).  Babbage's accomplishments turned out to be futile in the end, but Swade shows us how there is much to admire in his quest, successful or not.<br />Babbage wrote papers on chess, taxation, lock-picking, philosophy, submarines, archeology, cryptanalysis, and many other diverse efforts.  He was an unstoppable inventor and tinkerer; he invented (but didn't get credit for) the ophthalmoscope every doctor has used, and the cowcatcher installed on the front of locomotives.  But what he loved most of all were his computing machines.  The Industrial Revolution was making everything else by steam; why not calculations, and perfect tables of them?  He designed just such a calculating engine, and although because of various problems it didn't get built, he never stopped tinkering with it, and he designed an even bigger calculation machine that would have done, in its cogwheel way, all the basics that computers now do.<br />Babbage is sometimes called the grandfather of the computer, but he is more like an uncle.  There is no evidence that any of his intricate and visionary machines influenced the design of electronic computers.  Swade's engrossing book gives a good capsule biography of a fascinating man, but more importantly, it shows a hands-on appreciation for the machines he had dreamed up.  Babbage knew that his dreams were doomed for his own time, but he had an inkling of what was to come; he wrote of the inventor's lot, &quot;The certainty that a future age will repair the injustice of the present, and the knowledge that the more distant the day of reparation, the more he has outstripped the efforts of his contemporaries, may well sustain him against the sneers of the ignorant, or the jealousy of rivals.&quot;  He was right again.nating man, but more importantly, it shows a hands-on appreciation for the machines he had dreamed up.

His chapters are arranged by city in Europe, the US, and Canada; his publishers budget prevented Bangkok.  He got to see some places that if you are like me, you are curious about, and also if you are like me, you wouldnt get caught dead in.  Take, for instance, the Porno Oscars at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  The lovely Tristan Taormino picks up her award for best tape devoted to a particular sexual act.  &quot;Oh, my God!  This is so wonderful!... I just want to thank my mom and dad...&quot;  The Adult Video News Award show has become so mainstream that there is now a prize for Best Non-Sex Performance.  When Brownstein gets to chat with John Leslie (&quot;The Cecil B. DeMille of Porn&quot;), he discovers a theme that runs throughout this book.  Often the people in sex businesses are very conventional.  Leslie paints landscapes, plays harmonica in a blues band, grows his own food, and has a marriage lasting two decades.  His wife explains that she met him in 1980, when he was famous for his performances in front of the porn cameras.  &quot;He was a huge star - well, you know what I mean...&quot;<br />Brownstein gets to interview the seventy-four year old Hugh Hefner at the famous Playboy Mansion.  &quot;All of what has happened in my life,&quot; Hef says, &quot;has not made me cynical, has not made me overly sophisticated or jaded.  I am still very much the boy who dreamed the dreams and stayed connected to them.&quot;  Perhaps this explains his five girlfriends, the ages of four of which it would take to add up beyond his own.  He has, once again, displayed great timing.  Pfizer Pharmaceuticals marketing division, take note: Hef says about Viagra, &quot;When you have five girlfriends, you need it... It's the best legal recreational drug out there.&quot;  Nearby in Beverly Hills is Lou Paget who gives seminars on the themes of her best-selling books, _How to be a Great Lover_ and _How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure_.  She also gives private lessons and group instruction on fellatio.  This explains why Brownstein sees her dishwasher is full of latex phalluses; she takes a briefcase full of them to her classes for student use.  They lie who say she uses fruits or vegetables.<br />Amsterdam is hot.  Paris is not.  And remarkably, Montreal seems quite a fetish capital.  It goes without saying that Brownstein has picked the less seedy venues of commercial sex for his entertaining explorations.  The people he interviews make legal livings, and he'd be less amusing if he were looking at the darker side of his carnival.  Nonetheless, sticking to the high end of what is now popular entertainment has given him a platform to make jokes and open eyes, and to let us in on an international and surprisingly human aspect of the pursuit of happiness.ills is Lou Paget who gives seminars on the themes of her best-selling books, _How to be a Great Lover_ and _How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure_.

Everyone knows, but how is it that this universal sign came to be?  That is one of the surprising questions answered in an odd little book about, of all things, stripes.  _The Devil's Cloth: A History of Stripes &amp; Striped Fabric_ (Columbia University Press) by Michel Pastoureau (translated from the French by Jody Gladding) shows stripes all over the place and gives a wide-ranging account of just why they have the clothing functions we seem almost instinctively to know about them.  The pejorative nature of stripes was founded on a legend sparked in the Bible's pages, and the Carmelite order figured that stripes would be a good uniform for its members, while the members of other orders wore sober solid colors.  The Carmelites arrived in Paris in 1254, and were immediate victims of abuse and mockery, with people making jests about how they were just the type to be \\"behind bars,\\" and so on.  The cloaks were a scandal, and Pope Alexander IV expressly ordered unstriped ones for the Carmelites.  It didn't do; ten successive popes were required to put the demonic garment down, and even then the Carmelites out in the sticks probably kept it.<br />Stripes were thereby authoritatively banned from religious garb, and they became assigned to nasties: \\"Treacherous knights, usurping seneschals, adulterous wives, rebel sons, disloyal brothers, cruel dwarfs, greedy servants, they may all be endowed with stripes on heraldry or clothes.\\"  Cain and Judas don't always have stripes in their pictures, but they get them more than any other biblical figures.  As time went on, the stripe was associated not so much with badness as lowness.  Servants wore stripes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  Eventually, the jauntily fashionable folks of those times took to wearing stripes, but wore them vertically, which distinguished them somehow from the reprobates who had to wear them horizontally.  Everything changed in 1775, when the pejorative aspect of stripes (which has never completely left) was largely abandoned that they might become the clothing of the revolutions.  Stripes became a good thing, but they also remain naughty.  Pajamas, underwear, and bedsheets used to be uniformly a pure white, but in the nineteenth century, the white got diluted, either by quiet striping or by pastels.  It may be that such striping represents once again the barrier, this time against our own desires and our unquenchable lusts.  We are reminded perhaps that we are all potentially as errant as convicts.<br />This is an odd book with both close arguments and speculative hypotheses.  It has wonderful footnotes, including one telling how the author's father visited a department store with Picasso, who insisted on ordering pants that would \\"stripe the ass.\\"  Stripes are everywhere, and they mean something, and that meaning has expanded in surprising ways over the centuries.  If you like stripes, and who doesn't, you will find that your appreciation for them (especially for their surprising connotations of naughtiness) is magnified by this entertaining intellectual confection.he pejorative aspect of stripes (which has never completely left) was largely abandoned that they might become the clothing of the revolutions.

In _Savage: The Life and Times of Jemmy Button_ (Thomas Dunne Books), Nick Hazlewood has written an amazing and sad story about missionaries, colonialism, and a tragic clash of cultures.  Sparking the story, a shocking tale of repeated good intentions and bad results, was the high Tory captain of the HMS _Beagle_, Edward FitzRoy.  FitzRoy thought it would be grand to take Fuegian specimens back to Britain.  One of them, swapped for a button, became Jemmy Button, and Darwin got to see him on the _Beagle_'s trip in 1831 to take him back home (so he had influence in Darwin's _The Descent of Man_).  FitzRoy's hopes were futile, as Jemmy turned native again.<br />In 1845, the Patagonian Missionary Society, one of the many Protestant vanguards of British colonialism,  made an effort to land on Tierra del Fuego and begin proselytizing.  The mission lasted a week, because the natives merely stole from it, without improvement of their souls.  In 1850, a similar attempt lead to the deaths of the missionaries.  Newspapers warned the Patagonian Missionary Society off any future effort, but the public loved this British bravado, and the Society was emboldened to try a new venture.  It would use one of the Falkland Islands as a staging ground to which Fuegians could be ferried, civilized, converted, and returned.  To this end, Jemmy was found and was kidnapped once again, along with members of his family.  They became homesick and resentful, and were cycled back home, with another nine Fuegians picked up.  The Society's reports were glowing, but glossed over the frequent problems.  One of the basic ones was that the Fuegians had little concept of property rights, and when they liked something, they took it, and they resented any subsequent searches.  When this group was returned, eight missionaries were murdered.  The Society blamed the work of Satan, but as one letter to the papers said, the massacre \\"...was produced by the recklessness of the society and their agents, and therefore I must conclude that Satan is much maligned in this matter.\\"<br />Hazlewood has told this astonishing and distressing story with a novelist's fluency.  In the end, the efforts toward the Fuegians could not have been more futile.  Ranchers and sheep-farmers soon began invading their island, and brought devastating diseases or simply hunted them down and shot them.  No pure Fuegians survived.  Those with intentions of greed harmed them as much as those with intentions of improvement under the guise of imposition of a strong culture over a weak one.  Such were the benefits of civilization to the savages.hey resented any subsequent searches.  When this group was returned, eight missionaries were murdered.

Like some of his previous books, it is filled with wonder that regular American boys were able to get the job done: \\"From whence came such men?\\"  This book (like Ambrose's _Citizen Soldiers_) answers the question, but doesn't diminish our sense of wonder.  It is not really a history of the plane.  Ambrose concentrates on one squadron flying out of Italy, and even more particularly on the plane of one pilot, George McGovern.  There were those who loathed McGovern's anti-Vietnam War stance when he ran against Nixon in 1972.  Some rabid right-wingers even circulated stories of his Army cowardice.  Nothing could be further from the truth; McGovern was as tough as the plane he piloted.<br />\\"The B-24 was built like a 1930s Mack Truck,\\" writes Ambrose.  Over eighteen thousand of the planes were made, more than any other airplane ever built.  It was designed simply to carry lots of heavy bombs a long distance and fast, and so it did, but there was little it offered in the way of subtlety or comfort to the crew.  There was no power steering; the pilot came back from flying maybe ten hours with exhausted arms and legs from muscling the plane to behave.  The seats were cramped and unpadded. There was no pressurization, so above 10,000 feet, the nine men in the crew had to wear oxygen masks.  There was no heat, despite temperatures of 50 below zero at higher altitudes, and if the bomb bay doors were open, the wind cut throughout the plane.  The crew had to plug their suits into electrical outlets for heating.  Oxygen masks often froze to faces.  There were urinals in the form of fore and aft relief tubes, but heavy layers of clothes made these hard to use without leakage, and the tubes often froze.  Ambrose spends a third of the book detailing the training of the pilots and their crews to fly these primitive, effective machines, and then takes them to Europe.  The crews were to fly thirty-five missions before being cycled back to the States.  The odds were not good; the Fifteenth Air Force had 5,000 bombers and the Germans shot down almost half of them.  The anecdotes he tells are vivid and exciting.<br />Astonishingly, McGovern was twenty-two years old at the time, and some of his crew were teenagers.  This is just the sort of tale Ambrose serves up well, that of hero worship for ordinary guys showing extraordinary heroism in an unambiguously patriotic effort against evil.  When he writes, \\"Along with all the peoples of the Allied nations, they saved Western civilization,\\" there is admiration, but no hyperbole.  As the crews that fought the war are now leaving us, Ambrose has performed superb service in helping us acknowledge once again what we owe them.  The B-24s have already left us.  Of all the thousands manufactured, almost all were scrapped within a year after the war.  Three are in museums, and one is still flying.tive machines, and then takes them to Europe.

They also did little to abolish the antithesis of freedom and citizenship, slavery.  How can black people be patriots if this is so, and how are they to regard their portion of the American heritage? \\"Can I embrace the founders who may have `owned' some of my ancestors?\\"  This is the backbone question of _Jefferson's Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism_ (Beacon) by Roger Wilkins.  Wilkins has been an Attorney General, won a Pulitzer for his Watergate coverage, and has worked for the cause of civil rights within America and within Africa over several decades.  He feels himself to be deeply American and deeply patriotic, and his book provides a guide to why there is no paradox to such feelings.  It represents a new and useful way of looking at the founding of the country for both blacks and whites.<br />The title of the book comes from Jefferson's first memory: being carried on a pillow by a slave riding on horseback.  Wilkins accepts that such privileges of culture did shape the ideas of Jefferson, Madison, Mason, and Washington, but he looks at the role of slavery as something not contradictory to their efforts for freedom but as essential to those efforts.  \\"The fact is that without black Americans, including the 40 percent of Virginians who were black, the America that General Washington led into revolution in 1775 would have been a vastly different place - a poorer and weaker place, much less capable of waging a successful revolt.  And Mason, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison might themselves have been poorer, better, less conflicted, and more honest.  I would argue that they might also have been less learned, less strategically astute, and less politically wise.  Blacks and their works were present in the Revolution as essential elements both of its strengths and of the Virginians' greatness.\\"  Slaves at Monticello and Mount Vernon, in this view, worked in their own way as partners in the birth of the new nation, and toward eventual extension of its principles even to their descendents.<br />In a wise book, Wilkins is forgiving of the addiction to privilege.  He has capably blended national history, family history, and personal philosophy.  He realizes that the Virginia aristocrats about whom he writes are really not to blame for accepting the privilege they had as simply being the natural way of the world.

Now Adam Sisman has<br />biographied that great biography, in _Boswell's Presumptuous Task: The<br />Making of the Life of Dr. Johnson_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), a<br />grand book for anyone who loves the original one, or Boswell, or<br />Johnson. It is also a capital demonstration of the artistry involved<br />in writing nonfiction.<br /><br /> Boswell had a stern father who had contempt for<br />his son, and so he searched for father figures. It was this role that<br />Johnson inevitably played, and while others were disgusted by<br />Boswell's sycophancy, it mere ensured that Boswell could get his<br />subject to discourse, and could take it all down in his ever-present<br />journal. Sisman shows how Boswell used his voluminous journals to put<br />himself into the scene, even when he was not really there. Anecdotes<br />from friends and even Johnson's own writings were put into the<br />biography as if Boswell were really there, and that Boswell edited the<br />conversations to his liking. A skilled mimic, Boswell could turn<br />stories about Johnson in a way that made them true to life. Scholars<br />have counted up the calendars of the two men and found that they met<br />only on 400 days of the last 22 years of Johnson's life, so Boswell<br />really did not play the role of constant companion. Even more<br />interesting is what Boswell left out, Johnson's sexual<br />activities. Uxoriousness and unrelieved grief of the widower were<br />truer to Boswell's purpose, if not to Johnson's character. In<br />addition, painting his friend in this way may have assuaged Boswell's<br />guilt over his many infidelities to his own wife. Sisman also shows<br />how untiringly Boswell sought details from others, and confirmed them,<br />in order to write them up himself.<br />Boswell had a magnificent and<br />useful friendship with Johnson, who inspired him and provided him with<br />the immortality he sought (although, sadly, Boswell could not have<br />known this). The friendship was a foundation of his life, and forms<br />the basis of one of the most entertaining of the great books. It<br />wasn't always a smooth friendship, as Johnson was always<br />intermittently rough with his friends. His famous remark to Boswell,<br />\\"You have but two topics, yourself and me, and I'm sick of<br />both,\\" shows that he grew impatient at being prodded into<br />self-revelation. But we only know of that remark because Boswell, all<br />thanks be to him, recorded it for future use and kept it as one of the<br />details in his incomparable book.on of his life, and forms the basis of one of the most entertaining of the great books.

It is hard to imagine that there is any aspect of this<br />subject that Russell has not covered. The truly amazing part of the<br />gray whales story is that it had a terrible reputation in the<br />whalers day. It was called a devilfish, and was viewed as a<br />dangerous quarry, especially when it was protecting its young. It had<br />to be approached with fear (and this was realized in the Japanese<br />fisheries as well). It is a devilfish no longer. No one knows why, but<br />sometime in the 1970s the behavior of the whales changed. Into the<br />lagoons of Baja, the whales go in the winter to mate and to deliver<br />calves. The whales started becoming interested in the humans that had<br />put out in their boats to see them. They presented themselves at the<br />surface, turning on their sides to point an eye up to look at the<br />humans that used to kill them for oil and meat, and for baleen to<br />stiffen their corsets. They seemed to enjoy being scratched and<br />touched. Individual whales, returning year after year, seemed to<br />spread the behavior, which has become the norm. They even nudge the<br />calves toward the boats to introduce the new arrivals into the<br />activity.<br /><br /> All the eastern Pacific gray whales come to Baja in an<br />annual migration from the Siberian-Alaskan waters where they feed. It<br />is a 13,000 mile round trip, the longest annual migration of any<br />mammal, and Russell has traveled the length of that migration, and<br />more, to interview almost everyone who has researched the gray whale<br />or campaigned on its behalf. The result is a multifaceted,<br />wide-ranging tale that takes in important stories about the<br />interaction of humans and grays. The Makah tribe in Washington resumed<br />whaling with a controversial kill in 1999, possibly of a whale that<br />thought they were friendly. They get support from the Japanese, who<br />want to bring whaling back in general.

The grays have made a comeback, but seem to be less healthy; we<br />dont know if we can blame warming of the waters or other causes, as<br />research on the whales is only in the beginning stages.<br /> Best of all,<br />though, is that the book is full of attempts to describe just what<br />happens between two species as they regard each other. \\"Once you get<br />a chance to see these whales,\\" says one observer, I think it is a<br />natural reaction to fall in love with them.

This is a great story of a one-man scientific<br />revolution. Key to the story is that Smith was a nobody. He was the<br />son of the village blacksmith and had limited schooling. He liked<br />looking at rocks, especially fossils. When he eventually became a<br />surveyor, he had the perfect job. He got it at a perfect time, when he<br />was able to descend into the coal mines and try to make sense of the<br />strata, and when surveying was needed for the canals to carry the<br />coal, canals that enabled him to see what the country all around<br />looked like when sliced into.<br /><br /> It was in 1815 that Smith's map emerged,<br />\\"A Delineation of the Strata of England and Wales With Part of<br />Scotland.\\" If mounted in one sheet, it was about nine by six<br />feet. It was an entirely different representation of Britain than<br />anyone had ever seen before, and the map's novelty and the<br />intellectual acumen which had gone into it were not lost among those<br />who knew something of fossils and digging. Unfortunately, among those<br />who appreciated the map were members of a learned organization called<br />the Geological Society, formed in London in 1807. Smith had made<br />important contributions to the fledgling science, but was pointedly<br />not invited to join; the founders were more interested in having<br />gentlemen like themselves at their meetings, and Smith would not<br />do. Furthermore, these gentlemen treated Smith even worse: they<br />admired his map, and coveted it, and stole its ideas to make their own<br />competitive copy, and undercut him. Smith landed in debtors' prison,<br />and after that lived a hand-to-mouth existence. Happily, he did get<br />recognition before he died, a heartwarming ending to a great<br />story.<br /><br /> Simon Winchester loves telling it. He can be forgiven for<br />sometimes overstating the importance of William Smith. It is, however,<br />certainly true that Smith's map was part of a new way of looking at<br />the world. It took its place in the nineteenth century's scientific<br />view of the world's history which freed people from relying on the<br />Bible as a scientific guide. Winchester is right repeatedly to tell of<br />different facets of the map's importance. He has a love of the<br />dramatic, and his words show it: \\"For the first time the earth had<br />a provable history, a written record that paid no heed or obeisance to<br />religious teaching and dogma, that declared its independence from the<br />kind of faith that is no more than the blind acceptance of<br />absurdity. A science - an elemental, basic science that would in<br />due course allow mankind to exploit the almost limitless treasures of<br />the underworld - had at last broken free from the age-old<br />constraints of doctrine and canonical instruction.\\".<br />   Simon Winchester loves telling it.

Erotica: The Siege of Adam & Eve	Books	5	10	10	N	N	The First Amendment Forever!	\\"The threat of open tyranny is remote and unlikely for us in America. Far more dangerous is the slow erosion of our liberties, particularly freedom of speech and of thought, by fervent moralists who believe they are 'improving' us.\\" So Philip D. Harvey writes, and he has often been in a position to feel the pressure from religious moralists. Harvey is the president of Adam and Eve, a North Carolina firm that started thirty years ago selling condoms by mail, and then branched into erotica and sex toys. In 1986, thirty-seven law enforcement agents, some with firearms, representing county sheriffs, state officials from North Carolina (and from Utah), and federal inspectors, descended on Harvey's firm, shut it down, and began interrogating employees. Harvey himself wasn't there, but he heard by phone about the raid as it progressed. What came of the raid was an eight year struggle against the government. Harvey tells the story of the struggle, an inspiring David-and-Goliath legal fight, in _The Government Vs. Erotica: The Siege of Adam & Eve_ (Prometheus Books), and it is a page turner that I found I had to skip sleep to finish.<br />In his legal battles, Harvey saw himself as dealing with those steeped in religious moralism: \\"...we were dealing with people for whom sexual pleasure, unless specifically linked in some way to procreation, was wrong, and the sale of sexually stimulating items could therefore not be permitted...\\" His account of the legal battle is detailed and fascinating. The North Carolina jury ruled him not guilty, but that was only the start. The Federal government, realizing that the sort of tapes Adam and Eve sold were overwhelmingly popular but were not legally obscene, developed a heinous plan to put out of business pornographers who dealt in non-obscene (and therefore legally protected) material. It would financially annihilate such firms by simultaneously prosecuting them (even when such prosecutions could not legally succeed) in several different parts of the country, over and over. The Feds had lots of money, the firms relatively little, and the aim would be simply to bankrupt legal businesses whose wares offended government agents. The extensive description of his the legal strategies is given with good humor, and Harvey also obviously enjoys telling readers about his philosophy of libertarianism and about how wrong the religious moralists are. This is a splendid, entertaining book about the rights of citizens and the eagerness of moralists with the \\"right\\" view to impose that view upon others.

There was a long history of prudery on the subject, though, which continues to have repercussions on our society and our birth rates to this day.  _Devices &amp; Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America_ (Hill and Wang) by Andrea Tone, is a sophisticated examination of how Americans went from covertly using illegal contraception in the last century to medically approved versions during this one.  It is a fascinating tale, full of passion, science, repression, American ingenuity, and Horatio Alger stories of making it big in the contraception business.<br />The dour presiding figure over all these proceedings is Anthony Comstock, who built himself up into a vice busting public servant, a special agent of the Post Office, and enforcer of the Comstock Act of 1873.  He regarded contraceptives as obscenities, insisting for religious reasons that abstinence and the then poorly-understood rhythm method were the only moral means of birth control.  Although many Americans agreed with him, Tone shows convincingly that they also were ready to use contraceptives and to tolerate their sale.  The pictures of small time contraceptive entrepreneurs, filling a need that respectable manufacturers shunned, is fascinating.  Frequently the owner of a contraceptive factory was a woman, or an immigrant, who made everything in a back room.  It took a little know-how, some natural rubber, and some sulfur for the vulcanization process; a little capital could bring high profit.  Julius Schmidt, having immigrated from Germany in 1882, went to work at a sausage casing firm, but realized that the casings could be made into something more profitable.  Comstock busted him in 1890 for selling articles to prevent conception.  Schmidt easily paid the fine, and eventually moved into the rubber trade, selling the still-available Sheik and Ramses brand condoms.  Comstockery had its last gasp in 1965, when the Supreme Court struck down a Connecticut law forbidding contraceptives even from doctors to married women.  These pages contain a fine description of the development of the birth control pill, and the debacle of the Dalkon Shield.<br />This is an amazing history of how we Americans have come to our current legal and safe birth control methods.  Unfortunately, we do not use them very well.  Tones book, full of vivid detail and very readable, demonstrates that we cling to the idea that abstinence is an effective medical and social policy.  Pregnancy rates in America for those under twenty are higher than in any developed country except Hungary.  In Sweden, by comparison, young people have sex more often, but also benefit from compulsory real sex education which includes instruction about contraceptives.  They can get contraceptives at cost or free.  Rates of pregnancy and rates of abortion are far lower than ours.  Two thirds of our group insurance plans will not pay for contraceptive pills, and the bias against women in such plans is clear, since they will cover Viagra.  This is an important history book that demonstrates that Comstocks legacy persists.preme Court struck down a Connecticut law forbidding contraceptives even from doctors to married women.

The strange creatures thus revealed posed enormous questions about creation, and the theologians quickly got into the debate.  However, as the fossilists produced more specimens, and the geologists got acquainted with the enormous span of time required in their discipline, and the paleontologists were able to classify more of the ancient beasts, the pondering on creation came under the light of science rather than theology.  Thus when the Theory of Evolution was announced in 1858, Britain was not completely unprepared for its revelations.  The foot soldiers of this transformation were the fossilists themselves, and to tell their story, Christopher McGowan, senior curator of paleobiology at the Royal Ontario Museum, has written _The Dragon Seekers: How an Extraordinary Circle of Fossilists Discovered the Dinosaurs and Paved the Way for Darwin_ (Perseus Publishing).  It is a fine description of the science versus religion battles of the time, and of how paleontology got started.<br />There is an eccentric cast of characters within these pages.  Thomas Hawkins was a master at getting monstrous specimens displayed, but was really too good at it; he helped his displays with faked bones, a deception whose controversy was elevated to the House of Commons.  Gideon Mantell had a hectic medical practice, but it was fossilizing that he loved, and because people thought he was too much of a fossilizer while not enough of a doctor, they stayed away from his practice.  He also alienated his wife and family.  Although he discovered and named the _Iguanodon_, fossils ruined him.  But the most fascinating figure in the book, though, is Mary Anning.  She has recognition now as a star discoverer of fossils, but the earliest recognition she got in her own time was, sadly, a eulogy at the Geographic Society.  She had no advantages she did not make herself.  She was poor, her family was low, and she was, of course, a woman.  She was born in Lyme Regis, a seaside hamlet on the Dorset coast, and she got her living digging out the cliff's fossils and selling them to private collectors and to academics.  She didn't just collect fossils, she analyzed them and compared them to contemporary animals.  She had no access to a formal education, but studied the papers of the published experts, sometimes hand copying them with their drawings so that she could keep them for reference.  It was, however, always the \\"clever men\\" who formally studied the specimens she discovered, and wrote them up, and named them, often without crediting her.  None of her specimens bears her name.<br />The sensational finds described here sparked heated debates on many issues.  Some who believed that God had created all, for instance, insisted that there could be no such thing as an extinction, for that would mean that God had produced some creatures mistakenly.  The enormous and ancient beasts found by the fossilists meant that people had to start questioning the usefulness of the Bible as a guide to cosmology.  In fact, most of the fossilists described in these pages believed strictly in the Bible, and were unconvinced when Lyell published on geology or Darwin on evolution.  McGowan's entertaining book fits them within the social and intellectual history of the period, and shows that although they did not directly pave the way for Darwin, their discoveries put forth evidence to be argued about, and they fostered the learned debate that has resulted in our current understanding of geology and biology.he Geographic Society.

Heather Pringle, in a wonderful book, _The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead_ (Theia), admits that she knows she is on to a good thing.  She had never heard of a Mummy Congress, but her editor at _Discover_ magazine had asked her to watch for any stories on preserved bodies.  Readers relish stories about mummies.  The information desks at museums are most often asked where the mummies are.  And Pringle makes clear in her entertaining book that mummies are still playing a role in science, pathology, religion, and politics.  As long as we stay interested in them, they have an active relation to us, and are not dead by a long shot.<br />The Mummy Congress (actually, The World Congress on Mummy Studies) holds meetings of international mummy experts every three years, and Pringle attended its third meeting, in Arica, Chile.  She got to enjoy being with many of them, and then to fly around the world to interview many more experts, and her book is full of amusing thumbnail sketches of the mummy authorities and their stories.  This is not a book of Egyptology, for Egyptian mummies are mostly covered by accounts of the ways in which people have used them long after ancient Egyptian society had crumbled.  Such uses are bizarre, like for medicine or for pigment in oil paints.  Mummies might be able to show us how disease prospered in ancient times, so we can better fight it now.  There are mummies from other regions, like Tolland Man, excavated from a Danish bog after 2,400 years, and whose bog was recently sought for making an anti-aging cream; after all, it had worked on Tolland Man.  Cherchen Man is a mummy unearthed in China with strange striped clothes and a distinctly Caucasian look.  This so alarmed the Chinese government that all research became a matter of state security.  Juanita is the beautifully well-preserved mummy from the Inca highlands, whose display by _National Geographic_ was subject to accusations of cultural imperialism; a Peruvian firm proposed to use her eggs to make a new Inca baby.  Lenin and Stalin were turned into mummies, and met distinctly different fates.  The Catholic Church used to have a requirement that a saints body had to display a lack of corruption, but has abandoned this since fans of the saints had often mummified them in some way after they died, and the dry, cool crypts of churches might provide a natural explanation for preservation not requiring anything miraculous.  Mummies are with us, and always will be.  Pringle has made a lively book out of them, and well conveys her own enthusiasm for the long-dead bodies that still have something to tell us.Geographic_ was subject to accusations of cultural imperialism; a Peruvian firm proposed to use her eggs to make a new Inca baby.

Books	5	25	25	N	N	It Wasn't Just Darwin	Everyone has heard of evolution, and everyone has heard of Charles Darwin.  Indeed, evolution is sometimes called Darwinism.  143 years after papers on the Theory of Evolution were first published, however, relatively few people know that Darwin was a co-discoverer of the theory.  Independently, Alfred Russel Wallace had come up with it, and their papers were announced together.  Wallace fully deserves as much credit for the theory as Darwin, but will never get it because of Darwin's more voluminous writings on the subject.  Nonetheless, as a scientist and as a participant in one of the great dramas of science, Wallace deserves to be better known, and there is now the first biography of him in 20 years, _Alfred Russel Wallace: A Life_ (Princeton University Press) by Peter Raby, a full and fascinating book which tells plenty about Wallace, Darwin, and their theory.<br />Comparisons to Darwin run throughout the book, quite naturally.  Darwin's background was such that he never had to worry much about getting an education or earning a living.  Wallace was the son of an attorney who fared poorly, and throughout his life had to fret about money.  His formal schooling ended at age 14, and he eventually took up as a professional collector, selling prized specimens from the Amazon and the Malay Archipelago to museums and armchair naturalists.  His explorations enabled him to view island species and boundaries, and in 1858, recovering from Malaria, he had his inspiration of survival of the fittest.  He wrote from Malay to Darwin a paper about his ideas.  Darwin was startled.  He could not honorably publish his ideas, now that Wallace had come up with them independently, but he also did not want to lose the prize of his years of work on what turned out to be the backbone of biology.  Darwin conscientiously discussed the matter with his friends, and a thoroughly decent decision was made of jointly publishing the Wallace and Darwin papers.  Wallace never wavered in his admiration for the work Darwin had done, and never was jealous that even in his lifetime, Darwin got the credit for the theory.<br />Wallace may have undermined his fame by his insistence on spiritualism, and by deeply humane political convictions on such things as land reform, women's rights, and British imperialism.  He had come up with the idea of survival of the fittest, but he championed the causes of the underprivileged in Wales as well as in Papua New Guinea.  This fine biography tells a great story of a nearly-forgotten scientist and an original and caring human being.on for the work Darwin had done, and never was jealous that even in his lifetime, Darwin got the credit for the theory.<br />Wallace may have undermined his fame by his insistence on spiritualism, and by deeply humane political convictions on such things as land reform, women's rights, and British imperialism.

It is hard to imagine any facet of dust that Holmes has not covered in remarkable detail.  House dust is here, of course.  Everyone carries around a personal cloud of dust, made of skin cells and clothes fibers, but mostly composed of unknowns.  Some of this turns into house dust, which has a surprising complex ecology of fungi and dust mites which feed upon it, and tiny, fierce pseudoscorpions that feed upon the mites.  But thinking of dust as some domestic phenomenon is a bit parochial.  Try thinking cosmic.  Holmes goes back to the Big Bang, which scattered matter all over, in unimaginably thin concentrations.  The dust grains gathered, and formed places for atoms to meet and make molecules.  That made the sun, the earth, and of course, us.  Space dust is therefore of increasing interest to cosmologists, the target now of various probes that are supposed to gather the dust out there and bring it home uncontaminated.<br />It has become alarmingly clear that dust pays little attention to national boundaries.  Oriental countries have had booming technologies run mostly on coal for electricity and diesel for transport.  In China, one out of fourteen deaths is due to noxious dusts, and its crops are flagging because they dont get as much sun as they used to.  It is only recently that we have discovered that the problem dusts of Asia are our problem, too.  The Asian Express makes regular deliveries of Gobi Desert and industrial dusts to the American northeast.  The Sahara desert sends its dusts to the eastern US about three times a summer, maybe with bacteria.  And the US dusts go to other countries, and it is all one big swaparound.  There are rivers of dust in the air, rivers that have flowed since long before we knew of any such things.  They are now bigger because of drought and land abuse, and now they carry a freight of DDT, PCBs, and other pollutants that we magnanimously thought we were only dumping onto our own national soils.  We at least know now that if we are going to protect countries from poisonous dusts, we are going to have to have a global program to do so, but whether that knowledge will actually inspire such a program is not at all clear.<br />In an amusing last chapter, Holmes emphasizes that to dust we shall return.  She summarizes the efforts of the arts of the embalmer and casketmaker only to show that dust is our destiny no matter what.  Some of us will rush the job, being burned into ash quickly after death.  It is all well and good for family members to scatter that dust in a garden or at sea, but not too terribly imaginative.  For a fee, various companies will turn that dust into keepsake brooches, duck decoys, bowling balls, fireworks, or fishing rods.  It doesnt make any ultimate difference.  The sun is getting hotter every day, and will eventually turn to hot dust all living things on our planet, and then Earth itself will get sucked into the maw of the red-giant sun, finally to become dust again.  Well, take heart.  That people can pull together this many interesting facts and stories about mere dust is one of the things that means that the ride between beginning dust and final dust is intrinsically worth taking.is all one big swaparound.

A mobster of the old style, he had a fight with a couple of guys in New York in 1970, invited them to get together to end the quarrel, and shot them both.  Everyone knew he had done the crime.  No one knew where he was.  Twenty-seven years passed, Koehler eluded capture, and the case was closed because someone had heard he was dead.  It was a cold case, and in _A Cold Case_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), Philip Gourevitch tells how the case became active again and how Koehler eventually was put in jail.  The hero of the tale is Andy Rosenzweig, chief of investigations for the Manhattan District Attorney.  He's a real good guy, the type of cop who won't goof off or take kickbacks.  He got an itch about the old crime, started interviews again, found family members, and got his man.<br />Koehler had been on the lam in Benicia, California, where he had a reputation as \\"New York Frankie,\\" a ubiquitous and well-liked fellow who walked the streets, fished, sat around drinking coffee with the regulars, and could be counted on to help sick people and especially to scare wayward youths into better behavior.  Flushed out, the sixty-eight year old Koehler returned by train to New York packing a semiautomatic.  He was cornered at Pennsylvania Station, and considered mowing the cops down in a sort of Jimmy Cagney finish, but figured, \\"What's the point now?  I'm old...  I met some nice people on the train.\\"  He cooperated with investigators, and gave a videotaped interview which fascinates Gourevitch, \\"one of the classic portraits of a criminal personality.\\"  On the tape he seems to be taking credit for the murders rather than confessing to them.  When the interviewer asks, \\"So you left the bar to get a gun?\\" Koehler insists, \\"Premeditated murder, yeah.\\"  For all his candor, he is unable to explain just why he had to kill Glennon: \\"I didn't _like_ this guy.  He was an annoyance.  I'm trying to explain it as best I can.\\"  Enigmatic and chilling are the many quotations from the interview.<br />_A Cold Case_ is a short book, but it packs a wallop in the intensity of its depiction of cop and criminal.  Gourevitch closes Koehler's story with a jailhouse interview, in which the murderer admits, \\"They didn't deserve to get killed...I'll admit to that... What can you say if you do something real bad?  Sorry?  No, that don't cut it.  I don't know what does.\\"  And Rosenzweig, in retirement, is running a book store called \\"Book 'em,\\" and unable to stay away from his area of expertise: \\"I've sort of got myself involved in an investigation up here in Rhode Island... I'll tell you about it some year.\\"  We can hope so; in Gourevitch he has had a splendid listener and an enthusiastic reporter.the many quotations from the interview.<br />_A Cold Case_ is a short book, but it packs a wallop in the intensity of its depiction of cop and criminal.

The ceremony was at a special banquet, and the Reverend Bob Marsh, a local Baptist preacher, was asked to present the award.  Wilson got a bronze plaque, and gave an acceptance speech promising continuing service to the people of Laurel.  There were photographs and smiles, and the satisfied crowd went home.  An hour later, Clifford Wilson was arrested for the murder of a black man named Vernon Dahmer; others of his Klan buddies were also arrested.  They had burned down Dahmers house and fired into the flames as he tried to defend his family.  Reverend Marsh was disgusted that he had been fooled into recognizing Wilson.  Charles Marsh, the Reverends son, tells the story of his fathers shame in _The Last Days: A Sons Story of Sin and Segregation at the Dawn of the New South_ (Basic Books).  The author moved with his family to Laurel in 1967, and was there for some of the most vile acts of racism, but was also there when the schools were integrated, so this is a valuable and unique memoir of a time when enormous changes were occurring in the south.  Neither liberal nor bigot, the Reverend Marsh confronts his hypocrisy and makes a difference.<br />_The Last Days_ is a loving look at a father who was a devoted minister, and a mother who was a devoted ministers wife, trying to make sense out of a confusing time of turmoil.  The time does seem so distant now, and it is instructive to have the author give us details of the period.  The Rev. Marsh stayed and did his part to help.  It would make a good TV movie if he had been more of an Atticus Finch from _To Kill a Mockingbird_, and it would be dramatic if he stood on the church steps in a climax to confront the men in white hoods and robes.  Marshs heroism was parceled out in smaller steps, such as the time in 1970 when a girl from his church brought a friend, a black girl, to the service.  The deacons wanted to eject the unwelcome visitor, but Marsh would not permit it; and then they insisted on an apology to the congregation, but Marsh did not give one.  He did, however, work to keep the community from being split by integration.<br />_The Last Days_ is not just about growing up in a time of changing race relations, but also is simply about growing up.  There is a fondness for family within these pages that makes the racial chill and terror stand out starkly.  The author has admiration for his parents who in some of the nations most turbulent times... held on tight to the Old Story and refused incivility the final word.  Family members ought to be very proud of this son and his fine book.  The Klan was not triumphant, and healing was begun; a harrowing and unforgettable story ends in redemption and hope.his church brought a friend, a black girl, to the service.

But we know that this is just a failure of his imagination.  The truth of the matter is that the flower has cleverly manipulated the bee into hauling its pollen from blossom to blossom.\\"  His thesis in his book is that plants have not manipulated just bees, but humans as well in the ten thousand years since agriculture started.  If we have a success with a plant, it is just as true to say that the plant is having a success with us.  We may have learned plenty, but the plants have learned as well: make a flashier flower, a tastier tuber and those humans will do just what you want.  Pollan examines apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes and finds that we are serving them well.<br />Apples we grow for sweetness, and sweetness surrounds our image of Johnny Appleseed, but Pollan shows that this strange character was not delivering apple orchards to the pioneers as much as he was delivering the alcoholic beverage cider, and incidentally he was making preserves of wild apple trees.  Tulips we grow for beauty, and it is a beauty that has driven people wild.  Pollan reviews the story of the Tulipomania of seventeenth century Holland, and shows that by what Darwin called \\"artificial selection,\\" humans chose tulips that looked fancier, and tulips got fancier in order to be chosen.  Marijuana we grow for intoxication, and Pollan admires what has happened with it: \\"_This_ was what the best gardeners of my generation had been doing all these years: they had been underground, perfecting cannabis.\\"  The government has boosted the potency of marijuana by forcing growing inside, where even carbon dioxide can be forced into the plants.  The strangest and most troubling of the four stories is the potato, which we grow as a staple crop.  Pollan got hold of the New Leaf potato from Monsanto, genetically engineered to have a toxin throughout the plant that kills beetles.  The problem is that the toxin is behaving differently from natural toxins.  Bees take it in pollen to other plants, and we know that monarch butterflies die when they eat milkweed dusted with pollen with the toxin in it; will this happen in the field?  Pollan's potatoes grow into fine specimens, needing less worry and care than his other potatoes, but they fail as a harvest; he can't make himself eat them.<br />Pollan is an avid gardener and writes about these plants, all of which he has himself raised at one time or other, with an enjoyable wit and clarity.  There is plenty of science packed into his chapters, as well as amusing personal stories and cautionary tales.  Most important, his lesson of how plants are not just objects for our manipulation but are linked in pushing us along as we push them provides a vital evolutionary lesson.ow as a staple crop.

A fascinating survey, _Libraries in the Ancient World_ (Yale University Press) by Lionel Casson, explains how the libraries were similar and different from our own, and how they managed without printing and without books as we know them.  The similarities are reassuring and often delightful.  We suspect there were Egyptian libraries, but we have never found one, because there are no masses of papyrus documents; such collections may have been lost in fires.  The Sumerians, however, had written records were in cuneiform letters, pressed into clay.  Some of the  collections of these tablets offered the privilege of borrowing, and librarians then seem to have been bothered by two of the same problems that beset librarians now, theft and damage.  Tablets bore warnings or curses calling upon the services of the local gods: \\"Whoever removes the tablet... may Ashur and Ninlil, angered and grim, cast him down, erase his name, his seed, in the land\\", \\"He who carries it off, may Adad and Shala carry him off!\\", and \\"Who rubs out the text, Marduk will look upon him with anger.\\"<br />It was the Greeks who instituted libraries with aims similar to our own, shelves full of books on a wide range of subjects, available to readers who could come in and consult them.  There was a demand for books, and by the fourth century BCE, bookselling was a flourishing industry.  The booksellers probably employed scribes to turn out copies of works.  There were no such things as royalties or author's rights.  Rome conquered all, but Greece held intellectual sway over the Romans, who continued the library tradition.  Roman libraries had bookshelves of a particular type set into the walls, and archeologists can spot the tell-tale imprint of the bookshelves and thereby identify a chamber as a library.  Independent public libraries faded as the libraries became incorporated, surprisingly, into other structures, the baths.  Here they served as part of a recreational and cultural center.  Casson ends his story with the codex and the great monastic libraries.  The codex is very much like a modern book, not a scroll, but a mass of pages sewn together with covers (perhaps of wood).  It was less bulky (both sides of the paper being used) and could be held in one hand, with the other hand taking notes.  It took a long time for the scrolls to die out, except among the Christians who used codices for their scriptures, possibly because of the pagan association to scrolls.<br />Casson, a Professor Emeritus of Classics, has gathered together an important tale not just of libraries but of reading and publishing.  It is the first full study of libraries in the ancient world.  If you love libraries and books, this is a fine book for learning about their earliest foundations.creational and cultural center.

What is the meaning of life, how can we be happy, do gods make a difference?  All are good philosophical questions, not really to be left just to professional philosophers.  It has taken centuries, but philosophers led us into the idea that humans have certain rights, something we take for granted now although we are not always good at ensuring every human gets the rights that are due.  We can allow that human well-being is pretty much the gold standard in assessing values, and perhaps we take into account animal well-being, as well as the well-being of the Earth as a biological system.  We think we can behave morally, but we have doubts that this can occur without gods of some sort.  Gods or not, we sense that there is some larger meaning, and that selfishness just won't do, but selfishness seems to run a great deal of the world.  It wouldn't be a bad thing if we could think about these ethical, philosophical issues with more clarity.<br />And so professional philosopher Simon Blackburn has given us _Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics_ (Oxford University Press).  He has distilled thousands of years of thinking on ethical issues by various philosophers into a slim book.  It may not be a Guide for Living covering every situation, but it is an admirable introduction about how philosophers think about such matters, and where we ought to look for ethical answers.  His book is witty and pithy, and demonstrates that thinking about big ideas can be fun.  But we are largely on our own in this endeavor.  Socrates, in Plato's _Euthyphro_, provided the classic challenge to the idea that ethics must have a religious foundation.  Whatever gods there are that choose right and wrong for us cannot do so arbitrarily; they have to select such things correctly.  Most gods have a system that demonstrates that we should act correctly because of fear of punishment if we don't, or desire for reward if we do.  This distorts behavior into &quot;a religious cost-benefit analysis.&quot;  Kant said true virtue was living up to a rule out of respect for that rule, not on post-mortem consequences.  It is up to us to make judgements on what rules are worth living up to.  Blackburn takes us through the pitfalls of relativism, that there is no one truth but only the different truths of different communities and times.  He discusses our current obsession with rights, and even includes as an appendix the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human rights.  Death, birth, desire, and pleasure all have chapters in his work, all fitting essays within the larger whole.<br />Hume (whom Blackburn seems mostly to follow) said that rational, scientific proof of the virtue of an action is not possible.  Blackburn does not despair over what others have seen as this unsafe or uncomforting doctrine. We share some values, and we can judge actions as reasonable or not by referring to those shared values.  Blackburn (again with Hume) argues that the ultimate standard for judging an action is its capacity to promote happiness.  He unites this with the modern philosophical ideas of contracts between humans and the state, both caring about such things as liberty and safety, in a dialogue to find common points of view.  Blackburn's view is optimistic.  We have made progress with sensitivity to the environment, to sexual differences, and to toleration of cultural differences.  &quot;If we are careful, and mature, and imaginative, and fair, and nice, and lucky, the moral mirror in which we gaze at ourselves may not show us saints.  But it need not show us monsters, either.&quot;n't, or desire for reward if we do.

Pepys was, simply, a competent and often brilliant civil servant, even though he was involved in epochal and dramatic governmental changes.  He did, however, live for thirty-four years after he had written his last diary entry, and so our picture of him is imbalanced.  Stephen Coote has written a new biography, _Samuel Pepys: A Life_ (Palgrave), to correct the distorted picture Pepys unknowingly gave us.  It is no small feat that Coote has been able to give almost as lively account of the years without the diary as the years so memorably recorded within it.<br />Pepys was the son of a London tailor who performed a social rise within his life that was almost unimaginable in his time.  Eventually as secretary to the Admiralty, he was simply brilliant at his job.  He had been raised Puritan, and although he loved his pleasures, also loved order, efficiency, control, and domination.  Some of his innovations were small but useful; no one else is on record as starting the business lunch, but Pepys took his clerks home with him, \\"by that means I having opportunity to talk to them about business, and I love their company very well.\\"  Some innovations shook the navy to its foundations, such as insisting that even a member of the upper class who bought himself an officership in the navy would have to serve a term as midshipmen and pass an examination.  A staunch loyalist, he rubbed many Whigs the wrong way, and he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for a year, accused of Popery.  It was Pepys's ability, which he had perfected in his years of naval administration, to gather massive quantities of exculpatory information that enabled him to expose and explode the case against him brilliantly.<br />As Coote says, after the diary, Pepys wrote even private memoranda which would \\"show him as a public figure.  The artist had, perforce, given way to the bureaucrat.\\"  His enormous service to the navy would have been what Pepys would have wanted to be remembered for, but his diary has made him immortal.  Coote has diligently pursued ancient administrative documents as well as letters to give a bigger picture (even if it is not possible to examine the years after the diary with any hope of Pepys's detail), and has placed him within some of the most complex decades of English history.  His explanations of the forces of history in the time are excellent, and his comprehensive portrait of the diarist and the bureaucrat gives us in full one of the most fascinating figures of English history.w him as a public figure.

Collins has done good research to bring us these funny true stories and has a dry, sharp style that is a delight.<br />The title tale is about John Banvard, who in the 1850s was the most famous living painter in the world, and possibly the first millionaire artist in history.  Why havent you heard of him before now?  Because time swallowed him up.  Banvard sailed down the Mississippi and sketched all he saw on the 3,000 mile voyage.  He then painted what he had sketched, producing the biggest picture ever, said to be three miles long.  The panorama was rolled up, and he displayed it on stage as it rolled by, while he gave narration and was accompanied by piano waltzes he had commissioned.  His performance pieces were slow at first, but became a sensation, as he played Boston, New York, and then London, where he impressed the royal family and Charles Dickens.  Banvard spent time in London museums, being taught to read hieroglyphics; he then sailed down the Nile to make another panoramic painting.  He was troubled with those sincerest flatterers, imitators; he had made a huge fortune, but his invention was so popular that scores of other panoramas were on tour.  He decided to set up, instead, as a museum keeper, his huge display of curios in a massive New York building, described as the best museum in Manhattan.  In this, he was in competition against P. T. Barnum, who was by far the most capable promoter, and Banvard returned to the frontier where he was once again a poor and unknown painter.  A few panels of his many paintings are all that remain of his work.<br />Here you will find the astonishing story of Englishman William Henry Ireland, born in 1775, who because his father never thought much of his writing, started forging plays by Shakespeare, and created a literary sensation.  We read also the sad story of Delia Bacon, who was one of the first lunatics to write profusely on the theory that Shakespeare was not Shakespeare, but was a front for a collaborative effort by Walter Raleigh, Edmund Spenser, and Francis Bacon.  A lighter note is the story of Robert Romeo Coates, whose beyond-hammy acting brought down the house, when his Romeo died not once but three times.  There is a chapter on Blondlots N-rays, probably the most famous incident described in the book, an incident of scientific self-delusion.  There is one on John Cleves Symmes, an Ohioan who did everything he could to convince his countrymen about the holes at the poles of the Earth which would lead to its hollow core.  Theres one on A.J. Pleasanton, who shined blue light on everything imaginable and improved it.<br />And more.  Collins has done an amazing amount of research into long-lost books and pamphlets to bring us these astonishing instructive stories and amazing cautionary tales, the sorts of tales that the proverb Truth is stranger than fiction was coined for.  He has wry comments within his storytelling which makes reading his words great fun, and the stories are incomparable.  Losers were never so fascinating.he most capable promoter, and Banvard returned to the frontier where he was once again a poor and unknown painter.

I got to know her writing from her uninhibited diary entries at the fine adult site Nerve.com (The Community of Thoughtful Hedonists).  So, I was glad to take a look into _Dancing Queen_ in order to understand the past of this peculiar woman.  It is a slim volume of her essays on white trash, kissing, other ladies bodies, and more.  It is enormous fun.  Whats nice is that as different as Lisa is from anybody, she is happy and optimistic.  Ive done lots of stupid things, but Ive enjoyed myself.  _Dancing Queen_ is about _liking_ stuff.  Its about how pleasing it can be to be poked and probed  by the hairdresser, by the gynecologist, by killer bears, by the thirty-six-year-old ski instructress in _Princess Daisy_.  She is impatient with those who dont have fun; she cannot comprehend a whole essay by a woman who was upset that some men hooted at her, for instance.  I _like_ to be hooted!  She gives us rants that certainly are self-indulgent, but you cannot expect anything different from someone who indulges herself with such lewdness, shamelessness, and fun.<br />Not only are her opinions odd, but it is obvious she enjoys getting them into words.  In the chapter about her sensual enjoyment of a trip to the gynecologist (It is the _illicit_ pleasure caused by _necessary_ procedures performed by _removed_ professionals that gets my temperature rising.), she says that a certain kind of girl likes a visit to the gynecologist as much as Christmas: It only happens once a year and she gets lots of things she wants.  She skips to the clinic while visions of speculums dance in her head.  She gushes over the ghost-written novels of perfect specimen Fabio (Hes always mentioning condoms in his pirate books) and informs us that They contain bold lines like:<br />  1. I am a man of the sea.  2.  Go hide in the fields, woman.  3.  Mayhaps she thinks I am doing something bad.<br />It was this sort of literature that fired her pre-adolescent fantasies: At twelve, I had as much sex drive as the entire U.S. Army and absolutely no idea what to do with it.  Not to worry; she has since learned.  They sold me a roadmap to ecstasy covered in highways of trouble, and I couldnt wait to visit every site on the map.<br />Lisa is hilarious when discussing just a trip to the hairdresser, or K-Mart, or Olivia Newton John, but the best chapter in the book is entitled An Iron Fist in a Polyester Glove: Lawrence Welk.  What is he doing here?  Well, when Lisa was little, To me, the constant, ultra-close-ups of moist-lipped, moist-eyed, soft-bosomed lady singers lined up side by side in matching outfits like chickens to be plucked were an open call to perversion.  She has since made an extensive study of Lawrences several autobiographies, where she must have learned that he originally picked up an accordion and set out to conquer the world, as Lawrence Welk &amp; His Hotsy Totsy Boys.  While she doesnt gloss over Lawrences famous temper, she finds, surprisingly, a kindred spirit, someone who had a dream: extreme close ups of _nice_ people singing nice songs and dancing anachronistic dances against insanely cheerful backdrops.  Its a beautiful dream!<br />This isnt for everyone.  Lisa is frank, naughty, and lustful.  She throws sexual fantasies in even when discussing a sequence of post-Glasnost Russian leaders.  If you like smart people who write enthusiastically well, and if you appreciate that to be peculiar is also to be interesting, this is certainly worth a look.  Oh, and hot off the Lisa Diaries on Nerve.com: Lisa is trying to get pregnant again.  That kid is going to have plenty to think about.e:<br />          1. I am a man of the sea.           2.

What does not get acknowledged is that those frustrations, as common as they are, are only frustrating because they are so uncommon.  Most of the time our memories function incredibly well.  But as in most of neuroscience, when the brain doesn't function well, that's when we get a picture of what it is doing.  A fascinating book, _The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers_ (Houghton Mifflin) by Daniel L. Schacter, details just how memory goes wrong, and gives some answers about why.  Most important, it tells how at least some of memory's mistakes are directly related to it's remarkable, almost error-free, functioning.  Schacter is a neuropsychologist who has written about memory in both academic and popular publications, but his descriptions of the seven ways memory fails are novel, and everyone will recognize at least some of the failures, since they are universal.<br />Schacter devotes a chapter to each of the sins, like transience, absentmindedness, and so on.  There is a chapter on the sin of blocking.  We have a phrase for it: \\"It's on the tip of my tongue.\\"  This one is so universal that of fifty-one languages surveyed, forty-five have a similar phrase (the Cheyenne translates to \\"I have lost it on my tongue.\\").  It is far more likely to happen when you are trying to remember someone's name; remembering Mr. Baker is much harder to remember than the word \\"baker\\" because Mr. Baker designates one individual, whereas \\"baker\\" designates a well known range of activities and products.  One of the traps people fall into is while trying to retrieve a tip-of-the-tongue word, they find a sound-alike word and keep hitting on that, which delays finding the target word.<br />There is lots that can go wrong with memory, and Schacter presents amazing clinical cases, like the man who had no capacity to remember anyone's name while he could remember other things without difficulty, to show specific and extreme problems.  But in the final chapter of the book Schacter reports that these sins are not design flaws, not products of a basically defective system.  He uses (but does not over-use) evolutionary biology to show that brains have made trade-offs to produce a useful working system that will quite naturally fail in some instances.  It might be handy to remember absolutely everything, but then our minds would be too crowded to do other things efficiently; there have been cases of people who formed memories of virtually everything that happened to them, and were so inundated with details they could not function in the real world.  The brain is made to forget things it does not use regularly.  You can read this book and become more forgiving about your own forgetfulness and others; Schacter's readable, fascinating account will make you admire just how well your faulty memory works.ulty, to show specific and extreme problems.

In the prosecution of a particularly brutal murder in 1905, Scotland Yard introduced fingerprints to the courtroom, after decades of rejecting their use.  The history of early fingerprinting makes surprisingly good reading in _Fingerprints: The Origins of Crime Detection and the Murder Case that Launched Forensic Science_ (Hyperion) by Colin Beavan.<br />The horrid murder serves as introduction to the book, and its resolution by fingerprint is the climax.  In between is a fascinating story that involves legal philosophy as well as science and history.  For instance, throughout most legal history, the only evidence allowed in court was eyewitness testimony; even now, the words of an eyewitness are thought by the public to be especially weighty, although it has become clear especially in the last decades that memories are malleable and that eyewitness testimony is often worse than useless.  Physical evidence was held to be too likely to be manipulated; juries relied on hearing what people remembered seeing with their own eyes rather than what experts said they could deduce by objective methods.  Science had wrought the changes of  the industrial revolution, but had not touched the judiciary.<br />There was a system that had been invented by a Frenchman, Alphonse Bertillon, consisting of numerous, minute body measurements, such as finger and forearm lengths.  This was the competition to fingerprinting, whose advantages were less obvious.  A Scotland-born doctor, Henry Faulds, while in Japan as a missionary, noticed that there were finger impressions in ancient pottery, and began to study fingerprints as unique identifiers.  It was he who discovered that fingerprints did not change as people aged, and that using sandpaper, razor, or acid to obliterate fingerprints made no difference, as when healed, the prints grew back exactly in the previous manner.  Here was an easy way to identify people permanently.  But Faulds was robbed of credit for his research, mostly by the brilliant snob Francis Galton.  He died in 1930, still not even a footnote in the fingerprint story.  This book corrects the oversight.  _Fingerprints_ tells a good deal about the scientific infighting for credit for fingerprinting, and the process by which it became a forensic endeavor.  It mentions a few modern aspects of the science, such as the new FBI computer that can compare 65 million fingerprint sets, and the new capacity to lift prints from paper or even human skin.  Best of all, it uses several crime dramas from the turn of the last century to tell an engrossing story of how fingerprinting, in which no policeman had confidence, started on its way to becoming the most important police identification technique.e prints grew back exactly in the previous manner.

Cohen followed the company from its selection of a controversial play (involving serious cerebral themes and nudity) beyond the final cast party.  She seems to have been everywhere, watching both on and off stage drama.  She must thank her good fortune at reporting on just this troop.  The people involved have plenty of humor; with all the stress in getting this production running, they had to.  But they are truly serious artists; this is established by the choice of the play and the discussion group held before any rehearsal, in which are covered \\"everything from gender and sexual politics to Sino-French relations to ethnic stereotyping to the Chinese Cultural Revolution.\\"  Cohen could not have lit upon a more fascinating cast for her own work.  They are headed by the ambitious director Celia, who is by day a manager of a Hewlett-Packard branch office.  She has the extraordinary capacity to assign people to jobs at which they had no idea they could succeed. The Chinese opera star is played by Patrick, a self-effacing stranger she has picked and who seems at times a disastrously wrong choice.  The main role is given to Jimmy, a veteran of the ADC who has ACTOR 1 for his license plates, and who undergoes terrifying, inexplicable lapses of memory for his lines even in the week before his performance.  It is probably not giving anything away to tell that Cohen isn't reporting on a failure, but she builds up to a pitch of excitement in approach of the opening night that is delicious.  The book's drama is sufficient that it is easy to imagine it becoming its own play.<br />This turns out to be an engrossing tale where one would least expect it.  \\"No written contracts have been signed, no cash exchanged, no professional reputations put at stake to help ensure that the promises are kept, the goals met.  All they can do for the moment is skate along on that sheer, fine surface of trust, waiting for a firmer base to form beneath it.\\"  The narrative of the formation of that base, the process of creating by a temporary family of amateurs (the word comes from the root meaning \\"love,\\" and these people do love what they are doing), who in some cases jeopardize jobs and marriages in order to get their artistic dream realized, is an unforgettable and illuminating story.out to be an engrossing tale where one would least expect it.   \\"No written contracts have been signed, no cash exchanged, no professional reputations put at stake to help ensure that the promises are kept, the goals met.

Wolfe, you are probably guilty of a form of chauvinism you didn't even know existed, \\"surface chauvinism.\\"  You know there are roots down there, and you have seen earthworms, but other than those, you may not have any appreciation for just how complicated things are beneath your feet.  Wolfe, who does research in soil conservation and biodiversity, has set out to increase appreciation for his world, in Tales from the Underground: A Natural History of Subterranean Life (Perseus Publishing).  Not only can you stop being a surface chauvinist, but by reading this book you will have a foundation in some radically new biological ideas that are changing foundations of science.<br />In these pages, you will meet Dr. Carl Woese, who in 1976 suspected that the lowly methane-producing soil bacterium he was examining was something entirely different.  He started doing analyses on the nucleic acid (specifically, RNA) in the creatures, and confirmed that they were more different from regular bacteria than humans are from redwood trees.  He had not found a new species, but an entirely new superkingdom of organisms.  You will become acquainted with microbial communities thousands of feet down, who thrive in hot temperatures, dark, high pressure, and lack of oxygen.  They feed on oil or other carbon sources, or on hydrogen in the rocks.  One of the results of these findings is that they seem to make the possibility of life on other planets more likely; it used to be that we looked for planets that had just about the same sunlight, water, and so on as our own, but this was another example of chauvinism.  You will find out just how the lowly fungus has an intimate and essential relation to the roots of almost every plant, and about prairie dogs, and other animals digging around underneath.<br />Of course earthworms get a chapter in this enjoyable book, and the chapter is especially enjoyable because it concentrates on the work of Charles Darwin.  Darwin has other claims to fame, but his last published work was on the humble earthworm.  He studied them for decades, and even did an experiment of spreading chalk over a field and returning twenty-nine years later to see how much soil and vegetable mould had been brought up by the earthworms (six inches).  The mild and tentative Darwin could not avoid controversy even in his ardent work on earthworms.  Before his work, earthworms were regarded as garden pests which ate up the roots of plants, and though we now value earthworms, it took a while for their reputation to change.<br />Wolfe shows how soils are generally suppressants of disease (Selman Waksman was a soil biologist who found microbes that produced streptomycin), how bioremediation can be affected by humble bacteria or fungi that tie up heavy metals or clean up oil spills, and how by working with, rather than against, the millions of species within the earth, we might reclaim soil and reduce global warming.  Leonardo da Vinci said, \\"We know more about the movement of celestial bodies than about the soil underfoot.\\"  It is still true, but let us hope Wolfe's efforts make some difference.claims to fame, but his last published work was on the humble earthworm.

It is a three-fold work: the history of the spice; Willard's personal history with it (a foundation for pleasing essays from a sensuous woman); and assorted recipes.  I have not had enough saffron to consider myself a fan, and I have not tried the given recipes for saffron-soaked custard, pork, lobster, or paella, but I can tell you they sound good, and that Willard has written two previous well-regarded story-and-recipe books on pie and on broths.  Cooks are probably in good hands.<br />It is enormous fun, with Willard as a laughing guide, to see world history as saffron history.  She speculates that the makers of Persian carpets found saffron a useful yellow dye and its smell from the vats turned it into a perfume, and then the cooks tried it.  The Egyptians used it as perfume, but especially liked the bright yellow for the clot in which to wind their dead.  Alexander the Great had plenty of chances to soak up the cultures of his conquests, and liked saffron baths and tea and rice, and before dinner he had wine with saffron mixed into it.  Saffron, unlike other spices, could be grown in England, and it still was costly, so it made the fortunes of such towns as Walden, which became Saffron Walden.  It was only when new discoveries like capers, sugar cane, and vanilla came from the new world, and banquets were pared from forty dishes to a puritanical ten or so, that saffron began to wane.  The ounces of saffron that could be harvested from acres of crocuses eventually became tons of potatoes and corn, crops that were dependable and less fussy.<br />Willard's history is good, but her personal stories are the best writing in the book.  Her bittersweet recounting of going to the Saffron Festival in Spain, where Saffron isn't grown in any quantity anymore, is fine travel writing, and her introduction to the spice by a mysterious stranger who came to call on her has the bittersweet extended into eroticism.  She has a rich memory of what happened after her mother's death: \\"Of all the things that go through your mind when you watch death approach, thinking of food may seem the most absurd, maybe even a little obscene.  And yet it is what the living almost always turn to... the living's way of breaking away, the body understanding before the mind fully does what is the necessary and correct order demanded in the wider world.\\"  The way Willard writes about the subsequent effect of the saffron cr&egrave;me brûl&eacute;e pie (recipe, of course, included here) would have made her mother proud.  Willard can tell us also of her own successful growing and harvesting of saffron, in Brooklyn.  This is a book of many delights, a gathering of all sorts of saffron stories and histories, tasty, pungent, and wonderfully personal.ho came to call on her has the bittersweet extended into eroticism.

Some of us know the words, although we can't sing it unless we are singers of special talent, because of the reach of range of the notes (the \\"red glare\\" of the rockets makes most people's voices break).  And every American who knows some history knows that Frances Scott Key, watching the bombardment of Fort McHenry from the shore of Baltimore Harbor, saw the Star-Spangled Banner flying over the fort, and wrote the poem bearing that name on the back of an envelope, and since then it has been our national anthem, sung before baseball games starting from the last century.  All this history is pleasant, but it is not at all true.<br />Setting the record straight about our most famous flag and its anthem is the purpose of _The Flag, the Poet, &amp; the Song: The Story of the Star-Spangled Banner_ (Dutton) by Irvin Molotsky, a fun look at an important part of American history.  It is important history because of the emphasis we place on our sacred flag, and it is important to see how we often get that history wrong.  It shows how in the War of 1812, the British looked invincible advancing onto Baltimore after burning Washington (which they did in retaliation for the Americans unjustifiably burning Toronto).  Frances Scott Key, a lawyer, was commissioned by President Madison to negotiate freedom for a captured American, and thus was on a British ship when the bombardment of Fort McHenry took place.  He did not see the huge Star-Spangled Banner under bombardment; a smaller, less valuable one was flying in the rain, but the big one was raised the next morning.  He wrote his poem, \\"The Defence of Fort McHenry,\\" not the title by which we know it, and someone discovered it could be sung to \\"Anacreon in Heaven,\\" a jolly English drinking song.  It was popular, but it was not adopted as the National Anthem until 1931, and the choice was controversial.  Critics said that the music ought to be of a more modest range so everyone could sing it, and that it should not be derived from a British tune, much less a drinking song since America was under prohibition.  Most objections were about the martial lyrics, which would give \\"to millions of children who sing it the notion that the only real patriotism is warlike activity.\\"  This and its unsingablility are objections that continue to be brought up, when \\"America the Beautiful\\" or \\"God Bless America\\" are proposed as replacements, but the anthem is secure.<br />Molotsky's book is largely a happy miscellany of flag and anthem lore.  It spends a chapter on the proposed constitutional amendment to prevent flag burning (General Colin Powell: \\"I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants.  The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.\\").

It has been copied and parodied relentlessly for over five hundred years.  It shows Jesus at the center of a dining table, flanked by six disciples on either side.  Everyone knows _The Last Supper_, but few know as much about it as Leo Steinberg, who has looked and written and thought about it for thirty years.  The result of these decades of concentration are poured out in _Leonardo's Incessant Last Supper_ (Zone Books), as close an examination of a painting as you will ever find.  The book is not about the painting's history, its decay, or its restoration; it is, in astonishing detail, about the looks of the picture itself and a demonstration of how it continues to be an \\"incessant\\" font of thought and speculation as to its meaning.  Steinberg's big book is wonderfully well illustrated, with details from the original, a generous gatefold to show it in its current restored state, pictures of how it looks within the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, how Rubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and a host of others copied the painting (and how they left out significant parts, and what the omissions mean), and plenty of diagrams to show such things as the lines of perspective and the effects of matrices and diagonals on Leonardo's meticulously planned original.<br />Steinberg has chapters on the disciples, on feet and hands, on the disciples, and more.  The main figure, that of Jesus, bears, of course, the closest examination, and Steinberg details the history of thought about it, with writers weighing in on the meaning of the pose and the timing within the Gospel story of the scene depicted.  Over and over, Steinberg shows that to seek a meaning and a timing is in vain.  Leonardo has deliberately engineered his work so that any explanation involving a single meaning will be an oversimplification.  Jesus's right hand is downturned in a gesture of apprehension.  It is close to a mirror image of the left hand of Judas as they reach simultaneously towards the dish by which Jesus will designate his betrayer.  It is also gesturing towards the wine, so that it marks the institution of the Eucharist; after reading Steinberg's work, the idea that Leonardo drew these two separate parts of the story together and told them as one is only one of the multiple meanings that seem natural on further reflection.  Jesus's left hand is upturned, gesturing toward the bread.  It also underlies the portentous hand of Thomas, hovering directly above it.  Thomas's hand has an index finger pointing up, continuing the upturn theme of Jesus's left, and indicating, of course, higher things.  It is Thomas's index finger that would soon be feeling around for confirmation of Jesus's wounds.<br />To read this book is to appreciate a hundred telling details in the painting which one did not notice before, and consequently to admire Leonardo's genius anew.  It is also to admire the fruition of the decades of Steinberg's close study.  His readers may feel a sense of humility that there was so much to see that had previously escaped them, but his witty, sure, and genial expertise will welcome them into seeing _The Last Supper_ with new vision.simultaneously towards the dish by which Jesus will designate his betrayer.

He has been regarded as an intellectual giant, a genius of languages, a dupe, a fraud, and a prophetic mystic, among other things.  A new biography, _The Queen's Conjurer: The Science and Magic of Dr. John Dee, Adviser to Queen Elizabeth I_ (Henry Holt) by Benjamin Woolley, shows how he was all of this and more.  It is a clear biography of a fascinating figure, and an examination into the way of thought of Dee's times.<br /> Dee first came to the attention of the larger world when at the age of nineteen, as a student in Cambridge, he mounted a play by Aristophanes, _Peace_, which calls for a giant dung beetle to fly the hero up to the palace of Zeus.  Calling upon his passion for mathematics, before there were stage tricks such as projectors, lighting, motors, or fog machines, Dee indeed made a giant beetle fly around the main hall of Trinity College.  He astonished the audience, and no one knows how he did it, but some suspected black magic, a suspicion that was forever to taint him.  Woolley shows that although Dee was a serious astronomer and chemist, he was also an astrologer and alchemist, but also shows how magic pervaded Renaissance thought.  What really makes Dee extreme is his close association with \\"scryvers,\\" spiritual mediums who gazed at crystal balls to consult with spirits.  The scryver most associated with Dee, because of almost twenty years of joint work together, was Edward Kelley, a histrionic and demanding seer whom Dee originally distrusted and then began to use to lay a foundation for a system of occult knowledge.  Kelley would look into Dee's crystal balls and report the visions; Dee could never see them, but he took down voluminous notes and tried to make sense of them.  He worked for years on understanding the strange pre-Babel language the spirits were supposed to be showing.<br />Power and riches eluded Dee, however much of the language he came to understand.  He and Kelley were astonishingly busy, pulled by their language researches, divining for treasure, and pursuing various occult projects.  Dee did astrological consultations all his life, earning some money thereby.  He constantly sought some sort of sinecure within Elizabeth's court, and only intermittently was successful.  In 1589, after six years in Europe,  Dee returned to his home near London and found it in ruins, with his huge library and collections of scientific equipment stolen.  His reputation had been stolen, as well.<br />Woolley proves himself a guide who can benefit us by his meticulous research.  Dee left many intimate records, not only of all the things the spirits revealed to him, but of his daily activities, his wife's menses, the couple's copulations, his dreams, and more.  Woolley has intimately described the mystical foolishness as well as the scientific practicality of a mysterious man who ought to be better known as a significant intellectual figure.wing.<br />Power and riches eluded Dee, however much of the language he came to understand.

Will buildings still be important?  Or, perhaps, will there be e-religion that people practice at home, just as they e-shop rather than going to the mall?  According to Brenda E. Brasher, we already have e-religion, as shown in her book _Give Me That Online Religion_ (Jossey-Bass).  A funny, imaginative work, it is also a serious look at how online religion has gotten its start in what humans will surely look back on as the most primitive days of the internet.  Brasher teaches religion and philosophy, and for more than a decade has been taking a look at various religious websites.  She has had her work cut out for her; there are more than a million sites of diverse religious affiliation, drawing believers as well as those simply curious.  Perhaps this is just the internet way of distributing tracts, but Dr. Brasher says no: \\"online religion is the most portentous development for the future of religion to come out of the twentieth century\\" and \\"could become the dominant form of religious experience in the next century.\\"<br />Those familiar with basic traditional religions will find that they have moved onto the Web without much change; perhaps the literal Bible, apocalyptic ones are over-represented, just as they are on TV.  There are others in this book that any reader will find strange.  Some sites are direct offshoots of IRL (In Real Life) religious practice, like online prayer chains and chat rooms where people can go for a more-or-less directed Sunday school.  The site of EvilPeople, Inc., invites people to click on a button in order to sell their souls.  (A soul was recently put up for sale on e-Bay.)  There are memorials to many dead people; there are 8,000 Brasher has counted devoted to Princess Diana alone.  There are strange and comic religious sites.  Brasher never mentions the surrealistic site of the Church of the Subgenius (\\"The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die!\\") or the subversively comic realism of the Landover Baptist Church (\\"Where the Worthy Worship and the Unsaved Are Not Welcome.\\")  She does explain that much of the religion on the web is suffused with over-the-top humor.  There are what she calls \\"Celebrity Altars,\\" devoted to some sort of worship of someone famous, and she gives extensive quotes from the site \\"Dudes of the Keanic Circle,\\" devoted to finding, among other things, the esoteric meanings of the films of Keanu Reeves.  Keanu as Christ-figure is very weird, and so is another site that holds Keanu as the Antichrist, confusingly enough.  The Transhumanists are interested in the typical religious goal of eternal life, but intend to do so by uploading their brains onto the `net (undoubtedly Windows is merely withholding this software until their legal problems are worked out).  There are many strange religions in this book.  There are some not so strange, as the cyber-seder, and the woman who was drawn to convert to Judaism because of it.<br />Brasher does a good job of explaining how chat rooms and Web sites work, for those who don't know much about the `net.  She draws instructive parallels about previous shifts in media within religion; who is to say that the Web will not, as the years go by, have as much effect as Luther's use of the new technology of the printing press?  She is an advocate for watching with curiosity the way religion branches in cyberspace, and for its protection in the face of commercialization.  She is right to point out that those who grow up on the web may find the agrarian and pastoral images of inherited religion less credible than they find futuristic fiction.

Rick says, \\"Henri wants us to finish this bottle then three more.  He says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink any of it.\\"  The invaluable Sam then says it takes the sting out of being occupied, Rick says, \\"Here's looking at you, kid,\\" and the Germans come on.  It's a good bet they didn't get any of Henri's prized champagne.  That was fictional, but it's true, too.  The French had many ways of denying the Germans the pleasures of their vineyards, and many of the ways were overwhelmingly successful.  The amazing story is told in _Wine &amp; War: The French, the Nazis, &amp; the Battle for France's Greatest Treasure_ (Broadway Books) by Don and Petrie Kladstrup, and it is a rousing one, a view of the war never before told.<br />It is fun to read the stories of how the winemakers fooled the Nazis, making false walls in their cellars and gathering spiders to the wall, so that they might make the wall look old, or putting bad wine into bottles that bore good labels.  It must have delighted the French when they could fob bad wine off as good without the Nazis knowing any better.  Many of the cloak-and-dagger operations involving wines and winemakers were far from funny, however successful they might have been.  The wine cellars, many of which were labyrinthine caves that had been dug centuries before, proved to be excellent places to hide members of the Resistance.  Also, those with cellars turned out to be sources of valuable intelligence.  A big shipment ordered for \\"a very hot country\\" turned out to be among the first indications the Allies had that the North African campaign was beginning.<br />_Wine &amp; War_ explains how the German \\"wine fuehrers\\" played a dangerous double game, helping the winemakers to keep their trade going.  It also gives a vintner's view of the history of the collaboration government of Field Marshal P&eacute;tain, who was himself a vineyard owner.  It explains how much the memories of wine helped inspire French prisoners of war, and how the dangerous furtive manufacture of copper sulfate (used to combat fungus) was carried out underneath the nose of the Germans, who wanted copper for the war effort.  It shows how although many of the vineyards at liberation were ruined, some of them could break open their walled-up bottles and sell them to gain funds to get everything started again.  This is a fascinating book which will please those interested in the history of the period, as well as those who know something about wines.  Ronald Barton, who ran estates in Bordeaux, used to make it a practice to drink one of his good bottles of wine with dinner throughout the war.  His private toast was, \\"Here's one less for the Germans if they win, one less for my heirs if we do.\\"  Winemakers throughout France helped in many surprising ways to make it the heirs' loss.aboration government of Field Marshal Pétain, who was himself a vineyard owner.

The debt would be canceled if she would merely bring him from Easter communion the host, the sanctified bread.  She may have simply kept the host in her mouth and removed it secretly.  The Jew, once he had the host, applied to it various tests to see of what it was made.  He knew that Christians of the time believed that it had quite literally transubstantiated into the body of Christ, but he wished to see \\"whether the insane things which Christians prattle about are true.\\"  He stabbed at it with his knife, but it remained uncut.  Even so, it began to bleed.  He tortured it in various ways, nailing it to a board, throwing it into a fire, and boiling it.  The host remained whole and bleeding, until the boiling, when it turned into a crucifix above the pot.  The Jew may have been amazed, but he was stubbornly unconvinced, although seeing such a spectacle immediately converted his wife and children.<br />This is a legend told repeatedly with many variations in _Gentile Tales: The Narrative Assault on Late Medieval Jews_ (Yale University Press) by Miri Rubin.  Such stories were widespread throughout medieval Europe as a part of accepted folklore, and were held as true by even the educated in the priesthood.  Not only were the stories believed, but they formed the incitement to action against Jews, resulting in torture, death, forfeiture of lands and goods, and banishment.  The picture of Jews given in the various versions of the tales were of unredeemable brutality and greed, at least on the part of the male Jews; the females were less vicious and more tractable.  Jews insisted on kidnapping little Christian children, for instance, to drink their blood in grotesque ceremonies in the synagogues.  The stories reinforced themselves and made clear to medieval Christians what sort of people they were dealing with.<br />It is perplexing to try to make sense of such things eight centuries later.  Sometimes investigations of bleeding hosts did discover simple fraud; a priest could sprinkle a host with blood and hide it in the house of Jews he wished to betray.  Usually, of course, no such fraud would be found, the wrath of Christians in a village would turn into a riot, and pious mobs would extract what they saw as justice.  A mob in 1306 in St. Polten, near Vienna, was so violent and indignant, that it trampled some of its own members.  Rubin shows how the story from Paris traveled around Europe like a spark lighting a series of fires, making trouble for Jews wherever it went.<br />_Gentile Tales_ shows the horror stories from contemporary plays and poems, but does special service in reproducing illustrations of the nasty Jews torturing the host from illustrated manuscripts, altar pictures, oil paintings, and stained glass windows, as a show of how nearly universal such tales were.  The illustrations would be lovely, if they weren't so grotesque, but even so, Yale University Press has put out a good looking volume on glossy paper with many color plates.  It is a good book for anyone with an interest in medieval times, but ought to be required reading for those who wish to see one of the lamentable foundations for the relations between Christians and Jews.turies later.

It is a great monument to a forgotten explorer and collector.<br />Andrews began an autobiographical volume with a foreword that included the words, \\"I was born to be an explorer.  There was never any decision to make.  I couldn't do anything else and be happy.\\"  He had humble beginnings in Benoit, Wisconsin, but dreamed of exploring for the American Museum of Natural History in New York.  He literally told the director there that if it were just a matter of mopping the museum floors, that was what he wanted to do.  And he did it, eventually becoming the director of the museum.  From floors he went to taxidermy, and then to field expeditions about whales, and then to his five huge famous expeditions into Mongolia from 1922 to 1930.  Andrews had superb skills at planning and organizing his expeditions, but was he was a brilliant salesman, enlisting the financial aid of members of New York society.  The descriptions of his expeditions make exciting reading, as sandstorms, snowstorms, and brigands all battered the cars, camels, and explorers.  But he brought back dinosaur eggs, which caused a sensation, _Velociraptor_, and much more.<br />_Dragon Hunter_ is a well researched and at times exciting telling of the adventures of an American original.  Gallenkamp has usefully summarized the Mongolian regional politics as well as New York society of the time, and has made it clear just how the publicity-happy Andrews became a sensation in his day.  His record had been sadly neglected by the museum, which is now making amends.  The book ends with an epilogue to show how the finds that Andrews fought to get back to the museum have proved a foundation of much of modern paleontology.

1950105:US	50895620	RJZ8TRXYGSMWU	0761123849	696216471	In Code: A Mathematical Journey	Books	5	49	49	N	Y	A Girl's Guide to Cryptology and More	Number theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with counting numbers, 1, 2, 3...  Sarah Flannery, born in 1982, entered that world because her father was a mathematician.  What happened to Sarah is that she entered the number theory and cryptology world at age 16 with a science project that was new and original, and was a challenge to the way prime numbers were being used in the most popular of encryption systems.  She has written _In Code: A Mathematical Journey_ (Workman Publishing) about how this happened, and its aftermath (or After Math, as a final section of the book is called).  It is a delight.  It is a book of mathematics, it is true, but it is also an inspiring look at a girl who had an exemplary upbringing and a strong streak of intellectual curiosity.<br />Central to Sarah's story is the blackboard in the dining room of her home.  She grew up in the shadow of Blarney Castle, she and her four brothers raised by an independent-thinking pair of parents.  At meals, the blackboard would be the focal point for discussion of puzzles.  She gives plenty of these for the reader to work on.  Some are familiar, like, \\"Given a five-liter jar and a three-liter jar and an unlimited supply of water, how do you measure out four liters exactly?\\"  Some got into more difficult concepts: \\"How might you  determine the average earnings of a group of people in a room (at a class reunion, perhaps) without any individual's divulging his or her salary?\\"  This second puzzle gives a clue into getting information and hiding information, a theme throughout the book.  (All the puzzles are left for the reader to work on, and such work will repay effort in understanding the book, but answers are given.)<br />  Sarah repeatedly and sweetly apologizes for digging deep into number theory; before explaining matrices, she writes, \\"I promise that from then on there will be no more explicit mathematics, only light explanations of mathematical ideas.\\"  The main mathematical parts of the book are restricted to two chapters which she invites those who just can't stand the math to skim, and then there are appendices available for those who want to learn more.  Sarah's project explained how the most famous current encoding system works, but before she was done, she had invented one of her own.  She explains both systems and a lot of number theory along the way.  She tells about her interactions with the judges for the competition, and the pressures that eventually resulted in her winning a silver trophy, a cash prize, fame, travel, and interactions with the media.  Her lively descriptions of what happened after the newspapers got hold of the story of the genius girl are among the most amusing parts of the book; she and her family turned down a contract with Pepsi, but she did help in an article about herself which appeared in the Spice Girls pop magazine.<br />Here is a book full of mathematical ideas that are worth knowing about, and a bright, funny, modest young woman to lead us through them; Sarah denies that she is a genius, saying that she has met geniuses and that she does not have the spark that distinguishes genius from mere intelligence.  Maybe so, but she is a likable author, and it is a delight to hear her describe with affection her parents who obviously know what they are doing.  But perhaps the most inspiring part of the book is how well the mathematical community came together to nurture this newcomer.  Time and again, experts who worked in the cryptology field were eager to help out.  When it seemed that her new code system was patentable and might even make her a millionaire, Sarah got advice even from the mathematicians who might have shared in the bounty that, as one wrote her, \\"Mathematics should be above such mercenary nonsense!\\"  Mathematical ideas should be freely shared by all, she agreed.  It turns out that her system eventually proved vulnerable to attack, thus not quite as secure as the first system, but it doesn't matter.  Sarah's book can easily be enjoyed by those who don't like math at all, and would be especially good reading for young people.  It is full of happy discoveries in math, and discoveries about people, and it is wonderfully optimistic.Sarah's book can easily be enjoyed by those who don't like math at all, and would be especially good reading for young people.

Of course it is sad; one cannot look at these pages and read about the birds that we will never see again, without a sense of loss.  (However, this second edition has some good news: some of the extinct birds reported in the first edition have been found again!)  It's a shame we don't have the birds instead of a commemorative volume about them, but granting even this, _Extinct Birds_ is as beautiful a commemorative volume as we can ever expect to see.  It may be that some of these birds are not extinct, only hiding (Fuller shows this has happened before), but most of the birds here are certainly as dead as dodoes.  The reasons are not hard to seek, and it will come as no surprise that humans have killed most of them off.  Hunting has taken a direct toll, but is not a usual major cause of wiping out a whole species.  Ruination of habitats and introduction of predators (especially rats) to islands are more devastating.  Predicting how it will go for birds over the next century can't be done exactly, of course, but it doesn't look good for them; one respected research study concludes that one in eight bird species are at risk for extinction in the next century.  Watch the birds around you carefully, and count your blessings, and say goodbye.<br />_Extinct Birds_ is not a dry catalogue ticking off each species we have lost.  Besides the lovely illustrations, Fuller has written about the birds with a dry wit not found in a mere catalogue.  Fuller writes, &quot;...extinct birds are, by and large, a quite spectacular bunch.  Although there are some fairly unexceptional exceptions among the ranks of the extinct, not a few of the world's most memorable birds are now among the lost.  The dodo, the great auk, the moas, and the great elephant birds are all obvious qualifiers.  Are there any conclusions to be drawn from this?  Perhaps only the notion that a raised head is more likely to be chopped off!&quot;  The lovely pictures in this volume, often from sources that could draw the bird from life, come from Audubon, of course, from Edward Lear, who is now more famous for his nonsense verse, and from Fuller and some of his friends.<br />Some of the stories behind the birds are decidedly odd.  The funniest and saddest of the stories is that of the Stephen Island wren.  Stephen Island is a square mile rocky place near New Zealand.  There was a lighthouse on the island, and the lighthouse keeper had a cat named Tibbles.  As cats are wont to do, Tibbles would go hunting, and would bring his dead prey back to his human.  Tibbles brought the tiny birds to the keeper in around 1896 and thus can be credited with finding a bird that no one had previously recorded.  He can also be credited with wiping out the entire species.  The specimens he collected are in various museums.  Fuller quotes an anonymous correspondent to _The Canterbury Press_ at the time: &quot;And we certainly think that it would be as well if the Marine Department, in sending lighthouse keepers to isolated islands where interesting specimens of native birds are known or believed to exist, were to see that they are not allowed to take any cats with them, even if mouse-traps have to be furnished at the cost of the state.&quot;<br />A gorgeous volume, _Extinct Birds_ is paradoxically full of lively stories.a raised head is more likely to be chopped off!&quot;  The lovely pictures in this volume, often from sources that could draw the bird from life, come from Audubon, of course, from Edward Lear, who is now more famous for his nonsense verse, and from Fuller and some of his friends.<br />Some of the stories behind the birds are decidedly odd.

Mankind's Historic Quest to End Baldness_ (AtRandom.com) by Gersh Kuntzman takes up the causes, stigma, and above all the treatments for baldness.  It has a hilarious and scary section on the quack cures for the \\"loathsome disease,\\" but concentrates on the real cures or crutches.  There are now treatments for baldness, the \\"drugs\\" part of the amusingly named trilogy of cures: drugs, rugs, and plugs.  Drugs available now for baldness are Rogaine and Propecia, and they both work in a limited way.  There is a peculiar difficulty for researchers in field of baldness treatment.  They can publish small, tentative, preliminary reports in the most obscure technical journals.  All of a sudden they are inundated by requests from bald men who want to get the treatment, and if there is no treatment ready, they want to get into the test groups immediately, and if they can't get into the test groups, they accuse the investigators of being in a large, undefined conspiracy against bald men.  The volumes of mail and complaints about treatments that are not yet in existence have meant that researchers had no time for research, having to spend it all on public relations.<br />  Rugs are given an amusing coverage (sorry) in the book, but the strangest of superficial treatments are the \\"hair in a can\\" varieties.  These consist of something like spray-on or spread-on gunk, sometimes chopped up sheep hair.  Sheep hair is grated into microscopic pieces, dyed and given a negative static charge so that it sticks to whatever hair remains.  A dry cosmetic called DermMatch gets rubbed into the scalp.  The company slogan is, \\"Nothing looks better, stays on better, applies neater, is more healthful, or costs less to use.\\"  Kuntzman, a witty reporter, writes, \\"If that's the company _slogan_, I'd hate the see the employee handbook.\\"<br />Plugs are no longer the thing.  It used to be that hair transplants were cores of little circles of hair plugged into the balding areas.  Look closely and a plugged scalp looks like that of a doll.  But now there are micro-transplants, teensy cores of three hairs apiece carefully plugged in where they might do the most good.  It costs thousands of dollars, and Kuntzman describes the bloody process with enthusiasm.  One of the plastic surgeons interviewed who does such operations is himself bald.  He says, \\"I'm a reasonably content guy, and it doesn't bother me enough to go through a surgical procedure.  For me, hair loss is no big deal.\\"  Maybe not for him, but it is clear that is overall a big deal with big social and financial repercussions.  _Hair!_ tells about them with good humor and intelligence.  If one of our obligations in life is to spot human foibles and to sympathize and laugh about them, Kuntzman has helped us along.g areas.  Look closely and a plugged scalp looks like that of a doll.

Edwin Edwards, a man of intelligence and wit, was elected four times as governor.  He could have been the state's best governor (although that might be damning with faint praise), but he turned out to be at least among its worst.  His tragedy was inextricably linked with personal and corporate gambling, and it is told with all the fascination of a mystery novel in _Bad Bet on the Bayou: The Rise of Gambling in Louisiana and the Fall of Governor Edwin Edwards_ (Farrar Straus and Giroux) by Tyler Bridges.  It is a memorable account of the worst in politics.<br />Louisiana had had sometimes scandalous connections to gambling long before it became a state, but overt gambling had been suppressed, especially in the seventies with the oil boom.  When the boom went bust in the nineties, there was a scramble to boost state coffers, and especially those of New Orleans, and Edwards was determined that gambling would boost construction, increase employment, and bring money in from out of state.  It looked unseemly for someone with an obvious love of gambling to get on the casino bandwagon, but Edwards was never regarded as a beacon of moral purity.  When he ran against Klansman David Duke in 1991, bumper stickers read, \\"Vote for the Crook.  It's Important,\\" and Louisianans did so overwhelmingly.  The first two-thirds of _Bad Bet_ tells in amazing detail the ins and outs of the corrupt means by which gambling was brought to the rivers of Louisiana and specifically to the French Quarter.  But it is in the spellbinding final third that the book takes off, showing how the FBI brought Edwards down.  The Harrah's casino went bust in 1995, when Edwards went into official retirement, but he kept busy with his usual money ploys and influence.  The FBI started investigating the bribes that had been paid to get a juvenile prison built, and found that Edwards had gotten the money.  Rather exciting descriptions ensue of FBI informants wearing wires to talk with Edwards, and of the difficulties of installing microphones and cameras in the former governor's office.  Edwards was approaching seventy, he had a wife almost four decades younger, and he was for the first time in his life starting to take it easy.  Unfortunately for him, he also let his guard down, allowing an informant to get him talking.  The years of payoffs when he was promoting gambling were to come back on him, resulting in convictions on extortion and money-laundering, among other crimes, and probably federal prison for what remains of his life.<br />The tragedy of Edwards is shown by his enormous political skill run amok.  The book gives examples of deal making that he arranged that would have been excellent politics, if the deals had not been crooked.  He had an ability to read people and meet their needs that could have well served his constituents.  He knew how to make fun of himself, and the many funny jokes reported here were just the thing to delight reporters and voters.  His talents instead went to enriching himself and his cronies, gambling, and stringing along a line of mistresses.  What a waste.ther exciting descriptions ensue of FBI informants wearing wires to talk with Edwards, and of the difficulties of installing microphones and cameras in the former governor's office.

And yet, few would argue that in wartime is unnecessary.  _Secrets of Victory: The Office of Censorship and The American Press and Radio In World War II_ (University of North Carolina) by Michael S. Sweeney tells a previously untold story.  Sweeney has assembled what is surprisingly an inspiring tale on what could have been a dismal subject.  The censors did their patriotic duty, and in almost every case, did it well, staying to a middle course that got the job done but was not unduly repressive.<br />There's a hero in this often dramatic book, a hero who helped win the war not with firepower but with persuasion, common sense, and patriotism.  Byron Price was a newsman nominated by Roosevelt to be director of the Office of Censorship shortly after Pearl Harbor.  Price had huge amounts of authority and responsibility, but the miracle is that Price got all that power and chose to run a voluntary system whereby the nation's journalists would become their own censors.  All Americans wanted to do their part in winning the war, and journalists were no different; Price enlisted them in a cooperative effort.  He issued a code of voluntary censorship, and enlisted the help from newspapers and radio stations in following it.  Essentially, the code spelled out details of a rule of thumb: \\"Is this information I would like to have if I were the enemy?\\"  Violations, and there were hundreds of them, got confidential letters from Price's office, detailing the mistakes and asking for more circumspection.  There were few serious complaints about the self-censorship program.  Sensible rules included that opinions could not be censored, nor could stories that had been publicized in other countries.  Even the ACLU approved of the way the censors had done their job.<br />Sweeney's description of how censorship was applied is fascinating.  Even descriptions of sporting events had to contain no mention of the weather, and \\"lost dog\\" ads and requests for a certain song dedication were curtailed, for they could contain coded information.  There are wonderful details on censoring (or failing to censor) such things as the Manhattan Project, General Patton's slapping of combat stress victims, and the threat of incendiary balloons floated over from Japan.

Quint's tale is accurate, but it is only part of the terror within the _Indy_'s story.  The whole is laid out in _In Harm's Way: The Sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors_ (Henry Holt) by Doug Stanton, as spellbinding and frightening a book about the horrors of war as you are likely to read.<br />_Indy_ had had the imposing job of bringing the bomb \\"Little Boy\\" from San Francisco to Tinaian Island, near Guam, from where it could be sent to Hiroshima.  After leaving the bomb in Tinaian, the ship was routed to Leyte in the Philippines, ready to take part in any mopping up action; but on 30 July it was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine I-58, and sank in twelve minutes.  Astonishingly, for four days the Navy had no idea the ship was lost.  _In Harm's Way_ details a surprising number of administrative errors and missed chances that would have saved most of the crew, but  when the _Indy_ went down, no one but the survivors knew what had happened, and no one on land knew to worry about them.<br />1,196 men were on the ship when it was struck, and about 300 of them died immediately from the two torpedoes.  Of the remaining 900, only 317 were eventually rescued.  Sharks had, indeed, taken some of the rest, maybe about 200 during the four days the men floated in the Pacific.  The fuel oil blinded and poisoned some, and some just went mad with blood chemistry imbalances and killed themselves and each other.  The surviving doctor tried to minister to the sailors, but all he could really do was collect the dog tags of the dead, and when those proved so heavy that his exhaustion wouldn't let him carry them any more, he let them sink.<br />A patrol plane on another mission finally saw some of the survivors, and the belated, but heroic rescue took place.  Captain McVay became the first captain in US history to be court-martialed for losing his ship as an act of war.  It is clear that there was nothing McVay could have done to save his ship, but he was found guilty.  The survivors, however, rallied behind McVay, a truly tragic figure, who was worried when he attended the first survivor's reunion in 1960; it was clear that he was respected and even loved by those who had served under him.  Some members of families of dead sailors remembered differently, however, and McVay got hate mail from them.  This was surely one of the reasons he shot himself in 1965.  His crew has since tried to get his court-martial erased.  Though his story is the backbone of this engrossing and terrifying book, _In Harm's Way_ contains satisfying doses of history and of heroics under unimaginable stress.

It is an amazing story of a driven man who repeatedly accomplished the impossible.  For instance, it was simply not possible for Cook to become a Captain in the Royal Navy, as he was a farmhand's son with no pull.  He worked nine years in the commercial fleet in the North Sea, and against the judgement of everyone, halted a promising career to go to the bottom of the ranks in the Royal Navy.  He again worked swiftly up the ranks, but had no chance of becoming an officer.  Only the scheming of a scientist, a Lord, and King George III got him a commission, to go on a circumnavigation for a particular astronomical observation in Tahiti.<br />Cook commanded three circumnavigations, and racked up an impressive record, sailing farther north and farther south than anyone had.  He found and charted new islands throughout the Pacific.  He was an exemplary commander, a brilliant shiphandler who was reluctant to use the lash on his men.  He also pioneered the use of an anti-scurvy diet that kept his men healthy.  He kept close notes on the tribes he encountered and in the beginning, at least, had profitable and friendly relations with them.  Eventually, worn out from adventuring, and not at home either in England or in what he wished to be a paradise of the Pacific, he became frustrated, and his frustration led directly to difficulties on his command, and in his death at the hands of the Sandwich Islanders.<br />Cook emerges from these pages as a complex figure, a flawed hero who can justly be called the greatest adventurer in history.  The book includes fascinating accounts of naval facts, like what the sailors ate and by what means they were punished at sea.  The way Dugard has told the story it is by turns exciting, comic, inspiring, and sad, and the narrative never flags.	2001-06-04
1976667:US	50895620	R3ELJ9TVHZAS9R	0385494688	83296926	The Scarlet Professor: Newton Arvin:  A Literary Life Shattered by Scandal	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A Sad, Lonely, Productive, and Fascinating Life	Newton Arvin, a professor at Smith College for Women, could have fallen from grace during the McCarthy years, because he had a pinko history.  He could have been ostracized because of his divorce in 1940.  But he avoided scandal from his divorce and his politics, only to fall hard to it in 1960, when he was arrested for possessing pornography.  Arvin still has a fine reputation among students of literary history because of a series of biographies of nineteenth century American writers, but now is otherwise obscure.  His story is told in _The Scarlet Professor: Newton Arvin: A Literary Life Shattered by Scandal_ (Nan A. Talese / Doubleday) by Barry Werth.  This is a biography that seamlessly weaves together Arvin's literary interests and the hidden parts of his life, producing a memorable picture of a loner trying to make his own way in a hostile land.  It is also a fine summary of an episode of regrettable American repression.<br />Arvin grew up in Valparaiso, a backwater of Indiana, and knew he was different from other boys.  He went on to Harvard, and then to teaching literature at Smith.  What he loved was reading and working earnestly on critical biographies of Hawthorne, Whitman, Melville, and Longfellow.  Werth's book shows how in successive examination of these giants, Arvin was also examining himself, coming to a better understanding of his own quiet secret life.  Arvin didn't really get an understanding of his own homosexuality until he was in his forties.  Of course he kept the secret from most others, but revealing it to himself initially overwhelmed him with shame.  The panic and depression he felt over it would color his frequent psychiatric hospitalizations all through his life; he would go through rounds of electroconvulsive therapy.  He eventually allowed this part of his personality to express itself in cruising, in the New York Bath scene, and in taking lovers such as Truman Capote.  What brought Arvin down was a postal campaign against \\"pornographic filth in the family mailbox.\\"  The idea seems quaint and stupid now, although we fret over the same issues on the Internet, but the Massachusetts police became adept at making porno arrests as a political favor for politicians who wanted to look good in the papers.  The self-righteous police arrested Arvin in 1960 for simply possessing homosexual pornography, and his world collapsed.  It didn't matter, of course, that in a few years, owning pornography would no longer be a crime (and some of the examples of the items for which Arvin was arrested, illustrated in the book, look positively wholesome).  He was an intellectual asset to Smith, which treated him compassionately, and his many friends found ways to support him, but to the end of his life, he remained a solitary, brilliant man who cultivated loneliness.<br />He found redemption again in writing, and worked on his memoir, which was never published, but which Werth has been able to study, along with the diaries.  Worth's research has enabled him to write thoroughly and dispassionately about this unhappy, gifted man and what was at the time the expected treatment of homosexuals and porn fiends.  This is not a gay-rights polemic, but a thorough and fascinating examination of a unique life and time.ic filth in the family mailbox.\\"  The idea seems quaint and stupid now, although we fret over the same issues on the Internet, but the Massachusetts police became adept at making porno arrests as a political favor for politicians who wanted to look good in the papers.

Like many of the most famous of the founding fathers, he was a Deist, and counted himself a Unitarian, but he often said he was the sole member of a sect including no one but himself. He had confidence in his own reason and conscience.  He did admire Jesus, saying, \\"Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and others again of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, so much untruth, charlatanism, and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being.\\"  It was Jefferson's view that he himself could sort the truth from the imposture, for he felt that the real words applicable to Jesus were \\"as distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill.\\"  He thought about the process of doing so for many years, did a quick job around 1800 and did a thorough one in 1820.  His purpose was to make his own version of the gospels, an extraction that would summarize Jesus's life and morals, for \\"I hold the precepts of Jesus, as delivered by himself, to be the most pure, benevolent, and sublime which have ever been preached to man. I adhere to the principles of the first age; and consider all subsequent innovations as corruptions of his religion, having no foundation in what came from him.\\"<br />It was not enough for the polyglot Jefferson to make such a distillation from the King James Version; he also bought a couple of Greek, French, and Latin versions to use, two volumes of each, for his plan was to cut and paste the parts that he found useful into one volume, but using all four languages.  The resultant volume is called The Jefferson Bible, although his own handwritten title page gives \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, Extracted textually from the Gospels in Greek, Latin, French & English.\\"  He apparently studied the volume of his own manufacture nightly before going to bed, but he was horrified at the idea that it be published, feeling that his political enemies would use his ideas against him (his lofty Deism had produced against him charges of atheism) and that this product of his own conscience was his own comfort.  His descendants did not know that the volume existed until after his death.<br />The English extracts of the book were printed by the Government Printing Office in 1904 in a small booklet, and a tradition began of having the book be presented to newly sworn in congressmen.  Currently in print is an edition from the Beacon Press in Boston, which is entirely fitting, as this is the printing house for the Unitarian Universalist Church.<br />Naturally it is fascinating to go through the little volume and to see what was important to the genius of Jefferson and what was not.  He left out all the Old Testament, of course, and all of Paul's additions (he felt that Paul was the \\"first corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus\\"); the  Apocalypse, upon which so much of current prophetic beliefs are founded, he said was \\"merely the ravings of a maniac.\\"  He must have felt that only the life of Jesus was worthy of study.<br />But even the life does not start out in the way in which we are familiar. The first sentences of Jefferson's Bible have to do with Joseph and Mary going to Bethlehem to be taxed.  There is no Annunciation, indeed, no implication that Jesus had any sort of miraculous birth;  Jefferson distrusted miracles.  Having seen the beginning, I turned to the final pages; I knew how the story turned out, you see, so I did not really risk ruining it for myself.  The end is just as worldly; \\"They rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\\" (Matthew 27:60)  There is no magical resurrection in this version.  The life and teachings were apparently enough.<br />There is a similar lack of miracles throughout.  The story in the ninth chapter of John is cut short, when being presented with a blind man and asked who had sinned, he or his parents, to bring on the blindness, Jesus only gives the comment, \\"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\\"  This sounds a bit enigmatic to me, and although the blind man may have taken comfort that his condition was not the product of sin..., I cannot think he would be happy at being a display for the works of God.  A sighted man would be a better display.  Anyway, the episode does not climax with Jesus making mud with his spittle and putting it on the blind man's eyes to bring him vision.  One looks in vain in this volume for healed lepers, risen corpses, strolls on the waters, or renewed wine cellars.  Such stories were not important to Jefferson; only the life and teachings were.<br />And those teachings, though familiar, are magnificent.  Jesus causing the mob self-examination when it was about to stone an adultress is one of my favorites, and of course it is here.  There are higher values than obedience to old laws, he makes plain.  The widow still gives everything she has, thus giving more than the large sums from the rich.  Jesus encouraged love of others, as much as we love ourselves; the love extended to those who have no love for us.  The beseechings to do good make me painfully aware that I fall short of the sort of ideal Jesus would want: \\"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.\\"  Surely he was being hyperbolic, but even so, I don't come close.<br />I think the exaggeration does not serve him in many cases.  \\"Take no thought for tomorrow\\" I think of as exceedingly bad advice.  I hold that there is much to be said for thinking about the here and now, but only a fool never plans for the future.  Similarly, the enjoinings to abandon one's family or to give away everything one has to the poor are so far removed from the way my world works (and surely from the way the Nazarene's did, as well) that such exhortation is not only futile but argues against itself.<br />Jefferson has eliminated some of the verses that gave me ammunition against Biblical literalists.  He includes the story about Peter denying Christ three times before the cock crows, but omits the pesky Mark  14:66-68 which shows Peter got only one denial in before the crowing.  He leaves out the Holy Spirit or any verse that would show Jesus to be divine.  He does not include any verses that show Jesus speaking with a short temper to his mother, as at Cana.  Jesus certainly does not invite anyone to eat his flesh.<br />I was disappointed at some of the inclusions.  It is surprising that the naturalist Jefferson allowed Jesus to go on saying that the mustard seed is the biggest of all seeds and that it grows into a plant bigger than all other herbs.  Jefferson had no misgivings over having Jesus speak of a literal Noah: \\"Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.\\"  Not only does this seem to countenance a holocaust worse than any subsequent one (and against a world of poor animals, too), it makes clear that Jesus took the Old Testament myths literally.<br />The biggest disappointment is that although Jefferson saw fit to cut the story before any ascendancy of Jesus into heaven, he retains many of Jesus's parables of what the afterlife is like.  This is not so bad in the descriptions of heaven, but also included are Jesus's warnings about hell...  It is indeed a shame that Jefferson's admiration for the ethical system proposed by Jesus includes all of his verses that warn about being burned or tortured forever.  Jesus's words make clear he countenances such a system.  That's not morals, it's monstrosity.<br />I did like the Jefferson Bible, though, for its brief summation of the stories that have changed the world.  I like mostof all the idea of Thomas Jefferson with scissors and paste finding what was meaningful for himself in the gospels and cutting out his own version.  This was the Jefferson who encouraged, \\"Question with boldness even the existence of a god; because if there be one he must approve of the homage of reason more than that of blindfolded fear.\\"  His Bible was an act of audacious redaction: he refused to accept the book as divinely inspired holy writ, and determined that he would examine it carefully to see in it what his own conscience and reason showed was good, and follow that good, and ignore the rest.  Would that others would do the same.or to give away everything one has to the poor are so far removed from the way my world works (and surely from the way the Nazarene's did, as well) that such exhortation is not only futile but argues against itself.<br />Jefferson has eliminated some of the verses that gave me ammunition against Biblical literalists.

Otto.  Everyone would agree with those three little words, but Otto has the specialist meaning revealed in her subtitle: _The Court Jester Around the World_.  Her title amply is demonstrated in a large and wide-ranging history of fools.  Everyone knows of the fools in England, quite possibly because Shakespeare put many of them in his works.  But Otto has gathered a huge amount of material from Everywhere; fools may be found also especially in China (which is, along with Europe, the arena of Otto's closest inspection), and in India, Arabia, and Tonga, within the Yaqui Indians, among the Aztecs, and, well, everywhere, even in corporate boardrooms.<br />A tradition this nearly universal must have strong reason to exist, and Otto demonstrates over and over, from one anecdote to another, that fools served both kings and subjects.  Jesters were not only tolerated by the rulers, they were cherished.  They may have made uncomfortable, biting attacks; Sultan Mahmud was lying in the lap of his jester and asked him, \\"What is your relation to cuckolds?\\"  The jester replied: \\"I am their pillow.\\"  But even beneath the bite is understanding and even kindliness and acceptance.  When King Tamerlane was roaring out 800, 1,200, and 1,500 lashes for a series of offenders, his fool Nasrudin interrupted him with what seemed to be an irrelevant question: \\"O King, do you know everything?\\"  \\"Of course I do,\\" retorted the King.  \\"Then how could you inflict such punishment?  Either you don't know the meaning of the number 1,500, or you don't know the sting of a whip.\\"  The jester is here shown to be the kindly servant of the king, as the one who might save the king from himself; but also, he is the servant of the subjects who would otherwise feel the king's lash.  Thus the jester became in cultures everywhere a folk hero.<br />There are countless anecdotes here, and not all of them pay off.  There are many that rely on the time, or the language, or \\"I guess you just had to be there.\\"  But plenty of this otherwise academic work is good, foolish fun.  Otto has presented case after case, and her book has little theorizing.  She does speculate upon where the fools of the court went, since they are now historic figures.  They didn't really go anywhere, she says, they just specialized.  Actors, cartoonists, and comedians took over the role, especially after the fools became presences on the stage.  Otto hopes that the twenty-first century may have a rebirth of the fool (can you imagine someone paid to do pratfalls at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks?), and does give some fine twentieth century examples.  Will Rogers famously used his fooling to puncture politics-as-usual in otherwise impossible ways, and addressed President Wilson with great informality as Pres.  And Otto quotes the best jester of the twentieth century (in my view), Groucho Marx, who was told by the management of a beach club that Jews were not allowed to swim from the beach.  \\"What about my son?\\" came the reply that could have issued from a sprite clothed in swatches of colors, a horned cap, and bells.  \\"He's only half-Jewish.

1984225:US	50895620	RD10LV6NL66DT	0767906438	237921900	The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie: The Science and Aesthetics of Tie Knots	Books	5	38	38	N	Y	Not Just Knots	When I started my current job, I checked to see if I would have to wear a tie.  I do not like ties, but I did like _The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie_ (Broadway Books) by Thomas Fink and Yong Mao.  There are indeed eighty-five ways to tie a tie, and they prove it, and they show them all.  If you wear a tie, or know someone who does, and especially someone who does under protest, this is a useful and entertaining little book.<br />But how does anyone prove that there are eighty-five ways to tie a tie?  Well, the genial authors explain: \\"Tie knots, we realized, are equivalent to persistent random walks on a triangular lattice.\\"  If that explanation strikes you as less than useful, you can turn to the appendix at the back of the book, where you will find the random walk explanation proved by means of equations with symbols and superscripts which I cannot reproduce here.  Comes the explanation: \\"Our day job as theoretical physicists might have had something to do with it.\\"  It does not take a mathematician to enjoy this book, however.  What the authors have done is to examine all the variations of how to tie a standard tie.  This means that one leaves the little end alone and makes the big end travel around to form the knot.  Having crossed the little end, the big end can go to the left of it, or right, or to the center (where the neck of the wearer is).  That is three possible moves, and within each of the three fields, the big end may either go in toward the wearer or out away from the wearer, for a total of six moves in all, not counting the final move, which is always to pull the big end down through the knot to its final resting place.  Each knot can thus be specified with permutations of six simple moves.  The simplest is the three-move variety called the \\"Oriental,\\" the most complex is the nine-move memory-breaker known as the \\"Balthus.\\"  Windsor, half-Windsor, four-in-hand, and all the others are shown and instructions given.  The authors have also noted the methods which might help make a more impressive knot in a lightweight tie, or in a tie that has grown limp with use, and various other suggestions.  There is art here as well as science.<br />This is a unique blend of mathematics, sartorial history, and fashion instruction, wittily presented and attractively illustrated.  If we have to have ties, we might as well let them teach us something.h might help make a more impressive knot in a lightweight tie, or in a tie that has grown limp with use, and various other suggestions.

In 1859 there was a real mania for the color mauve, because it had been invented only three years before.  Of course the color had not truly been invented, but people then just started seeing lots of it because the process of dyeing using the color had been invented.  The inventor, an Englishman named William Perkin, was someone who achieved a good deal of fame in his time, but is now largely forgotten.  _Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color That Changed the World_ (W. W. Norton) by Simon Garfield aims to bring him back to our memories, and in a lucid and enjoyable way, manages just that.<br />Perkin's revolution was to use coal tar derivatives, which had been regarded as useless waste products, to make the first of the aniline dyes; textile dyes before Perkin's day came from \\"natural sources,\\" and were expensive, unreliable, and subject to fading.  Perkin was only eighteen years old when he was tinkering with chemicals, trying to make the antimalarial drug quinine artificially.  Perkin was looking for the colorless quinine, but instead produced a reddish powder.  It would perhaps have been a sensible decision to scrap what he was working on and try again, but Perkin possessed an admirable curiosity, and further purified the powder to discover the prettiest purple dye anyone had ever seen.  Chemists made new colors all the time, so his fellows were horrified that he planned to abandon academic chemistry to go into business, but he decided to go with his entrepreneurial instincts.  Garfield describes the grueling duties of the young man trying to make it in a commercial world about which he initially knew little.  But mauve took off, becoming the fashionable color, and Perkin's fortune was secure.<br />Perkin was a modest man, whom Garfield obviously admires.  When the fiftieth anniversary of mauve came around, he reluctantly accepted a knighthood.  It was not for a color, nor for the other colors he invented, nor for the papers he continued to produce for the academic world (usually not about dyes).  With the production of the first aniline dye, Garfield demonstrates in his engaging book, it was the start of chemistry anew; the progeny of Perkin's original reactions for fashion now play roles in less superficial arts of medicine, pharmacology, engineering, and more.ic world (usually not about dyes).

I mean, lately over the past hundred years, since we left the ice age?  If you don't think of the weather on this scale of climate, it would be a good idea to take a look at _The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History 1300 - 1850_ (Basic Books) by Brian Fagan.  The weather has been amazing during our most recent century, but it is always more or less unpredictable, and has always fascinated people.  However, the particular conditions of the Little Ice Age were peculiar, indeed, and we haven't seen anything like them for more than a century.<br />There are plenty strange events described in Fagan's book, things like glaciers which no longer threaten us.  It is best, however, at giving a broad view of the Little Ice Age and how it affected history.  Fagan does not make the mistake of \\"climatic determinism,\\" carefully showing how human behavior, economics, as well as climate produced historic changes, but his links to the weather is convincing because he accepts weather as only a partial explanation.  His explanations, for instance, of weather's involvement in the Viking retreat, the French Revolution, and the Irish Potato Famine are excellent.<br />Fagan's book makes clear that climate has affected civilization, and that humans have not always handled its changes well.  His book is not a polemic about the current warming, but he acknowledges that the carbon dioxide levels and coal burning may have been among the mechanisms that produced it.  Since we understand such changes only imperfectly, and since they are best shown in computer models upon which corporations can cast doubt, a surprising number of people think that global warming is not a real phenomenon.  Fagan shows that the warming is real, and that our weather these days is greatly different from the Ice Age before.  More importantly, he shows that people responded to the changes of the past in often lamentable ways; if ever learning from history was vital to prevent repeating it, we would do well to look at past mistakes.repeating it, we would do well to look at past mistakes.	2001-05-23

Spock got the Vulcan freedom from emotion in the non-human half of his genes.  It sometimes made it difficult to get along with him; he never got jokes, for instance, and was fascinated by what went on around him, but never amused.  Because he had no emotions, he made all his decisions with cool rationality, and because he wasted no mental energy on emotions, had had a superhuman degree of intelligence, insight, and logic.  Examining Spock's emotionless state is one of the themes in _Emotion: The Science of Sentiment_ (Oxford University Press) by Dylan Evans, a short, witty review of the current scientific and evolutionary views on emotion.  Spock could not have evolved in any environment we are familiar with.  For instance, fear is a beneficial emotion, helping animals react swiftly.  Animals incapable of feeling it would not last long.  Emotions, contrary to the opinion held by philosophers through the centuries, are not a drain on intellect, but help it.<br />Most researchers would include fear, disgust, joy, distress, anger, and surprise in a list of basic emotions.  Darwin himself thought that there was a universality of human emotions shared by all cultures, and that this was evidence that humans had evolved together and then the races and cultures had separated.  However, this view was not generally held until fairly recently; it was supposed that just as your culture teaches you language, it also teaches you what emotions are part of your world and how to display them.  Not true; experiments in the 1960's showed that a remote tribe that had never seen western media could match pictures of faces to the proper emotion, and in reverse, Americans could recognize the emotions being shown by tribal members who were asked to display fear, anger, etc.  Emotions, at least some of the basic ones, are indeed universal and part of our genetic rather than cultural heritage.<br />All in all, Emotions have gotten a bad press, for centuries.  _Emotion_, a valuable small primer, helps set the record straight, with amusing examples and fascinating explanations of the experiments that have helped make the role of emotions plain.  The lesson is driven home repeatedly: emotions are good for us, they help (not hinder) rationality, and they are there because natural selection has used them to get us around a dangerous, unpredictable world.of our genetic rather than cultural heritage.<br />All in all, Emotions have gotten a bad press, for centuries.  _Emotion_, a valuable small primer, helps set the record straight, with amusing examples and fascinating explanations of the experiments that have helped make the role of emotions plain.

She tells how this happened to \\"Timbertown\\" (a pseudonym, and she has used pseudonyms for all the town residents) in The Stranger Next Door: The Story of a Small Community's Battle over Sex, Faith, and Civil Rights_ (Beacon Press), a balanced history of a contemporary controversy.  Timbertown was a logging community, and in the eighties the economy turned bad for it.  Newcomers came to the region, some in communes, and in the bad economy, didn't always get along with the long term timbermen.  Among the newcomers were homosexuals, not many, to be sure, and most of them were women who blended into the community so that most others hardly knew.  When the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), an outside agency powered by Christian fundamentalism, came, Timbertown started fracturing.<br />Timbertown was hardly teeming with the sort of gay population that scared the OCA, those that could be found in the larger, more open cities of the area, the hypermasculine muscleboys in leather, who dared to flaunt aggressive sexuality.  Though a spokesman for the OCA could warn that the intent of homosexuals \\"... is to take over the state of Oregon and turn it into Queer Nation,\\" no one in Timbertown could have seriously thought that of any fellow residents.  The idea that homosexuals were going somehow to ruin government, or that homosexuality somehow weakens marriages (whose?), were never shown to have any factual foundations.  But the OCA put a petition to put an anti-gay civil rights measure on an upcoming ballot, splitting the community into sides.  This had bizarre and unexpected consequences.<br />An exhibit based on the life of Anne Frank became politicized, with the OCA calling it \\"pro-homosexual propaganda.\\"  The valuable role of victimhood was sought by both sides, with the OCA unconvincingly arguing that they themselves were the persecuted minority, the equivalent of Jews in the Holocaust.  The mayor of the town had to withdraw from the traditional annual prayer breakfast as it, too, became political rather than ecumenical.  Children at school began to beat each other up depending on what sides their parents took on the issue.  The few members of minority races in the town saw an increase in hostility, and although the newspaper and schools took an anti-racist attitude, the white majority who were losing jobs did what people always do, and found someone else to blame.  There was no racial strife before the sexual issue started splitting people.  Even more sadly, although the ballot measure passed with 57% of the vote, it accomplished little except the fracturing of Timbertown.  In less than a year, there was an injunction against putting the measure into effect, a statewide antigay ballot failed, and U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ways that would make the measure a dead issue, but of course Timbertown could not be put back together again.  Stein's well-researched book coolly recounts the agonies of Timbertown, and reminds us that they are national concerns, here merely writ small.emselves were the persecuted minority, the equivalent of Jews in the Holocaust.

1998738:US	50895620	R20CUIVQ8DX428	0375504281	637747415	The Immortal Class: Bike Messengers and the Cult of Human Power	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A Speedy Career, An Urge To Improve Society	The tyranny of automobiles over our cities didn't have to be inevitable, and Travis Hugh Culley is out to make his city safe for bicycles.  His lively book, _The Immortal Class: Bike Messengers and the Cult of Human Power_ is a combination memoir of his days as a bike messenger and a polemic against the tyranny of the automobile.  Culley has an original voice, a poetic way of telling about his road adventures and the other bicyclists he encounters.  He has more than his share of guts, and his book is a convincing examination of how to look at a problem from a different view, and how to make a difference.<br />A thwarted theater producer, he signed on to be a bike messenger in Chicago, a city he obviously loves and wants to care for.  The descriptions of the career of bike messenger are the most vivid and enjoyable parts of the book.  It is peppered throughout with radio jargon: \\"10-4, boss.  I'm going to drop the bucket of Bucklin, grab a bouquet of Rosies, roll off the Fairbanks, and hit you on the outside of the Dentist.\\"  (Only some of the talk is translated; \\"the Dentist\\" is, for instance, the headquarters of the American Dental Association.)  It is full of collisions which are rather beautifully and balletically described: \\"When my front wheel slipped out from beneath me, I fell forward, smacked the asphalt with my back, and began sliding in a straight line between the two cars.  I could feel the white lines in the road skipping beneath my messenger bag, _thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump_...\\"  After an accident, \\"Messengering bloody was kind of cool.  Secretaries would offer me napkins and things to tell me that I needed to freshen the bandages... At first I couldn't distinguish sweat from blood, so I kept wiping everything with a blood-drenched hanky.\\"  Afterward he gets stitches at home from a medical resident, his girlfriend.  Eating and drinking are altered for the messenger's exhausting routine; Howard Johnson's eggs, pancakes, and grits for breakfast, with snacks through the day of granola mixed with M&amp;M's and dried fruit.  \\"If I didn't eat at least three ounces by noon, I would be brain-dead by 1:30, slurring my words and overshooting my streets, stoned from depletion.\\"  I don't want to live this life, but it is a thrill to read about it.<br />Culley saves his harshest words for city and state governments that refuse to recognize bicyclists as road-users with road-privileges, for the police who break up his demonstrations, and for those of us who simply accept the automobile as the way it has to be.  He is no longer a messenger; his injured knee eventually gave out, and he now commutes to his gallery job, by bicycle, to be sure.

I don't have an interest in sports, so I don't wind up reading much about them.  I don't know the first thing about horses or horseracing.  So take a real expert's opinion: if you are one of the few readers who has yet to take up _Seabiscuit: An American Legend_ (Random House) by Laura Hillenbrand, I tell you to put down what you are reading right now and take it up.  It is simply a magnificent story, beautifully written, about one of the best athletes in history and the men who eased him into expressing his potential.<br />Seabiscuit didn't look a winner.  His body was low and his knees didn't straighten all the way.  His gait was so peculiar that people mistook it for lameness.  His gallop was such chaos that he could hit his front ankle with a hind hoof.  He had a bloodline, but he lacked the looks, and he lacked the background.  His jockey, Red Pollard, kept with him pocket volumes of Shakespeare and Emerson (whom he called \\"Old Waldo\\"), and he had much of the contents memorized, quoting it and spouting jokes.  At fifteen, he hung around the \\"bush tracks,\\" the lawless races that followed the carnivals.  Even when he graduated to racing at the official tracks, he had no home, for he slept in empty horse stalls wherever the riding circuit took him.  He might get hired, and he might win, but he seldom had money because everyone knew he was a soft touch for a \\"loan.\\"  Horseracing ripped his body apart; he was blinded in one eye (a dangerous secret he managed to keep), and he had his chest crushed and a leg ripped up in racing accidents.  Perhaps the strangest character in the book is the trainer, the sphinx-like Tom Smith, who had learned horsemanship from the Plains Indians.  It was he who saw Seabiscuit's potential when it was invisible to everyone else, and he who convinced his employer to buy the horse.  Smith used to give sportswriters fits, as he seldom strung any words together for humans, and when he did deign to talk to a reporter, he could deliberately spout the most outrageous lies, such as that all of Seabiscuit's legs had been broken (that one was picked up by the wire services).  The man who took Smith's advice to buy Seabiscuit was Charles Howard, who had come to San Francisco and begun a bicycle repair shop, but started repairing autos when no one else during the turn of the century could do so.  Howard took on the Buick distributorship, making the fortune by which he could play the racing game.  Unlike Smith, Howard loved publicity.  Hillenbrand's description of how the contract for the race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral was arranged between Howard, War Admiral's owner, and the different target tracks is almost as exciting as the race itself.<br />Hillenbrand's book includes quite a bit of American history, especially of the Depression, from which Seabiscuit fandom was a special relief.  She has traced the arcs of the careers of these three remarkable men, and that of one legendary racehorse, with great attention to period detail.  Seabiscuit was lucky to have the men on his team, and now he is lucky to have such a riveting story made of his life to bring his fame back sixty years on.ether for humans, and when he did deign to talk to a reporter, he could deliberately spout the most outrageous lies, such as that all of Seabiscuit's legs had been broken (that one was picked up by the wire services).

Who?  He is just one of those invisible engineers no one has heard of, but his big idea affects all of us every day.  Clark Blaise tells his story in _Time Lord: Sir Sandford Fleming and the Creation of Standard Time_ (Pantheon Books).<br />Fleming was born in Scotland, and immigrated to Canada to do surveying.  His jobs got bigger and bigger, and he traveled.  When he missed a train in Ireland in 1876 because the schedule read p.m. when it should have read a.m., he wondered why, if there are twenty-four hours in the day do we not number them to twenty-four, but assume people can only count to twelve and have to do it twice?  It is amazing that no one had had this particular inspiration before, but it was just a starter.  For centuries, the world didn't really have a time standardization problem.  There was not enough mobility for people to notice that one town's time was not synchronized with another's.  Each town had it's own sundial, or an acting astronomer who would compute the meridian of the sun, calculate noon, and fire a gun or run up a flag when the time came.  Solar noon moves about twelve miles westward every minute along the most populated parts of North America.  Trains moved fast enough to show that meridians were different at every longitude.  This not only meant that if you took the train from Boston to New York, you would have to reset your watch.  It meant that train companies had to keep track of unimaginably complicated calculations to keep their trains running on time.  Each train company kept its own time based on where it's headquarters were, so that in Buffalo, for instance, there were three official times because three railroads served the city; in St. Louis there were six official times.<br />  The climax of the book, and of Fleming's successful thinking on time standardization, came with a series of international conferences, culminating in the 1884 Prime Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C.  Blaise's description of the conference is great fun, with scientists having to act like diplomats, and those French trying to keep from being humiliated by having to accept a prime meridian in any other country.  It was eventually a commercial decision, not entirely what Fleming had planned, and certainly not what the French had wanted.  Most shipping was done by navigational charts based on Greenwich, and so the nations voted to make that the prime meridian, although the French abstained and four years later defined their mean time as \\"Paris mean time, retarded by nine minutes, twenty-one seconds;\\" this put them in exact accord with Greenwich, without having to mention that detested London suburb.<br />  Blaise has done an outstanding job of bringing some deserved light on Fleming.  He has also put some pleasant essays in on how standardizing time affects art and literature, but they are certainly digressions in what is an inspiring story of a man with a good idea and how it changed the world.erences, culminating in the 1884 Prime Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C.

But the only real reason to be reading about Sterne is to increase appreciation of his wonderful book, _The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman_, which has been making people laugh for almost two and a half centuries.  So let me make the recommendation first of that book to you, if you have never read it.  Go read it, and when you finish, I'll be right here.<br />  There!  What did I tell you?  Intelligent, chaotic, witty amusement, with some bawdiness thrown in.  I don't need to tell you of the thousand odd attractions of the book.  It is one of the most fun of the classics.  Now to the fine book at hand.  Sterne was, Ross shows, just as peculiar as his book, and had as chaotic a life.  Sterne lived only eight years after bursting onto the scene with _Tristram Shandy_, and to Ross's credit, he has made Sterne's pre-Shandy years interesting.  Sterne had led a modest, impecunious life of a vicar in Yorkshire.  He did a bit of political writing, but nothing that would have prepared anyone for his comic masterpiece.  He had an unhappy marriage, and a remarkable interest in adultery.<br />  Then in 1759, the first two of the nine volumes of _Tristram Shandy_ were published, and caused a sensation.  The reviews were very good, and if readers were puzzled by the extraordinary digressions and puzzles in the book, they laughed at them, and they bought them up.  Then Sterne appeared in London, and was delighted to wear his black ministerial garments everywhere.  This brought his book notoriety as well as fame; reviewers changed tone from praising the book's hilarity to criticizing the vicar for writing \\"downright gross and obscene expressions.\\"  Sterne became a hot ticket at dinners and salons.  The zany mixture of adventures and accidents, farcical and sad, reflected the life of the author.<br />  This was an odd man, to be sure, who produced an odd book.  Ross's elegant and thorough biography brings Sterne to life for our age.  The gregarious James Boswell wrote that Sterne was \\"the best companion I ever knew,\\" and those who find him to be a good companion in the form of his famous book will find him an even better one after reading this illuminating biography.o produced an odd book.

That is, of course, as it should be; evolution is the overarching explanation of biology and although its evidence is all over, it is spectacularly shown in these equatorial and isolated islands.  The islands' connection to Darwin is a great story, but it is not the whole story of the Galapagos.  A successful attempt to tell the whole story is _Evolution's Workshop: God and Science on The Galapagos Islands_ (Basic Books) by Edward J. Larson.  If you are interested in evolution, or if you are going to join the growing numbers of tourists who are heading to the islands, this is a vital book.<br />Darwin, visiting the islands as the naturalist on the _HMS Beagle_ in 1835, confirmed what his predecessors had seen: \\"The country was compared to what we might image the cultivated parts of the Infernal regions to be.\\"  That was the classic view of the Galapagos, which Darwin would rewrite.  He wrote in his private notes as he voyaged home, \\"The zoology of the Archipelagoes will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species.\\"  When he was reading Malthus on population and resources three years later, he hit on the mechanism by which speciation could occur.<br />Larson tells the stories of the collectors who brought the specimens for academics to study, and how the specimens at first confirmed evolution, and then gave details about its mechanisms.  He shows how the philosophy of science has been changed by regarding the islands, were there is death, waste, and indifference.  Nonetheless, some biologists (most famously Agassiz) have seen nothing but confirmation of Genesis.<br />Larson's entertaining and comprehensive book winds up with a summary of how the Galapagos fit into our current world.  The islands are prized as jewels of science, but for decades, popularization in books, film, and television have made them targets for eco-tourists or just tourists.  It can be shown that the increased tourism has had benefits to the species precariously placed on their little rocks, but the cost of bringing more of the inevitable outside rats, seeds, and insects may be high.  Already there are those who go to the Galapagos just for surfing tournaments, and insist on a nightlife, so Larson is not completely optimistic about how well preservation can survive.  He gives an amusing symbol of ambiguity towards the book's end, a supermodel posed for the 1998 swimsuit issue of _Sports Illustrated_, whose depicted bare leg had the superimposed text \\"Charles Darwin's observations of animals here laid the foundation for his theory of evolution.\\"  Larson jokes, \\"Sexual selection apparently played a feature role in this version of the theory.\\"rists or just tourists.

She was falsely accused of lunacy by her family, fought the lunacy laws (and changed them for the public good), defended her married rights, ran an orphanage and several choirs, served as her own defense barrister in a score of cases, spent time in jail, and each time was released to the cheers of a rapturous crowd.  At her last release, \\"her followers unshipped the horses from their shafts and dragged her carriage to Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, from where she addressed a crowd estimated at 17,000.\\"<br />What makes this book so much fun is that Mrs. Weldon was a nut.  She may not have been a lunatic, but she was far from normal.  She didn't marry as her family directed, but estranged them by taking up with an army Lieutenant who eventually became a minor member of Victoria's court.  She was a soprano of some untrained talent, and thought she could sing and manage a choir of orphans in order to get back into society.  She lured the French composer Gounod away from his family to live in the orphanage with her; she was a tease, but wasn't much interested in sex, and he may just have been overpowered by her domineering personality.  Her singing career was shaky and the orphanage was complete chaos.<br />Her husband eventually would put up with Mrs. Weldon's foolishness no longer, but was unsuccessful in getting a writ of divorce.  The climax of Mrs. Weldon's life was when Harry colluded with her family to have her committed to an insane asylum.  The \\"mad-doctors\\" came one day in the guise of being interested in the orphanage, and asked Mrs. Weldon about her beliefs in spiritualism and phrenology.  She barricaded herself in and escaped.  It was the making of her.  The lunacy laws enabled psychiatrists on the flimsiest of evidence to grab their targets off the street and keep them in highly profitable asylums from which there was no release.  The families were happy to pay for the service of keeping troublesome members from being at large, and there is no doubt that Mrs. Weldon was troublesome.  She began to give at-homes in the orphanage twice a week, when she would read from her pamphlets against the mad-doctors, would use her talents as a raconteuse, and would wind up the evening singing an aria by Gounod.  She struck a blow against the lunacy laws and for women's rights, but was no heroine; she was simply boisterously pushing herself into the public eye, with enormous success for the years it lasted.  When the whole silly show ran down, she retired to a religious hospital in France (which had taken some of the orphans off her hands years before) and wrote her life story, a six-volume opus in French of scandal, accusations, misinformation, and, of course, self-promotion.<br />It was this work, forgotten and probably never read even when it was published, that Brian Thompson came across in a second-hand bookstore.  The poor fellow has read it all, but he has also drawn upon more reliable sources to give this amazing history of a whirlwind in woman's garb.

His brilliant designs for intricate and complicated calculating machines included the never-built Analytical Engine, which would have had a memory and a processor like our electronic versions, and would have run on punched cards, programmable and flexible enough to vary its routine through the If-Then steps familiar to any programmer.  It never got funded because others were not able to envision just how singularly useful the gadget could have been, but Babbage had one friend and interpreter who knew the potential of his creation, and who handed the world a prescient account of what this computer might be expected to do.<br />Her name was Ada Lovelace, and although her ties to Babbage and his machine give her a connection to our century, she was a sensation in her own times by right of birth.  As told in the exciting biography _The Bride of Science: Romance, Reason, and Byron's Daughter_ (McGraw-Hill) by Benjamin Woolley, everyone knew about Ada because she was the one child of Lord and Lady Byron.  Their stormy marriage had endured only eleven months when Ada was born, and a month later, Lady Byron left him; he left for the continent, never to see his daughter again.  Lady Byron was motivated ever after to vindicate herself against Byron, and she raised Ada to be a soldier in this cause; she tried to make sure that the child was raised on mathematics to suppress imagination and keep any elements of the Byronic temperament from breaking out.<br />Raising Ada was thus a science experiment, one that didn't work.  She remained curious about her father, and as she got older, she was convinced that she had genius from him and was impelled to express it.  She couldn't do it through mathematics, as despite all the intense training, she wasn't a mathematician.  But she was introduced to Babbage, and in 1840, set out to translate a paper he had presented on his Analytical Engine in Italy.  She didn't just translate, but with Babbage's help, she made her own notes on the meaning of the computer and what it could and could not do, amazingly prescient for her time.<br />Woolley has not only given a fine biography of a limited woman who happened to be at the center of events that presaged our future.  He has given capsule biographies of Lord and Lady Byron, Babbage, and many others who were connected with her.  Furthermore, he has given historic notes on phases that touched Ada's life, such as phrenology and mesmerism, which are extremely interesting and valuable, and his argument that the Analytical Engine could not catch on because the Victorian world was not ready for the computer is fascinating.  Even feminists and cyberhistorians who want to make Ada something she wasn't (and there are many of these) should be thrilled with this portrait of what she really was.Engine in Italy.

Atoms were a lucky guess by the ancient Greeks, but ever since Lucretius, the belief in atoms has implied a mechanical and even godless universe.  Atoms were seen, in the nineteenth century, as hypothetical, even imaginary, entities which might help in the bookkeeping of following chemistry experiments, but had only a theoretical rather than a physical existence.  It was the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann who showed that atoms really were the teensy particles that made the formulas for heat and gases so consistent.  It is a pleasure to read _Boltzmann's Atom: The Great Debate that Launched a Revolution in Physics_ (The Free Press) by David Lindley, for it brings this important physicist to light and restores credit to a flawed but important thinker.<br />What Boltzmann did was to take kinetic theory (the concepts of how gases flow, exert pressure, and exhibit temperature) into the uncharted waters of assuming that tiny atoms were responsible for the manifestations of the theory.  He insisted that atoms behaved in orderly and predictable ways that could be understood.  Furthermore, he realized that although we could never measure the uncountable trillions of atoms in a liter of gas, their behavior could be understood by approximation using the laws of probability.  We could not know exactly what all those atoms were doing, but probability explained it to a reliable approximation.  The idea of probability demonstrating what is real was anathema to many scientists of the nineteenth century, and Lindley, in a cogent explanation of thermodynamics, tries to show both sides of the debate, which eventually, of course, Boltzmann was shown to have won.<br />Boltzmann in frustration had committed suicide before he could appreciate the verifications given to his work by Planck and Einstein, who built their own ideas upon his.  It was decades before his work got its full acceptance; his grave in Vienna was neglected, and only in 1929 did he get a deserved resting place, with his simple, epochal formula for entropy carved on its monument.  This fine book shows that being right in science does not mean being accepted as right, and that radical concepts may be attacked just for being different.  Lindley writes, \\"Sometimes scientific ideas, like strange musical compositions or surrealistic dreams, need a ready audience as well as a creator.\\"  His book is a winning explanation of important scientific, biographical, and historical details.ected, and only in 1929 did he get a deserved resting place, with his simple, epochal formula for entropy carved on its monument.

W. Norton &amp; Co.) by Jan Bondeson.  There may have been just a touch of truth in the old fear, but Bondeson's fascinating, cheerful, but ghoulish book shows that like most worries, the one about being buried alive was generally not worth getting upset about.  This book is full of legends: the woman who awoke when a grave robber tried to cut her finger off to get her ring, the anatomist scared to death when he is about to do an exam of a body that wakes at the touch of the knife, the exhumed skeleton that is found to have clawed at the inside of its coffin and vainly burst the lid, and so on.  These legends have been revived now and then in the current tabloids, but they blossomed in seventeenth century Europe.  Physicians at the time were aware that in the plague or cholera epidemics, the mayhem might mean that victims of the carnage might not be individually diagnosed, and death might only be apparent.  When a medical book on premature burial became stocked with legends and addressed to the public, a trend to worry about premature burial began.  The Germans even introduced the practice of communities proudly building houses for the dead.  Bodies would, by law, come to the institutions, stick around until putrefaction was documented, and then be released for burial.  The facilities permitted families to visit, and even charged for sightseers, although the smell was awful.  The houses, even with the support of law, got few takers, and it was never documented that even one occupant woke up.  Security coffins were designed for those who were buried in the usual way, so that people could receive light and air if they happened to wake up underground, and could even get food and drink by a special tube once they sounded the alert.  The alert, a tolling bell or a raised flag, would go off if the entombed tripped a special lever or pulled a rope, but many of the gadgets had the problem of false alarms.  As the body decomposed it might swell or shift, triggering the alarm.  Americans responded to the increased fear of premature burial by patenting a coffin that had rotating lights as an alarm, and even had a light, heater, and telephone within.<br />It seems that there was a spell of cataleptic-type episodes which (like the syndrome of fainting after emotional shocks) for a while was a way people showed emotional distress physically; it may be that they were at some risk for being thought dead prematurely, and Bondeson shows that the fear of being buried alive was not completely without foundation.  There are cases of people, even recently, medically certified as dead, who lived on; at special risk are those who have been chilled to a low temperature or who have taken overdoses of different medicines.  The centuries of fear of burying people alive, however, simply faded, undoubtedly because of increasing trust in medical evaluations.  There were organizations devoted to the prevention of the horrors of being buried alive, but these were often allied with other cranky groups like the spiritualists, and they wilted after 1900.  True to its subtitle, this entertaining book is a \\"terrifying history,\\" but it is a history of terrifying previous generations, mostly unnecessarily.  Premature burial did have some slight influence on medical practice, and considerable influence in literature (especially Poe), but its chief effect has been to act as yet another bogeyman.  We have outgrown this bogey, which makes Bondeson's book all that much more fun to read.ver or pulled a rope, but many of the gadgets had the problem of false alarms.

There were organizations devoted to the prevention of the horrors of being buried alive, but these were often allied with other cranky groups like the spiritualists, and they wilted after 1900.  True to its subtitle, this entertaining book is a \\"terrifying history,\\" but it is a history of terrifying previous generations, mostly unnecessarily.  Premature burial did have some slight influence on medical practice, and considerable influence in literature (especially Poe), but its chief effect has been to act as yet another bogeyman.  We have outgrown this bogey, which makes Bondeson's book all that much more fun to read.	2001-04-24

Asma's _Stuffed Animals and Pickled Heads: The Culture and Evolution of Natural History Museums_ (Oxford University Press) will do nicely.  It is an amusing ramble through museums, but since Asma is a professor of philosophy, it veers through much larger ideas.<br />  Asma obviously likes museums, and he has gained entrance to the back rooms denied to other mortals.  He is delighted to report his findings, such as the dermestid beetle room at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.  These beetles, held in a stinky sealed room that has a door like a submarine hatch, swarm over the skinned bodies of specimens, literally gnawing them to the bone in a couple of days.  He has interviewed curators and exhibition designers, and has them explain what they are trying to accomplish in their exhibits.  But they may not know; how a display is arranged depends on scientific and social philosophy which varies from time to time and from nation to nation, and may be covert.  Louis Agassiz displayed human racial artifacts at Harvard to emphasize that races were different, having been separately and specially created, rather than showing the continuity of human descent.  The natural history museum in England have exhibits that emphasize Darwin, but the French hardly mention him.  The Americans will have the most modern philosophy of taxonomy.<br />Comfortable with including Plato, James, Wittgenstein and others from his own field, Asma gives a wide-ranging discussion of epistemological issues that is academic but is never stuffy and never loses its sense of fun.	2001-04-22

If among the things you have to confess you know nothing about are designing, stocking, and running a public aquarium, you can change that and have a darned good time filling in these particular voids.  David C. Powell, who knows more about running aquariums than just about anyone, has written a memoir, _A Fascination for Fish: Adventures of an Underwater Pioneer_ (University of California Press) that tells about his unusual career and has more than its share of pleasing anecdotes.<br />Powell took the first fish he caught as a kid and slept with it under his pillow.  He maintained the lobster tank at a fancy Malibu restaurant.  When he read Cousteau's first book, _The Silent World_, he knew he had to start diving.  As he kept specimens in his home aquarium, he joined the Marine Aquarium Society of Los Angeles.  A fellow member told him of a job opening as an aquarist at Marineland of the Pacific; it was just what he wanted to do, and from there he worked at various aquariums, directing the live exhibits at the Monterey Bay Aquarium until retiring four years ago.  He now seems to be the most frequently consulted consultant whenever towns or nations want to set up aquariums.<br />Powell writes with admiration and affection about the creatures he has to capture and then keep in as home-like an environment as possible, including the wonderfully named sarcastic fringehead, the \\"thumbsplitter\\" mantis shrimp with its faster-than-the-eye claw, and many more.  He tells about the process of capturing samples in many different ways, but diving and capturing fish is the easy part.  Transporting them is hard.  There are different gadgets and containers that have to be used, including the truck transport named the \\"Tunabago.\\"  It is planning the displays of the fish that obviously has given Powell the most satisfaction in his career.  His description, for instance, of the responsibilities of putting up the largest window in the world, a gigantic acrylic pane fifty-five by fifteen feet, thirteen inches thick, and weighing thirty-eight tons, is completely engrossing.<br />Powell's book, a mixture of autobiography, oceanography, ichthyology, museology, and funny stories, is a delight.  In seemingly effortless style, he conveys the excitement even in the minor aspects of his career.  He gives a final essay on the importance of aquariums (disdained by Cousteau as \\"fish prisons\\") in bringing people closer to nature and in promoting the conservation that could keep the oceans healthy.  His book is a worthy summary of a lifetime's effort in that cause.fteen feet, thirteen inches thick, and weighing thirty-eight tons, is completely engrossing.  <br />Powell's book, a mixture of autobiography, oceanography, ichthyology, museology, and funny stories, is a delight.

Nonetheless, the film did demonstrate the continuing realization of the importance of the cracking of Enigma, the most famous episode of codebreaking in history.  The story of the English boffins at Bletchley Park, led by the strange, brilliant, and doomed Alan Turing is indeed one of the great victories of the war.<br />But it wasn't all mathematicians, primitive computers, and brainpower.  _Enigma: The Battle for the Code_ (John Wiley &amp; Sons) by Hugh Sebag-Montefiore tells plenty about the cerebral efforts within Bletchley Park, but expands the story to include the cloak-and-dagger work and military captures of German vessels that were able to bring codebooks, Enigma machines, and encoding wheels into the purview of the cryptographers.  The victory over Enigma is a thrilling story that first started being revealed only twenty years ago, and this book helps to describe the difficulties the decoders went through because of the hazards of getting information from the field.  And it is a good story, with hair-raising escapes, bureaucratic in-fighting, eccentric characters, and genuine heroism on the high seas.<br />Some of the spywork was mundane.  We owe a lot to Hans Thilo Schmidt, for instance, the German who spied for the French Secret Service, providing keys to the system as early as 1931.  Schmidt was, however, no hero; he was simply in it for the money, to pay for vacations and mistresses.  He continued to provide information for pay until caught by the Germans in 1943.  Captured, he took cyanide, perhaps provided by his family and perhaps allowed by his captors to avoid an embarrassing trial.  His story has not been told before, and came from sources previously unavailable to historians.<br />_Enigma_ gives a chronology of the battle for the codes that demonstrates how vital decryption was in winning the war in the Atlantic.  When Bletchley Park could decrypt quickly, information got to the convoys enabling them to avoid U-boats.  When the Nazis changed methods of using Enigma, information slowed and ships were lost.  The ups and downs of gaining information from spies or from captured ships and using that information to crack messages is well told here.  The victory over Enigma is rightly remembered and celebrated.  Sebag-Montefiore expands the extent of the victory beyond the Bletchley cerebrations to the mostly unsung heroes who gave the code-crunchers something to work on.  The book is full of information, including appendices on details of how the Enigma machine worked and a useful chronology of high points in the Enigma battle.  It is a vivid account of the battles at sea and on land that won the code war.ources previously unavailable to historians.<br />_Enigma_ gives a chronology of the battle for the codes that demonstrates how vital decryption was in winning the war in the Atlantic.

But in the case of the Bible, translation has been regarded literally as a betrayal, a betrayal against religious or civic authority that might result in the most severe of punishments.  In _Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired_ (Simon &amp; Schuster) Benson Bobrick tells about the dangers of this particular betrayal as the Bible was launched by various attempts over the centuries into English.  The popes and monarchs were right to be worried about putting the Bible into the vernacular.<br />The right of the individual to make private religious inquiry may be said to have started with John Wycliffe, who was involved in translating the Bible in 1380.  His work was suppressed and condemned as heretical.  The offended and unforgiving church dug up his bones forty years after he died and burned them.  The father of the English Bible as we know it is William Tyndale.  He was a child prodigy in languages and \\"singularly addicted to the study of the scriptures.\\"  Influenced by the Humanists and by Luther, and taking advantage of the advent of printing by movable type, he wanted lay-people themselves to see the \\"process, order, and meaning of the text.\\"  He was hounded into Europe, and Henry VIII put watches on English ports to ensure his dangerous book did not sully their shores.  Tyndale lived a hunted life in Europe, was betrayed and captured in Antwerp, tried for heresy, and strangled and burned.<br />Bobrick, of course, explains much about the formation of the King James Version by fifty distinguished scholars, and he gives examples of the evolution of the Bible, with the KJV shining admirably in comparison to its predecessors.  Although the story of how we came to have an English Bible is a fascinating one, Bobrick's main thesis is that a popular Bible changed the way everyone regarded kings, popes, and governments.  Removed from the clutches of the clergy, the Bible became the instruction for any individual who cared to take it up and interpret it in any manner.  It was not necessarily that the Bible had instruction in liberty, but being able to read it freely was a token of the importance of liberty; it wasn't especially important whether reading the Bible turned readers into Christians.  Those who upheld the individual reading of scripture were those who promoted freedom of the press and who saw the conscience of the individual as the authority in all things.  They thereby reduced the authority of clergy and kings.  Those who could read the Bible themselves began to cite its many examples of bad kings and religious leaders when making comparisons to contemporaries.  The read-it-yourself Bible was a blow for individual conscience, one which brought on a constitutional crisis in Britain and eventually spurred independence for the United States.  Bobrick's well-researched and persuasive book shows that all of us, believers or not, are in debt to those who thought the Bible ought to be in everyone's hands.glish Bible is a fascinating one, Bobrick's main thesis is that a popular Bible changed the way everyone regarded kings, popes, and governments.

It's a peculiar idea that in a time when so little was scientifically understood about how the body and how medicines worked, physicians did try to make sense of what their patients were going through, and even tried to be objective and logical about treatments that were mostly magical.  In _The Notorious Astrological Physician of London: Works and Days of Simon Forman_ (University of Chicago Press), Barbara Howard Traister tells of one particular physician working around 1600.  The notoriety mentioned in the title of the book does not refer to his frequent sexual affairs, but to something that happened after Forman's death and for which he was completely unresponsible.  Nonetheless, those who know Forman's name these days know it because of literary references to his dark posthumous connection with a case of poisoning.<br />But Forman was an earnest and serious physician.  He wrote an autobiography, he wrote and copied textbooks for himself, and he kept a diary; Traister has gone to these core documents to give his picture.  Forman was busy during the London plague of 1593 (unlike other physicians, he didn't flee the city), and he had an active career as physician and astrologer.  He had many years of fighting the College of Physicians, which did not give him a medical license until 1603 (and persecuted him, in his view, even after that).  Forman kept fine records, one of the reasons his life and practice can be reconstructed better than those of other physicians.  Traister gives many quotations and samples to show how his practice worked.  Forman was not so enthusiastic about bloodletting as were most of his contemporaries.  He tended to give strong purgatives, and for this reason, he seldom treated children; the treatments of the time were too harsh.  Parents seemed to understand this, and often only wanted him to give a prognosis.  This was common at the time; ability to diagnose was severely limited and ability to cure was even worse, so patients were often satisfied just to know how bad they could expect things to be.<br />The pleasure in reading Traister's lively account is that Forman comes across as a active thinker who used his own resourcefulness and intellect to build a stock of clinically useful knowledge (and also spent as much energy womanizing as that other diarist, Pepys).  He may have built his practice on superstition, aphrodisiacs, and fortune-telling, but he had a successful professional life despite many trials (literally and figuratively).  Traister's book, an academic work full of quotations and footnotes, is nonetheless an engrossing picture of an interesting doctor and how he made his living.d and ability to cure was even worse, so patients were often satisfied just to know how bad they could expect things to be.  <br />The pleasure in reading Traister's lively account is that Forman comes across as a active thinker who used his own resourcefulness and intellect to build a stock of clinically useful knowledge (and also spent as much energy womanizing as that other diarist, Pepys).

They spend more on fast food than on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos, and recorded music - combined.\\"  Whew!  That's the sort of surprising statement that you can find throughout _Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the American Meal_ (Houghton Mifflin) by Eric Schlosser.  But the dark side is not how much we pay.  If we were enjoying a wholesome, safe product with our bucks, and the money was going to happy workers and happy managers, that would be one thing; but Schlosser shows that from bloodstreams to landscapes, fast food is doing us little good.<br />The structure of his book is just right.  It starts mild and gets more and more distressing chapter by chapter.  The start is nothing more than stories of guys successfully pursuing the American dream.  Guys like the one commemorated in the Ray A. Kroc Museum, which is located at One McDonald's Plaza in Oak Brook, Illinois.  We learn of the corporate strategy to pull the kids in, who will pull in their parents, who will pull in their money; the other arm of the strategy is to set up kids with an appetite for fast food that they will continue to satisfy as adults.  Before that, the kids will be teens, and teens are the main employees of fast food joints.  Their turnover means that they don't have even the slim chance their companies give of earning pay upgrades, overtime, or medical benefits.  Even more important, they don't stay around long enough to organize unions.  We learn about the chemistry of taste and smell production.  We learn about how large scale ranching can ruin the land, and how ranchers hope that they don't have to manage corporate cow factories like the chicken factories now bedeviling chicken farmers.  We learn of the dangerous jobs in the abattoirs, and the even more dangerous job of cleaning them.  People have died for your fast food, and it is killing people who eat it, too.  Some die from germs, some just from cholesterol.<br />The subject matter of the book makes it hard reading in places, but that is an emotional response.  Schlosser has a clear style, and while he can use wit, he does not let his anger over injustices and irrationality color his writing.  He presents stories, facts, and analysis with cool reason.  This is useful, worrisome muckraking.  He gives examples of restaurants that are doing things the right way and are not going broke in the process.  He has suggestions for what we can do to improve the situation.  One is to urge Congress to stop subsidies of dead-end jobs, improve food safety laws, protect workers, and fight concentration of economic power.  I somehow can't see the current administration doing this.  Another is that we should walk out of fast food restaurants and stay out; I may do this myself, but I don't know if many are going to follow.  If you can read this book and not consider boycotting fast food places, you have a stronger stomach than I.ho eat it, too.

It is a great legacy, but what does it really mean?  We are still struggling to find out.  In _To an Unknown God: Religious Freedom on Trial_ (St. Martin's Press) by Garrett Epps we learn how one of the latest struggles is turning out.  It is a fine book to show in detail how a specific constitutional decision came to be made.<br />On one side of the story was Al Smith.  Smith was born into the Klamath tribe, but was pulled out of it to go to Catholic boarding school.  Rather late in his life he was introduced to sweat lodges and Native American religion.  He was also introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous, and eventually became a respected counselor, speaker, and organizer of treatment centers for alcohol and drug abuse.  As he traveled to different reservations to set up recovery programs, he came across peyote religion.  It seemed to give some of his clients spiritual strength, and they seemed to do better in overcoming substance abuse if they participated in its religious ceremonies.  He began to consider participating in peyote religion.  He was told that taking peyote at a ceremony would violate the rules of the treatment center in which he worked, and so he did so.  He was thereupon fired, and he filed for unemployment compensation.  That filing set the stage for a subsequent battle within the Supreme Court and beyond.<br />On the other side was Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer.  He had tried in his political offices in Oregon to mend fences with the tribes of his region.  He was, however, very worried about the dangers of drug abuse, and so he felt he was doing the right thing in trying to squelch community acceptance of drugs, ceremonial or not.  He approached the Supreme Court proceedings with the mantra, \\"Drugs are bad.  Slippery slope.\\"  Not only was peyote illegal, but it was used in a minority religion; if it were allowed, then surely someone would be asking to use other drugs for religious purposes.  But he did reflect sadly to his legal team, \\"How did we get to be the Indian bashers?\\"<br />Epps is not only a journalist and lawyer, but also a novelist.  His ability to describe personalities and anecdotes serves him well, for although this is a legal story, the human stories within it are what make it live.  He has used process of the legal arguments as a springboard for an examination of many connected subjects: the history of the Bureau of Indian Affairs; the story of Alcoholics Anonymous; the tale of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and the Oregon town that was taken over by his devotees; the saga of the Road Man who is the ceremonial leader of the peyote religion.  These set pieces are fascinating, and strengthen the main story.  It is disconcerting that there is no pat final resolution, but Epps writes, \\"The law of religious freedom remains unsettled.\\"  Thus may it ever be.monial or not.

It is a complicated and unpredictable universe out there.  Chance and chaos seem to rule much of everything, and even when we think we have control, we often fool ourselves into thinking we really have more than we do, or that we have any at all.  The feeling of being in control, however illusory, is what has been harnessed by magical beliefs that have been found in all societies.  In _The Magical Universe: Everyday Ritual and Magic in Pre-Modern Europe_ (Hambledon and London), Stephen Wilson, a British historian, has compiled a monumental collection of magical beliefs and practices that shows how they affected almost all aspects of society, including doctrinal religion.  Every page is filled with odd practices that some community has at some time thought would decrease the chaos in the world.<br />Wilson has tried to lay out his encyclopedic work in logical fashion, with one chapter on livestock, another on conception and pregnancy, another on illness, and so on.  Within each chapter, though, is a grab-bag of folk belief, with every page having its share of surprising beliefs.  Take sex, for instance.  Sex had plenty of its own associated magic, as can be imagined when people understood nothing about genetics and about the menstrual cycle.  Impotence was often addressed by magic means because it was so frequently imposed on men by witches.  The witches' main time of instilling such a curse was at the wedding itself, perhaps by secretly tying knots which symbolized sexual frustration.  The prevention of such curses was commonsensical: the couples would deliberately avoid them by having sex before the wedding.  In parts of France, if the impotence took hold, the couple would be put into a barn, striped naked, tied to a post and whipped.  Having enjoyed this frolic, the \\"therapists\\" would untie them, given them food, and leave them to enjoy the night.  Standing stones from prehistoric societies were found all over Europe, and were, by the descendants of those who had erected them, thought to be fertility aids.  Women touched, bestrode, and rubbed on them, sometimes in groups as a pilgrimage.  When such stones were incorporated into the architecture of churches, their function as fertility talismans continued, to the distress of some clergy.  The cult of St. Leonard flourished in Limoges, and focused on a large bolt (\\"the bolt of St. Leonard\\") in the church door there.  A woman would move the bolt in and out to banish sterility.<br />These descriptions show a theme that rises throughout this book.  Wilson did not set out to write a comparative study of superstition and religion, but the two are interconnected in every chapter.  While the organized church often tried to keep separate from magical practices, or to suppress them, the two spheres eased the same doubts and engendered the same feeling of control.  Many priests frankly practiced magic and spells, and did ritual healings.  The host was treated with utmost care, but it could be cheeked and furtively removed from the church for magic purposes, such as helping in battles or detecting an unfaithful spouse.  It is no wonder that magic and religion were inextricably linked.<br />This impressive book is crammed with facts, many of them amusing.  The author, however, has the view that such magical thinking is no longer part of our modern world, and this is simply not true.  One can turn on Pray TV to see preachers casting out devils and doing healings.  The head of the PTL club thinks he can divert hurricanes.  We have Viagra now to help with erectile dysfunction, but the Web and newspapers are full of ads for herbal remedies for the problem.  Thousands of people believe they are regularly abducted by flying saucers.  We may no longer think that a baby's intelligence can be improved by application of blood or spittle, but we just know that Einstein had more brain cells in his mathematical area, and every now and then the newspapers have a story about the gene that carries genius.

Science cannot determine that gods of any type exist, nor can it determine that no gods exist.  However, there may be scientific reasons why the belief in gods remains strong.  In the surprisingly titled _Why God Won't Go Away_ Ballantine Books) by Andrew Newberg, M.D., Eugene D'Aquilli, M.D., and Vince Rause, we get a fascinating scientific answer to the title question, and a review of the current scientific understanding of the roots of belief.  The authors have done research by means of brain scans on those who are having mystical or religious experiences.  The brain scans show that something is going on among the neurons that doesn't happen at other times.  Most of the scans described in the authors' research show an increase in activity in the posterior superior parietal lobe, an area just behind the top of the head.  They call this for operational purposes the &quot;orientation association area (OAA),&quot; because the OAA orients a person in physical space.  &quot;To perform this crucial function, it must first generate a clear, consistent cognition of the physical limits of the self.  In simple terms, it must draw a sharp distinction between the individual and everything else; to sort out the you from the infinite not-you that makes up the rest of the universe.&quot;  When this area is damaged by trauma or stroke, patients have difficulty maneuvering in physical space; when it is extra active, it seems to be a source of an inexplicable feeling of connection to all creation.  A meditator describes the ineffable state in terms that are typical: &quot;There's a sense of timelessness and infinity.  It feels like I am part of everyone and everything in existence.&quot;<br />The authors explain that the gene-driven wiring of the brain to encourage religious beliefs exists because it has been evolutionarily good for us.

When twenty years ago the unprecedented exhibit of artifacts from King Tutankhamen's tomb was shown around America, they caused a sensation wherever they went.  When it came to the importance of Tutankhamen, however, the exhibit sparked another round of dismissiveness about the boy king (who just happened to leave a terrific tomb) compared to his predecessor Akhenaten, who was regarded by western Egyptologists as a bit of a hero.  It was Akhenaten who struck a blow for monotheism, banishing the strange gods with insect and crocodilian bodies in favor of the one sun god Aten.  He was a figure compared to Moses or Jesus, but it was said that his heresy terrified the people and threatened the powerful priesthood, which forced him out of Luxor into a new city he could devote to his peculiar ideas.  Upon his death, the boy king Tutankhamen came to power (or his handlers did), and caused a reversion to the old ways.<br />Christine El Mahdi has another tale to tell in _Tutankhamen: The Life and Death of the Boy King_ (St. Martin's Press), a revision of the lives of the pharaohs that shows how fashions, even in such arcane studies as Egyptology, change over time.  Akhenaten, in her view, was not the monotheistic hero pictured by the Egyptologists of the last century.  The old view was sparked by Tutankhamen's successor Horemheb, a conservative military man who hated Akhenaten, but not Aten.  The attestations of Akhenaten's monotheistic \\"heresy\\" were most vividly not from his successors, but from the nineteenth century \\"gentlemen archeologists\\" who were in Egypt as part of their Grand Tours, perhaps as preparation for entering the church.  Ancient Egyptians were seen as those who had enslaved the Jews, and who had the worst sort of animal-worshipping polytheism.  Their interpretation of Horemheb's denigration of Akhenaten (which seems to have been political) was that there was a revulsion against monotheism just as there had been reviling of the true religion by those other pagans, the Romans.<br />El Mahdi's title is simply too limited.  This is not just the story of Tutankhamen, but of the pharaohs who came before and after him.  It is a survey of the religious beliefs of their societies.  It is the story of Carter, Carnarvon, and of Egyptology in general, and how subjectivity influences even academic research.  It is a wonderful book for readers who want to find out more about the reality of a time that has always inspired enormous curiosity.  El Mahdi's enthusiastic and clear writing and broad view of history ensure that even those addicted to the wilder ideas of Egyptology should enjoy this guided tour of evidence and common sense.pagans, the Romans.  <br />El Mahdi's title is simply too limited.

The machine was the famous chess-playing automaton \\"The Turk,\\" and although it has been extensively written about for centuries, much of what has been written is just wrong.  No one has collected as much history about the Turk as Gerald M. Levitt, a chess player and writer who has written _The Turk, Chess Automaton_ (McFarland &amp; Company).  It is a fascinating history of the machine and what people made of it.<br />How it worked was a trick, but an exceedingly clever one that has been speculated upon in various ways ever since the Turk made its debut.  It was an intricate mechanism, to be sure.  That mechanical arm really was picking up the pieces and moving them, and somehow the machine could see what move its opponent had just made.  But the main part of the machine was a human chess player concealed within the table.  (Even if you know this, the way the Turk saw the board and moved the pieces will be a surprise.)  The doors of the cabinets inside the table were opened one at a time and no player could be seen, but that is because the cabinet was a cleverly designed magical apparatus that allowed him to scoot around in it to remain concealed as the various doors were opened.<br />During its career, the Turk played the chess champion Philidor, Benjamin Franklin, and Napoleon.  It was taken on tours of the world, and crowds were amazed by it.  Eventually, it wound up in a museum in Philadelphia, and was burned up in a fire in 1854.  _The Turk, Chess Automaton_ proves to be a grand history of the Turk's amazing career, but it is also a good deal more.  For real chess freaks, all the moves of the known games played by the Turk or its various operators are given here.  During the years of its operation, many different theories about how the machine worked were voiced and written about, and Levitt has included many of the original documents.  By far the most famous writer about the Turk was Edgar Allen Poe, whose 1836 article is reproduced here.  Among the useful appendices to this entertaining and well-illustrated book is the final one: the Turk has been resurrected.  A maker of equipment for professional magicians has made a faithful copy of it.  It has been shown in various seminars on the history of magic.  And the Turk still fools people.most famous writer about the Turk was Edgar Allen Poe, whose 1836 article is reproduced here.

Krauss showed in _The Physics of Star Trek_ that he could nimbly handle the exposition of big ideas in physics.  He has now picked perhaps the biggest assignment a science writer could tackle: the cosmos from beginning to end.  In his audacious new book, Atom: An Odyssey from the Big Bang to Life on Earth... and Beyond (Little, Brown and Company), Krauss has hitched onto an oxygen atom from the very beginning and perhaps even to the end of it all, showing the history and destiny of matter.  It is an exhilarating ride.<br />To take the start of the atom requires, of course, that Krauss explain about what went before.  His explanation of Big Bang weirdness is as clear as one can get.  He goes on to explain how both quarks and antiquarks were formed, with quarks in an almost inconsequential majority but enough to make all the matter we see around us now.  It was an accident that things turned out so, and Krauss's history is a list of strings of accidents to produce a world we can't help but see as full of design and consequence.  It is no surprise that throughout his pages he has exclamation points; his own surprise at all he describes is refreshing and sincere.<br />The oxygen atom which is the focus of this big story has to be traced to quarks, and then to the eight protons and eight neutrons that would make up its nucleus.  The protons and neutrons in the oxygen atom weren't close originally.  They may have been galaxies apart in the hydrogen and helium atoms that constituted all of the original universe, and that clumped together to make stars.  These nuclear furnaces started churning out heavier elements, include our oxygen atom, which joined with a couple of hydrogens on a snowball traveling around our solar system.  The comet crashed into Earth, the water became part of the ocean, the oxygen got to be part of the acid rain, and became incorporated into the mantle of the earth.  Then it was gobbled by a microbe to start its participation in all the life cycles.  Krauss speculates that long after the sun (and we) are gone, the oxygen atom will be speeding away, and maybe its protons and neutrons will wink away into even smaller dust.<br />Krauss's enthusiasm for his tale is wonderfully infectious: \\"Can each of the atoms in the air I breathe really have gone through hell and back, braved the bitter cold of space, the brutal heat of stars, have crashed into the Earth, have dredged down below the continents and ocean floor merely to rise again?  Have these atoms been a part of countless lives and seen countless deaths?  Will they travel throughout the cosmos that I would give my eyeteeth to explore?\\"  This exciting view of the very strange cosmos we live, in seen through the vicissitudes of one atom, ought to be a science classic.fe cycles.

Drought and monsoons hit India, China, southern Africa, Brazil, and Egypt, and millions died under the most hellish conditions.  About a third of this big book is devoted to descriptions of what the populace in various areas went through.  The pictures of suffering due to \\"malign interaction between climatic and economic processes\\" are harrowing.  This part of the book is not for you if you object to hearing about bodies by the roads as prey to the dogs, dogs as prey for the remaining humans, survivors fighting over corpses for food, parents eating their children and vice versa, and parents swapping children so that they might not cannibalize within the family.  A more complete nightmare is not to be imagined.  In the El Ni&ntilde;o events of the years around 1877 and 1898, something like fifty million people starved in China, India, and Brazil alone, and the horror stories are the same in all the locales.<br />It was the weather, of course, and no one can do anything about the weather.  Crop failures due to water shortage are just part of our agricultural lot.  And yet, the chief culprit in all those millions of deaths, Davis demonstrates, was not the amoral weather, but the immoral means used to cope with it.  In almost all the areas hit with starvation, there were grain surpluses in other parts of the country or the empire which could have rescued the drought victims.<br />It was during this period that by instantaneous international communication, people began to realize that drought in one area often accompanied drought in other areas.  Synchronous drought results from huge shifts in seasonal locations of the chief tropical weather systems.  Davis gives a history of our better understanding, with the key breakthrough coming only in the late 1960s, of what came to be known as ENSO, the El Ni&ntilde;o - Southern Oscillation.  Using the global insights, Davis demonstrates the linkages between the fates of sharecroppers in Brazil, cotton growers in India, and peasants in China.<br />This ambitious and well-documented work is an indictment of the capitalism of the time.  It is compelling reading, for all the ugliness of the episodes described.  It cannot provide specific plans for the inevitable famines to come via ENSO or other forces, but it compels us to admit that if starvation happens, we must not blame the weather, but rather ourselves.y breakthrough coming only in the late 1960s, of what came to be known as ENSO, the El Niño - Southern Oscillation.

Roy Moxham spent his every holiday in India, and thought he knew something of the nation, but when he came across an old book that mentioned the hedge, he had never heard of it.  He found more references to it, did all the research he could, and then went on a quest to find it.  _The Great Hedge of India: The Search for the Living Barrier that Divided a People_ (Carroll and Graf) is the delightful story of that quest.  Moxham had the idea in the beginning that he was searching for a quintessentially British folly, but learned in his researches that it was a far-from-harmless monstrosity, \\"a terrible instrument of British oppression.\\"  He gives us the history of salt and of the salt tax, as well as salt physiology, and it's role in the deaths of millions in the last century.  The salt tax and the hedge played a role in that sad story.<br />Fortunately, while Moxham has to fill us in on such history (and the history of the comparable French tax on salt), he also has the much more pleasant task of telling us about his researches and his travels.  We get to learn about his finding period maps, how difficult they were to read, and how he came to use the Global positioning System on his hunt.  But the cheeriest parts of the story have to do with his visits with friends and strangers in India.  He is able to describe with good humor the frustration of travel by motorized rickshaw, inexplicably efficient or inefficient trains, and pedestrian searches in the heat and dust of the Indian plains.  His Indian friends were unflaggingly helpful.  The strangers he met were almost always interested in his quest, although intensive farming and road building have wiped out almost all the traces of the hedge, and the community memory of it is almost entirely obliterated, too.  They supported him when all seemed lost.  This is fine travel writing.<br />Moxham succeeded in his quest to find some remnant of the hedge, but more importantly, he has made history by rescuing it from obscurity.  The hedge was an amazing physical achievement, but perhaps because its purpose was so ignominious people preserved little record of it.  Anyone reading this fascinating book, however, will be impressed by the quest for the hedge, and that its history has not been lost.but more importantly, he has made history by rescuing it from obscurity.

Pepper,\\" and has served as a model for characters in plenty of twentieth century novels. Lawrence Sutin has tried to make his importance clear in _Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley_ (St. Martin's Press), and to a large part has succeeded.  It is a big, readable biography, and Sutin has done his best to be sympathetic to his subject.  That must not have been easy.  Whether or not Crowley was \\"The Wickedest Man in the World,\\" as the tabloids liked to call him, he was often a jerk, although an entertaining one, and his life makes for entertaining reading.<br />Crowley was known, to his pleasure, as The Beast, identified with 666 and the Antichrist.  He pursued magic (or Magick, as he spelled it) all his life, saying, \\"The adventure of the Great Work is the only one worth while; for all others are but interludes in the sinister farce of Life and Death, which limits all merely human endeavor.\\"  This extreme seriousness was to mark all his efforts (which also extended into writing novels and a huge amount of poetry, as well as mountain climbing).<br />The seriousness is also the thing that is funniest about his life, at least to me; I am skeptical about a lot of religious beliefs, but Crowley served his up with some real silliness.  One of his titles in his beginning magickal career, for instance, was \\"Lord of the Paths in the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts and an Adeptus Minor of the Second Order Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis.\\"  He was able to enter the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and various other mystical sects, founding his own along the way.  He studied the ancient lore of alchemy and magick with fervor.  He practiced spells and magic rituals with complete sincerity, ... in various ceremonies.  He crucified a frog.  He incorporated mystical ... experiences into his rituals, using ... different variants of... couplings to elevate his learning to higher planes.  This work led to strange occult books attempting to unify his huge knowledge of ancient lore.  His _The Book of the Law_ has had a persistent life since it first emerged, and continues to influence thousands of believers, and these days, their websites.<br /> This silly, unsuccessful man founded a new religion that may well be regarded as the wellspring of \\"New Age\\" nonsense.  His work influences Scientology and Wicca, which are going strong.  As such, whether scoffers like me like it or not, he will continue to have enormous influence.  Sutin's biography may have a little too much deference, but he certainly does not shy away from the many unpleasant aspects of Crowley's life and character.  There is so much enigmatic material presented here that the main effect of studying the life of Crowley is a huge puzzlement.  Crowley would be delighted that even Sutin's careful delineation has failed to humanize The Beast.led to strange occult books attempting to unify his huge knowledge of ancient lore.

While it is accepted by most people that the Old Testament is not a science book, it was still held to be the history of Jewish people.  Now even that claim is questionable, with scientific archeology rewriting the history of the Holy Land.  Archeologists digging there now have no particular religious ax to grind, and are coming up with data unfound by archeologists who set out to prove the Bible true.  Israel Finkelstein is chairman of the Archeology Department at Tel Aviv University, and with journalist and archeology historian Neil Asher Silberman, he has told about the new archeology in _The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts_ (The Free Press).  While some of Silberman's claims are more controversial than others, most of them are accepted by archeologists, but no Bible fundamentalists will accept any.  They are, however, well explained in a clear style here, and ought to be attended by anyone who thinks the Bible is an important book.<br />Take, for example, the very idea of the exodus out of Egypt.  Biblical historians have always had to confront the fact that while the Egyptians were very good record keepers, none of them had recorded this particular slave revolt or miraculous defeat.  The explanation used to be that it was just too embarrassing for the Egyptians to describe, but now it seems that there may have been nothing to record.  There were strongly guarded forts established that would have made an escape of thousands of Israelites impossible, or at least, well noticed.  The biblical story about Moses and the troop wandering around in the Sinai desert also lacks any sort of archeological confirmation.  There has never been evidence of any such encampment, not the slightest shard of pottery, left in the area, even around Kadesh-barnea where most of the time was to have been spent.  This and other sites mentioned in the stories are real ones, some famous.  The archeology shows that some were occupied well before and some well after the exodus occurred, but they were empty during the wandering of the children of Israel in the wilderness.  The locales mentioned were occupied in the seventh century BCE, lending credence to the idea of composition of the legends around that time.<br />The legends succumb:  The walls of Jericho didn't fall because it had no walls at the time, and wasn't even occupied.  Solomon's Temple cannot be found.  The despised Ahab may have been the best builder and best ruler of Israel.  There is plenty more in this fascinating look at the light modern digs are throwing on the old stories.  The literalists will have to ignore such findings, of course, and those less literal will have to reassess the Old Testament.  As _The Bible Unearthed_ says, after casting doubt on so many venerable stories, \\"The power of the biblical saga stems from its being a compelling and coherent narrative expression of the timeless themes of a people's liberation, continuing resistance to oppression, and quest for social equality.  It eloquently expresses the deeply rooted sense of shared origins, experiences, and destiny that every human community needs in order to survive.\\"mpment, not the slightest shard of pottery, left in the area, even around Kadesh-barnea where most of the time was to have been spent.

Satanism was rampant across America, nay, the world, with protean manifestations, if people would just pay attention.  Twenty years before, there had been Satanism, but it was not very well publicized and not very interesting.  But somehow it became the fashionable scare.  How did this happen, and what should we do about it?<br />Bill Ellis is a folklorist, and an academic specializing in English and American studies.  His book, Raising the Devil: Satanism, New Religions, and the Media (University Press of Kentucky) attempts a sympathetic understanding of how the Devil made one of his cyclic emergences and how folklore can affect society and politics.  Scares about Satan and witchcraft have been present for centuries, and seem to give a safety valve for social aggression, scapegoating deviant individuals.  At the individual level of, say, someone who thinks he is possessed by a demon and someone who thinks he can cast that demon out, there is a social agreement on a folkloric belief that may be beneficial for both concerned (if not for the demon).  But Ellis's theme is that social groups can take over a folkloric belief to push a religious or governmental agenda, with disastrous consequences.  He shows how demon possession and speaking in tongues are two sides of the same coin, and how belief in demons was ballooned into the belief that there was a huge underground satanic network ruining our country.  Those who promulgated such conspiracy beliefs also bought into conspiracies involving Jews, vampires, the Illuminati, and cattle mutilations.<br />Raising the Devil is an academic work, well documented and organized.  Ellis tries to illuminate the role of the folklorist in examining these sorts of belief, and realizes that he and his fellows have the difficult road to follow of accepting folklore (even if it is patently untrue) as a force between small numbers of individuals, while they also have to confront institutions that would harness folklore for political or religious change.  His academic prose is leavened by the strange subject matter.  For instance, the Governor of Colorado is quoted as saying that cattle mutilations were \\"one of the greatest outrages in the history of the western cattle industry,\\" and a leader of a coven in England warned about bogus cult groups, as he had heard about one in which members \\"started getting in prostitutes dressed in rubber gear and there was wife swapping, too.

Women have been held to have particular power over the sea.  Mermaids, of course, enchanted the sailors, as did the Sirens.  And yet, there is an ancient superstition that women are not good for ships.  The contradiction between woman as sea power and woman as sea jinx is hard to understand.  It is discussed, but not resolved, in _Women Sailors &amp; Sailors' Women: An Untold Maritime History_ (Random House) by David Cordingly, a wide-ranging look at women and the high seas during the great age of sail.  Cordingly has been on the staff of the fine National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, and his wonderful book _Under the Black Flag_ was a revealing account of what pirates actually did.  His current book is an entertaining miscellany of feminine and nautical lore, and while it is not a feminist tract, it is clear that women have played a larger role in seafaring than history generally gives them credit for.<br />Some of their roles are direct ones.  Hannah Snell, for instance, served as a marine in the Royal Navy, sent to India on the sloop _Swallow_ in 1747.  She was a bit of a hero in the siege of Pondicherry, shot eleven times in the legs.  She revealed herself as a woman to her shipmates when she arrived home, and they would not have believed it had her sister not assured them of the truth.  She was the only woman sailor to be granted a pension by The Royal Hospital at Chelsea.  Once she was fully recovered from her wounds, and her identity was open, she became a celebrity, performing on the stage, having her portrait painted, and issuing a vivid account of her life story.<br />Most of the women at sea were, of course, women without a subterfuge of being men.  Lower rates were allowed to have wives and families on board, especially the warrant officers known as \\"standing officers.\\"  These were the gunners, boatswains, and carpenters who, once assigned to a ship, were attached to that one ship more or less for good, sometimes from her launch to her breaking up.

Unlike many other religious leaders, he fought against a cult of personality.  He wasn't important, he insisted; his teachings were worth writing and thinking about, but he wasn't.  The Buddhist scriptures reflect a legend about Gotama as told three generations after his death, but they do contain some reliable historic information.  No incident in the Buddha's life can be proven to be historically true, but Karen Armstrong, the former nun who has taken on the task of writing histories of God, of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, has now written a fine biography, _Buddha_ (Viking Penguin), which may have little to offer the millions of practicing Buddhists, but will inform the rest of us about the basics of Gotama's life, the process by which he came to his understanding, and the essentials of his teaching.<br />Gotama was raised in privilege, an easy, luxurious life into which he felt he did not fit.  He saw aging, illness, sorrow, and corruption, and reasoned that there must be some other mode of existence if only he could find it.  He always insisted that this other mode was nothing supernatural, that the almost universal feeling that there must be more to life did not mean that \\"more to life\\" depended on the divine world of the gods.  Leaving his family, he initially encountered forest monks who were interested in finding the absolute self within, rather than speculating about any ultimate reality.  From his initial teachers, Gotama absorbed the practice of yoga as a step in such a severance, and he used it all his life.  Quickly he achieved the yogic feeling of \\"nothingness,\\" of complete separation, but with ruthless honesty and skepticism, he realized that this was not the nirvana he was seeking; when he came out of the trance, he still had desires, and nirvana could not be temporary.  He then tried enlightenment through asceticism, starving himself, going naked, and even trying to go without breathing.  He eventually found his own \\"middle way\\" between asceticism and self-indulgence.  He was acutely aware of human suffering, and the desire that gave rise to it, but it freed him from even the tiny frustrations and disappointments that occur every hour.  He abandoned all personal preference, and adopted a disinterested benevolence.<br />Armstrong can describe such revelations, but of course the description can barely give insight into the mental processes Gotama went through.  More importantly, she describes his career of teaching.  He had enormous success in attracting devotees in the cities.  He eventually retired more and more into the wilds as he became elderly.  He reminded his followers that their teacher would soon be gone, but the teachings could remain their teacher forever.  \\"All individual things pass away,\\" he reminded them in his last words before slipping into coma.  \\"Seek your liberation with diligence.\\"<br />_Buddha_ is a useful summary of the life and teachings of an influential thinker.  Armstrong has provided a sensible overview of the basics of Buddhism that will improve the understanding of anyone of another belief.  She has judiciously used comparisons with more familiar religions, and she has given background information on the society and economics of the Buddha's times.  Her explanations are clear, and her prose, as usual, is very readable.  Buddha might not have wanted a biography, but if he had to have one, this one is close to perfect.to go without breathing.

Proof that we need such a drug is that ninety percent of the world's population already uses it.  The drug is caffeine, and every aspect imaginable of it is covered in _The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug_ (Routledge) by Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer.  If you are at all interested in knowing more about the drug you almost surely use on a daily basis, here's a wealth of information for you.<br />For instance, why is it that so many plants make caffeine?  There's coffee, of course, and tea, and cocoa.  Then there's cola nut, mat&eacute;, and guarana, and yoco, and others you have probably never heard of and which have no commercial value.  Caffeine within a plant possesses capacity to kill harmful fungi and bacteria.  It can kill weeds around the plant, and bother insects.  Pure caffeine is so dangerous to humans that labs which make it have to have ventilation and mask and glove their workers.  It is possible to kill yourself with caffeine, but it isn't easy.  Drinking a hundred espressos quickly might do it, but getting all that liquid down might present a little difficulty.  This dangerous a drug ought to cause some real problems, but other than sleep disturbance, it is really quite seldom that anyone has a difficulty with caffeine.  In truth, there have been countless studies of what caffeine does to the body, and virtually no ill effects can be traced to it.  We may have made a terrible choice in our other legal mind altering drugs, tobacco and alcohol, but we picked a pretty safe one in caffeine.<br />Caffeine must do us plenty of good if it is so prevalent, and studies show that it is in many ways a \\"smart pill\\" that can help in intellectual effort.  This seems to be at least partially independent of its capacity to simply increase alertness.  Rather startlingly, it has been shown to make the branches of nerve cells in the brain longer and more numerous, so that there is more potential for the neurons to interconnect.  Caffeine is thus the only known substance that augments brain function by changing the brain's physical structure.  It may be that governments don't like the idea of caffeine-fired people thinking political thoughts; many governments have made coffeehouses illegal.<br />History, chemistry, physiology, and economics are tied together in this big, well-illustrated tribute to the world's only unregulated, unlicensed, addictive drug that is available everywhere.  Good reading for all addicts.that it is in many ways a \\"smart pill\\" that can help in intellectual effort.

Oscar was unfortunate in his enemies, and in many of his friends, but he was very fortunate in the friendship of Robbie Ross, a friendship that displayed itself throughout Oscar's successes and worst trials, and for long after Oscar's death.  It cannot be said that Ross was a particularly important figure, but as a friend to Wilde, he influenced Oscar in many good ways.  Ross is a footnote, but he was an exceptionally good friend and a good man, and now he has a good biography, _Robbie Ross: Oscar Wilde's Devoted Friend_ (Carroll and Graf Publishers) by Jonathan Fryer.  It will be a welcome volume for any interested in Oscar's life.<br />As a youth, Robbie met Oscar and introduced him to homosexual lovemaking.  Oscar took other lovers afterward, as did Robbie, and Robbie had not the slightest jealousy about Oscar's affections.  Throughout Oscar's life, Robbie was there to give him help and good counsel, although Oscar sadly didn't often take his advice.  When Oscar wound up in jail, Robbie came back, and made himself indispensable with visits to the jail and with taking up collections from the friends Oscar still had.  Robbie received the deserved admiration of Oscar's friends, and of Oscar: \\"When I see you, I shall be quite happy, indeed I am happy now to think I have such wonderful friendship shown to me,\\" and \\"Your love, your generosity, your care of me in prison and out of prison are the most lovely things in my life.\\"<br />Robbie oversaw the publication of \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\" and of _De Profundis_.  He was on hand at Oscar's death, and oversaw the temporary internment and the arrangement of the final resting place in Paris.  He befriended Oscar's sons, who from him heard the first kind things about their father since they were taken from him and had their name changed.  He was determined that Oscar's work would be read and performed again, and that the sons would get the benefit; his efforts to remove Oscar's estate from bankruptcy were eventually successful.  He edited the twelve volume set of Oscar's collected works, and the books were a commercial and critical success.<br />There is much in this affectionate biography about Robbie's writing career, his running an art gallery, or his becoming an influential art critic.  He would be forgotten, however, if it were not for his devotion to Oscar, and it is quite possible that we would remember Oscar less vividly if Robbie had not performed him such faithful service.  This book is a fit testimony to that service.  He was faithful to Oscar's memory until his own end, and when that end came, his ashes were eventually placed, fittingly and sweetly, in the cavity he had requested in the design of Oscar's monument.car's work would be read and performed again, and that the sons would get the benefit; his efforts to remove Oscar's estate from bankruptcy were eventually successful.

Thousands of women took this super-safe sedative, or morning sickness suppressant, and found that their children were born with grotesquely stunted limbs like flippers, or perhaps no arms or legs at all.  The dismal story of how thalidomide was invented, marketed, and withdrawn is a big part of the fascinating account in _Dark Remedy: The Impact of Thalidomide and its Revival as a Vital Medicine_ (Perseus Publishing), by Trent Stephens and Rock Brynner, but as the title implies, the story is not all gloom.  The initial part of the story is simply shocking, with the German drug manufacturer displaying incompetence and selfishness throughout the product's development, testing, and distribution.  When problems emerged, the company did a cover up, hired a detective to keep tabs on the doctors and patients who were complaining, and kept selling the drug.<br />The United States was a huge potential market for thalidomide.  A subsidy of Vick Chemical Company (makers of Vicks VapoRub) was set to release it in the US in 1961.  The company was sure it would get quick approval from the Food and Drug Administration, because at the time there was no requirement to show that the drug worked, it was up to the FDA to find any data to show any dangers, and pharmaceutical representatives did favors for FDA officials.  The FDA, and the company, did not reckon on young FDA staffer Dr. Frances Kelsey, who was appalled by the sloppiness of the application.  The story of the drug company's recklessness is shocking, but Dr. Kelsey's refusal to bow to heavy pressure, from both the company and her superiors in the FDA, is one of the inspiring parts of the book.  She got a civilian service medal from President Kennedy, and it was due to her unflagging refusal to compromise that thalidomide didn't make it to American shelves.<br />Dismaying and astonishing are the stories of how the drug got approved elsewhere, and how the makers attempted to absolve themselves of any financial responsibility to the victims.  But those are only part of the thalidomide story.  The other part is that thalidomide is back.  Results published in 1965 showed that thalidomide has an enormous capacity to relieve the pain of leprosy.  This is important for lepers, of course, but there is not a huge population of lepers these days.  More recently and more importantly, thalidomide has been used for HIV; it was found that it was good for the wasting of the illness and the mouth ulcers.  From these results have grown the research that shows that thalidomide can be useful for victims of cancer (especially multiple myeloma) and autoimmune diseases such as lupus.<br />Current research on the drug (and author Stephens has done some of it) has pursued just how thalidomide caused its extraordinary birth defects, so that the drug company now making it could work on an analogue drug that has all the good effects and none of the birth deformities.  In fact, such a drug is undergoing trials.  Thalidomide, this excellent history and scientific explanation shows, has ruined lives, but it has also caused needed changes in drug approval processes, and still has potential for diminishing suffering.ed elsewhere, and how the makers attempted to absolve themselves of any financial responsibility to the victims.

Nonetheless, _1831: Year of Eclipse_ (Hill and Wang) by Louis P. Masur puts that American year under a historian's microscope and shows how the people making history then were bringing on the American future, for better or worse.<br />It was a year of eclipse, literally.  On 12 February, there was a total eclipse of the sun that crept up the eastern seaboard.  Some writers celebrated that people would be seeing the simple mechanics of the solar system following the laws of planetary motion, and that no modern would take the eclipse to mean a token of divine displeasure.  It wasn't quite true; another author wrote that there was \\"a kind of vague fear, of impending danger - a prophetic presentiment of some approaching catastrophe.\\"  Some citizens sought out their families, that they might all die together.  Actually, the eclipse was an anticlimax, not as dark or dramatic as the newspapers had predicted, and they and almanac editors were condemned for the fizzle.<br />But the eclipse was dramatic enough for one prophet, who \\"saw white spirits and black spirits engaged in battle, and the sun was darkened - the thunder rolled in the Heavens, and the blood flowed in streams.\\"  These are the words of Nat Turner, a slave and a literate preacher, who in August executed his plan of slave rebellion in Virginia.  The reports of the horrors of the rebellion galvanized Virginians, and shook their foundations of economic happiness.  Masur reports on the insistence of southern states that they be able to practice \\"nullification\\" of federal laws they thought unjust, an insistence that had President Jackson threatening to use force against them.  1831 saw the testing of the first reaping machine, and a boom in the railroads.  It found visitors to the new nation impressed and appalled that, as a Frenchman wrote, \\"The sole interest which absorbs the attention of every mind is _trade_.  It's the national _passion_... Money is the god of the United States.\\"<br />Especially with reports from outside visitors, Masur's book gives an idea of just what sort of nation we were beginning to be.  He describes the enthusiasm for religious revival, tent meetings that were supposed to bring reform of the individual and then of society.  He describes the surprising political party of the Anti-Masons, who were sure that the Masons were the sort of conspiracy that some decry still today, who were the first third party in American history, and who invented the presidential nominating convention.  He examines the first stirrings of a workers' movement.  He shows Jackson as trying to hold the nation together, wiping out the Cherokee notions of nationhood, and destroying the National Bank which others saw as indispensable to the nation.

The clerk was a former football star, and the \\"politically powerful football fraternity\\" made his initial imprisonment as deprived as possible, and for thirty-five years has acted against any parole actions.  Sinclair tells his life story in _A Life in the Balance: The Billy Wayne Sinclair Story_ (Arcade Publishing).  It is full of distressing events during his upbringing and during his decades of imprisonment, but it is devoid of self-pity.  Sinclair landed on Death Row in Angola, \\"the bloodiest prison in America.\\"  He became a \\"fanatic devotee\\" of self discipline.  He began studying law on a daily schedule.  \\"I learned to lock my mind on living, to believe that I had a future...  The Row taught me patience.  It burned away my habit of recklessness when I grew frustrated in the pursuit of a goal.\\"<br />Readers who can stomach Sinclair's descriptions of an abusive upbringing by a sadistic father and his descriptions of prison life will find some bright light in this dark tale.  Angola was \\"a world of racial strife and hatred; homosexual rape and slavery; protection rackets that provided a way for the strong to live comfortably at the expense of the weak; and widespread drug trafficking that brought its dealers tremendous profits and its users an escape from the bitter reality of their failed lives.\\"  In this dismal environment, Sinclair continued to study, and became a jailhouse lawyer, helping many of the other criminals.  He became an editor of the penitentiary's newsmagazine, _The Angolite_, and helped change it from an innocuous newsletter to a serious prison publication with journalistic standards.  It won journalism awards and played its part in bringing reforms to Angola.  Sinclair continued his life as a whistle-blower, and while it gained him respect, it also led to recriminations from the authorities and continued balking at his parole attempts.  When he challenged the corruption within the inmate society, his life was at risk.<br />  He wrote the book with his wife of nineteen years; it is clear he loves her, but it is a mystery why she, a television news reporter, entered into a jailhouse marriage.  Nonetheless, they have produced a book that is graphic, powerful, and unforgettable.  As Sinclair went through losses within the prison system, he gained empathy about the loss of life he had caused in a punk robbery decades ago.  He has seen the worst of humanity as captors and captives, but he also has distinct admiration for some of the exemplars on both sides.  He has had decades with no disciplinary write-ups, has served prisoners and prisons with needed reforms, and has seen multiple murderers begin their sentences and end them while he trudges on.

You won't forget him after reading _The London Monster: A Sanguinary Tale_ (University of Pennsylvania Press) by Jan Bondeson.  Bondeson is a physician who lives in London, and whose previous books include _The Feejee Mermaid_, a look at various \\"unnatural\\" specimens like fake mermaids and vegetable lambs.  His current book is a gothic-comic history, full of unnatural specimens such as a hero known as \\"The Catamite\\" and \\"The Cowardly Fishmonger,\\" unreliable alibi witnesses who worked in an artificial flower factory, corrupt judges, and The Monster himself, Rhynwick Williams, or maybe it wasn't.<br />The Monster had a career of crime not of disemboweling his victims as his criminal descendant The Ripper did, but of following them in the street, insulting them, cutting their clothes, slicing their buttocks, and making his foul and stealthy escape into the night.  He also would approach a woman, insist that she examine the bouquet of artificial flowers he carried, and then cut her with a blade concealed in the bouquet.  His exploits were heavily covered by the press; one reporter wrote that certain ladies had been \\"wounded by some MONSTER (for such the perpetrator of such horrid deed must be, as there was not one but laid strong claims to beauty).\\"  His career lasted from 1788 to 1790, and Bondeson lists fifty-eight women who were his supposed victims.  Such a list is highly questionable, because of the notoriety of The Monster.  Newspapers, poems, caricatures, and posters for rewards (all well reproduced here) meant many false leads.<br />Not only has Bondeson described the career of The Monster with verve and humor, but he has given a brief history of similar episodes of \\"epidemic hysteria.\\"  While it is true that there was a Monster, and he did cut ladies up, the exaggerated response of the public was similar to the phantom gas attacks by the nonexistent Mad Anesthetist of Illinois in 1944, or the Halifax [England] Slasher of 1926 in which people were cut up, but it turned out they were cut up by their own selves.

If you took a human being and dismantled the body into its elements of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and the rest, you would get a collection of pure chemicals that used to estimated as worth 89 cents.  That's what you get if you take all the information and structure away.  Information and structure within our bodies are worth something, and are worth more and more every day as we are able to understand them better.  And here's a disturbing thought: someone else may own those particular details on your own particular body.  And sell them.<br />According to Lori Andrews and Dorothy Nelkin, in their troubling book _Body Bazaar: The Market for Human Tissue in the Biotechnology Age_ (Crown Publications), that's happening often.  It happened to John Moore, who about fifteen years ago was being treated by a specialist for hairy-cell leukemia.  As you can imagine, such treatment required a lot of tests on Mr. Moore's body, but it seemed to Moore that there were too many going on, and that the doctor was secretive, and insistent that the blood, and then bone marrow and skin and semen, had to be obtained at his own lab.  Moore investigated, and found that he had become patent number 4,438,032.  The doctor had found that there were certain unique chemicals in Moore's blood, and the pharmaceutical company Sandoz had reportedly paid $15 million for the right to develop a cell line taken from Moore.  The doctor seems to have said that he had found a \\"gold mine\\" in Moore, and Moore indeed felt he had been \\"harvested.\\"  So, of course, Moore sued for property theft.  In 1990, the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of the doctor, saying in effect that Moore didn't own his body parts, but the ones who discovered and patented them did.<br />  Author Andrews is a legal scholar and bioethicist at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and Nelkin is a New York University professor of law.  They offer many other troubling examples of what we would intuitively regard as people's rights to their own body chemistry being smashed for the profits of gene-hunters and corporations.<br />  Issues of genes are not the only problems covered in this worrisome book, which is an excellent introduction into a world we are just now making for ourselves.  It also considers such things as the ownership of bodies which are prepared for artistic display; the Korean Ear Mound in Kyoto, Japan, a collection of body trophies from the Japanese-Korean War four hundred years ago; and the web sales of a firm called Skulls Unlimited.  The genetic issues, because of their novelty, are certainly the most enigmatic, and the authors quite rightly raise questions about non-medical issues such as DNA typing of criminals, military people, or minorities to go into a computer whose usage may be unlimited.  It is perhaps regrettable that the final chapter of the book, where one would expect intelligent recommendations for solutions, is only seven pages long, and contains more questions than answers.

With some concern about ten years ago I began hearing about a group of feminists who were campaigning against pornography.  Catherine MacKinnon, one of the leaders, wrote, \\"Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex... an institution of gender inequality... [P]ornography, with the rape and prostitution in which it participates, institutionalizes the sexuality of male supremacy.\\"  MacKinnon teamed up with another feminist, Andrea Dworkin, who has spouted a remarkable range of anti-sex rants: \\"Intercourse with men as we know them is increasingly impossible... It means remaining the victim... It means acting out the female role, incorporating the masochism, self-hatred, and passivity which are central to it.\\"  The MacDworkinites, as they are called, might be considered by some just a branch of feminists that are even more radical than their sisters, but the problem is that they are eager to chip away at the First Amendment.<br />That brings them into conflict with the American Civil Liberties Union, and in 1995 Nadine Strossen, President of the ACLU, wrote a fine argument against the MacDworkinites, which has now been issued with some updates, _Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights_ (New York University Press).  It is a thrilling invocation of the principles of liberty given by the First Amendment, and a reasoned but passionate argument against those feminists who would for some notion of a greater good restrict free speech to make social gains.<br />The MacDworkinites have made some enormous leaps of definition and logic that to them justify suppression of certain forms of speech.  They define pornography as sexually explicit description that subordinates or degrades women, and they insist that as such it causes discrimination and violence against women.  The ACLU has successfully battled against the definition of pornography pushed by the pro-censorship feminists in various states and communities, but it has, of course, not taken legal action in Canada, which in 1992 adopted the definition and made illegal sexually explicit expression that might be deemed dehumanizing or degrading to women.  The Canadian law has no provision for work that has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value (as our obscenity laws do now), and it allows for suppression of an entire work even if only parts of it meet the new obscenity definition.  MacKinnon and Dworkin saw this as a stunning victory for women.  What happened in Canada is that the feminists who worked for the new law have been stunned to find it used against them.  Women's bookstores, in particular, were raided if they carried sexual material.  Homosexual material was found by definition to be degrading and was seized.  And, in a delicious irony, two books entitled _Pornography: Men Possessing Women_ and _Woman Hating_ were seized by Canadian Customs at the American border, because they contained illegal descriptions of pain and bondage.  The descriptions, however, were there for the purpose of persuading society against misogyny, and the books were written by Dworkin herself.<br />Much of _Defending Pornography_ deals with the legal reasons that MacDworkinist regulations undermine women's rights and human rights, and the chilling effect that such regulations would have on free expression, but it does touch on pornography in a more general view.  If there should be no laws restricting freedom of the press (or other media), what is so particularly special about sexual content that justifies laws restricting freedom of the press?  Why, if a work has sexual content, must we insist that it have artistic, scientific, or political content as well, when we do not do so for anything else?  If men and women (and women are increasingly users of erotic material) find pornography entertaining (and even the Meese commission found it could be educational), how does it benefit society to restrict such material?  And are such benefitsworth the losses that censorship, censorship exemplified by the MacDworkinist restrictions, would necessarily make?  _Defending Pornography_ makes plain the losses that have already occurred and serves as a call to arms against prudes or well-intentioned advocates that would cut back First Amendment rights.s worth the losses that censorship, censorship exemplified by the MacDworkinist restrictions, would necessarily make?  _Defending Pornography_ makes plain the losses that have already occurred and serves as a call to arms against prudes or well-intentioned advocates that would cut back First Amendment rights.	2001-02-23

Only over the past few decades, however, have scientists been able to get a grip on something else fascinating: climate.  Ice in Greenland has been piling up year by year for 100,000 years.  This ice carries inside it a record of the climate that produced each yearly layer.  In _The Two-Mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and Our Future_ (Princeton University Press), Richard B. Alley, who has done research in Greenland and Antarctica, gives us a view of his narrow and deep studies, and tells us why they are important.  It is the first book for the layman to show how climate historians are doing their jobs, drilling five inch cores two miles down, and analyzing the ice in many clever ways.<br />For most of the 100,000 year record, the climate has had wild jumps, centuries of cold followed by abrupt heating.  Humans have lived in an anomalous period of stability.  There have been climate changes that influenced human life, like the warm spell that lured the Vikings to Greenland and the cold that drove them out, but these represent one degree shifts shown in the recent ice records.  Teensy temperature changes have made what we would consider big climate differences, but when it comes to the wild changes, we ain't seen nothing yet.<br />Yet.  Alley devotes the main part of his book, after showing how scientists draw facts out of buried ice, to discussing what drives global climate change over decades and over eons.  He is able to paint a vivid, if brief, picture for those who are not acquainted with his field.  His comparisons are felicitous, explaining that the ocean loses carbon dioxide when heated just as a carbonated soft drink would, or showing how a glacier pushes Greenland down into the deep, hot, soft rock below like a person sitting on a waterbed full of syrup.  He is in no way a scaremonger, and takes the correct tentative tone because we don't have all the information yet.  However, he concentrates on a switching mechanism involving the flow of the Atlantic Gulf Stream; it seems that minor changes in temperature or salinity may jam the \\"conveyor belt\\" of the oceans as they transfer heat from the equator to northern latitudes.  If it does jam, the results for Europe would be disastrous, and it would affect the rest of the world as well.  We know about this switch, and there must be others that we do not know about, and all of them may be vulnerable in our current period of stability to being switched off and making the climate careen again.  His moderate advice is that climate change is inevitable, that it will trouble more people than it benefits, and that there are reasons to think that what we are doing to the atmosphere may kick it into instability.  If we continue, we may well suffer a crash of a climate change that uses up more of our resources than we have; prudence suggests that we all (especially in developed nations) should be trying to reduce our impact per person.  We have used the current centuries of stability for all they are worth; if you don't like the weather now, stick around for twenty years or two hundred, because it is going to be quite different.oses carbon dioxide when heated just as a carbonated soft drink would, or showing how a glacier pushes Greenland down into the deep, hot, soft rock below like a person sitting on a waterbed full of syrup.

There may have been bigger plagues before and since, but _The Black Death_ (Tempus Publishing) by William Naphy and Andrew Spicer is about _the_ plague, the one that is commemorated in countless paintings and woodblocks and in literature.  It is still a mysterious and scary illness, and while the authors skimp on some of the horrors and medical explanations, they describe the atmosphere around the disease and the changes it wrought in fascinating detail.  Christians and Muslims were agreed that the new arrival of the plague was sent upon humans by Divine Will, but Muslim clerics interpreted their Koran as insisting that no one should try to flee a plague deliberately sent from Allah.  Bear it with humility, was the advice, and when you die, you get straight admittance to Paradise.  Being sent straight from Allah precluded the understanding of the plague as contagious.  The fairly monolithic Catholicism of the time could not see the plague as a blessed ticket to paradise.  It did not insist that parishioners remain to stick out an infection, but it did insist that people consider their sins and those of their societies.<br />The decrease in population meant that it was harder to get priests, and that apprenticeships were shortened and younger men became masters; guilds recruited outside of the families that had been their historic sources.  Women entered trades which had never welcomed them before.  Attempts were made to hold wages down and agricultural workers were forbidden to leave their lands for better prospects.  \\"Sumptuary laws\\" were instituted to make it illegal for one class to dress like the ones above it, implying that luxury goods were more available to the reduced market.  Mere shopkeepers gave fine banquets.  The plague is historically significant for bringing a sort of populism.  Society was also turned upside down by people fleeing the communities that had nurtured them.  People took solace from their saints.  Mary was often depicted as wounded by arrows of grief for her son, so she became somewhat of a specific saint for those fearing plague; similarly, Saint Sebastian who was martyred by being an archery target was held to be particularly good for deflecting the arrows of the plague.  Just how these secondary religious figures managed to thwart the marksmanship of God was never explained.  Then the flagellants came to town, traveling to whip their bodies bloody to appease God's wrath and make the plague go away.  They would go to the church, surround it, and start whipping themselves with cruel barbed whips.  The clergy were horrified not by the blood, but by the threat to their monopoly on spiritual power, and Pope Clement VI quickly condemned the flagellants in 1349.  A frequent recourse of religious people was scapegoating, and as usual the Jews got blamed as the cause of everything.  It is nice to think that we have risen above such behavior, and of course we do have enormous technical expertise in dealing with diseases now, as well as refusing to accept that they are simply manifestations of angry deities.  However, human nature is not really any different than it was seven centuries ago.  Although the plague quite mysteriously collapsed in virulence, there will someday be a new one, I believe, to take a big chunk of us away.  (What if ebola transformed into an illness that could be caught as simply as colds are?)  _The Black Death_, with its descriptions of the plague process and many illustrations, gives a fine, sobering review of what happened before, and while it makes no attempt at prognostication, I think we may just see such things again.for bringing a sort of populism.

Is there one material that is the bottleneck, the thing that limits populations and growth?  Surprisingly, there is a \\"supreme ruler\\" that if diminished slows all life down, no matter what the availability of other chemicals is.  That bottleneck chemical is phosphorus.  According to _The Thirteenth Element: The Sordid Tale of Murder, Fire, and Phosphorus_ (John Wiley &amp; Sons) by John Emsley, phosphorus is essential for, among other things, being the backbone of DNA and forming the basic chemistry for biological storage and use of energy.  It does not get replenished by circulation as the other big four do; carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen all can circulate in the atmosphere or by water.  It cannot be \\"fixed\\" from the atmosphere into the soil by microbes, as nitrogen can.  Phosphorus does have its cycles, but they are slow, like the one that includes it being washed from the soil into the sea, forming part of the sea bed, and then in millions of years being lifted up as rock to form new land.  The main land-based cycle is simply from soil to plants to animals and via urine, feces, or decomposition, back to soil again.  Cultivation of land means that phosphorus in plants is exported away, and does not get re-deposited into the soil.  Crops grown on the same land deplete it of other vital chemicals, but the one that is lost forever without deliberate replacement is phosphorus; this was not known until the nineteenth century.  It was found that using bone meal as a fertilizer was effective, but it was originally assumed that the calcium in its calcium phosphate was the cause.<br />Emsley has good fun describing the ins and outs of phosphorus, but his book is particularly wide-ranging.  He explains why the phosphorus in detergents is not really as bad as we once thought.  He explains that it has been used as a medicine for centuries, even though it never cured anyone of anything.  He tells stories of phosphorus as a poison, used as such successfully by many dissatisfied husbands and wives, some of whom were particularly skillful at the use of the element in this way, having practiced on a succession of spouses.  Much of the book is devoted to the nasty properties of phosphorus, such as the horrid disease of \\"phossy jaw\\" which afflicted those in the matchmaking trade, or the distressing effects of nerve gas or phosphorous bombs.<br />So, like so many things, phosphorus is neither good nor bad, but is essential and can be used in many admirable or detestable ways.  Emsley takes us through many of them in a wide-ranging book that not only covers the science of his element, but also the social forces in such activities as the advertising of matches and the social reforms which improved the safety of the matchmakers.  He has many previous credits as a science writer, and clearly and vividly describes the history and both the dramatic and quotidian effects of an essential, ubiquitous, and dangerous element.one of anything.

The most unacceptable part of the theory was that humans themselves had evolved from some previous ape-like form.  Scientific opposition to this idea started crumbling when the \\"Missing Link\\" between humans and their obviously non-human forebears was found.  Eug&eacute;ne Dubois was the man who found it, and his story has never been fully told.  Now, in _The Man Who Found the Missing Link: Eug&eacute;ne Dubois and His Lifelong Quest to Prove Darwin Right_ (Simon and Schuster), Pat Shipman has written an exciting biography of a neglected genius, and has given a narrative that tells how paleontology was done in his times, as well as how his ideas eventually became accepted within the scientific world.<br />The word \\"lifelong\\" in the subtitle of the book is almost literally true.  Inspired by learning about the Theory of Evolution as a boy, Dubois learned that transitional forms between ape-like creatures and humans were hypothesized but had not yet been found.  The boy realized that finding such a specimen would be possibly the greatest scientific discovery ever, and astonishingly, he was convinced that he was going to be the one to do it.  With this in mind, he entered medical school and engineered an assignment as a physician in the Dutch East Indies, for it was there his research told him the missing link would most likely be found.  Shipman's account of the prospecting years is exciting.  Dubois took his family to the islands, he survived cave-ins, malaria, and government neglect, and he identified thousands of mammalian fossils, including in 1891 a molar, skull, and thigh-bone of the missing link.  His Java Man (which he classified as _Pithecanthropus erectus_) had a small brain, a flat forehead, and a leg made for upright walking.  To Shipman's credit, she illuminates well the sadder aspects of the man and his subsequent story with equal detail.  Dubois was brilliant and tenacious, but he experienced real betrayals in his scientific life that consumed him.  He had a lifetime that was hard enough.  His beloved father died while Dubois was prospecting in Java, and never learned of Dubois's spectacular success.  When Dubois brought the specimens home, the reaction of his mother was, \\"But, boy, what use is it?\\"  As the finder of the first link between humans and non-human ancestors, Dubois was necessarily the lightning rod for attacks from the clergy and the public.  Also, the old-guard scientists who had not accepted evolution found or imagined reasons to disagree with Dubois's discoveries.  He felt himself so ill-treated that he locked up his fabulous specimens for decades, provoking an international scientific protest when he would let no one else examine them.<br />Shipman has written about evolutionary subjects before, most notably _Taking Wing_, an excellent book about the evolution of bird flight.  She has had access to Dubois's personal archives which no one previously had examined.  She has produced a remarkably interesting volume about an extraordinary individual with huge flaws and huge capabilities.  He was, after all, the father of paleoanthropology.  The story of Dubois's boldly making good on a boyhood promise to himself to find the missing link is inspiring, and if he continues to be an underestimated figure in evolutionary histories, it will be despite this dramatic biography.at forehead, and a leg made for upright walking.

Such opposition seems like a recent phenomenon, but according to _The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic_ (Beacon Press) by Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, there has been protest against capitalism ever since capitalism began.  Their book is a valuable history to show that the ideas of property and land use that we take for granted were not inevitable.<br />The book's title comes from the legend of Hercules attempting to slay the hydra; whenever he cut one of the heads off the fearsome beast, two would grow in its place.  The use of the story from the seventeenth century on was not just a boast of knowledge of the classics or a mere rhetorical ornament.  The hydra, over and over again, stood for the mob, dispossessed commoners, religious radicals, pirates, sailors, slaves and more.  Essentially, in religious and political harangues, the many heads of the hydra stood for all the unseemly factions that were standing in the way of those with possessions to get more possessions.  As the book shows, mentioning decapitation of the hydra was in many cases not a figure of speech, but was a call to actual capital punishment, or simple murder.  The main subjects of the book (and the authors write many of them up as heroes) are the often obscure sailors, slaves, and women who were caught up in the eighteenth century's enthusiasm for revolution and liberty.  There were several engines that drove the protest.  The claiming of the common land as personal property of those with wealth meant that (as was written in 1655) \\"the wealthy men would devour the poorer sort of people... and rich men, to make room for themselves, would jostle the poor people out of their commons.\\"  The indentures of workers sent to the colonies were often little better than slavery.  Sailors were impressed into the Navy against their wills.  By these means the elite strove to maintain political and economic power, and they were horrified whenever the hydra showed any protest.<br />The authors are professors of history who have both written about the eighteenth century, and here they have dug into books, diaries, and pamphlets of the period to look at the view of ordinary people.  It is a dense book, a serious study lightened by biographical sketches and moving portrayals of men and women persecuted for damning tyranny and advocating liberty.  There are accounts of rebellions large and small, of slave uprisings all over the New World, of sailors who mutinied against oppressive captains, and of pirates who, surprisingly, ran humane and democratic ships in opposition to the elite.  What if all the dispossessed had won and something more egalitarian than capitalism as we know it had become the main operating system for the world?  I suppose we would still have dispossessed of other categories, and we'd always have the poor around us.  But the book shows that history as it happened was not what had to happen, and the global economy of centuries ago casts light on the troublesome global economy of our own time.e poor people out of their commons.\\"  The indentures of workers sent to the colonies were often little better than slavery.

2113383:US	50895620	RJAK6P0FC6HDG	0195135830	853496261	The Engines of Our Ingenuity: An Engineer Looks at Technology and Culture	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Homo Technologicus	When we use the word &quot;technology,&quot; we are likely to think of airplanes, computers, and factories.  That isn't wrong, of course, but the truth is that unless you are naked and sitting in a pristine landscape, technology is all around you, and even if you are naked and sitting in a pristine landscape, as a citizen of the twenty-first century, you will not be able to abandon thinking patterns based on the technology you know.  Pencils, books, and Post-it notes are all indelible parts of our lives.  The broader outlook upon technology is what John Lienhard has dwelled upon during his years of making his Public Radio program which has now been turned into a wide-ranging and stimulating book of the same name, _The Engines of our Ingenuity_ (Oxford University Press).  Lienhard's background is that he spent a childhood building model airplanes and models of all the other gadgets of the twentieth century.  Then he worked for a half a century as an engineer, and he studied a lot of historical technology.  His admiration for our technological expertise (even though he is not blind to its darker side) is almost unbounded, and it is infectious.  He contends that what differentiates us and makes us human is our ability to think about tools and put them to use.<br />Lienhard never lectures and is never dull.  His sweep of knowledge is confined to seventeen chapters, which he admits is looking at technology like the blind men looked at the elephant.  It is as an assortment of disparate facts that this book is most appealing.  Lienhard tells of geometry, which had been central to the ivory towers of medieval scholasticism as an exercise in logic, not in practical design.  Masons had been able to fashion arches and ribbed vaults, but had done so without mathematical foundation.  When geometry and masonry married, a baroque architecture based on exact mathematics emerged.  Galileo is supposed to have done experiments (maybe from the Leaning Tower of Pisa) to show that heavy balls and light ones fell at the same rate, but he noted something peculiar.

Anyone who regards scientific progress over the centuries, and especially in the past century, will find that such expectations are generally met.  And yet scientists are human, with all the weaknesses humans are prone to.  _The Undergrowth of Science: Delusion, Self-Deception, and Human Frailty_ (Oxford University Press) by Walter Gratzer demonstrates instances where scientists can be susceptible to wishful thinking, patriotic coercion, and self deception.  Interestingly, the book does not dwell on cases of fraud; the scientists in the episodes described generally aren't trying to fool anyone, but manage to do so only after fooling themselves.<br />The guiding spirit of this book is Irving Langmuir, a scientist who won a Nobel for his work on surfaces, but who brashly (and offensively to some) pushed his way into the research areas of other scientists.  When he wasn't in the lab, he liked to pursue what he called \\"pathological science.\\"  He never wrote about this hobby, and only a transcript of a lecture he gave in 1953 remains, but Langmuir's Rules for spotting pathological science show up all over this book.  The rules specify, among other things, that in pathological science, experimental results are very close to the limit of detectability (hardly noticeable, or noticeable at a very low statistical significance); there are claims of great accuracy; explanations are fantastic and contrary to experience; and any criticism of the \\"science\\" is met with excuses thought up on the spur of the moment.<br />What has happened to these scientists?  Gratzer explains: \\"The germ of a pathological episode is usually an innocent mistake or an experimental mirage; the perpetrator is persuaded that he has made a great discovery, which will bring him fame and advancement in his profession.  Once committed it is difficult to go back and to allow the principles of caution and skepticism that training and experience normally inculcate to overcome the excitement and euphoria of a brilliant success.\\"  Among the stories Gratzer covers are N-Rays, polywater, Lysenkoism, the foolish Nazi science of superstition, cold fusion, and more.  These stories have all been told before, but it is useful to have them collected here.  Gratzer writes for _Nature_ and has a clear style even when the physics gets a little intimidating.  The lessons from the collected events should increase our admiration for how well science usually works, but should also remind us that there will always be fringe scientists.  It is impossible to tell when the next cold fusion embarrassment will occur, but I hope we will be able to count on mainstream science to counter claims that HIV does not cause AIDS, that the world is less than 10,000 years old, or that people are being regularly abducted by aliens.to go back and to allow the principles of caution and skepticism that training and experience normally inculcate to overcome the excitement and euphoria of a brilliant success.\\"  Among the stories Gratzer covers are N-Rays, polywater, Lysenkoism, the foolish Nazi science of superstition, cold fusion, and more.

He has friends there, so he goes to South Africa for his vacations.  _Madumo: A Man Bewitched_ (University of Chicago Press) tells the story of one such friend, and the extraordinary lengths toward which friendship goes.  It is a warm, generally happy book blending memoir, reportage, and sociology.  It is steeped in witchcraft.  Madumo, a friend from Ashforth's first stay in Soweto, has been thrown out of his house because a prophet of the Zion Christian Church told Madumo's younger brother that Madumo had used witchcraft to murder their mother, and Madumo had been thrown out of the family home.<br />  Much of the book has to do with the counter-witchcraft Ashforth helps Madumo hire, through a medicine man named Mr. Zondi.  Madumo has to be washed with herbs and earth from Madumo's mother's grave.  There is a ritual cutting of Madumo's hands and legs, with mercury rubbed into the cuts.  A white hen is slaughtered in a pre-feast to assure the ancestors of goodwill and more to come.  Other herbs induce vomiting, the sort of purgative that has been favored in folk medicine for centuries, but which makes Madumo seriously ill.  Ashforth tells a surgeon friend about what Madumo is going through, and the surgeon explains the danger.  The vomiting can cause dehydration, kidney failure, and bleeding from the esophagus.  Ashforth seriously worries if he had been too simple-minded in endorsing the Zondi cure.<br />The treatments bring improvement for Madumo.  The improvement can't promise him a new place in his family, or within the South African economy, however; the strange daily life and business ways of the Sowetan community are a constant theme in this unique memoir.  The main theme is, of course, the pervasive belief in witchcraft, and Ashforth explains how as a form of belief in the supernatural it takes its place with other religious ideas as a way of trying to make sense of the world.  Ashforth is often asked if he believes in witchcraft, and he resoundingly doesn't.  But he also knows that there are no arguments persuasive enough to make believers think that Madumo's treatment is placebo any more than those who pray can be convinced that prayer is not a real interaction with the divine.  Trying to argue Madumo out of his beliefs would have availed Ashforth nothing, while paying for the treatment did give his friend a new life.  Thus the materialist harnessed counter-witchcraft to help a bewitched friend, and brought results.t, and Ashforth explains how as a form of belief in the supernatural it takes its place with other religious ideas as a way of trying to make sense of the world.

However, in a surprising book _Birth Chairs, Midwives, and Medicine_ (University Press of Mississippi) by Amanda Carson Banks, we get quite a lesson in history and medical sociology.  Some of the lessons don't reflect well on medical practitioners or on societal choice at all.<br />This well-illustrated book shows birth chairs and stools from many cultures and times.  They were low, about ten or thirteen inches, and they had a more or less straight back.  They had the simple job of supporting the woman in a squat, a position that allowed her to brace her feet against the ground and that allowed gravity to help.  They had a very narrow seat, or a seat that had a horseshoe-shaped cut out, to allow the midwife access to the birth canal and delivery.  They came in many styles, because they were generally made or ordered by the midwives that owned them.<br />Because of the rise of the profession of medicine, and because obstetrics was a source of professional endeavor and income, chairs changed.  The seats became higher, allowing the doctor an easier view and more room for manipulation.  The attitude seemed to be that midwives could put up with back strain, but doctors wouldn't; it didn't matter that the position of squatting was eliminated, so that the woman could do less to brace herself during contractions.  The chairs also became more gadget-ridden, with adjustable backs, seats, arms, and stirrups.  The doctor would probably adjust these to his convenience.  The innovations of gadgets on what were formerly simple stools started to include chair backs that could descend to the horizontal, making the lithotomy position an option.  Increasingly, birth chairs became more like operating tables, and the role of the woman centrally involved became less important than the duties of those conducting the delivery.  Birth chairs came into fashion again with the rise of the women's rights movement, but doctors only grudgingly accepted them.<br />This is a lot of medical history for the lowly birth chair to bear, but Banks has written a thought-provoking summary of just how societies have regarded birth chairs and midwives, and how we got to the current era of continued medical intervention in labor and delivery.  To her credit, she has written a history rather than a polemic, but the history cannot help but question whether abandoning birth chairs has been good for mothers or their babies.ng the delivery.

Scott Turner gives plenty of surprising examples to show that animals indeed use the environment outside in ways that would qualify the outside as part of their physiology.  He intends us to take a broader view that organisms are not just tangible things wrapped up in skin or chitin or scales.  An organism is, instead, an ephemeral collection of organized matter and energy.  An organism is busy all its life influencing the flow of matter and energy through itself, but also through the environment.  He argues that the reductionism of molecular and evolutionary biology may give way to a more holistic view, and winds up with the controversial idea of Gaia, the hypothesis that earth can be viewed as a single living organism.  He says he doesn't want to air the arguments pro and con of this idea, but if organisms modify their environments into becoming part of their physiology, then it is not much of a step to saying that the Earth has a physiology of its own.<br />Perhaps.  Turner's book is well argued and full of good ideas, and it may presage a neo-holism.  Whether it accomplishes that, though, is less important than what it does manage to do.  Turner is astonishingly encyclopedic in his explanations of his many surprising examples of out-of-body physiology.  He draws upon thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, chemistry, electrical circuits, fractals, acoustics, and much more to put his audacious ideas onto a sound scientific foundation.  This does not make for easy reading, but he is a genial guide and he tries his best to explain complicated ideas simply; the book is not for those, however, who can't stand equations mixed with the text.  The best parts of the book are the examples of animals that have as good as made their surroundings part of their innards.  There are lots of examples.  In addition to the beetles that grab a bubble of air to use as scuba gear, there are beetles that not only do that, but if there is a current moving over them, their hydrodynamic form causes a suction, so that if they face into the current (which they of course habitually do), a bubble forms, pulled out of the water itself.  They make this their gills, and they never have to go to the surface.  Spittlebugs make a frothy white spittle attached to plants.  The spittle isn't spittle, of course, but a froth of sap from the plant, processed by the digestive tract, excreted, and inflated with bubbles.  Turner makes the case that since the bugs have a diet of protein-rich sap, they have a lot of ammonia as a waste product, and they cannot detoxify it as other animals do.  The spittle enables the ammonia to be carried away; in other words, it functions as an exterior kidney.  Earthworms, Turner shows, are fundamentally aquatic animals that only manage to get around when the water content of soils is perfectly balanced for them.  (Turner reminds us that Darwin got enormous satisfaction for his last great work concerning earthworms and what they do to soils; before Darwin, earthworms were regarded as pests which ate plant roots.)  The burrowing activities of the earthworm actually make the soil itself more favorable to the narrow needs of their own survival, and they use the soil as an organ to maintain a proper salt and water balance inside them.<br />There are many examples even before Turner gets to bees and to termites, which are his own particular enthusiasm and which use their homes to regulate temperature, oxygen content, and more.  It is inarguable that these creatures really do shape their environment, and in ways that are not obvious.  With clarity, humor, and a broad scientific understanding, Turner has done much to advance an argument to his holistic view.etles that not only do that, but if there is a current moving over them, their hydrodynamic form causes a suction, so that if they face into the current (which they of course habitually do), a bubble forms, pulled out of the water itself.

This is a fine book about viewing dogs in a scientific light, but as such, it will offend those who love dogs because they think that dogs provide unconditional love or because they view dogs as people or because they are convinced that dogs understand the thoughts of humans and can equally with humans experience such things as guilt and affection.  Dogs, Budiansky says, do what dogs do because they are their own species, not because they are \\"almost human.\\"  Dogs get along with us because dogs are parasites.<br />Now, Budiansky says he keeps dogs, and it is obvious he loves and appreciates them and that his dogs have a perceptive and caring owner.  But he points out that as dogs, dogs are wonderful, but if they were humans, they would be jerks: they compete for our food and other resources, they spread disease, they bite and cause injuries, they relieve themselves where we do not want them to, they chew up valuable items, and they behave in countless other ways that would turn humans who so behaved into enemies very quickly.  Dogs exploit the \\"Awww Effect\\" and we can't help but look at them as something like human.  Dogs have our number.  Dogs are on our side just as tapeworms are.<br />That's a bit too strong, of course, since we do get something back from dogs.  I think we get more than the cool scientific appreciation of a living, breathing bundle of conditioned reflexes which Budiansky encourages, but even if it is only that, dogs and we have more of a symbiotic rather than parasitical relationship.  Seen this way, his book cannot make us appreciate them any less.  He describes very well their evolutionary history, their peculiar ways of looking at the world and how they got them, their uncanny ability to respond to stimuli that will please us, the peculiar deviancies of aggressive or hypochondriacal dogs (and how we encourage such behaviors), and the dangers and cures of inbreeding.  There is much to learn in this amusing and well informed book, and this is a scientific view that admirably encourages delight: \\"[Dogs'] enrichment to us is visceral and cerebral - the joy of touching and feeling the mind of another so different, the awe, even, of contemplating the sublime forces of evolution that have fashioned such a wondrous array of life on Earth.  Dogs are a constant reminder that we are just one species among many, and that our automatic and daily assumptions about the set nature of society and the rules of the world are the height of parochialism for all that evolution cares about it.\\"uncanny ability to respond to stimuli that will please us, the peculiar deviancies of aggressive or hypochondriacal dogs (and how we encourage such behaviors), and the dangers and cures of inbreeding.

What makes volcanoes run is forever hidden beneath the earth, every volcano is different, and intense work on understanding and predicting them has only occurred in the last two decades.  People tend to think, \\"It's only a mountain, for goodness sakes,\\" and aren't eager to abandon their real estate, even if they don't take time to consider how new and vague a science volcanology has been.  So the volcanologists don't have the best of reputations.<br />That is changing.  In _Volcano Cowboys: The Rocky Evolution of a Dangerous Science_ (Thomas Dunne Books) by Dick Thompson, the ways of this relatively new science are explained, along with a good deal of social science and the histories of two of the best studied eruptions recently, Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The book is a remarkable picture of how science is done under pressure.  We get to meet a lot of the cowboys in this book, and they are, well, individuals; perhaps those who are fascinated by this dangerous science have to be a little off kilter.  There are lots of anecdotes.  For instance, at Pinatubo, some of the volcanologists were unexpectedly trapped in a building at Clark Air Force Base, and had no idea if the upcoming volcanic flow would take out the building as the minutes ticked by.  But there were bags of popcorn, and one of the researchers tore into one and started eating.  \\"How can you eat popcorn at a time like this?\\" exclaimed an incredulous geologist who was also trapped.  \\"I always eat popcorn at this part of the movie,\\" came the reply.<br />Along with the anecdotes, there is a good deal of description about how this serious and dangerous work gets done.  There is much about how scientists compete, and how the competition is worsened under public scrutiny and pressure.  There are scary descriptions of how hard it was to get the public to listen and to leave endangered areas.  The volcanologists are easily better at useful predictions than they were twenty years ago, but there is still too much unknown, and there is always going to be at least as much uncertainty as with the weather.  This is a fine introduction into the dangerous and often unappreciated work of an unusual bunch of professionals.t there is still too much unknown, and there is always going to be at least as much uncertainty as with the weather.

The story of that lock of hair is the backbone of a riveting slice of history in _Beethoven's Hair: An Extraordinary Historical Odyssey and a Scientific Mystery Solved_ (Broadway Books) by Russell Martin.  Martin has told three stories in his book, intercalating them in chapters that come to a pleasing whole.  The first story is a fine capsule biography of Beethoven himself.  Within the biography, Martin tells us much about the composer's medical problems, increasing our wonder of how such an afflicted man could have produced works of such profound concentration and joy.  The second story within the book is about the fate of the wandering lock of hair as it passed to the heirs of the young musician who clipped it, and how it formed part of the story of the Holocaust, turning up in Denmark in 1943.  Eventually it was sold at Sothebys in 1994, to a couple of non-musician fans of Beethoven, one of whom donated his share to the university Beethoven center he had started, and one who made his strands available for medical testing.  The hair snipped by Beethoven's young friend was able to tell its story a hundred and seventy years later, giving a probable explanation for Beethoven's ailments.<br />What a story for a lock of hair, how full of amazing personalities and significant historical events.  And how well told; Martin has used Beethoven's life, the travels of his lock of hair, and the scientific investigations to jostle and play off each other, putting the different parts of the story in relief.  It makes for a richly satisfying musical, historical, and scientific encounter.	2001-01-13

You won't find remarks on the authenticity of the recent movie _Gladiator_, but you can learn plenty about _Ben Hur_.  The book shows in profuse illustrations the different categories of gladiator, the weapons each was assigned, and the role they played in the games.  It goes into the fates of those who were sentenced to the amphitheater; those sentenced to be torn by wild beasts had no chance, but there were others who were sentenced to gladiatorial school and could possibly gain freedom, money, and celebrity.  Of course, they had to survive plenty of mortal combat to do so.  The book tells repeatedly about how different Caesars used the games to defuse public anger about governmental conditions.  The scholars are complimentary about _Ben Hur_: \\"Although there are a number of inaccuracies, the film as a whole thrillingly conveys the character and atmosphere, one might even say the quintessence, of such a sporting event, in a way that scholarly attention to detail could never have done on its own.\\"<br />A handsome, profusely illustrated, big (though paperbound) book, _Gladiators and Caesars_ has thorough detail about a facet of sports history which we can be glad is now past, but which was important in consolidating power in an empire whose history still affects us.  Those who enjoy sports will especially find the analogies to modern competition, hero-worship, and media superstardom amusing and enlightening.  Those who have no interest in sports will perhaps remember the brutality of gladiatorial combat, and confronted with endless bowl games or professional wrestling while scanning for something good on TV, will be thankful things aren't worse.	2001-01-11

It is an exceedingly pure tone, electronically generated, which has been used in various ways since the instrument was invented.  It was used with distinction in the Hitchcock psychoanalysis thriller _Spellbound_ and in Billy Wilder's _Lost Weekend_, but it is best known for being used for an eerie, futuristic sound in science fiction movies like _The Day the Earth Stood Still_.  It was in the background of _The Ten Commandments_ and also was that warbling tone in the Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations.\\"<br />The theremin was not invented in Hollywood, however; it was invented in Russia in 1920, and had its real heyday in the succeeding decade.  The inventor, Leon Theremin, had a life that was too bizarre for a novelist to make up, and finally in _Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage_ (University of Illinois Press) by Albert Glinsky, Theremin has a big, comprehensive biography that does him justice.  And he deserves it, for Leon Theremin was the father of electronic music.  The book describes his cozy life in tsarist Russia, his introduction of electronic music to Lenin himself, his being sent out on propaganda tours with his instrument, his decade of performing and inventing in the US, his return to Russia not to acclaim but to imprisonment and disappearance in the Gulag, his gadgetry for Soviet espionage, and his return to acclaim as the grand old man of electronic music.  Readable and full of color, _Theremin_ not only brings into focus the astonishing events in the life of its subject, presenting him as an inventive genius, persecuted innovator, and citizen of the world.  Its fascinating story is a capsule history of a complicated century.	2001-01-10

Provine.  It's not merely that Provine is covering a serious subject.  He is as good as his word: his book is a scientific investigation, and he is neuroscientist by profession who has done original research on laughter published in such non-newsstand rags as _Ethology_ and _Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society_.  And it's not that Provine is an unentertaining, dour writer; he has a light touch, and good explicative skills, he is happy to share a joke, and his stories about some of the ways he has done experiments are funny.  For instance, we can share his bemusement over his initial explorations of why people laugh; he got a group into a clinic and played them funny tapes.  He failed to get anything but a few chuckles.  It was his first demonstration that laughter was a social behavior, not a laboratory one.  He went on to study people in social situations.<br />Similarly, the reason you can't expect to laugh much from reading Provine's book is found in the book itself.  Laughter is not something you can most reliably expect to do alone reading a book; it is something we do as a social behavior.  Its \\"sociality,\\" the ratio of social to solitary performance of the act, is very high.  Provine had his undergraduate students keep logs of their behavior, including laughing, and found that we are thirty times more likely to laugh when with someone else.  Another study showed that eye contact between two companions increases the likelihood of laughter.  Laughter has a nonlinguistic role of holding people together.<br />Provine writes about many other curious studies, about the illnesses that can impair or propagate laughter, about the neurological explorations of the under-researched universal behavior of tickling, about the physiology of laughter and speech, about laugh epidemics that can paralyze schools, and about the Pentecostals that get \\"drunk in the Spirit\\" with laugh sessions.  Wide-ranging and entertaining, _Laughter_ provides us with interesting studies on something we take for granted, and gives insight on just how hard doing such studies can be because of the commonness of the phenomenon involved.  Provine wisely does not concentrate on wit, humor, or the meaning of things that influence us to laugh.

Tirzah Miller was born in 1843, and her unique memoir, published as _Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller's Intimate Memoir_, edited by Robert S. Fogarty (Indiana University Press), gives us a view of how some very strange sexual principles were practiced under Biblical inspiration.  Miller's memoir was part of the Oneida archives, which were opened in 1993, and are fully printed here for the first time.  There is useful editorial introduction and notes to prepare a reader for much of Miller's descriptions.  Miller was the most important figure among the younger generation at Oneida, which had been founded by her uncle John N. Noyes, a prophet of \\"Perfectionism\\" which, among other things, entailed shared sexual relations in order to make jealousy impossible, and even planned breeding of humans to bring out the best traits in the young.<br />Tirzah Miller was involved in this sort of breeding, and writes about her participation.  Her memoir tells about her doubts about Noyes, doubts which were always soothed by prayer so that she continued within the community.  She was Noyes's favorite sexual partner, but had longings for others, and acted on them.  Among the difficulties this caused was that there must not be any sort of \\"special love\\" analogous to marriage.  Miller writes quite a bit about how she has to avoid this, and about her quarrels with Noyes, and about her liaisons with other community members.<br />Miller's memoir breaks off during the tumultuous end of the community.  There had been raids on Oneida by ministers from the outside, shocked at its peculiar principles, but also Oneida was racked with internal dissention as members strove for more independence.  Noyes declared that traditional Pauline marriage was now to be advised, and before the community broke up, Miller was able to abandon her worry that her love for the father of her third child was \\"too special;\\" she married him exclusively, and lived thereafter in apparent happiness.  Her memoir is good reading to reveal a lively, thoughtful, and reverent woman, and throws welcome light on the innermost workings of a famous, failed social experiment.at her love for the father of her third child was \\"too special;\\" she married him exclusively, and lived thereafter in apparent happiness.

He is a professor of English literature, specializing in Shakespeare, and so you can bet he reads a lot.  But sometimes he reads not to understand the text, but specifically to detect the writer of the text.  In fact, if he reads it in such a fashion, he might not understand the text at all.  \\"When reading a text of unknown or disputed authorship, I have developed an odd way of reading, by which my brain records ideas and words and punctuation form the printed page while the story goes zipping right past me, unattended.\\"<br />Foster's fascinating _Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous_ (Henry Holt and Company) lets us in on some of his other secrets of being the world's foremost literary sleuth.  Foster came to fame in showing that _A Funerall Elegye_ by W.S., printed in 1612 was by William Shakespeare himself.  His fame got him the assignment of tracking down who wrote the political novel _Primary Colors_, and his stories of how he managed the attribution, and the media tempest that occurred to the professor afterwards, are witty and fun.  He goes on to tell in detail about his work on Ted Kaczynski's writing as the Unabomber, the \\"talking points\\" paper attributed to Monica Lewinsky, and letters attributed to Thomas Pynchon.  He is a good storyteller, even in cases that didn't get national attention.<br />His funniest stories are left for last in his search for the real author of the poem we know as \\"The Night Before Christmas,\\" which Foster convinces us was not the product of Clement Moore.  Hilariously, Foster presents real work of Moore, whose poems were moralistic, forgettable verses that curmudgeonly carped about scolding wives, frivolous maids, lewd coquettes, and (over and over) loud children, who obviously needed the birchen rod.  Even Moore's juvenilia is crabby.  The real author, Foster resoundingly demonstrates, was not the choleric Moore but the cheerful Henry Livingston, a jolly Dutch landowner whose bouncy verses were full of fun.<br />This is an eye-opening book that shows just what can happen when someone reads carefully.  Foster does not get bogged down in details of how he does his work, but he gives us enough to explain it well, and his clear, humorous stories are a pleasure to read.es were full of fun.  <br />This is an eye-opening book that shows just what can happen when someone reads carefully.

Have you ever heard of the Aitken brothers?  Probably not, but their innovations in the motion picture business before talkies helped make Hollywood what it is today.  They are often left out of the movie history books, so that even silent film fans may not know who they are.  This need no longer be the case.  _A Silent Siren Song: The Aitken Brothers' Hollywood Odyssey, 1905 -1926_ (Cooper Square Press), by Al P. Nelson and Mel R. Jones, provides a biography of the brothers, who produced more than 2,500 films, including some legendary ones.<br />These were, amazingly, Wisconsin farm boys.  They knew they wanted to do something more lucrative and exciting than milk cows, and in 1905 when Roy went to a nickelodeon in Chicago to see _The Great Train Robbery_, he sent for Harry to come see it, too.  They saw that movies were a business with a future, and set up their own nickelodeon.  _A Silent Siren Song_ wonderfully traces the arc of the brothers' career, buying nickelodeons, then running a film exchange to rent films to other peoples' nickelodeons, then distributing films to Europe, then producing films themselves.  They helped the careers of Fatty Arbuckle, Charlie Chaplain, the Gish sisters, and many more famous stars, but they knew to promote their directors as well.  Their most famous director was D. W. Griffith, and he made for them the first superpicture, _Birth of a Nation_ in 1915.  A smash success, it was followed by _Intolerance_, a critical success, and an expensive commercial flop.  The Aitkens, for many reasons detailed in this careful book, could not survive as outsiders in Hollywood, and returned to Wisconsin.<br />Harry and Roy were happy when they were on top and unembittered when they had to head back home.  This book shows just how innovative they were.  Besides making the first superpicture, they established worldwide branches for film distribution; they were the first to use public relations and full-page ads for films; they engaged the finances of Wall Street to make movies.  An engaging, revealing work, _A Silent Siren Song_ gives us back some film history we lost in letting us meet the Aitkens.

That just shows our chauvinism and inability to see the larger picture.  The planet ought to be called Water.  As Philip Ball points out in _Life's Matrix: A Biography of Water_ (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), water covers two thirds of the globe, and seen from space, water in its three different states is what determines what Earth looks like.  It also determines that every other heavenly body we have been able to see looks to us like a lifeless orb.  It is water that defines life for us, and when we go poking our noses into other planets, one of the first things we try to find is water.  So no wonder that Ball has called this a biography.<br />And like a good biography, the book covers all the aspects of his subject.  He goes into the origins of water back to the big bang.  He shows how we found it on the moon and Mars, and of all places, our Sun.  Since he is a doctor of physics, it is not really surprising that he looks at the chemistry and physics of his subject, detailing why ice expands, and why you can ski on solid water but not on asphalt.  He tells how its currents run the oceans, and how we don't completely understand the molecular happenings in water flow, or in the formation of snowflakes.  He tells us about the dire problems we could have if we don't start handling this most precious and most taken-for-granted resource with more wisdom.  He reports at length on the foolishness of cold fusion of heavy water, or of polywater.<br />In short, this book wonderfully covers every aspect of water you could think of.  Ball writes with humor and excellent analogies, and even when the science gets complicated, he is an excellent guide.	2000-12-28

This is one of the most fascinating parts of that magnificent book.  As mystical and symbolic as the parts and the whole may be, they are all firmly grounded in fact, in the world of nineteenth century whaling as it was.  Facts crowd into the chapters, even the most novelistic ones.  Tim Severin has made a career of replicating historic vessels, using them to trace the supposed routes of their historic sailors, and then writing about the results.  In _In Search of Moby Dick: The Quest for the White Whale_ (Basic Books), he does not plunder Melville's great work, but actually expands it.  Using _Moby Dick_ and other Melville texts, he has gone on an adventure to find the white sperm whale, and although he never brings home the fabulous creature, he does indeed find it in ways that demonstrate that even a century and a half after the white whale entered literature, he still exists as fact as well as fable.<br />Severin's curious quest takes him first to the island Melville described in his bestseller _Typee_, and then to islands where Melville never visited, but where there are still whalemen who still harpoon whales.  The descriptions of the dangers of the hunts on which Severin accompanied the islanders are vivid and memorable.  He finds, intriguingly, that the island legends of the white whale are in many ways the same as those of Melville's whalemen.  He conveys vividly the excitement of the hunt, both of physical prey by contemporary whalemen and his own search for Moby Dick.  The islanders know there is a white whale out there.  Ahab was not able to destroy him, and the islanders revere and respect him.  Severin's vibrant book shows that the whale hunters will surely pass away before Moby Dick, secure in legend and literature, is ever finally caught, or finally known.	2000-12-28

She insisted that he repeat it, and he did so unwisely, for it was a risqu&eacute; story, and it produced her unforgettable reprimand.<br />But one of the lessons of _Queen Victoria: A Personal History_ (Basic Books) by Christopher Hibbert is that the Queen did have a sense of humor, even during her long widowhood.  One of his chapters, indeed, is mostly devoted to the things that made her laugh.  Letters of a maid-of-honor say, \\"the queen laughed very much,\\" or \\"she was immensely amused and roared with laughter, her whole face changing and lighting up in a wonderful way,\\" or \\"she was very funny at the evening concert... in excellent spirits and full of jokes.\\"  The comedian J. L. Toole was renowned for his imitation of the Queen, and was horrified after dinner when she insisted on seeing it.  After the performance, she sat \\"for a while silent and serious, but then began to laugh, gently at first, and then more and more heartily.\\"  It is hard to believe that this risible monarch could have been doing anything but continuing the joke when she thereupon told him, \\"Mr Toole that was very clever, and very, very funny, and you must promise me you will never, never do it again.\\"<br />The compartmentalization into chapters is one of the attractive parts of this new biography.  Hibbert himself lists \\"several excellent biographies\\" of the Queen, and it is clear that her larger-than-life persona will never exhaust the biographer's art.  This book is of fair size (500 pages) but it is divided into 66 chapters, each one sticking, more or less, to its point.  The chronology of the Queen's life sometimes suffers thereby, but each chapter has its light to give.<br />Hibbert has had access to some letters and other papers not previously used in biographies, but there is not a great deal new to learn about this extraordinary woman.  However, the organization of the book makes its episodes memorable and compelling.  There are anecdotes on almost every page that bring the Queen into focus; especially good are descriptions of her traveling habits, her relations with her Prime Ministers, the dullness of her court life, and the difficulties with her children.  She was a woman of many talents and weaknesses, and put herself forward in an amazingly intricate court and political system.  This is a readable, full, and insightful biography.traordinary woman.

This is bound to sound peculiar to those in the twentieth century raised on Freud, or more recently those who have followed the follies of John and Lorena Bobbitt, but before Freud, castration always  meant removal of the testicles, never removal of the penis.  It was reproduction that was important then, and the \\"stones\\" were what mattered.  Now that we have reproduced entirely enough, the \\"scepter\\" is more important.  Sex for pleasure is now more vital than sex for reproduction.<br />Eunuchs, just like oxen, were useful.  They guarded the harems, for one job, but power in the bedchamber within some societies became legal or military power.  A eunuch had no testicles, but had enough genitalia left to play games in the harem.  Jesus spoke highly of eunuchs, and Taylor makes the case that he was speaking literally.  Augustine, however, insisted that Jesus's words were an allegory to promote priestly celibacy.<br />Taylor is a Shakespearean  scholar (the editor of the Oxford Shakespeare), and in a show of scholarly breadth cites plenty of the Bard, but cites also other Elizabethan playwrights as well as Tori Amos and Christina Aguilera.  Funny, provocative, scholarly, and decidedly offbeat, _Castration_ is a witty tour-de-force.	2000-12-25

He was the last of the famous Hollywood Ten, those who were jailed by the House Un-American Activities Committee for being Communists.  He also landed on the blacklist, unable to get the studio work he had previously and lucratively enjoyed with Twentieth Century Fox.  He was a hero to many, but his humorous, delightfully self-effacing memoir shows he didn't think he fit that role.  He writes, \\"I try to suggest that we weren't as heroic as people make us out to be.  It would be more analytically precise, it seems to me, to say that we did the only thing we could do under the circumstances.\\"<br />Lardner's time in our nation's history, his membership in the Communist Party, and his work in the movies make this a unique memoir.  Those who read his touching recollections will learn about screenwriting in a type of studio system that no longer exists, and about a type of Americanism (and American Communism) that also no longer exists.  He writes with grace and amusement about his own mistakes and those of others.  The wit that won him Oscars for _Woman of the Year_ in 1942 and _M*A*S*H_ in 1970 is clearly on display, as is a lack of rancor for how his nation and his fellow movie makers treated him.  This book is a warm farewell.	2000-12-19

If you want to read a lurid potboiler containing mischief that would make J. R. Ewing blush, but is all true, this is your book.  It contains reports of seductions, incest, child murder, family infighting, the decay of a prominent aristocratic family, drug addiction, and general scoundrelism.  All true, and all occurring in the public eye, and among supporters and family members of Thomas Jefferson.  It is a historical feast of scandal.<br />  The main character, Nancy Randolph, was accused at various times by rumor, and by her family, of seducing her cousin Richard Randolph, helping Richard murder the infant, and then murdering Richard himself.  Many of the charges came from Richard's brother Jack, a fiery orator and congressman who grew increasingly unstable in matters concerning Nancy, perhaps because she had herself spurned him.<br />Nancy was therefore unmarriageable, but that didn't bother the fun-loving, cheerful patriot Gouverneur Morris, who took her on as housekeeper, and then married her, giving her two decades of true happiness.  Nancy was a resourceful woman and this amazing chronicle of scandal brings her out of oblivion into our own times, times that are no better or worse than her own.	2000-12-17

The best book I have read celebrating a particular cat is _The Cat Who Covered the World: The Adventures of Henrietta and Her Foreign Correspondent_ (Simon &amp; Schuster) by Christopher S. Wren.  Wren was a foreign correspondent for _The New York Times_, but when he wrote his first article about traveling the world with the family cat, he got more response than he did for any news articles.  He acquired Henrietta as a gray ball of fluff because the person giving kittens away was giving a bottle of Scotch away with each one.  Henrietta went with the Wren family to Egypt, China, Moscow, Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere.  The book tells of the difficulties of finding her the right food, or kitty litter, or of getting her through customs; but it also shows how in a family which traveled everywhere together, Henrietta became a movable symbol of hearth and home.<br />A fine book for anyone who likes cats, _The Cat Who Covered the World_ is also a memorable portrait of a loving family in unusual environments, and of amusing and frustrating clashes of culture.  Wren is a good story teller, and has a wealth of tales about his cat, whom he obviously loved, and her extraordinary life.  Charming.	2000-12-15

Londoners, however, had to achieve the monumental changes of the middle of the nineteenth century in bits and pieces by cooperation with various authorities rather than an imposition by a dictator.  Certainly, the modernization of London in the mid-nineteenth century produced a city that was greatly different form Paris, according to _Victorian Babylon: People, Streets, and Images in 19th Century London_ (Yale University Press) by Lynda Nead.  Nead is a professor of art history, and her well-illustrated book explains the changes in the city and the society from around 1850 to 1880.  &quot;London's municipal government emerged out of a fog of local hostility and resistance,&quot; Nead writes.<br />Nead details the changes that came to the city because of its huge sewer system, or the installation of gas lighting.  For instance, gas made night shopping and strolling possible, and enabled men and women to dance, drink, and generally be naughty at the Cremorne Pleasure Gardens.  The moralists of the time fought against Cremorne's various licenses, and eventually it went under, but not before inspiring Whistler's famous _Nocturne in Black and Gold_ which led to his lawsuit against Ruskin.  The moralists were in further quandary over Holywell Street, the history of which is the most engaging part of the book.  It was the home of pornographers who put their wares in the windows, hazarding youth and especially (according to the view of the time) women, who loved bright colors.  Holywell was especially cited in debate over the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, and police closed down some of the businesses and seized some of their goods, but it seems that such efforts are never very effective.  The street soldiered on in its popular and sinful way until the very end of Victoria's reign, when it was finally done in by razing to make way for the new Kingsway thoroughfare.  Parliament never did solve the problem of defining what is obscene; those who want to censor the Internet have the same problem today.<br />Nead has written a book about how people affect the city environment and vice versa.

It may be that disrupted symmetries are essential for our very being, and experiments planned for this decade may give us an answer about this.  The world of subatomic particles and basic forces is very weird, and so Close spends much of his book discussing symmetries that are a bit easier to understand.  For instance, human bodies are mostly symmetric on the outside, but there are interesting exceptions to this rule.  Some molecules come in left and right handed forms, and our own molecules are of the left form, as are most biological molecules.  (It makes a difference; the molecule limone comes in right and left forms, too, and we can tell the difference: one smells like lemons and one like oranges.)  Close tells us why mirrors reverse right and left but not up and down (they don't, really) and why bathtubs drain in different directions in different hemispheres (they don't, really).<br />Symmetry can break up for all sorts of reasons.  Billions of years ago in the Big Bang, for instance, there was equal matter and antimatter.  For some reason, as far as we know, matter prevailed.  Why?  Are there packets of antimatter galaxies in the universe that are buffered from us by light years of separation?  How did the asymmetric increase of matter over antimatter come to be?  Why is there more matter, and when it comes down to it, why is there anything?<br />These are questions that the newest generation of particle accelerators will be trying to tackle in the next decade.  Close's book does a good job of examining these confusing issues and trying to make some sort of sense of them for the layman.  He has a gift for the felicitous metaphor, and his writing on strange subjects is clear.	2000-12-12

H. Freeman) by James Deetz and Patricia Scott Deetz, takes the history we would like to believe about the Pilgrims and makes it the history that is history, not wishful thinking.  Prepare to abandon cherished ideas: Pilgrims almost undoubtedly never set that first foot on Plymouth Rock.  Pilgrims dressed in brightly colored clothes.  They didn't live in log cabins.  They didn't eat turkey for Thanksgiving.  They shot guns off to celebrate that first harvest, but no one is on record of thanking anyone for anything on that day.  The most frequent crimes for which they were tried were sexual ones, and premarital sex occurred at a shocking rate.  The mythmakers of the nineteenth century found the supposedly pure Pilgrims more attractive than the rowdy, fortune-seeking crew at Jamestown, even though Jamestown preceded Plymouth.<br />The Times of Their Lives deals with the social history of the colony, but also examines how the historians and archeologists have been able to come to present conclusions, some greatly at odds with Pilgrim image.  The book climaxes with a description of the changes at Plimoth Plantation, the recreation of the colony along the lines of something like Williamsburg.  James Deetz was a director of the museum for eleven years, and took the radical position that visitors should be induced to believe that they had really entered the seventeenth century because nothing would be present that was not there at that time.

But since we aren't really good judges of that (it takes complicated experiments to tell if a drug is effective or not, for instance), all sorts of weird remedies have been tried and have been lucrative for their makers.  These are the rightful prey of Bob McCoy, who a decade or so ago established the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices in Minneapolis.  In _Quack!  Tales of Medical Fraud from the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices_ (Santa Monica Press), McCoy shows some of the contents of his museum, in book form.  It's a treat.<br />All sorts of nostrums and gadgets are described and illustrated here: soaps that wash away weight, breast developers, and various stimulants to the sexual appetite.  These are funny, but also covered is the tragedy of radium and those poisoned by it.  The gadgets are hilarious.  Nose adjusters, height developers, even glasses that would reduce your weight.  The book has abundant quotations from the advertising and pamphlets that came with the quackery, and is profusely illustrated.  Americans spend a hundred million dollars a year on quack pills and gadgets that do nothing and may be harmful.  So _Quack!_ might not just deliver the fun of laughing at human greed and credulity, but it may help the serious education of readers as well.	2000-12-03

It gives capsule biographies of the main artists of the time, and the interrelations between different facets of the arts and the economic and religious trends.  It is unillustrated, but pithy, and as a small book on a huge subject, it is excellent.  Repeatedly, Johnson shows just how the Renaissance artists drew on ancient models.  Roman type was developed by studying the classic engraved letters, artists began to use themes from pagan myths instead of only depicting scenes from the Bible, scholars resumed the task (abandoned throughout the middle ages) of critically examining scriptural texts, and the rules of perspective were rediscovered.<br />Johnson also has insights on particular artistic processes.  For instance, his description of the advantages and disadvantages of tempera use on wet plaster is excellent; the rules of perspective gave enormous freedom to the artists to depict real scenes, but artists were constrained by the fresco technique which demanded that final decisions be made about a large work before any coloring of the plaster was begun, since corrections could only be made by starting all over again.  When painting in oil was introduced, artists could make a living painting not on walls but on canvas.  With canvas came the easel, and artists could not only paint scenes from life, but could work in their studios where models (and clients) were readily accessible.  This involved less church work, ending the religious monopoly on art, and giving another impetus towards humanism.<br />The most important lesson from the Renaissance, however, is not its deposing the centrality of the church.  Those who created the Renaissance masterpieces had drawn from the excellences of the ancients, and having done so, produced works that were equivalent and even surpassing.  Leonardo himself said, \\"He is a wretched pupil who does not surpass his master.\\"  After centuries of stagnation, the Renaissance had instilled its most vivid legacy into western thought, that of progress.tion, the Renaissance had instilled its most vivid legacy into western thought, that of progress.	2000-12-01

They loved liberty, and they loved each other as they worked toward their vision, but like brothers, they didn't always like each other.  In _Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation_ (Alfred A. Knopf), Joseph Ellis takes a look at key episodes of the 1790s, the decade after the Constitution was instituted; for some reason our own time has produced many books to look at this particular decade.  He examines the famous duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, the first great national compromise Jefferson engineered between Madison and Hamilton, the silence of the founders on the issue of slavery, Washington's Farewell Address, and finally, and best, the famous correspondence between Jefferson and Adams.  He eloquently summarizes the half-century relationship between the two giants.  Collaborators and close friends during the Revolution, they had become rivals during the leadership of Washington, and if never exactly enemies, they had maintained an angry epistolary silence for many years before resuming their famous epistolary friendship.  The physician Benjamin Rush cajoled the two to begin a correspondence, and in 1812, Adams made the first move.  He was motivated to challenge the Jefferson version of history, but he explained poignantly, \\"You and I ought not to die before We have explained ourselves to each other.\\"  Explain to each other they did, for 158 letters over the fourteen years until their simultaneous deaths, but they were also explaining to posterity, and they knew it.  They rehashed many battles, but the old problem of how to deal with slavery was barely mentioned; silence ruled in a time that could have allowed action, and silence ruled in reminiscence, too.<br />Ellis, a scholar who has written well-regarded biographies of both Jefferson and Adams, has done a fine job of showing the issues of the time, and the difficulties of steering the newly-launched ship of state, not only a new country, but one founded on principles never before tried.

You don't have to be a racing fan to enjoy this book; it is full of racing, but it is full of history and many Gilded Age politicos and capitalists wander through its pages.  It covers the rise and fall of Sloan, who introduced the way we all have seen jockeys riding their mounts, forward on the saddles, almost hugging their necks.  Before Sloan invented this position, all rode back in the saddle and upright.  Sloan introduced the \\"forward seat,\\" and he won with it, causing a revolution in racing.  Many didn't like the new style, but took to it when it won.  Many didn't like Sloan.  He became a crowd pleaser, and his dandified dress in miniature, his constantly smoking a cigar \\"as big as a policeman's club,\\" his inability to let others take the tab, and his eagerness with women made him a star of the sport.<br />Sloan's success  was not just due to his gimmick.  He was a skilled jockey.  He was known for quick starts and blazing finishes.  His judgement of pace was unequalled.  Horses that had not performed well would succeed under his control.  They knew his voice; a trainer said, \\"When Sloan enters the paddock, horses that he has ridden recognize his voice and turn to look at him.\\"<br />But Sloan made such a spectacle of himself that he was resented by some members of the British racing establishment, even though he had occasionally been tapped by the Prince of Wales to ride royal mounts.  A minor betting incident, not a big deal at the time, led to his being exiled from the sport he had revolutionized.  Sadly, his drinking and gambling ruined his two marriages and any business prospects, and he would up as a ticket taker at a race track in Tijuana.<br />Dizikes's readable book is a beguiling history of racing as it used to be, illuminating a good deal about the history of racing, and the attempts to regulate it, and make it fair.  It also is a little parable about what can happen to revolutionaries.illuminating a good deal about the history of racing, and the attempts to regulate it, and make it fair.

He has written book and theater reviews, and such journals as _The New Yorker_ have published his essays on topics ranging from Jeffrey Dahmer, to his visit to Fallingwater or his reflections on performing his magic routine with Penn.  And with Penn, he has written such funny books as _How to Play with Your Food_.  But until I read _When I'm Dead, All _This_ Will Be Yours_, there was something I didn't know about bad-boy, anti-religious, and iconoclastic Teller.  He visits his parents for a few days every month, and he calls them every evening.  He loves his parents.<br />And, given his parents, he ought to; they seem pretty darned lovable.  Teller's father (\\"Pad\\"), now eighty-seven, is the focus of this book.  The title comes from what he said to Teller when they were excavating in the cellar for a flathead screw to fix the oven, among the collection of ball bearings, matchbooks, and old batteries.  To Teller's surprise, on one visit, his dad asked if he had ever seen his cartoons.  Teller knew his dad drew, painted in oils, and sculpted, but he didn't know his dad had ever drawn cartoons.  They retrieved a bundle of cartoons from the attic, drawn in the pre-Teller days of 1939.  It was Teller's first introduction to how his parents had lived before he had come along, and it sparked reminiscences that turned into the prose of this delightful little book.  The illustrations are Joe Teller's cartoons, often directly related to the stories, and also color reproductions of his paintings.<br />Not only come the cartoons from the attic, but also emerges the Hobo Shoebox, ten pounds of letters and postcards which \\"Sonny\\" had sent his family as he tramped around depression-era America, riding the rails to every one of the forty-eight states.  And the memorabilia from World War Two.  Teller has a lot to learn.<br />Teller's parents met in art school, and painting has been essential to their lives together.  When Teller came along, they bought the row house they still inhabit in Philadelphia, and although Pad had to take a job in commercial art, he always kept an oil painting on the easel.  These days, he and Teller's mom, &quot;Mam,&quot; trot up to the attic studio every day to work on their paintings, Mam at her easel and Pad at his.  They have never tried to sell any, but the paintings reproduced in the book are quite good.  The pair are devoted to painting, and clearly to each other, and just as clearly to their talented son, of whom they are proud.<br />This is a charming book, a loving tribute from a son to his parents, especially his dad.

It is also a fine history of how curiously people have behaved when confronting the supposed supernatural, and how fashions can change our view of history.  Savage shows that black magic was for millennia subject to legal prosecution, but that the medieval church wasn't particularly worried about black magic or the women who supposedly practiced it.  Priests who heard reports from women who said they had flown during the night and taken part in satanic rituals were encouraged to maintain disbelief.  Reasonable men were not to take such things seriously.  One priest of the time wrote of such dreams, \\"Who is imbecile enough to imagine that such things, seen only in the mind, have a bodily reality?\\"  The church itself lapsed in its wise toleration when it opposed a couple of dissident sects in France around 1400.  The sects allowed women to administer baptisms and so on, so in prosecution, the church tortured them until it got confessions of copulating with the devil, riding broomsticks, and eating infants.  Witches were seen everywhere if something bad happened; they sowed disease and discord; they were the Devil in female shapes; they were Public Enemy Number One.<br />Against the wishes of many Bible believers, the image of the witch was changed during the enlightenment from a vicious devil-worshiper to a foolish little old lady.  Still later they became the subjects of children's literature and cautionary lessons about what roles women really should fulfill.  Finally, through the faulty scholarship of one Margaret Murray they were erroneously revealed as priestesses practicing an age-old pagan cult and proudly defying the Christian church.  Scholars agree there was no such organized religion practiced by witches, but of course that doesn't matter.  Savage shows in this profusely illustrated book that whether we need a scapegoat on whom to blame barrenness, a negative role model with which to warn our children, or a high priestess of cultural renewal, the image of the witch will always be there to scare or inspire, reinforcing the regrettable idea that there is something anomalous, something otherworldly, something not quite human, about a powerful woman.to blame barrenness, a negative role model with which to warn our children, or a high priestess of cultural renewal, the image of the witch will always be there to scare or inspire, reinforcing the regrettable idea that there is something anomalous, something otherworldly, something not quite human, about a powerful woman.	2000-11-23

Catching a gravity wave would be the last major experimental confirmation of Einstein's ideas.  The problem is that any gravity wave effect is unimaginably small, thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus.  Bartusiak has interviewed many of the scientists involved in the project, and explains their work in good but not numbing detail.  Her explanations of the weirdness of Relativity are excellent.  Her examples and descriptions are good fun to read, and a model of clear scientific writing for the public.<br />What will LIGO find?  That's something like asking Galileo what he would see in the telescope before he looked through it.  LIGO will not be a one-task apparatus, but will be more like an observatory.  The biggest game it is after is black holes; after all the theory, we still have only circumstantial evidence that black holes exist, and this could be a way of getting hard data.  It would be very nice to see two of them collide, or whirl around each other before the inevitable collision in thousands of years.  Neutron star collisions and supernovas are targets, too.  We are going to have a new instrument and we don't know what we are going to find; that's an exciting scientific stance.  _Einstein's Unfinished Symphony_ communicates that excitement, and those who read it will be well prepared to understand the upcoming results.	2000-11-22

It's worth the trip down from San Francisco; if you can't make it, there is now _Hearst Castle: The Biography of a Country House_  by Victoria Kastner, with photographs by Victoria Garagliano.  As befits its larger-than-life subject, this is a big book with gorgeous pictures, but the pictures are within a very helpful historic text, so even if you have seen the house, there is much to learn.  There have been tourist picture books of the house before, but this is the first book to tell the house's full story.  The story largely concerns the partnership between the architect Julia Morgan and her famous client.  Miss Morgan is regarded as the first woman architect of any prominence in America.  She and Hearst worked on the huge castle, adjacent guest houses, pools, and gardens over three decades.  She had responsibilities even for his zoo animals, and he was essentially her patron.  They were superbly able to work together, and to have obvious fun in accumulating and displaying the riches illustrated in this book. Morgan put up with Hearst's changeability, with every building turning out quite differently from how it was first planned.  Given his impulsiveness and the span of time of construction, it is astonishing that the site has any architectural unity, but she managed to make it a real showplace.<br />The book also documents the entertainments held by Hearst's lover, Marion Davies, with whom he had a longstanding, loving, and happy affair.  She was a perfect hostess at the Castle; guests and staff loved her.  Hearst loved fun in his own way, but spent much of the time at the Castle managing his business affairs by phone, leaving Davies to show hospitality to all visitors.  It was very unusual for their time, but they rejected socializing with the established money and society of the East coast, preferring to have Hearst's own business associates and movie stars as guests.  Pictures in the book show Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, and many others.<br />Much of _Hearst Castle_ is taken up with pictures to document the astonishingly rich gothic interiors.  Unlike most castles, however, this one feels like a home.  There are comfortable overstuffed chairs and sofas throughout, and a poker table jostles with Renaissance-style sculpture.  It is clear that Hearst and Morgan had fun tearing down and building up, and collecting the artifacts that range from ancient bric-a-brac to priceless masterworks.  _Hearst Castle_ is a lovely homage to a great American house.e East coast, preferring to have Hearst's own business associates and movie stars as guests.

So it is a delight to read _Trilobite!  Eyewitness to Evolution_ (Knopf) by Richard Fortey.  Fortey is surely an expert; he is a senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, and has done extensive research in fossil fields all over the globe.  His favorite specimens (he refers to them as \\"my animals\\") are trilobites, and reading his lucid, humorous, enthusiastic pages, one can certainly understand why.<br />Fortey writes with humor about his adventures in the field.  He has hunted trilobites everywhere on the globe, in desert as well as arctic wastes.  But of course, most of Fortey's book is about the trilobite itself.  The name comes from it's three lobes, not head, thorax, and tail, but the central body axis flanked by the left and right pleural regions.  It was originally thought to be some sort of flatfish, but as more specimens were found, it became clear that it was an arthropod, with the nearest living relative the horseshoe crab (although they look more like the woodlice or roly-poly bugs, and some balled up like them).  What is generally fossilized in trilobites is the outer upper shell.  The underside, with the legs, is thin cuticle that decomposed before fossilization could take place.  It was only when specimens were found from a certain field in New York state that details of limbs became plain.  Because of a peculiarity in the minerals of the area, the thin cuticle had become gilded with pyrites, fool's gold.  Every segment was shown to have a pair of branched legs, and the creature even showed antennae.  Fortey's chapter on trilobite eyes, the only ones ever to use calcite prisms for lenses, is amazing.<br />In Fortey's account, trilobites become interesting in themselves, but he clearly shows that they have larger importance.  Trilobites were always marine, never freshwater, and they generally inhabited the coastal areas.  Because of this, the outline of trilobites in what is now land shows where the coasts used to be.  Trilobites help to track the movements of the continents as they split off and sailed to their current positions on the globe over millions of years.  Fortey shows how tracking trilobites can sometimes top paleomagnetism as a way of documenting continental drift.  In addition, trilobites serve as timekeepers.  They are found all over the world and range through such times as Cambrian, Devonian, and Permian, and if you can confidently identify a trilobite, you can spot what range of times your rocks come from.<br />Trilobites lived for over three hundred million years (humans have been around about a thousandth of that time), so they had, as the British say, a very good innings.  They have been gone for over two hundred and fifty million years, and yet in this fascinating book, they live still and, with help from a superb reporter, they have news to tell us.e coastal areas.

Aczel traces the history of these understandings, but concentrates on the mathematical understanding that was really begun only in the last century.  Galileo contemplated two sets, the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4... and the square numbers 1, 4, 9, 16....  He found that every square from the second set could be paired with a number from the first: 1/1, 2/4, 3/9, 4/16, and so on.  This means that although there is an infinity of numbers in either set, one set is exactly as big as the other.  Galileo was shocked that this was true, even though it seems as if there are many more numbers in the first set; but he had found the key property of an infinite set, that it can be equal to a set included within itself.  Bernhard Bolzano built on this strange finding to show that a line one inch long has as many points as a line two inches (or any number of inches) long.<br />Georg Cantor is the mathematician most identified with studying infinities.  Aczel's book is pretty good at explaining his very peculiar findings.  Cantor found, for instance, that the infinity of counting numbers could be placed in a one to one correspondence with fractions (rational numbers).  Of course, the fractions are more dense, given all of them that exist between only, say, 1 and 2.  But the number of such fractions does not exceed the number of counting numbers.  Cantor also had clever demonstrations that a one inch line had just as many infinite points on it as a one inch square plane, as did any size line and any size plane; the same was true of higher dimensions as well.  This would seem to indicate that all infinities are the same size; however, Cantor showed that this was not true.  Specifically, he showed that although the rational numbers could be paired up with the counting numbers, there were not sufficient pairs to be made if you included such numbers as the transcendental irrationals pi or e.<br />Cantor went mad, and died in a psychiatric hospital; it is too much to say that contemplating infinities made him crazy, but his continued attempts to prove his Continuum Hypothesis provided increasing frustration, as did attacks from his fellow mathematicians.  G&ouml;del himself showed that the continuum hypothesis could not be proved or disproved.  During his work on this problem of infinities, he began to go mad as well, showing his own symptoms of paranoia and obsessiveness.  Eventually, he was convinced that his food was poisoned and he would touch less and less of it; he simply starved himself to death.<br />So open up these pages if you dare; studying infinities has not been healthful for everyone.  Aczel, however, does not go deeply into proofs, using good illustrations to provide access to non-mathematicians for some distinctly strange mathematical ideas.ade if you included such numbers as the transcendental irrationals pi or e.  <br />Cantor went mad, and died in a psychiatric hospital; it is too much to say that contemplating infinities made him crazy, but his continued attempts to prove his Continuum Hypothesis provided increasing frustration, as did attacks from his fellow mathematicians.

It is atop the cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore, and is larger than the dome of the US Capitol, St. Paul's in London, or even St. Peter's in Rome.  It was built before any of them, in 1436.  The architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, solved many problems to produce the wonder.  He did away with any central scaffold on which to build the dome, and his design for such machines as an ox-powered hoist were innovative and useful.  70 million pounds of brick, mortar, marble, and more were hoisted into the air.  The dome gradually rose, while below it were plagues, wars, jealous arguments against Brunelleschi, and financial problems.  The book is exciting as it traces the progress of the dome, and it brings out the personality of Brunelleschi well.  It gives details of Renaissance life, such as guilds, food, transportation, and brickmaking.  Fascinating.	2000-10-15

Naturally, there are few amusing anecdotes or personal recollections to draw on, and it is not possible to come up with even a biographer's speculations about how the character of the subject was formed.  What Dr. Fletcher (the jacket says she is a \\"freelance Egyptologist\\") can do is look at the monuments, paintings, and written records to show aspects of what Amenhotep III did from year to year, and from his possessions make inferences as to what was important to him.  It is as full a biography of this ancient as we could expect.<br />For instance, it is possible to get some idea of what the prince's upbringing was like.  Children of the royal nursery were taught to read and write hieratic, the \\"cursive\\" variety of hieroglyphics by the scribe Menkheper.  He also would have learned cuneiform script, the language of diplomatic correspondence of the time, and he would use it prolifically during his reign.  A primer of the time advises students: \\"You have to do your exercises daily.  Don't be idle... Ask from those who know more than you, and don't be weary - try to understand what your teacher wants, listen to his instructions.\\"  Maybe such exhortations worked, but obviously not always: a contemporary proverb says, \\"A boy's ear is on his back: he hears when he is beaten.\\"  It was not all work and no play, however.  There is a palette of six blocks of paints which bears the name of Amenhotep III, and his playroom (shared by children of the royal generations) in the palace of Amarna has paint marks on the floor and lower walls.<br />_Chronicle of a Pharaoh_ is a beautifully illustrated book, with pictures on most of its pages.  Some of the descriptions of life in ancient Egypt will seem as if they are taken from the ruling classes of our own times, but most interesting are the descriptions of customs, dress, and religion which are nothing like our own.

The full story of their relationship will never be known, but in _John Brown: Queen Victoria's Highland Servant_ (Sutton Publishing), Raymond Lamont-Brown sifts through what can be known to give as good a picture as we are likely to get of the servant beloved by the Queen and detested by so many others.  It is a small but successful study of the Queen as honest and loyal, with a love of the outdoors, and with a sense of humor (when will the opposite legend go away?) which Brown must have frequently tickled.  They were a good match.  He impressed both Albert and the Queen with his knowledge of game and hunting, and a strong friendship grew between the gillie and his Queen.  He liked jokes and gossip, and the Queen liked to hear his stories.  There are many illustrations here of their familiarity.  When the royal family went out on jaunts, John Brown usually brewed the Queen's pot of tea.  Early in his service, she remarked that this was \\"the best cup of tea I ever tasted.\\"  \\"Well, it should be, Ma'am,\\" came Brown's reply.  \\"I put a grand nip o' whisky in it.\\"<br />There is little doubt that the Queen idealized Brown in a way no one else did, but especially after Albert's death, no one tended her as he did.  A courtier wrote, \\"Others had tended her as their Queen and mistress.  John Brown protected her as she was, a poor, broken-hearted bairn who wanted looking after and taking out of herself.\\"  Many around the Queen disapproved.  Brown took his duties so seriously he would deny even her family access to her.  His gruffness with others made few friends.  Sent to convey the Queen's invitation to dinner to the Lords-in-Waiting, Brown pushed open the door of the billiard room, eyed the aristocrats, and bawled, \\"All what's here dines with the Queen.\\"  The Prince of Wales particularly disliked him, always referring to \\"that brute\\" rather than using his name.  He obliterated all the busts and mementoes of Brown after the Queen's death, but he was never able to wipe out the rumors that Brown and the Queen were lovers, or that they had a morganatic marriage, or that Brown was her guide in spiritualism.  Such evidence as there is shows that they were nothing but devoted friends as well and mistress and servant.  This readable book well illustrates the relationship, with ample quotations from the Queen's diary and from remarks of those who knew both parties well.isliked him, always referring to \\"that brute\\" rather than using his name.

They begin their story with a useful account of the campaign of Napoleon into Egypt in 1798.  The savants accompanying the soldiers brought back the records from which people tried to translate the ancient Egyptian texts, but the translations were idiosyncratic and faulty.  Champollion wrote: \\"It is a complex system, a script at the same time figurative, symbolic, and phonetic, in the same text, phrase, I would almost say in the same word.\\"  The grueling work was conquered by Champollion's stubbornness, overcoming illness, poverty, and betrayal in a triumph that caused a sensation in the academic and popular worlds.<br />This is a superb biography of a truly heroic scholar who made a difference, written by two archeologists; it is the first English-language story of Champollion.  The details of the task of translation are well laid out, and the pressure Champollion was under makes the tale surprisingly exciting.  Champollion did not just give understanding of a language; he brought us into another world which we had lost.	2000-10-05

The answer is obvious to everyone, but on closer examination, the question becomes cloudy.  Take fibers, for instance.  There has been a boom in cotton and even hemp  clothing because it is \\"natural,\\" but then one has to consider the  artificial fertilizers used and all the insecticides poured on the land to  make the plants to make the textile.  \\"Polyester\\" is something of a bad  word to many people, as it is a synthetic, but it comes from petroleum  derivatives, remnants of plants that are millions of years old rather than  grown last season.  Ever since artificial fibers were invented, there has  been a see-saw of taste for them and against, for sensible reasons and for  irrational ones.  The history of this see-saw forms much of the story in  _Nylon: The Story of a Fashion Revolution_ by Susannah Handley.<br />In the  US, the story of artificial fibers has been the story of Du Pont.  Dupont  made gunpowder in the nineteenth century, and boomed during WWI, but it had  an image problem after the war.  \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" became  the slogan, and the better living was going to start, of all things, with  better stockings.  There was a wildly fluctuating silk market based on  imports from Japan; American women were buying 1.55 million pairs of silk  stockings a day.  The Japanese cornering of the market was resented by the  American government and citizens, but that didn't curb the appetite for  silk.<br />Stockings were a huge market, but Du Pont dragged the textile  industry into re-inventing their stagnating wares.  Nylon for dresses,  nylon for wedding gowns, nylon for everything possible was advertised by Du  Pont, and synthetics were linked to fashion forever.  Polyester and Dacron,  launched in the fifties, were light and resistant to stains and wrinkles.  Sales of irons went down, sales of washers and dryers went up.  There was a  positive image of scientists taking part in fashion and popular  culture.<br />Synthetics drastically affected even the couture of the Paris  salons.  The post-war cultural shifts meant that the salons could not  continue to exist on a small number of wealthy clients, but had to start  licensing such things as perfumes and ready-to-wear clothes.  The sixties  had a vogue for all sorts of technological materials, and especially for  synthetic fashions.  Du Pont worked hard to integrate its fibers into  fabric manufacture and fashion design.  It commissioned top fashion  photographers to photograph synthetic fashions and sent the results out as  press releases, a free publicity outlet to French couturiers.  In America,  20 of the 21 layers in the Apollo moon suits were Du Pont fabrics  originally developed \\"for earthbound use,\\" and Du Pont encouraged \\"spacey\\"  looking designs in clothes.  Synthetics were pitched to the youth market,  which had no prejudice that they were inferior to the \\"real\\" thing.<br />There was a bust.  Polyester and nylon were in everything.  Polyester  especially peaked in John Travolta's disco leisure suit, and has had a bad  reputation ever since.  Overproduction of synthetics caused a classic boom  and bust; with so many wonder fibers, people were free to notice that they  caused static, retained moisture, and yellowed in perspiration.  Natural  fibers became more fashionable, both because of the ecology movement and  because with more money, people could afford the extra cost of washing and  ironing them.  Raw materials for synthetics became more costly with the gas  crisis.  Attempts to shore up synthetics in the fashion industry were  unsuccessful, and they took their places mostly in blends.<br />All things  come full circle.  Engineered fibers were reintroduced to European fashion  in the eighties by none other than the Japanese.  They married amazing new  microfibres and the ancient craft of textile making, to produce brand new  forms of cloth.  Sculptural textures are formed by blending fibers of  different shrink ratios and popping them into a hot dryer.  Metallic films  are imbedded into the threads.  Even stainless steel could coat the  fabrics.  The Japanese recognized that silk has a desirable audible quality  when it rubs on itself (called \\"scrooping\\"); new fibers passed sound-wave  tests to verify that they scrooped satisfactorily.  Next up: clothes that  change colors or other properties based on heat, moisture, or anxiety  levels, or wearable computers that control the appearance of the cloth.  Will these be the next objects of desire, and if so, will they become just  another burned out fad?  Predict fashions accurately, and get  rich.<br />_Nylon_ is a lively history of modern technology and fashion.  Handley covers engineering, advertising, and fashion house philosophy with  insight.  The excitement, disillusionment, and excitement again of  synthetic fabrics is a surprisingly alluring topic.  Her book is  beautifully illustrated with many historic advertisements, fashion model  shots (both beautiful and absurd), and pictures of such novelties as the  two ton leg in a huge nylon stocking to advertise a Los Angeles hosiery  shop.erent shrink ratios and popping them into a hot dryer.

Rather, it describes the less rigid teams or clumps that other insects  make, to examine how evolution has exploited living by the numbers.  You  will find out how ladybirds and tent caterpillers gather to control the  weather around them; how milkweed bugs feed together in a way that wouldn't  work if they did it individually; why tropical fireflies set up a communal  beacon in trees; and how periodic cicadas manage to come out by the  billions in thirteen or seventeen year cycles.<br />Insects are enormously  successful and are fascinating and accessible objects for wonder.  _Millions of Monarchs_ looks at one aspect of insect behavior, spread in  various and intricate forms.  Waldbauer's accumulation of facts is  impressive (and he can't resist telling us about the analogous group  behaviors of say, horse-shoe crabs), and well organized according to the  benefits which evolution has made available to congregations of insects.  Anyone interested in what insects do will find learning here.	2000-05-15
2481066:US	50895620	R2MFTHJ8GW1YD5	0195135156	53004101	Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud	Books	5	72	81	N	N	It's Physics versus Fantasies	For years, Robert Park, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, has written \\"What's New,\\" a short weekly update on science issues for the American Physical Society.  Park's quirky, pithy bulletins end with  the phrase, \\"Opinions are the author's and are not necessarily shared by  the APS, but they should be.\\"  Now he has written at length on some of the  topics his column has touched on.  His opinions may not be yours, but once  you read _Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud_, they should  be.<br />For Park has taken what ought to be the uncontroversial step of  simply insisting that basic science is true, and that those who profit  because they can supposedly violate scientific laws are fools or frauds,  and the rest of us ought not to be fooled or defrauded.  He keeps things  basic; he never enters, say, the controversy of creation \\"science\\" versus  evolution.  His realm is physics.  For instance, Park spends many pages  describing perpetual motion machines.  A machine that makes more energy  than it takes in (or runs on the same amount of energy it makes) would  violate basic thermodynamic laws, which Park carefully and lucidly  explains.  We may wish for the waterwheel that pumps enough water up to  fall over the wheel again and thus keep going forever, but it will never  happen.<br />Park covers plenty of other areas: homeopathy, magnet therapy,  cold fusion, Star Wars / SDI, human versus robot exploration of space,  therapeutic touch, extrasensory perception, alien abductions, Roswell, and  so on.  In each case, he simply aims cold, hard facts and physical laws at  targets that fall under his good sense.  \\"Most people who are drawn to  voodoo science simply long for a world in which things are some other way  than the way they are.\\"  With good humor and clear writing, Park has done  us the favor of reminding us that the world is the way it is, that science  shows the way it is, and that wishful thinking just won't do.	2000-05-13

We may be completely alone.  The famous biologist Ernst Mayr said that there have been a billion species on  earth, and look how many developed the stuff we would inarguably call  intelligence; we are a billion to one shot even among lots of living  things.  Sagan argued, on the other hand, that we now know of only one  planet that is inhabitable, and intelligence happened, so it's a 100%  phenomenon as far as we know.  Polar opposite conclusions can happen, if  there is no data.  Achenbach's lesson from scientists and sillies is deeply  humanistic.  We will have to wait for that special signal picked up by  Arecibo, or almond-eyed little green men landing on the White House lawn,  to know anything for sure.  _Where are they?_ turns out to be less  interesting an enigma than the magnificent, puzzling and puzzled species we  can examine in our own selves, and it is churlish to insist that we have to  look outside our planet to find amazing beings.  Achenbach's blend of  science and silliness is just right, educational, and funny, and  captivating.	2000-01-21
