In the many years I have been reading Nora Roberts, her characters have had many different occupations.  From a  detective in the In Death series written under the name JD Robb to an archeologist in Birthright to a glass blower in Born in Fire and a dance instructor in Reflections, Ms. Roberts always provides her readers with not only interesting professions but wonderful research into what these jobs are all about.  And now in one of her older titles from the Language of Love series, Summer Desserts, Ms. Roberts tackles the world of cooking and hotel ownership.<br /><br />When a young woman chef goes to work for a hotel owner sparks fly over the prime rib and creme brulee. But as the chef, Summer consumes large amounts of fast foods to keep her happy, she cannot deny her growing interest in her boss or his interest in her. This was a good read and just right for the end of the summer.  Best part is that readers of this book can continue to read about one of the characters introduced in this book in the sequel, Lessons Learned.  As with most of the Nora Robert's books I recommend, this was a delightful journey and destination to happily ever after.  And the descriptions of the food should keep your mouth watering and will have you headed to the kitchen to whip up a some up some good menus, but most of all desserts.	2005-09-01

There are few authors I immediately read as soon as they publish a new book, James Patterson is one of them.  And while some of his books of late have been rather uneven, his latest written with Andrew Gross is a perfect summer and beach read.<br /><br />Ned Kelly was raised on the wrong side of the Boston Streets.  With a father imprisoned and a brother killed during a robbery, Ned has also had his fair share of scraps with the law.  But after a spots scholarship to Boston College and a treating degree, he may have found his way to a normal life.  But as always something stands in his way and this time its a female student who accuses him of a sexual liaison and so once again Ned is without a job and looking for a life.  Moving to Florida, he works as a lifeguard and then is hired by a wealthy man to help out on his estate.<br /><br />Then one day he meets a beautiful woman who appears to be used to the good life.  When his cousin and friends who are also living in Florid propose a fail safe heist and Ned sees a million dollars in the future for him, he sees his way out of an ordinary job and a good life with Theresa the woman he just met.  But something goes terribly wrong during the robbery leaving 5 people dead and Ned on the run from Florida to Boston.  And what Ned doesn't know is that this planned robbery was meant to fail and now Ned is left to find himself accused not only of the robbery but murder. Furthermore Ned finds himself surrounded by a cast of characters which include an obnoxious millionaire, his log suffering wife, an enticing FBI agent, his father a former convict and Dr. Gatchet, a classic painting by Vincent Van Gogh.  And wherever Ned goes, he is followed by more murders, double crossing, deceit, lies among the rich and famous, some unbelievable twists and turns as only James Patterson can write.<br /><br />Lifeguard was a good and fast read as is usually the case for me when I read a James Patterson book.  Whether I am reading an Alex Cross mystery, one of the Women's Murder Club books, a heart wrenching romance or even a stand alone, this author usually satisfies my reading interest.  And Lifeguard, in my opinion, is the perfect book to grab for a lazy beach day or summer's day.  And finishing a Paterson book always makes me look forward to the next one too.  Read this book and see if the world of this Lifeguard doesn't find you turning the pages quickly to the end.n's Murder Club books, a heart wrenching romance or even a stand alone, this author usually satisfies my reading interest.

With a renewed interest in knitting on my part, and having enjoyed several books by Debbie Macomber in the past, I recently read and enjoyed The Shop on Blossom Street.  And whether you're an old time knitter or this is your first time learning to cast on and purl, I do recommend you read a book which blends a hobby with personal friendships.<br /><br />The Shop on Blossom Street books tells the story of a young woman and cancer survivor who opens a knitting store.  Offering knitting classes to attract customers, three women come to the shop to learn how to make a baby blanket.  But these three women couldn't be more different or come to the classes for different reasons which don't necessarily include learning how to knit.  And we as readers watch as these three women learn the stitches, watch their baby blankets take shape, and find themselves learning more about each other, helping each other with their projects and influencing each other's lives.  By the end of the book we find them forming lasting friendships and we know we won't soon forget these knitters.<br /><br />Similar to the premise of Debbie Macomber's book, Thursdays at Eight which I really enjoyed, The Shop on Blossom Street while  somehwat perdictable was a good journey and satisfying destination.  The best part is that the sequel, A Good Yarn, was recently published and I look forward to reading this shortly.	2005-08-20

And much to my happiness I also learned that the second book, Summer of Roses, was going to be a sequel to Summer's Child.  Since Luanne Rice is one of my very favorite writers, I ran to the store the first day Summer's Child was on the shelves and immediately began reading it.  Unfortunately I literally gulped down the book.  And what a shame since this book was so very good I should have savored each page.  But I hardly had the chance because it was as it the pages turned themselves till the end which found me sobbing.  And again when Summer of Roses was available I wasted no time but again bought it and almost immediately read the second title.  I wouldn't want anyone to misunderstand what I am about to say because I did enjoy Summer of Roses and it would be hard not to coma pre the two books, but I do think that Summer's Child was the better of the two reads. And now I seriously wonder why the two books were published when it might have been possible to write one longer book.<br /><br />Lily Malone, along with Liam Neill and her daughter return home to hubbard's pint, Connecticut, to care for Lily's ailing grandmother. Lily continues to be wary of her ex husband who knows nothing about the birth of Rose.  But when he learns that Rose is Lily's child and the dates match, he begins legal proceedings to find out if in fact she is his daughter.<br /><br />And while this is happening in Connecticut,, at Nova Scotia, Marisa is reunited with her sister Sam.  And it seems as though Patrick Murphy, who unrelentingly searched for Lily, is falling in love with Marisa and she with him too.<br /><br />In recent years Luanne Rice's books feature some of the same characters from previous books in minor roles. Its always nice to revisit with these people and also become involved in Rice's new characters as well.  Summer of Roses was a worthwhile read and perhaps it suffered because I loved Summer's Child so much and few sequels ever live up to my first read if I have loved the first one. When it comes to Luanne Rice's books, I often say that even a so so read from Luanne Rice is better than most.<br /><br />Now once again I am looking forward to the next Luanne Rice book since I have read all of them.  But now I don't have to wait too long to revisit a book which I loved since one of Rice's books, Beach Girls, has been adapted as a TV movie for cable and will be on this weekend.  I do hope that all who read this review will have an opportunity to read Lane Rice if they don't already.  She hardly ever fails to  entertain me with her settings and characters who I feel after reading one of her books are my good friends.d and perhaps it suffered because I loved Summer's Child so much and few sequels ever live up to my first read if I have loved the first one.

Not only does Ms.Collins talk about life as in the title of one of her famous songs, Both Sides Now, but she tells her life works from all of her various sides and accomplishments.<br /><br />Using a typical day divided into morning, noon and night, Ms. Collins describes how her day is influenced by her creative flow which includes, meditation, meals and the time she devotes to her music or writings. It is as if everything she creates comes forth from the creative energy she pursues daily.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  I have long admired Ms. Collins as a voice of the 60's and recently both her fiction and non -- fiction books.  To me she epitomizes a Renaissance woman not quite content simply to sing and write songs but to spread out her creative forces to many other aspects of her life.  And she seems to do all of these things so well.<br /><br />While I usually don't quote from a book, I decided to include the following lines from Morning, Noon and Night as an incentive<br /><br />for readers of this review to read a copy of this book.<br /><br />\\"Hope springs eternal they say.  As long as I can  hope, I can find my way somehow.  As long as we can hope, we see around the edges of life as they appear and look for the best, look for the love, look for the light.  It is no longer the responsibility of the world around us to make us happy; it is our responsibility to create joy in our lives and we must take what happens to us under all circumstances and find a way to tell the story, to find our way thru the dark, to get thru to our own strength from the failings that come to everyone, no matter how strong or how gifted they are.\\"<br /><br />Read this book and see for yourself if Judy Collins is not only inspiring and uplifting, but a woman for all times.g, but a woman for all times. <br /> <br />	2005-07-23

But in the past few years I have found the only romance authors I continue to read are Nora Roberts and Barbara Delinsky.  Then the other day while weeding through some old books I came across The Beach Hose by Georgia Bockoven.  This reminded me that some time ago I read one book by her, Moments, which I enjoyed.  Thinking this was a good book for the summer, I decided to read it immediately. Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be even that worthwhile a beach read as I wasn't that impressed with this book.<br /><br />Every year three families rent a lovely beach house in Santa Cruz, California for one month each.  It is tradition for the couples to spend the months of June,  July and August swimming and sunning themselves and renewing old summer friendships and rituals.  But this year may very well be the last one since the owner, a young woman has recently lost her husband and no longer has the heart to stay at the beach house during the other months without him.  Once a source of great comfort for this couple, now the widow only feels terrible loneliness when she is at the house.  But as fate would have it and this woman contemplates selling the hosue anmd trying to move on, she  meets a new neighbor who may give her cause to reconsider selling.<br /><br />The book begins with the owner opening the house for the season and as each month begins we are introduced to each family unit -- a mother and son, an elderly couple and a middle aged couple.  As their summer month we find out more about them and see how the month changes their lives immeasurably.  But the stories failed to move me and I found one downright depressing and reminded me of the popular Six Feet Under cable show. I also didn't much care for the writing style or found any of the characters endearing which I found strange.<br /><br />What I thought would be a good summer read instead turned out instead to be a rather mediocre book and I doubt I will read anything else by this author.  For this once fanatical romance reader, its back to reading Nora Roberts and Barbara Delinsky on the beach and before the fireplace on a winter's day too.bt I will read anything else by this author.

Luanne Rice is back and better than ever!<br /><br />As much as I love most of Luanne Rice's books, I was a bit worried about her next book after reading her holiday entry, Silver Bells.  It wasn't that Silver bells was entirely disappointing and didn't have all of Luanne Rice's signature marks, it was just that for me it missed its mark somehow.  And when early reports indicated that Summer's Child had a bit of a mystery angle, I wondered if this gifted auuthor, who previously wrote The Secret Hour, was venturing into a new genre.  Now that I literally gulped down Summer's Child, Rice's newest book, I am happy to say that Luanne Rice, as only she could, gave to her readers and myself a wonderful book filled with some of the best characters I've read about for sometime.  And if the mystery angle was a bit easy to figure out early on, I still found myself captivated by the story and how wonderful it all turned out.<br /><br />In Hubbards Point, Connecticut, the scene of many of Luanne Rice's previous novels, lives an elderly woman whose pregnant granddaughter vanished in the night.  A devoted detective has relentlessly searched for the young woman and has indeed sacrificed much of his life and marriage obsessed with what happened to Mara.  At the same time in Nova Scotia live two women fleeing from a difficult past.  Lily Malone runs a needlepoint shop while her young daughter, Rose, suffers from a debilitating heart ailment.  But Lily seems to have cut herself off from finding a man for herselfserself and is consumed with caring for her child and spending time with her women friends known as the Nanook women. Lily is pursued by a gentle man Liam who would give her the world if she would only give him the chance but seems too consumed with her past to allow this. A recent addition to the community is Marisa, another wounded soul who arrives with her young daughter.  Both Lily and Marisa's daughter become fast friends almost sensing they share a similar history.  And then there is a mysterious presence in both Lily and Marisa's lives which neither of them can shake no matter how far they have gone. What secrets do these people share and how their lives intersect and intertwine intrigues the reader as this book crescendos to am amazing climax.  This was one of the most heart wrenching books I have read in a long time and one which I won't soon forget.<br /><br />I first began reading Luanne Rice in 1993 and never thought any of her future books would be as good or as well loved I felt about Blue Moon, Home Fires or the recent Firefly Beach trilogy.  I am happy to say that I was wrong then and imagine I will be in the future.  And I won't have to wait too long to be reunited with these endearing characters since a sequel to Summer's Child, Summer of Roses has already been published.<br /><br />My reading life has been so enriched with the hours I have spent with Luanne Rice's books which for the most part I love.  I can't think of anything better to do when reading a book then spending days and nights with Ms. Rice's characters or spending time in Hubbards Point, a wonderful beach community in Connecticut.  This is one author who despite an occassional book I don't love, remains one of my favorite authors and I imagine I will always feel this way based on the many books I did love by her.  As I've often said, a so so book by Luanne Rice is still better than a lot of what I read these days.  My hats off to you Ms. Rice.

Cook	In the tradition of Harlan Coben and Nelson DeMille, Thomas H.Cook presents readers with not only mysteries and suspense books but taught psychological dramas.  Among the books I've read by him which I really enjoyed are the titles, The Chatham School Murder, Places in the Dark and perhaps my favorite, Breakheart Hill.  And his newest book Red Leaves is a welcome addition to a writer who provokes gradual increases of fear which finds readers holding their breaths and gulping down the pages.<br /><br />Red Leaves begins on an ordinary day in an ordinary home in a suburb which could be found across America.  But in less than 48 hours this will be no ordinary home with ordinary people, And once again we as readers find ourselves wondering how well do we really know people, even those closest to us.<br /><br />On the surface life seems good for Eric Moore and his family. He is happy with his photo and framing shop and his wife has<br /><br />a good teaching job at the local community college. They live in a closely knit community where they have friends and good neighbors.  And if their 15 year old son seems a bit odd, isn't that just teenage angst, Eric thinks?  But undeneath it all Eric's life so good or so simple as wrestles with thoughts about his other family as he calls them.  His mother who died in a car crash, a young sister who died, his ne'er do well and iullusionary father now in a nursing home and his brother, an alcoholic and solitary man.  And then one night Eric's son goes to baby-sit for aneighbors 8 year old daughter and life for the Moores nothing will never be the same again.<br /><br />This book which begins slowly gains steam as the events and Eric's thoughts and findings begin a downward spiral for which there is only doom for his family. And if the ending was melodramatic and almost anti-climactic, it did seem like the only plausible and possible ending.  The characters were well defined and I as the reader felt compassion for all of them but most of all Eric who began to realize that things were never the way they seemed.<br /><br />I have long found Thomas H. Cook to be a wonderful writer of this genre.  And my recent reading of Red Leaves only served to confirm my previous thoughts as well.  Allonge with presenting us with believable characters living ordinary lives that are about to change dramatically, Cook has the knack of making his readers feel as if they are part of the scenery.  As always when I finish one of his books, I look forward to reading his newest one or an older title I haven't read yet.  Keep writing them Mr. Cook and this is one reader who will continue to gulp down your titles.most of all Eric who began to realize that things were never the way they seemed. <br /> <br />I have long found Thomas H.

Readers of the first book in this trilogy , Blue Dahlia by Nora Roberts, may remember Roz, the warm, hearted character from this book.  In Blue Dahlia, Roz hires Stella to work for her and also gave a preganant and unbefore known relative Hayley a job and home as well.  WhiLe Blue Dahlia focused on the three women, primarily it was Stella's story.  This time in the second book in the trilogy Black Rose, Ms. Roberts, continues the trilogy by focusing on Roz Harper, the owner of the In the Garden nursery and Harper descendant.<br /><br />While the residents of Roz's ancestral home continue to deal with the Harper Bride ghost, Roz finds herself dealing with her ex husband Bryce Clerk who is creating difficult situations for Roz in her hometown community of Memphis Tennessee.  At the same time Roz also finds herself falling in love with the professor, Mitchell whom she has hired to delve into her family's past history. And if all goes the way it should this professor may very well be able to find out who the Harper Bride ghost is, and why she is occupying Roz's home and wreaking havoc at times.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me as the reader I found myself dealing with a great deal of frustration with this book.  A lover of most of Nora Roberts books, especially her trilogies, I found myself bored with this book and at times wondering what happened to my one of my favorite romance writers.  At times I found myself wanting to close this book unfinished and just counting the pages. Even the wedding of Stella and Logan the man she met inBlue Dahlia did nothing to lift my interest in this book.  In the end,  I did persevere hoping it would get better but it didn't. But I still don't know what went wrong since I gulped down Blue Dahlia and really looked forward to this next title in this trilogy. I have found while reading the last couple of trilogies, the Key and Jewels trilogies, that whereas I love the first book by the third one I have tired of the characters, the events and the settings. I was hoping to continue my enjoyment of this series but apparently it didn't work out this time either I am now left wondering if I will even read the next title, Red Lily, in this series.<br /><br />Please understand that for me to rate a Nora Roberts book with anything lower than a 4 or B is very rare.

About 8 months ago everywhere I went I saw people knitting.  In the school where I worked there was a newly formed knitting club.  And an art teacher even went so far as to include this craft as part of her curriculum with even the boys using their hands not for throwing a ball but taking up knitting needles.  Then I would also see people knitting at the park while I walked or on the train to Manhattan and even at Starbucks when I ran in for a latte.  And as always this reminded me of my mother who knit and crocheted beautifully and taught me how to knit when I was younger.  Or at least I thought she taught me how to knit.<br /><br />I first learned to \\"knit\\" at around 10 when my Mom taught me the knit stitch.  But as I got older it became apparent to me that all my Mom taught me was the eon very basic stitch.  When I would ask her how to put the stitches on or off the needles, she seemed to ignore me or perhaps ran out of patience to teach me.  And then I lost interest until a few months ago when I decided to try this again.  At first I decided to try this and enrolled in a knitting and crocheting class at the local evening high school classes. But for some reason I became more confused than anything else.  With over 20 other students and only one teacher it was almost impossible to really get help and while we tried to help one another and rely on those who seemed to catch on faster, I knew I needed to do something more.  I then began asking the teacher in school and even students and friends to help me out but that wore thin and since I really wanted to learn I did what I often do and visited the local book store.<br /><br />An avid reader and book store browser I turned to the local bookstore where I found a large assortment of knitting books.  But which books do I begin looking through and which books do I consider focusing on and most of all which books would I consider buying left me wondering if using books was the way to go.  Still I continued looking and over a period of a few weeks, I found myself returning time and again to the Maran Illustrated Knitting and Crocheting book and I knew this book would become my knitting Bible and I just had to own it.<br /><br />The Maran Illustrated Knitting and Crocheting published by  Maran Graphics is that rare \\"how to do it\\" book which really teaches you \\"how to do it.\\"  By that I mean you as the reader and the doer don't just sit there and scratch your head wondering how to decipher all of these confusing directions but are able to pick up your knitting needles and begin knitting almost at once.  Using this book I was able to make sense of the directions and unlike other knitting books the Maran book not only explained in words but showed you using explicit and wonderful colorful illustrations how to cast on stitches, knit and purl and bind off.  And it also shows you how to make different patterns of stitches and do knit cables, something which although I've been shown how to do this was never able to do it before using this book. And then there are patterns which graduate from easy to difficult which one is well prepared to do after reading this book.  But best of all besides the informative illustrations are the mechanics covered in this book which only the very best of knitters might attempt.  Items like blocking a sweater or making buttonholes or even creating one of those beautiful fair isle sweaters using different colored strands of yarn.<br /><br />I like to think of Maran Illustrated Knitting and Crocheting as just that -- a wonderful guide through the world of knitting and crocheting.  While this book can be used by the beginner knitter, it also can be used by more advanced knitters as a refresher course or even to learn something they never quite got before.  The authors focus on the easiest stitches and then other basic and more difficult combinations of stitches.  They also focus on items like making buttonholes and blocking, things the more serious knitter wouldalso want to know how to do.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading and then using this book to learn how to knit and crochet and now continue to refer to it time and again.  I imagine I always will as I continue to knit one project after another.  The Maran's also publish all sorts of wonderful guides for other crafts and interests.  And I know that in the future when I want to learn something new -- whether its how to play an instrument or learn more about the computer I will always buy their books first.  And if the other books in this series are anything like the Maran Illustrated Knitting and Crocheting, I know they will be the best teacher this interested person could ever find.<br /><br />And now thank you, Maran family, for providing somebody like me with a concise and well illustrated guide to knitting and crocheting. If my Mom was still here I would say to her,\\"Look Ma, I'm finally knitting!\\"itter would also want to know how to do.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed reading and then using this book to learn how to knit and crochet and now continue to refer to it time and again.

A long time reader of Beth Gutcheon's since her first book, Still Missing to her latest one More than You Know, I have always found her novels to be refreshing even taking on different themes and almost different writing styles each time.  But after finishing Leeway Cottage, I wondered if Ms. Gutcheon took on more than she should have in one book.  And now looking back on this title, I do wonder what point the author was trying to make since there were two very distinct storylines and they never seemed to mesh that well to me.<br /><br />The story begins with the well to do background of one of the main characters, Sydney, and how her ancestors built and lived in a cottage in a summer community.  When Sydney is a young woman, good friends of her family live in Leeway Cottage which will be her home one day.  Life is good for Sydney or so it appears.  A Kennedy type life Sydney sails during the day and parties at night with her crowd of friends.  Sydney is destined to come out at a debutante ball, attend college for a year or two, marry a wealthy man, bear children and hopefully live a happy life.  But when her father abruptly dies and Sydney is left in her mother's demanding and at times abusive hands Sydney's home life changes considerably. And than a chance encounter with a Danish pianist, Laurus, and meeting him again in New York City when Sydney leaves home at 18, sets in motion two very different worlds which will soon collide.<br /><br />The first part of the book describes to readers Sydney's dilettante lifestyle.  And while her life with just her mother is considerably difficult, Sydney also inherits a great deal of money from her father which when she's 18 allows her to leave her mother's home.  This money also allows her to buy Leeway Cottage when it goes on the market. And shortly after the birth of their first child and war breaks out, Sydney retreats to Leeway Cottage renewing her old friendships but this time on her own terms as a wealthy woman in her own right.  But Laurus does not return to Leeway Cottage with Sydney.  As a Dane and a Jew, Laurus feels compelled to return to Europe and serve in the underground jeopardizing his life and marriage.  And now we have a shift in the book as Sydney is at home o once again living the high life among society despite the war while Laurus is hard at work not only trying to save members of his own family from Hitler, but the lives of other Danish Jews as well.<br /><br />While I was familiar with some of the stories surrounding the Danish Resistance during WW II, I did learn more about this and enjoyed reading the historical information provided in this book.  But then I began to wonder why I never felt the two distinct parts of the book never fully came together to tell one large story. While there were parts that were very well written I was left disappointed by the efforts of a writer who has done much better in the past.  And just as I was about to finish the book I was further confounded by the last chapter and wondered if it was misplaced in the publishing process.  After we learn about an illicit love affair which seemed to be written for shock value and the end of Sydney and Laurus' lives, Ms. Gutcheon returns to the war and describes Laurus' sister's life and release from a concentration camp.  I still wonder why the author chose to end the book with these events since they seemed to come from left field.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy this book and recommend it to others as I have done in the past with other books by this author. I do think that Ms. Gutcheon was trying to chronicle a marriage between two people from different worlds and not necessarily suite for a happy life together.  Or perhaps she tried to show the different lifestyles of two characters and how their desires ultimately affected their lives together. In the end, though, I thought that the author might have done better to write two books rather than the one she did.  That way we would have had a much larger story of the Danish Resistance and the life of a socialite.<br /><br />If after reading this review you are still interested in reading worthwhile Beth Gutcheon books, I suggest you read her first book Still Missing or her wonderful paralleling story set over a period of 100 years, More than You Know.she tried to show the different lifestyles of two characters and how their desires ultimately affected their lives together.

In the tradition of A Short Guide to a Long and Happy Life and being perfect by Anna Quindlen, the very versatile Maria Shriver offers reader of all ages her latest book, And One More Thing Before You Go.  And what a wonderful book especially to be given as a gift at this time of year.<br /><br />How many of us either recall our mothers and fathers saying to us at the end of a phone call or face to face discussion, and more thing before you go.  It's as if our advice giving days are never over because a soon as we have our own children, its seems as though we begin saying these very words too.  And while Maria Shriver, a former news reporter, daughter of the famed Kennedy family and now married to the Governor of California also hears these words from her mother, Pat Shriver whenever they are about to end their phone calls.  Using this expression as the premise of a speech given to her friends daughter at an annual graduation luncheon from high school, Ms. Shriver expands on this theme and offers a small advice book which reader can either identify with or learn from as we continue on our journey in life.<br /><br />Touching on subjects like why fear is good, how we learn from our mistakes and most of all why trying new things or having new adventures in the world is good for us, Ms. Shriver entrances readers with ideas we may remember hearing from our own parents and now we can either learn from or pass along to the next generation as they venture forth.  But this book is not only useful for those about to embark on a new experiences but also a refresher course in how to meet life head on no matter what age we are and what we've already accomplished.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this book and think it is one which can be a most worthwhile book for young men or woman or even seasoned veterans as they try to give advice to others.  And her ending -- to call home often and let your children know the light is always on for their return is exactly what I often say to our child just before I say, and one more thing before you go.  Consider this as a graduation gift this year or in the future or even to a non graduate but to a person starting something new and a bit different.  See if it doesn't take its rightful place among books like Ms. Quindlen's or Dr. Seuss's Oh the Places You'll Go for a good lesson in how to deal with life which is always presenting us with new experiences.  This is a wonderful book infused with Ms. Shrivers own lessons in life and equal doses of sensibility and poignancy.y to our child just before I say, and one more thing before you go.

As I found after my first reading many years ago, this was a wonderful family saga  and onyl wish there were more like this book these days.  In the tradition of The Thorn Birds or more recently The Tea Rose by Jennifer Donnelly, this book taskes hold of you and doesn't let go till the last page.<br /><br />Charles Kitteridge sires three daughters from three different women in three very different areas of the world. Aisla is raised in the hills and glens of the Scottish moors filled with all sorts of mysticism and traditions.  Li Ann, whose mother was Chinese, was raised a blue eyed woman in China while Generva is raised in India the daughter of a Bristish woman who abandons her when she is very young.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and found the charazcters wonderful and entrancing.  This was an unusually good story of three very different women and how they grew up imaginng their father.  The characters were well drawn and their circumstances found me once again turning the pages of a real good book. And the end was very poiugnant and quite fitting as a father finalyl meets his three daughters from all over the world.<br /><br />I now look forward to reading the next two books in this series and continuing my enjoyment of this author's esepcially fine storytelling.	2005-06-20

In my opinion this was one of the better book in this series although I enjoyed all of them as I always do when I read Nora Roberts series books or trilogies.<br /><br />Suzanne lives in the Towers at Bar Harbor, Maine with her two precocious children -- a son and daughter, Now a single parent and owner of a nursery and flower shop, Suzanne was once married to a vicious man and is well rid of him.  But fate has two surprises in store for Suzanne.  One is that her sister just married the brother of a woman who had a child with her former husband before they were married. And the other is a good looking man who can't seem to stay away from Suzanne.  The fact that Holt is the grandson of the artist Suzanne's great grandmother Bianca fell in love with all of those years before is as intriguing as the man himself.  And as the relationship flowers, Holt and Suzanne begin to feel as if history is repeating itself although there longings can be realized.  And all the while there is somebody out there who is determined to find the family emeralds which were given to Bianca by her husband so that she will stay with him. I found this book not only interesting to learn more about Suzanne but also about the artist who loved Bianca and how this love affair affected future generations not only of the Calhouns but the artist's family as well.<br /><br />This was a good book which presents readers with the story of the oldest Calhoun sister. As always I closed the book realizing how nice it is to be part of a closely knit family like the ones presented in Nora's books.  And this time it was especially nice to catch up with the other sisters, Catherine, Lilah and Amanda. It was also interesting to finally meet Megan, Catherine's sister in law and the woman whose son is Suzanne's children's half brother and is featured in the last Calhoun book, Megan's Mate.<br /><br />I must admit that of all of Nora Roberts many books which fit into three sub genres of the romance area, it is her trilogies and series books I love best.  Not one to leave Nora and her characters long, I am about to begin Black Rose, the second book in her latest series, Into the Garden.  And something tells me that once again my eyes will be glued to the page as I am entranced by Nora's characters and their lives.ate. <br /> <br />I must admit that of all of Nora Roberts many books which fit into three sub genres of the romance area, it is her trilogies and series books I love best.

And as if Andy doesn't have his hands full with his canine rescue partner Willie, his somewhat interesting lawassociate and his not too hardworking and crossword puzzle secretary, Andy's long standing girlfriend and private investigator is thinking of leaving New Jersey and taking a job in the hometown where she grew up.<br /><br />In the tradition of characters like Myron Bolitar from the<br /><br />Harlan Coben series and Patrick Gennaro from Dennis Lehane's<br /><br />series, David Rosenfelt takes his rightful place next to<br /><br />these men in the fast paced world of suspense sprinkled with<br /><br />both humor and pathos.	2005-06-18

Those familiar with Harlan Coben's series featuring sports agent sometimes detective Myron Bolitar will delight in this gifted author's latest book, The Innocent.  Joining other stand alone books of Mr. oben's like Tell No One and Gone for Good, this book takes its rightful place along with the above mentioned as being a hair raising roller coaster of a read.  And one which I imagine most readers will love as I did when Mr. Coben's newest book around the asks the age old question,  do we really and truly know the person we're married to.  To day this is a really good suspsense book and will have yoru emotions going up and down as the suspsense mounts is an understatemnt.<br /><br />Matt Hunter is 20 years old when during a vacation from a college vacation, he is involved in a brawl and accidentally kills a college student.  Although he ha dlittle do with instigating the fight and merely was trying to help a friend, Matt is found at the scene whiel others scurried away and stands trial for the death of another college student.<br /><br />While this most likely was an accident and he may be innocent he is found guilty by a jury and is sentenced to spend several years in prison.  Needless to say, as a young suburban man, Matt is less than prepared for prison life but manages to stay alive.  When he leaves prison four years later he is taken under the wing of his older brother,a laywer with a prestigious NJ firm which eventually hire Matt as a paralegal. But life for Matt as a convicted felon will never be the same.<br /><br />Now it is nine years later, Matt's brother is dead from a brain<br /><br />aneurysm and his father is also gone.  Matt's mother and<br /><br />sister live far away but he still helps out his sister in law<br /><br />and his two nephews.  Matt also continues to work for the same law firm as before but he is now mrried to a wonderful woman, Olivia and they are expecting their first child.He is also about to close on a home in his old neighborhhod and Matt cn't help but think that life is good.  But when his wife convinces him to buy two cell phones which can send pictures, this sets in motion a series of events which have Matt wondering who Olivia really is and why is his life spiraling downwards. on one otherwise ordinary day Matt's phone rings and<br /><br />the sights he sees will once again change life as he knew it.<br /><br />And we as readers now embark alogn with Matt on a whirwind and well thought out plot stretching from New Jerey to Nevada<br /><br />with a cast of characters we come to know and enjoy.<br /><br />This was a real good read, much better than Coben's last two books, No Second Chance and Just One Look, in my opinion.  The characters are fully developed and we are privy to not only what is happening now but what happened to them in the past as well. Readers are able to feel all of the emotions as this story takes off and doesn't let go.  One slight change from Mr. Coben's other stand alone books and main characters is that, Matt Hunter isn't quite as sarcastic as other characters found in this author's other books, ie Myron Bolitar This fact makes Matt a much more believable and vulnearble character.  And as hardened as Matt may seem from priosn life,underneath we know that he can't believe the world he has made with Olivia is unraveling before his eyes.<br /><br />Harlan Coben's books at best are rather convoluted which<br /><br />has been one criticism which I have often heard about his books.  I even found myself taking a few notes while reading his books to try and keep one step ahead of these well crafted novels.  Overall, though, I found this book a bit easier to keep up with and if I didn't get all of the goings on at the end, Matt Hunter himself says there are some things he won't ever understand either.  And this I can live with since I really enjoyed this book.  If I had one small criticsm it would be that the end was a bit too coincidental as if the author decided to tie up the book with an ending which readers were hoping would happen.<br /><br />While I have read all of Mr. Coben's stand alone books I haven't read any of his Myron Bolita series books. I hope to read them this summer. And I also am anxiously waiting for Mr. Coben's next stand alone. he can't write them fast enough for me and I highly recommend his books.ch readers were hoping would happen. <br /> <br />While I have read all of Mr. Coben's stand alone books I haven't read any of his Myron Bolita series books.

If I had one wish other than good health and prosperity for my family and friends, it would be to spend an hour with Anna Quindlen.  From Ms. Quindlen's earliest days as a columnist for the New York Times to her books and musings for Newsweek magazine, this author never fails to amaze me.  I will truly never forget feeling black and blue when I read Ms. Quindlen's book so aptly named or the longings of Mrs. Blessing to nurture an abandoned infant in her book Blessings or most of all how she seemed to be writing about me in How Reading Changed My Life.  But it was her canceled graduation speech and the basis of the book, A Short Guide to a Long and Happy Life which filled me with joy and tears as I handed this to our only child when she left our home and she embarked on a career and living in the big city when she graduated from college.And now that I have read Ms. Quindlen's latest offering and once again I must sing her praises as a wise and witty author who shares with her readers her innermost thoughts on living a life of perfection and being perfect.<br /><br />In Being Perfect Ms. Quindlen explores how each of us is consumed with the goal of being perfect and more important what happens to us when we march to our own drummer.  While we hear this term and may even use it ourselves, as we read this book we really have time to think about what is \\"perfect\\" and what surprises and life lessons await us when we're not \\"perfect.\\"  And how we grow and learn and sometimes realize that being perfect may not only be a myth but harmful to us as individuals.<br /><br />While avid readers love to read, we all read for different reasons.  And when I read Anna Quindlen I can't help but think of CS Lewis' quote, \\"We read to know we are not alone,\\"  And so I know I am never alone when I read an Anna Quindlen book and it is as if she is standing right beside me urging me on to continue reading, continue  to be myself and continue to enjoy what I hope will be a long and happy life.  And if I never get to meet this gifted author, I can always look forward to her next book, or article or even reread one of her previous books which I cherished.<br /><br />I urge to read Being Perfect and consider this as a gift for any and all who are embarking on a new journey or just living their usual lives.

Well versed in the law, she had provided readers with a new voice in the genre of police matters and courtroom dramas.<br /><br />Finishing law school and studying for the Bar, Chloe Townsend has just returned from a somewhat disappointing evening with her boy friend.  Falling asleep quickly she wakes to find a man in her apartment speaking to her in a low tone wearing a clown mask. The evening turns violent and ugly as she is raped and almost left for dead.  Twelve years later, with a new name and after years of trying to heal, Chloe she is now a prosecuting attorney in Florida and has spent the better part of a year trying to find and prosecute a serial killer.  When a man is taken into custody, Chloe realizes almost immediately this is the man who raped her long ago but is he also a serial killer?  What ensues is a roller coaster ride of a read.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the beginning and end of this book, I found the<br /><br />middle portion to be way too graphic concerning medical autopsies and too detailed about police procedures.  I also would have enjoyed more of an interesting court case although the thrust of this book clearly was Chloe's revenge which might have been misplaced.  I fully realize that while Chloe never should have tried this case based on the events in her life, the author presumed that readers should and would suspend disbelief.  Doing this allowed me to finish this book although the better part of me also knew that in the real world this should never have happened.<br /><br />I read this in part when I heard about Jilliane Hoffman's new book Last Witness and was told it featured some of the same characters found in Retribution.  Knowing my propensity to read books in order I had to read Retribution first.  I now look forward to reading Last  Witness.	2005-06-03

This is a book to be read not once, but several times.  And each time one can explore some new aspect of a sad tale from which not only the characters in this book can learn from but something which teaches all of us about life and loss.<br /><br />Tess's youngest sister dies on September 11th but not as a result of the Twin Towers tragedy. Unfortunately While waiting for the school bus, Tess takes her eyes off her sister, Zoe for a couple of minutes and when Zoe wanders off and into the street, she is hit and killed by a reckless driver.<br /><br />The death of a sibling is horrific at any age but for Tess the guilt is even greater.  Zoe was Tess's half sister -- the child of her mother's second marriage and the beloved youngest child of this family. Tess is faced with unbearable agony and guilt over this event and asks herself many questions as the family tries to recover.  First and foremost Tess asks herself how a devoted older sister will ever cope with her younger sisters death?  And how does she cope with the fact that she was at fault for her sister's death when she turned away just for that moment?  How will she ever cope with the fact that in that moment when she turned away she was finding out about the 9/11 tragedy in New York City?  And the final question posed to her that day will forever haunt her when her mother asked, \\"Where's Zoe?\\"  And most of all how will Tess cope with the fact that while the world at large is mourning a terrorist attack in Manhattan her sister's death goes almost unnoticed.<br /><br />Dear Zoe is a letter to Zoe from Tess basically their first year without her. More than that thought this book tells the story, in frank and poignant passages, how Tess not only came to terms with Zoe's death but how she also came to terms with her part in this tragedy and to forgive herself.  But for Tess to deal with her part in the tragedy and come to grips with this isn't easy.  The book is filled with events during that long year and how Tess grows up and ventures into almost another world as she goes to live with her negligent father and finds herself falling in love with the boy next door who may or may not be right for Tess.  While Dear Zoe deals with the tragedy of Zoe's death, in a sense it deals more with Tess's coming of age as she deals with the love for her lost sister, for the love her family provides for one another, the love her errant father shows towards her and Tess's.  And as painful as it is for us to read this book, we know that Tess will come out of this overwhelmingly sad even much stronger and wiser for knowing about the power of love and forgiveness.<br /><br />In many respects this book, with a strong young female adolescent character, reminded me of the main character from The Usual Rules by Joyce Maynard and Katie Nash from the Durable Goods trilogy by Elizabeth Berg.  Each of these books provided me with characters I felt I knew well and ones I won't ever forget.<br /><br />I highly recommend all of the above mentioned books and now look forward to Philip Beard's next book.  I see a bright future ahead for both this author and his main character.dy and come to grips with this isn't easy.

I see a bright future ahead for both this author and his main character.   <br /> <br />	2005-05-27

If you were to ask me to list my favorite authors, the name Nelson DeMille would surely be at the top of the list.  Yet, in the past number of years I have only read two of his books, The Gold Coast which I still can remember laughing out loud while reading and Plum Island which introduced the irascible character of John Corey.  I'm not sure if instinctively I save DeMille's other books or just needed to be in the mood but I recently picked up Night Fall and gobbled this book down in a matter of days.  Never much of a mystery or suspense reader, except for a couple of authors and books, I did wonder as I closed this book why I waited so long to pick up another title by this exceptionally author in this genre.  Or why I don't read more of these books in general.  Night Fall, for me, was one of the best suspense filled books I've ever read and it literally kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Five years after the fatal plane crash of Flight 800 over Morachies Beach in Long Island and after a few well placed hints by his wife, John Corey investigates what really caused the explosion of this plane killing all of its passengers as they headed to Paris. Was it a malfunction as the final report stated or was it a missile, possibly one of our own.  What caused the famous streak which was seen by so many before the plane exploded plunging it and the passengers into the sea.  But most of all as John Corey unearths more and more information he uncovers an illicit affair, a beach tryst and a missing tape from a camcorder which may show all of the events which once again might lead to some new conclusions. As John continues to investigate all of the angles, he finds himself facing brick walls and stumbling blocks galore not the least of which are higher ups in the government who warn Corey to stay away from snooping around.  But by then Corey is knee deep in a grand cover up and he can't and won't let go of finding out the truth.  As tensions mount both personally and professionally for Corey and his wife, an even grander tragedy is about to play our which will not only alter the world as we know it but certainly any future investigation of this event.<br /><br />I thought that Night Fall with all of it twists and turns, revelations and fictional suppositions was a really engrossing read with a solid B+ rating.  That was until the end.  I never saw the last event coming and as it was a real zinger for me it and the final conclusion of this roller coaster ride, the book became an A rating in my opinion.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br />Now I have all of Nelson DeMille's books on my \\"to be read\\" table and plan on reading and savoring them one by one.ly for Corey and his wife, an even grander tragedy is about to play our which will not only alter the world as we know it but certainly any future investigation of this event.

This book concentrates almost solely on Lindsay Boxer, a police detective, and at the heart of the first three books.<br /><br />Lindsay Boxer, who has already had her share of problems in the previous three books, is now on trial after her attempt to help two childen goes very wrong.  At the same time she is trying to solve recent murders which remind her of one of her first cases which was never solved.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book and might have rated it higher if we heard more from or about the other members of the murder club.  Other than a few drinks and a meal or two with all three women together both Claire, a pathologist who works for the city and Cindy, a newspaper reporter were kept very much in the background.  This meant that the camaraderie which was established in the first three books was sadly missing. Also Lindsay's lover, Joe, seemed to come and go and I was eager to see them establish a more permanent relationship during this book.  Finally, as Patterson has done in  past books, the guilty parties are almost plucked from the sky and a bit too conveniently place when you realize who did it.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms, I continue to enjoy these books and now look forward  to the next book in this series.  For a fast and light read you can't do better than a James Patterson title. And this  title is more than a satisfying and worthwhile read.	2005-05-19

But for some reason I didn't pick any of them up until I recently saw the audiotape. While I began by listening to the audio, I did finish by reading over half the book and enjoyed both experiences.<br /><br />Route 66 is a rather new highway which winds around the country and the year is 1935.  The United States is gripped by the Depression and thousands from Oklahoma and other cities effected by the Dust Bowl are on the road seeking a better life in California.  But for one woman pregnant and a widow, Route 66 takes her back to her home near Santa Fe, New Mexico and the motor court her father owned.  Now Mary Lee's father is gone and her mother an alcoholic has allowed gentlemen callers to rent cabins and takes the rent money and buys liquor instead of fixing up the cabins.  But Mary Lee realizes this may be the only way she can earn some money and take care of her child who will be born in a few months.  Complicating her life are her mothers friends and her deceased husband's father who wants to raise the child.<br /><br />Although this was a rather predictable romance, it did intrigue me and while the ending was obvious it was a good journey till I reached the last page.  Dorothy Garlock is well known for writing Americana romances and slices of American life, primarily during the 30's and 40's.  This was a good read with endearing characters and I do look forward to reading more books by her in the future.	2005-05-09

For Love of Lilah by Nora Roberts continues the saga first began with Courting Catherine.  In this book Lilah Calhoun is determined to live her own life until she rescues Max Quartermain from a stormy sea.  And Max a rather reserved history professor doesn't exactly know what to make of why he was in the sea until he meets with the rather unusual Calhoun family.  But almost immediately the one thing he realizes is that they are in danger and that he's also falling in love with one of them.<br /><br />Another good read in a series devoted to four sisters and their loves.  Inlcuded in the romance is the paralellingstory of their great grandmothers love for an artist and her tragic death. And also the search for an emerald necklace which may or may not be in the house or the grounds and has attracted the attention of an unsavory man determined to find the necklace at all cost.<br /><br />This is the third book in the Calhoun series and with each book I realize how much and why I so enjoy Nora Roberts's series books.  I rated this book with a B+ and look forward to reading the next two books to complete this series.	2005-05-06

I recently saw the movie The Village and when I mentioned this to a book group, somebody advised me to read Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix.  There was some talk that the movie which I so enjoyed was based on this book. Perhaps if I read this book without knowing anything about a similar movie I might not have compared it and might have enjoyed it more.  But I was disappointed at best and found while the premise was similar too much else was far different to say The Village was based on this book.  And as it turns out although the publisher and author planned on suing the producers of this movie, that never did happen.<br /><br />Jessie is a 13 year old girl living in 1840.  She is surrounded by the love of her parents and five siblings when one day her mother begins to explain where they actually are living and then asks her to find medical help for the children who are dying from diphtheria.  What ensues is a rather unbelievable story which borders on science fiction and the case for a utopian society.  But in the end greed is at the center of this plan and it was a bit too far fetched with too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Objectively speaking perhaps I no longer can appreciate nboosk meant for a younger population but I doubt I would recommend this book to grade school or young adults.  I think there are far better books which broach this subject which make a far better case for a plan like this.  In the end the book was very mediocre to me.  I would suggest seeing the movie which explores the premisee quite differently and more exciting and is almost believable and far better in my opinion.	2005-05-01

A number of years ago a book called The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd hit the bookshelves.  Hailed as a wonderful read and compared to To Kill a Mockingbird this book enjoyed great popularity which can be a blessing or curse for an author.  The blessing is that your name becomes a household name and well known and you profit monetarily.  The curse often is that you may be a one hit wonder and what will you do for an encore?  Does anybody reading this review remember how eagerly anticipated Pat Conroy's next book was after he wrote Prince of Tides?  So now thousands of readers waited for Sue Monk Kidd's newest book and since I was among them I must say that the wait was so worth it.  In my opinion, The Mermaid Chair is one terrific read and is certainly on my top ten reads for 2005.<br /><br />The Mermaid Chair tells the story of middle aged Jessie.  She is an artist, wife of a psychiatrist and the mother of one daughter who is off at college.  What happens to a woman who is at the mid point of her life with accomplishments behind her but a restless spirit burning within her.  And then a phone call about her rather reclusive and religious mother on a low country island forces Jessie to evaluate not only her mother's emotional health but her own as well.<br /><br />Jessie on the verge of unhappiness returns to her childhood home to care for her mother who has just caused a bizarre physical event. Surrounded by a Benedictine monastery and a monk<br />unsure of his calling, life takes an unexpected turn for both<br />Jessie and Brother Tom two very fragile people.  As Jessie sorts through her mother's personal demons and dilemmas, she is now faced with her love for her family and her love for Brother Thomas.  How this all fits together and truths ear revealed leads to a stunning conclusion.  While I couldn't fully buy the intensity of the love affair between Jessie and Brother Thomas happening, I finished this book loving the message of love loss and redemption.  And most of all I loved how lies which altered lives and feelings were finally exposed and how healing even after many years can begin.<br /><br />A great second book by the author of The Secret Life of Bees.<br />I highly recommend this book and once again am sitting and waiting for another book by this gifted author.ed how lies which altered lives and feelings were finally exposed and how healing even after many years can begin.

I now realize the only thing I learned how to do was knit and that was it.  Clearly my interest was never catered to and I forgot all about knitting until I inherited my mom's knitting and crochet needles.  But too quickly I put them into our basement and didn't think about them until this year when suddenly everybody at the school where I work is knitting, including the boys.  OK, so an art teacher is doing this in her classes but I becomes so intrigued and decided to pull out the needles and buy some yarn and knit away.  But that didn't happen too quickly.  First I had to learn how to cast on and hwo to read a pattern and how to purl and bind off and my head was swimming.  Relying on the help of some friends who got tired of my questions and a wonderful student and knitter, I knew I needed somethign handy I coudl refer to which would help me out.  And then one day my student loaned me Stitch 'N Bitch by Debbie Stoller and my prayers were answered.  (Of course with in two days I bought my own copy and returned my student's copy to her with a note of thanks).  Thanks to this book today I am knitting away, practicing what I knew as well as learning new things.  And all because of this comprehensive addition to my libraray.  Today I can knit and purl away with eas and I am also looking forward to the other books in this series.<br /><br />I like to think of Stitch 'N Bitch, the Knitter's Handbook as a primer for those who either want to learn to knit or know some but not all of the basics. The author explains using layman's terms and concise illustrations basic knitting stitches.  She also includes some family history as to how she began knitting and why she took this hobby up years later.  Of special interest is a discussion of the various types of yarns and when to use them and the various needles one can use.  We are also provided with a list of knitting terms useful when deciphering a pattern and what accessories are handy to keep with you while knitting. And Ms. Stoller also includes patterns from various other stitchers and bitters which include scarves, baby blankets and other projects.  Finally the author also includes not only a list of where to buy yarn all over the country but suggestions for how to form your own stitch n bitch groups and where to go online for help and other information.<br /><br />This book really has been a one stop learning guide to knitting.  It has already proved to be an invaluable aid in figuring out what is important to know and I imagine over time I will refer to it again and again.<br /><br />In the last 6 months since the knitting bug has struck me, I have pored over many knitting books which proved to be either too<br /><br />complicated, too boring or assumed you knew just about everything.  Stitch 'N Bitch on the other hand  is just about perfect in my opinion.  Now if it only it could also knit for me.

One was The First Time which I thought was OK.  The second book was Whispers and lies which I loved.  When I found Puppet at the library, I couldn't wait to read another psychological thriller because of how I felt about Whispers and Lies.  Sadly while I enjoyed three-fourths of the book, by the end, I was left feeling rather disappointed.<br /><br />Amanda is a 28 year old lawyer living in Florida.  With two failed marriages behind her Danielle now finally enjoys a wonderful career, great home and single lifestyle. But this may not last much longer after she receives a phone call from her ex husband, a practicing attorney from her home town in Toronto, Canada.  Now Amanda's carefully ordered world is about to crumble when she learns that her mother, whom she has always had a strained relationship with, has just killed a total stranger in the lobby of a hotel.  Initially Amanda tells her ex husband this isn't her problem and refuses to fly to Toronto.  But then realizing her mother has no other family, Amanda decides to make the trip if even for only a few days.  Once there Amanda must not only deal with her mother's refusal to discuss what happened but her mothers stubborness about pleading guilty without explaining her actions. What ensues for readers after this was a roller coaster of events which kept my eyes pealed to the page.  But only up to a certain point.<br /><br />While I raced through the first 200 pages of the book I found there was one real problem I had with the book and that was I didn't find Amanda a totally sympathetic character although she should have been, especially by the end.  And the zinger at the end, as I call this revelation proved to be way too creepy for me to really rate this book higher which I originally planned to do.  Still when I thought about lowering my rating, I did rate this book higher than I might have because for most of the book I was sitting on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more books by Fielding.  But I do hope that her next endings might not be as creepy and disappointing as this one was for me.  My feelings reminded me of those readers who also felt cheated by the ending in Whispers and Lies although fro me I never saw that ending coming and therefore loved it.  This ending I would never have predicted and when I read it, was really disappointed that Fielding would resort to this rather bizarre shocker.e edge of my seat.

Each time I hold a new James Patterson book in my hand I have such high hopes that the book will be a terrific read.  And in some cases like Honeymoon this is true.  But in other cases like The Beach House, I feel as thought this reading experiences has been a waste of time.  Then I always can rationalize and say these are Patterson's stand alone and in some cases co authored and then I patiently wait for a new Alex Cross title with those villains you love to hate.  And then came London Bridges this year and what can I say except that maybe its time for Alex to find a woman and retire with his family to a nice place where no one will bother him.  Either Alex has run out of steam or Patterson is much too busy pursuing his romance books and other series which now include The Women's Murder Club and the one about the FBI agent featured in Honeymoon.<br /><br />This time Patterson finds two previous enemies, the Weasel and the Wolf have become somewhat united in an effort to alter the world as we know it.  And despite that it has the usual twists and suyrprises and we once again read about Alex's private life, I thought this book was a grand waste of time.  Too bad since I so loved most of the Cross books and looked forward to this one.	2005-04-21

In the sixth book of the Elm Creek Quilt series, the author Jennifer Chiaverini returns to the group of women we met in the first book The Quilter's Apprentice.  While in previous books we kept up with their lives, the author chose to take us on a journey describing the family history of Sylvia Compson, the owner of the Elm Creek house through quilts the ladies found.  While I enjoyed this book I didn't find it as interesting as the historical side of the other books.<br /><br />As Sylvia remarries and business is good at the Elm Creek Quilt camp, two of the original members are faced with life altering decisions.  The opportunities which are presented to them will take them far away.  One decision involves marriage for one member and the future of her husband while the others woman is offered a wonderful teaching position which offers her husband a better job and her child the opportunity to live closer to her grandmother.  In each case these women worry how their absence will influence not only the viability of the group, but their own lives. And then a third member is beset by personal problems and the loss of her business.<br /><br />While this was a pleasant read, it lacked the historical stories<br /><br />found in other books in this series which the author paralleled<br /><br />with the present day doings at the manor. Still it was a good read and I now look forward to reading the newest book in this series.	2005-04-21

And while I read many of this authors other books, this title always eluded me and remained on a list of books I was someday determined to read.  The beginning of 2005 saw me finally read this book or shall I say skim many pages since almost from the beginning I found the book too wordy and overly descriptive for me.  When I finished it, I thought I read about as much concerning Emma Harte as I wanted to.  Then other readers from my book group began talking about Bradford's new book Emma's Secret which filled in Emma's doings during the war years.  And somehow I was enticed by the lure of this secret about Emma's past and finally decided to listen to audio of this book.  Unfortunately by the time I finished the 12 CD's, I found there wasn't much of secret after all.<br /><br />As Evan Hughes' grandmother Glynnis lies on her deathbed, Glynnis tells Evan to find Emma Harte in London. That this woman holds the key to Evan's future.  Evan who bears a striking resemblance to Emma's beloved granddaughter Paula, journeys to London when her grandmother dies and is heartbroken when she learns that Emma has been dead for over 30 years.  But not to worry. Evan is hired to be Paula's daughter's assistant and is not only taken in by a couple of Emma's great granddaughter's but becomes romantically engaged with another Harte, Gideon.  While the rest of the family is also quite taken with Evan, most of all her looks they quickly realize that she isn't any relationship to the late Paul McGill, Paula's grandfather.  And what could be better than when two of Emma's great granddaughters find her diaries from the war years.  From there the story progresses to the end when we find out the secret which I'm afraid wasn't much of a secret after all.  And while the main story is about Evan and her father's true background, there are also the familiar threads of a large family fighting over who will become the number one heir when Paula retires or dies. And as every wealthy family in books, at least, has to have a bad seed, Jonathn Ainsley is back with his hopes of somehow controlling Harte industries.<br /><br />A stickler for reading all of the books in a series and always in order I wondered if I would miss reading the two books in between this title.  But much to Ms. Bradford's credit, she does fill in her readers with events from all three previous books, A Woman of Substance, To Be the Best and Hold the Dream. But once again I found Emma's Secret like A Woman of Substance to be overly wordy and descriptive.  Do I really care for all of the folds and creases of  Emma's couture clothing collection or her objets d'art found in her Belgravia home or Pennistone Royal?  In the end I imagine that the author missed her favorite character, Emma, and this was a convenient way to return to yesteryear and provide her loyal Emma Harte readers with another book.  But on the plus side if you like large family trees and a family saga over many years, this book is definitely for you.  But for me the lure of another new Emma book, Unexpected Blessings isn't enough of a lure.  I'm afraid that I have reached the end of my time with Emma Harte and her family.  I will continue to read family sagas since I do enjoy them but Emma and her families days for me are over and not a day too soon, I'm afraid.when Paula retires or dies.

Elizabeth Berg is one of my most treasured writers since I read her first book Talk Before Sleep.  Each time I am about to begin her newest book I wonder if I will enjoy it as much as the book before her last one or the book before that one and so on.  And each time I am almost never disappointed because each book is filled with wonderful characters and emotional sagas written from the heart.  And once again I have fallen in love not only with this writer but her latest book The Year of Pleasures which features a main character on the brink of a new change in her life.<br /><br />Betta Nolan is a fifty something woman who up until her husband's death enjoyed a good life.  Madly in love with her husband, Betta lives in Boston where she enjoys an almost solitary profession as a writer of children's books. Able to travel and enjoy the companionship of her husband, both she and her husband, who was a psychiatrist, never thought their time would be cut so short when he became terminally ill.  With no children or relatives and few friends, it is as if they lived unto themselves in the world around them.  But life stood in their way and when Betta's husband realizes she will live out her days without him, he urges her to strike out and make a new life for herself elsewhere.  So when her husband dies, Betta honors her promise to him and does exactly what he urged her to do.  Locking the door of her home, she sets out in her car to find a new place to live in and to grow as a woman alone but hopefully never lonely.  And in the first year of widowhood, with some bumps along the way, this is exactly what Betta does finding not only a home but friends and a business which is an inspiration not only to her but to other woman in the area.<br /><br />The Year of Pleasures is one of those books like Pull of the Moon which reached out to me, took hold of me while I was reading it and will remain with me always.  The emotions of losing a beloved husband and lifestyle and how one reacts is surely different for every woman who unfortunately experiences this event.  And for Betta perhaps even more since the death of her loved one came at a time when life was somewhat winding down and plans for their golden years together was just around the corner.  Although Betta wonders as many others do if there is ever a good time to lose a mate?<br /><br />At first Berg provides readers with all of the grief one must go through at this time and then slowly shows us how people in this position must grieve and then move on to give a new meaning and purpose to their lives.  While I think that perhaps there was a bit of coincidence and unreality about some of the events -- would one really leave all that they know so quickly, in Berg's more than capable hands, readers are given an adventure in how to give meaning to one's life alone and feel good about the next stage of their life as well.  And so Betta experiences a year of pleasures despite that the circumstances never suggested this is what it would be when her husband first died.<br /><br />Many years ago, I read Widow by Lynn Caine which told the true story Caine's story of being a young woman left with two small children when her husband dies. And more recently this year I read Home Away from Home by Lorna J. Cook where a younger childless woman was suddenly widowed and found for almost a year that she couldn't sleep at the home she shared with her now deceased husband.  While both of these books wee excellent and insightful reads, there are emotions and passages from The Year of Pleasures which truly gibes the reader an undeniable sense of what it must be like and feel like to be a widow.<br /><br />The Year of Pleasures now takes its place among my very favorite reads by Elizabeth Berg, which include The Pull of the Moon, Durable Goods, Joy School, True to Form and The Art of Mending, With The Year of Pleasures it is as if Berg has gone full circle in describing the stages of a woman's life.  One can onlyhold the breath to see what she will write about in her next book.<br /><br />I urge you to read this book and see if you don't fall madly in love with this author.  Read it and see if her characters don't become friends of yours that you worry about and wonder how life is treating them now.  Most of all revel in the writing which may find tears in your eyes or a smile on your face.One can only hold the breath to see what she will write about in her next book. <br /> <br />I urge you to read this book and see if you don't fall madly in love with this author.

As those who have read my reviews before, especially for books set in prep schools, public high schools or college campuses knows, (see my review for Speak Softly, She Can Hear by Pam Lewis), I love books set on college campuses or boarding schools, etc.  Therefore I was really looking forward to reading the debut novel of Curtis Sittenfield, Prep: A Novel. But while the book took place at a prestigious New England prep school, think a coed Choate or Exeter, ultimately I was sadly disappointed while I read this book and certainly when I finished it.<br /><br />We first meet the main character, a young student from Indiana who on her own decides she wants to attend a prep boarding school.  Not realizing all of the ramifications of going to a school like this, Lee Fiora, enters these academic halls where the focus of the book seems more social than academic.  The usual prep school things occur like unhappy students, class distinctions between the rich girls and the ones who attend on scholarship, the wild crush on a male students which lasts for four years, parents weekend where Lee is embarrassed by her middle class parents who are a bit of place and finally graduation.  Only then does Lee realize there is more to life than this school.  Too bad she didn't realize this earlier on and concentrate on the real reason she went to his school, the academics instead of all of this social mumbo jumbo. While there were many things I wondered about in this book, most of all I wondered what initially possessed this young woman to attend this school at all since she seem so ill suited to enjoy herself in this atmosphere.  And as the book proceeds we watch as Lee tries to navigate through prestigious Ault Academy with almost few successes and again I wondered why she remained there.<br /><br />Many other authors have tackled the theme of what prep and boarding schools are all about and more often the idea of the haves and the have nots and the social ramifications of these institutions. But what really disappointed me was that I couldn't really warm up to this character or understand most of her decisions.  And while reading about her ongoing lust affair with a fellow student for four years and her attitude to her parents on visiting day when she realizes how out of place they really are, made me feel annoyed at first and then sad for her family. Even a glimpse into her future and attitude showed an almost irreverent attitude towards Ault Academy and her peers but an equal portion of snobbiness to the actual world around her most likely fostered by her academic history.  Most of all, though, was the fact that once I closed the book I all but forgot about Lee and this book except for writing this review.<br /><br />I rated this with a B because I did enjoy the beginning of the book. Unfortunately by the middle of the book I was eager to read<br /><br />the last about Lee and her prep school days.  I will read this author in the future because I did think the writing was good, just never warmed to Lee or her days at Ault Academy.e institutions.

A Man for Amanda continues the romantic tale of the four Calhoun sisters from Bar Harbor, Maine.  This book picks up a few months after the first title, Courting Catherine, wherein the sisters seek to find a way to preserve the home that has been in their family for over 80 years.  Now the on eve of Catherine's marriage to Trent, we are told the story of a second sister, Amanda.<br /><br />Amanda Calhoun works for a local hotel on Bar Harbor as the assistant manager.  Beautiful and bright, she looks forward to the time when her ancestral home, The Towers will become both home and a boutique hotel which she will manage. A rather grounded young woman she never expected to fall for the Harvard educated architect, Sloan O'Reilly, from Oklahoma who has been hired to begin the renovations on the sister's home.<br /><br />This book also continues the sister's search concerning the whereabouts of family heirlooms, a matched set of emerald earrings and necklace owned by the Calhoun women's great-grandmother, Bianca. And also answers the question as to whey there such noticeable hostility from Sloan towards another one of the sisters, Susannah when he's just met the family.<br /><br />In her usual romance style Ms. Roberts presents her readers with a good romance book which I read in a couple of hours.  Now I look forward to reading the third book in this series, For the Love of Lilah.	2005-03-27

I found a new to me author and what a find.  While I have read all of Mr. Paterson's books I rarely bother to red his CO authors book if there are any because quite frankly I'm never that enamored with these books.  That said as I gulped down Honeymoon in one day, I couldn't wait to find other books by this author, purchase them and then read his first book The Up and Comer. And now that I have finished Mr. Roughan's debut novel, I can honestly say this is one of the one of the best suspense books I've read in some time.<br /><br />Phillip Randall is living the high life in Manhattan.  With a wife from a very wealthy family and a job in a prestigious law firm, Phillip seems to have it all. Even a nice affair with his friends wife. But it may be too good since somebody is out to blackmail him.  And we as readers watch as Phillip's carefully planned life begins to unravel and things go from bad to worse.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and now can't wait to read Howard<br /><br />Roughan's second book, The Promise of a Lie.  I also look forward to read ing more books by this talented author who now joins the ranks of other suspsense and or mystery writers I love which include James Patterson, Dennis Lehane James Patterson, Harlan Coben and David Rosenfelt.<br /><br />Finally I owe a big thank you to Mr. Patterson for introducing me to  Mr. Roughan. Had I not read Honeymoon I might never have found out about this author and enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed The Up and Comer.	2005-03-27

When an FBI agent is hot on her trail to prove her guilt. he finds himself unfortunately also caught in her web.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this book.  In many ways this was a return to<br />the old time Patterson writing that I have come to love over the year.  And while I was still left with some unanswered questions I still highly recommend this book.  Also, as I turned the last page it occurred to me that the word sequel was written all over this page as the main character John O'Hara is very bit as engaging as Patterson's well known character Alex Cross.<br /><br />Finally, because I so enjoyed this book I also read Howard Roughans debut book The Up and Comer and plan on reading his second book as well.  I always love finding a new to me author and if it wasn't for Honeymoon, this might not have happened.	2005-03-25

Anyone who knows me, knows that I am a sucker for books and movies set in high schools, boarding schools, prep schools and college campuses.  Among the movies and books I have enjoyed are Daddy Long Legs, Good - bye Mr. Chips by James Hilton, School Ties, Dead Poet Society and The New Girls by Beth Gutcheon.  Ass to this fact is that I also enjoy a good suspense book set at one of these educational venues like Red Leaves by Paullina Simons and The Secret History by Donna Tartt.  Considering this I really looked forward to Speak Softly, She Can Heard by Pam Lewis which I recently finished. In addition I also attended a prep school in Manhattan and am approximately the same age as the main character Carole Morgan.  But sitting here now and writing this review I must say that I still have very ambivalent feelings about this book and how to rate it.  Originally I gave this book a B but the more I think about this book, I think it was very average book and I now plan on changing my rating to a C.<br /><br />While I do think the book started off with a bang it slowly went downhill after that.  And I think one of the main reasons for this was that the main character bought a lie told to her which pretty much altered her life.  Played out among the height of the later 60's and early 70's when young people dropped out and ran away, the authordid capture those heady days when anything could and did happen.  And as one familiar with Manhattan prep schools, Pam Lewis described the young women who grew into aimless older women beautifully.  But through it all I did wonder why at some point this woman didn't speak up.  Then again there wouldn't have been a book.<br /><br />I was hoping that Speak Softly, She Can Hear would be as good as the supsense filled Red Leaves which kept me on the edge of my seat. But it didn't fuflfill this promise and in the end I didn't find too much redeeming about any of the characters or the situation presented.<br /><br />In the end if you can really suspend disbelief, you might enjoy this book. But I'm not quite sure I buy the comparison to Donna Tartt's The Secret History or titles by Particia Highsmith which a blurb by a noted author alluded to.  It might just be me but I do know that I found this character almost irritating in how she conducted her life after one disastrous evening in Stowe.  And for that matter, I couldn't even buy how she wound up going there and for the reason she did either.<br /><br />Despite my feelings for this book, though, I won't dsimiss the author entirely and most likely will read another book by this author, hoping it will be  better than this one.can really suspend disbelief, you might enjoy this book.

Once again it is similar to Nora Roberts' other romance books from series but still worth the journey and destination.<br /><br />An eligible bachelor is invited by an aunt to possibly buy the home of her four nieces.  Her nieces parents died years before in a plane crash and now the white elephant of a home is slowly becoming a burden none of them can afford.  Aunt Coco has invited Trent St. James to the house for a few days.  He is interested in possibly acquiring the property and house for his conglomerate, but Aunt Coco also has another type of merger in mind with four eligible nieces. What Trent and one of the sisters, Catherine doesn't expect though is to fall in love.<br /><br />There is also a mystery angle to this book as the sisters and Trent try to find an unbelievable and legendary emerald necklace given to their great grandmother by their great grandfather.  And as an added element to the book is a glimpse into the life and love of their great grandmother Bianca.<br /><br />Like most of Ms. Roberts romance books, I did enjoy Courting Catherine and look forward to reading the other four titles from this series.	2005-03-05

I first began reading Diane Chamberlain in 1992 with her book, Keeper of the Light.  After that title I made it my business to find and read every book she wrote and then buy all of her new books almost as soon as they are published. For some reason I saved Cypress Point which I bought at a reading featuring the author in 2002. And while Keeper of the Light and the Keeper trilogy which include Kiss River and Her Mother's Shadow will remain my favorite book, I do think I saved one of the best for last since Cypress Point was a most wonderful read.<br /><br />Cypress Point takes place in the beautiful area of Monterey, California surrounded by the cypress trees we all marvel at whether we live there or visit. And what better place than to tell the story of a medical healer and the young woman she saves at birth whose paths once again are about to cross.<br /><br />Carlynne Shire knew she was a medical healer at an early age.  And while she has always been treated special by her family her twin sister, Lisbeth, didn't possess the same gift and was virtually ignored by her mother. Growing up and treated differently, Carlynne becomes a gifted doctor while her sister only attends secretarial school.  Both sisters find love although neither of them have quite as traditional marriages as one would think.<br /><br />Then sometime later when Carlynn saves a young baby born on a commune, little does she know that in the future years later she would be asked to save this woman's best friend. Or how this birth at the commune would effect the life of her sister, herself or their husbands.<br /><br />For Joelle reaching out to the woman who saved her years before may be both a blessing and a curse if she is able to help her.  Joelle needs Carlyn to try and help heal her best friend who suffered a brain aneurysm while giving birth to a son.  But if Mara regains her abilities and life, what will happen to the love Joelle feels for Mara's husband, Liam. How the medical healer and Joelle meet after more than 30 yearsprovides readers with a wonderful novel filled with romance and a bit of a mystery.<br /><br />As the author Diane Chamberlain provides readers with in most of her books, this one really captivated me and I hated to see it end.  I highly recommend this book as well as all of Diane's books.  They are emotional stories with characters you will think about long after you finish her books.  Now that I also read Diane's latest book, The Bay at Midnight, I will be anxiously waiting for her next book to arrive on the bookshelves.rsprovides readers with a wonderful novel filled with romance and a bit of a mystery.

Andy is up to the same old things now that he's inherited 22 million dollars which was the basis for the plot of his first book Open and Shut.  Andy walks his dog Tara, spends time with his girlfriend Laurie, helps out at the Tara Foundation, a placement center for stray dogs rescued from death and occassionally represents a clinet in court.  He also spends a great deal of time with a circle of friends whose antics along with Andy kept me laughing till I was crying.<br /><br />But times are tense in the area of New Jersey where Andy lives.<br />Recently there have been three women who have been brutally murdered and there seems to be no rhyme or reason for the murders since the women are totally unrelated to one another in every way.  Then a young reporter captures the attention of the killer and is being fed information as to what has happened and will happen next.  As the police scramble to find the serial killer, a fourth woman is found brutally murdered in the same fashion and this time the killer has struck a prominent state official from New Jersey.  Almost no time goes by before an arrest is made and the person charged is the least likely suspect readers can imagine. Andy is then asked to represent the alleged murderer and as usual there is bound to be some tense moments till the murders are solved and the real murderer is brought to justice.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book as I did the other two in this series.<br />I especially love Andy's sense of humor and wit.  I highly recommend this series adn now look forward to the fourth title<br />which will be available this spring.	2005-02-18

A book calls out to you, you're hooked from the first page and you hate to see it end.  Well, this is exactly what happened to me when I recently read Railroaded by Whitfield Grant.  A debut novel in the tradition of legal thrillers, Railroaded was a terrific read from beginning to end.  And as I do with any new author I find, I can hardly wait to read Mr. Grant's next novel.<br /><br />Tony Williams is a star football player.  He is also a black man who is highly regarded not only by his teammates but by members of his community.  He is also happily married and realizes all well the many temptations put before men in his visible position.  One night, though, with a bit too much too drink, Tony winds up with a woman in his bed. In the morning, realizing what has happened and the mistake he made, he spurns the woman's attention and quickly leaves the hotel.  The woman, thought, shocked by Tony's attitude seeks revenge against him and claims he raped her during a violent evening.  The charge of rape for anybody is bad enough but the woman turns out to be the daughter of the owner of the team Tony plays for and he had no knowledge about this either.  Now the owner of the team believing his daughter seeks justice never thinking that his daughter is a liar.<br /><br />And so begins an adventurous chase and courtroom setting with Tony fighting not only for his life professionally but also literally.  First he has severely injured and then he is pursued by less than your average members of a fan club.  Helping Tony to fend off any other attacks and to clear his name are three \\"blood brothers,\\" friends of Tony's from his youth, a defense attorney and a Jamaican soldier of fortune.  But when circumstances become worse and worse and the evidence is more and more damaging, Tony can't help but think about another similar incident in his family history which proved tragic.<br /><br />This is a book which moves headlong and is one spectacular roller coaster ride. Just when you think the plot can't twist or turn anymore, it does. And if you are a reader like myself who enjoys character driven novels, this is the perfect book for you because you will so miss these characters when you close the book.<br /><br />Whitfield Grant, the author of this well conceived and crafted novel, is a name to remember.  His books are the kind, like other beloved authors I read, that once I finish them I can't wait till the next title is published. In the book Railroaded there is mention that Mr. Grant's next book, Derailed, a sequel to Railroaded will be available soon.  For sure I will be the first one to pluck it from the bookstore's shelves.  But I need to clear my calendar of everything because as soon as I begin reading this book, I won't be doing anything else.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?

The books I read most recently by John Grisham were Skipping Christmas and Bleachers.  The first title I found amusing.  But the latter title I thought was a waste of my time. And if I thought it was a waste to me, I wondered why Grisham bothered to write it.  Well, if I felt that way about Bleachers, it is nothing in comparison to the way I felt about The Broker. I will admit that its been some time since I read a Grisham book on the order of what he's been known for, but like falling off a horse and getting back on afterwards, I thought that after a couple of pages I would be on familiar territory.  To be honest, the first few chapters were OK but then it became all too clear that something was very wrong with this book.  And that was, that for a suspense book, there was little suspense.  And if I was really forthright, the book was downright boring. But since I always try to look for the good in all books I will say that one aspcet of this book did spark my interest.  It was the long walks in Bologna, Italy and a bit of information about some of the sights that at least kept my eyes on the page. But in the end, I thought that perhaps Mr. Grisham is applying as a writer for the Fodor guide books or to be a tour leader next summer.<br /><br />I don't want to reiterate what many have already said about this plot but just in case you know little about the theme I offer you this condensed version. A power broker released from jail on a presidential pardon has secrets that can't be revealed.  So at the hands of the US government, the broker is spirited away from prison by the United States governemnt and placed in Italy where he is supposed to go underground.  While news of his pardon reaches the rest of the world, those that have conceived this pardon are hopeful that somebody else will kill him before what he knows can leak out.  Naturally the broker is way too crafty for this to happen.  But by the time he catches on to what may happen to him and is being pursued by many countries, I was already wishing the book would end.  What could have been a really good book like the Robert Ludlum or John LeCarre novels, never got off the ground and when it did, it landed with a flop.  It was at best mediocre and if anybody but John Grisham tried having this published, they'd most likely have the manuscript for wallpaper. In the end I read and read and surely thought that there would be some redeeming value. But all there was, was great relief that this book was finally over and I could move on to another book.untries, I was already wishing the book would end.

Six women meet at a women's' college in the South.  When one of them dies another woman is added.  For the most part there friendships are defined by who they roomed with during college.  That and the fact that they really aren't quite that sweet, rather sassy if the truth be known.<br /><br />Spanning three decades, these women, meet twice a year to reminisce about their past lives but more importantly to share their present day secrets and adventures.  The book is told through the voices of three women.  Julia is the wife of the Governor of Alabama and mother to a disabled daughter as the book opens.  Despite that she knows better, she is highly attracted to her husband's body guard.  Corrine, who has battled depression and suicide attempts is now separated from her husband who was originally her therapist.  While she knows she's better off without him, she fears that her husband has turned their son against her also. Finally there's Lanier who never has gotten her act together despite marriage and motherhood.  When an old neighbor arrives next door to what was once her parents summer cottage, it opens her eyes to new possibilities or maybe old ones instead.  Then word reaches the other SSG's, as they refer to themselves, that one of them is in serious trouble and the others must put aside their petty differences to once again be there for a same sweet girl.<br /><br />The book initially hooked me although midway I felt it was awfully reminiscent of other books with this theme and was rather predictable.  Still I enjoyed the characters and will continue to read this author in the future.	2005-02-07

I guess Mr. Rosenfelt accommodated me even before I read his first book because as soon as I finished this book I realized there were two more which were already written featuring the main character and other characters found in the first book.<br /><br />First Degree by David Rosenfelt is the second book in what I hope will be a long series which features Andy Carpenter, a rather unconventional and unique lawyer.  But now Andy has inherited a large sum of money from his father and with little need to work for money, Andy hasn't worked in the legal profession in quite some time and has little interest in the cases which are offered to him by clients.  As he puts if he's suffering from lawyers block.<br /><br />Then word reaches him that a missing and possibly dirty cop has been found decapitated and burned beyond recognition.  Suddenly Andy is ready to go back to work.  Not quite sure why this case intrigues him, Andy also never expected his client to be released so quickly after he claimed be the murderer.  The next person who is arrested turns out to be a former policewoman who not only worked with the murdered man but knew just how dirty and corrupt he was while for worked for the police department Hired by the former policewoman will test every skill Andy has as a lawyer and there is no option about to win since this woman who readers may remember from Open and Shut is Laurie, Andy's girlfriend.<br /><br />As the author David Rosenfelt provided for us in his first book,<br /><br />this is a roller coaster of a mystery which will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this series for those among you who enjoy procedural legal cases.  I did rate this book with a B+.	2005-01-31

And since some of these topics are somewhat controversial, the books always left me thinking about the characters and their situations.  I knew that the books I read were more recent titles by Ms. Picot and I was determined someday to read her debut book Songs of the Humpback Whale: A Novel Told in Five Voices.  When my book group recently chose this book, I was so glad that finally would make the time to read this book first published in 1992.<br /><br />After a fight with her husband, Jane Jones and their daughter Rebecca travel to Massachusetts to find Jane's brother Joley.  During this road trip we come to know more about the relationship between Jane, her husband Oliver, her brother Joley and even her father.  Not sure of how to get from San Diego to Massachusetts, Joley establishes an elaborate plan where Jane receives instructions and directions at various spots along the way.  And its safe to expect that at each place both Jane and Rebecca meet interesting and in some cases quirky people who only lead them to a better understanding of their past present and future.<br /><br />This book, as the subtitle indicates is told in five voices which while innovative is not executed all that well.  As we read the book we hear the voices of Jane, Oliver, Joley, Rebecca and Sam the owner of the apple orchard where Joley works.  Jane tells the story going forward from the day they left Oliver and San Diego while Rebecca tells these story going from the end backwards until their stories tales criss cross at the site of a very important in the lives of all three members of the Jones family.  This technique of going backwards in time has naturally been used before and reminded me of the movie Pulp Fiction, the Seinfeld episode when they attended a wedding in India and the recent book Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland.  But while it worked well in these venues, Songs of the Humpback Whale it didn't work that well in this book.  The first 50 pages or more were confusing till you realized how the author was presenting the time frame. And then I found the last 150 pages was much too repetitive as the various characters had very little to say which shed any new light on the story.<br /><br />Books and movies about road trips have been popular for sometime.  Just think of On the Road by Jack Kerouac and this year just think of the impact the independent film Sideways had on the viewing public. And I do enjoy books about road trips and the revelations individuals have while taking them.  Unfortunately this road trip wasn't all that exciting and in the end I don't think I cared for these characters all that much.  While I felt sad for Jane at times I didn't find he particularly likable although I wondered why.  And I also thought think there might have been actions she could have taken long before she needed to leave Oliver so abruptly but then there wouldn't have been this book.  And for some reason I couldn't help but compare the situation of the book, especially Rebecca's story, to the theme and the young woman from the book The Horse Whisperer.  In the end I wondered how much more young Rebecca could go through and what her future would be like if they returned home.<br /><br />Based on other books I read by Ms. Picoult, I was somewhat disappointed with this read.  I now think if I had read it before any of Ms. Picoult's other books, I might have enjoyed it more. One thing for sure is that it proved to me that since this book was written, Ms. Picoult has evolved into a gifted and talented writer and one I have come to cherish greatly.  I now look forward to reading her latest book Vanishing Acts which will be published this spring.  I do want to leave this review on a positive note and say that even a so so read from Ms. Picoult is still interesting and worthwhile. So if you're reading this someday you may just want to read the first published book written by Jodi Picoult.to reading her latest book Vanishing Acts which will be published this spring.

The Covenant by Naomi Ragen, which is set in Israel also flashes back to the Holocaust where four women make a pact in this case to be known in the future as a covenant. The covenant is not only to survive Auschwitz, but to help each other in the future when any one of them is in trouble. And this time each of them is called upon to help when in Israel the husband and young child of one of their granddaughter's is kidnapped by the Palestinians.  While we read about Elise Margulies, her husband and daughter, it is her elderly grandmother who recalls her days in the camps.  Through her memories we come to know Ariana, Maria and Esther.  After the war each of them continues in the their own way to right some of the wrongs of the world, but never have they banded together through even their grandchildren to save Elise's family.<br /><br />Naomi Ragen, the author of this book, has written several previous books which were also set in Israel.  Born in America she has lived in Israel for the last three decades.  It is because of Ms. Ragen's first hand knowledge of the area and issues that the events in the book are well described.  And the characters, especially the members of the covenant, will become truly inspiring to readers everywhere.  This was a compelling and interesting read with questions concerning the Mideast for which there are few answers.  I recommend this book to readers who enjoyed books like Exodus by Leon Uris and War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk.	2005-01-25

In the tradition of Harlan Coben and Nelson DeMille's characters, David Rosenfelt introduces us to Andy Carpenter, a lawyer based in New Jersey.  And be prepared because once you begin this book you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />When Andy's father, a former District Attorney, suddenly dies, Andy never expected to inherit 22 million dollars.  Neither did he expect to be seeking a new trial for a man on death row who is there after Andy's father successfully prosecuted him.  Then while Andy is going through his father's things, Andy finds a photograph which was hidden behind another photo which shows his father with three men.  The photograph which was taken in 1965 shows one man who looks vaguely familiar but the other two are unknown to him.  Now confused by the size of his inheritance and the surprising photograph while seeking a new trial for Willie Martin, Andy decides to investigate not only where the money came from but who else is in the picture.  Unfortunately for Andy though as he gets deeper and deeper into his investigation along with some colleagues, some disturbing events occur.  His home is broken into, he's assaulted in his office by a man wearing a ski mask and then a bullet meant for him mistakenly wounds somebody else, Andy begins to wonder if somehow all of these events aren't<br /><br />connected.<br /><br />This is one terrific book which I couldn't put down. It is a roller coaster of a read which although convoluted is easy enough for readers to follow and enjoy. And as improbable as it may seem, I couldn't help but think that the plot of this novel could very well have happened.<br /><br />I found this book exciting, entertaining and well written.  And the author certainly knew that readers would look forward to more books about Andy Carpenter since there are now two more titles in this series.  I can hardly wait to begin the second book, First Degree and only hope its as good as Open and Shut.  And than I will look forward to more books by David Rosenfelt either in this series or as stand alone titles.books by David Rosenfelt either in this series or as stand alone titles. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-18

From a line which ended the prologue, \\"I wish I could have stopped the most important person in my life from dying, \\" to the closing line, \\"And a part of me who will always be a boy still missing the childhood he left too quickly behind,\\" readers will be glued to the story of Dominck Pindle.<br /><br />Dominick Pindle may appear to be a normal and average 15 year old but his life is anything but normal.  Many is the night that he accompanies his mother and her friend while they go looking for Dominick's father in local bars.  But then one night trailing his father to a woman's home will set Dominick, his mother, father and this woman on a course which can only lead to tragedy.  With a rather eccentric and unhappy mother who is hiding secrets to his philandering father and missing money, we sit on the edge of pour seats as Dominick's world is about to fall apart.  And we as readers have a front row seat to how Dominck deals with the cards life handed him and a young woman who may very well save him.<br /><br />Not in a very long time have I found a young male character as engaging and as sorrowful as Dominick Pindle.  I am sure that some readers will compare him to other male teenage protagonists, perhaps even Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye.  But to me Dominck is a most unique young man whom we get to know and root for as we get closer to the end of this book.<br /><br />I found this to be a well written book with wonderfully portrayed characters and a captivating theme.  I do look forward to reading more books by this author in the future.	2005-01-16

Birds of a Feather by Jacqueline Winspear is the second book in a series featuring the detective/psychologist Maisie Dobbs.  And like the first book, simply called Maisie Dobbs, readers once again will be intrigued by both the characters in this book and the way Maisie solves the mystery.<br /><br />Birds of a Father was more mystery than the first book which was used to introduce the characters and their backgrounds.  While there was a thinly veiled mystery Birds of a Feather will surely captivate readers as the mystery angle of this book gets better and better as readers turn the pages.<br /><br />Maisie and her business associate Billy Beale are hired by Mr. Wait to find his daughter Charlotte.  Mr Wait, a wealthy store owner,  further explains that Charlotte has done this before but this time she also broke off her engagement. After meeting with one of Charlotte's friends, early leads send Maisie to a convent where Charlotte might be living and protected by the nuns.  Then Maisie learns that the friend of Charlotte's she's just spoke to had been killed and she's not the only one.  It seems as though two other friends of Charlotte and all women who wee friends at one time are now dead under very suspicious circumstances.  What did these four women have in common?  And what does a small object found next to the nurses have to do with these crimes.  Does a plaque in Mr. Waite's store to fallen men who served in WW I and worked for him hold a key to the murders, And most of all is the killer looking for Charlotte next?<br /><br />As we read this book and consider who did it, one can't help but enjoy characters from the first book which include Maurice Blanche, Maisie's mentor and former employer, Lady Rowan, the wealthy woman Maisie worked for and helped Maisie further her education, and Maisie's devoted father Frankie. There is also a poignant part devoted how Maisie along with others help her business partner finally heal from his war injuries.<br /><br />This book was a wonderful second book in what I surely hope will be a long series.  One can't help but feel they are right on the streets of London so well does the author describe the city and also the country estate of Lady Jane.  In addition there are wonderful descriptions of the clothes Maisie wears so we have a clear picture of the English fashion world in the 1930s.<br /><br />I have thoroughly enjoyed both of these books and once again must thank a friend for suggesting them to me.  Now I in turn suggest them to mystery and non-mystery readers alike.  I can't wait for the next book in this series.  Hope if to won't be too long before it is published.

Never much of a mystery reader, in the last number of years I have been introduced to two wonderful female detectives of sorts.  One was Fremont Jones, a private detective based in San Francisco at the turn of the century and the heroine of a series written by Dianne Day.  The other was Mma Ramotswe from the Alexander McCall Smith mystery series set in Botswana, Africa. While I enjoyed the mystery angles of both series, it was the women and their personalities, the geographical areas where they lived and the historical times which intrigued me so greatly. And as much as I loved these books, I remember thinking that I most likely would never find another female character from this genre who would appeal to me in quite the same way. But then I didn't know that very shortly I would meet up with the most intriguing character of all, one Maisie Dobbs from the book with the same title by Jacqueline Winspear. And as I said in the title of this review, I just know this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.<br /><br />We first meet Maisie Dobbs in 1929 when she is moving into her first office in London. A private detective, Maisie has been tutored and apprenticed by a Dr. Maurice Blanche who is highly regarded in London's social circles.<br /><br />Her first case seems rather ordinary when a man suspects his wife of cheating on him.  Following the woman in question, Maisie finds a lady mourning a childhood friend killed during W.W.I.  But more than that Maisie also uncovers a rather sinister plot involving a farmhouse used as a retreat for men unable to rejoin society.  Called the Retreat it holds the answer to why certain war heroes met untimely deaths while living at the Retreat.<br /><br />While this book is considered a misery it almost takes a back seat to the main character for as we turn the pages we learn more and more about Maisie and her circumstances. In a series of flashbacks we first meet Maisie at 13 when her mother has died and her father, a costermonger, has no money left for Maisie's education due to the medical expenses for his wife.  Maisie's father then finds a job for her as a scullery maid in the home of Lady Compton, a wealthy woman and suffragette. While working in this large London home, Maisie soon finds a wonderful library which appeals to her sense of learning.  When she is found there one night by her employer while poring over a book, Lady Compton arranges for Maisie to be tutored over a period of years, then paying for her to attend Girton, the women's school from Cambridge. But then war intervenes and the book takes a different turn as Maisie faces World War I working as a field nurse and learns about both the joys and sorrows of a first love.<br /><br />I so enjoyed this book that I literally gulped it down.  I found that Ms. Winspear offered her readers a wonderful glimpse into the world of London before, during and after W.W.I.  From the drawing rooms of the wealthy homes to the life of a young nurse, I felt as though I was in London during these times, not reading in the year 2005.  But more than anything I love learning about Maisie's life which was also laid out as a misery till the final pages revealed an important piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />I must say that I might never have read this book had it not been for the recommendation of a dear online friend. So not only do I thank Ms, Winspear for writing this book, I also thank my friend for reading this and passing along the recommendation.  And now that I've finished Maisie Dobbs I can't wait to read the second book in this series, Birds of a Feather.  I only hope that the next book will be as good as the first one.  Something tells me it will be.

How Anna finally copes and comes to the conclusion that as painful as widowhood is, life is for<br /><br />the living, will have you cheering for Anna at the end and wishing her well.<br /><br />Many years ago, the author Lynn Caine captured in her book Widow, her experience when her husbanded died leaving her with two small children.  While Ms. Cook wrote a fictcional account of widowhood, it did remind me in many ways of Ms. Caine's book.  Like the character in from Home Away from Home and the the grief stricken widow, Lynn Caine, decisions were made that others questioned.  But then who can say how one reacts to this situations.  And for both the true widow and the fictional one, everyoen around them gave advice and thought they kewn what was best for them.<br /><br />Home Away from Home is a poignant and emotional book.  It is well written and certainly opens ones eyes to what life could be like when the one you love is gone.

At first Mr. Auster doesn't even want to write the article fearing he has nothing to say, but then he's worn down and agrees to do this. One thing the author knows is he doesn't want to write<br /><br />anything sentimental. Readers should think of his thoughts as a non Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus.  When in fact he sits down to write the article, though, he has trouble actually write this unsentimental tale.  Days go by and he has nothing written on paper to show for his efforts.<br /><br />Fearing he may never write this article, Mr. Auster mentions his problem one day to the man who owns a small newspaper and cigar store in his neighborhood.  The man, Auggie Wren promises to tell him a Christmas story if he treats him to lunch.  And so over lunch the author listens to a tale which is both sentimental and poignant which asks what does a wallet, a blind woman and a camera have to do with each other.  More important than the answer which these questions raise are the more important ones like what is true, what is lying and did any or all of these events really ever happen.<br /><br />This is a warm and somewhat sentimental story, despite what the author hoped for, about the spirit of the holidays in the tradition of O. Henry's Gift of the Magi.  Consider buying this title for next Christmas.  This book is just perfect as a holiday gift and sure to be a keeper in the future.	2005-01-10

In 1975 a writer Alan Zweibel and a comedienne named Gilda Radner meet while working at Saturday Night Live. In this poignant yet very funny book, the author pays homage to a woman he worked with for over 14 years and with whom he had sort of a love story.<br /><br />Using recreated dialogues between Gilda and himself, Mr. Zweibel recounts their first meeting on the set of Saturday Night Live when Gilda asks him if he will write a scene for her where she is a parakeet.  From this opening story we then see their friendship forged as they work together, vacation together, get mad at one another and finally comfort one another over various events in their lives. Mr. Zweibel captures the essence of two young people in crazy business on the brink of great success beautifully and we revel in their friendship.  There are so many wonderful moments I will remember like when Gilda talks about her fame and Alan is overjoyed when he gets a credit card and gets another one to pay off the first one.  The when we read from the night when John Lennon dies outside of Gilda's apartment house to asking Alan to meet her new love, Gene Wilder.  And as we are laughing all too soon our joy turns to sorrow as Gilda is diagnosed with ovarian cancer ending her life too shortly at 39.<br /><br />This is a wonderful love story about two people who meet and fall in love even if isn't the same kind of conventional love story you might have expected.<br /><br />Read this book - you'll laugh, you'll cry and end the book<br /><br />Wishing we still had this talented woman still among us and especially that our sort of love story with Gilda went on forever.	2005-01-08

For whatever the reason, A Woman of Substance by Barbara Taylor Bradford, was one of those books which always eluded me.  Trying to read it on three separate occasions I never got any further  than 200 pages.  But this year when my online a book list decided to read this, I was determined to persevere or as Emma Harte, the heroine of the book said at the end, \\"To endure\\" till I finished the last page.  And finish it I did and found myself falling in love with not only the characters portrayed in this book but with the areas of England Ms. Bradford describes as well.<br /><br />There are books we all read who give us characters we will never forget.  Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Father Ralph and Meggie from The Thorn Birds, Ari Ben Canaan and Kitty from Exodus.  And to this list I now add the name Emma Harte.<br /><br />A Woman of Substance is a grand book told over close to six decades and also introduces us to the Yorkshire area of England as well as the cities of Leeds and London.  And as if that wasn't enough we come to know dear friends of Emma's like Blackie and the Kallinski family as well as enemies and rivals from the Fairley family.  We also come to know Emmas brothers Frank and Winston and her children and grandchildren.<br /><br />Emma, through great business acumen and the will to succeed, rises from a maid in a wealthy home to own a multimillion dollar enterprise.  She does this to reap revenge on her former employer and his son, two men who have little understanding of their actions and the consequences.  As Emma becomes more and more successful she finds herself marrying several men but only one does she love with all her heart.<br /><br />If you enjoyed books like The Tea Rose by Jennifer Donnelly and As the Crow Flies by Jeffrey Archer, I highly suggest you read this oldie and keeper of a book.

Sarah her good friend suggests making a wedding quilt for her but Sylvia has a better idea.  She's going to look through the attic in her family home and try to find the quilts her mother made over 50 years ago.  The book now becomes two paralleling stories with part of the story taking place at the turn of the century in New York State and the other part taking place in present day Pennsylvania.<br /><br />As we go back in time we learn about Sylvia's mother Eleanor and her family.  We also learn the reasons and occasions why Eleanor made the quilts that Sylvia is looking.  On her part Sylvia is helped by some of he coworkers using both the Internet and also visiting locations where the quilts were last seen.  But the storyline I most enjoyed was about Eleanor's nanny, Amelia, and her role in the rise of the suffragette and union movement and her role in purchasing one of Eleanor's quilts when it was being sold.<br /><br />This is the 5th book in the Elm Creek Quilts books and almost every book touches on some history of the Compson Bergstrom family in the past along with a modern day tale.  While I have enjoyed these books and the paralleling stories, this time I enjoyed Eleanor's story much more than the present day story which concerned itself with Sylvia's marriage to a widower and the disapproval of his children.  Now I look forward to the 6th book, The Master Quilter, and the new book coming out in the spring.	2004-12-28

With a bit of the wanderlust in him and at odds with his father he takes off at 20 and never looks back.  Saving a man from being killed during a barroom brawl, Trace is persuaded by the saved man to join an agency similar to the CIA where he will be employed as an undercover agent.  But now at 32, trace's friend is dead and though Trace has had his share of adventures to last him a lifetime, he is tired of running and is taking a vacation after a failed assignment.  Into his midst walks a physicist, Dr. Gillian Fitzpatrick, a fiery Irish redhead who offers him a great sum of money to find her kidnapped brother and niece.  And it didn't take long before I felt I was between the pages of a Robert Ludlum novel with the couple in Casablanca walking down narrow and winding streets filled with danger everywhere.  And if this is a Nora Roberts novel, it also doesn't take long before the young couple, first at odds with one another, are falling in love.<br /><br />While I prefer to read books without a terrorist plot since the news is enough these days, I found this book to be a fast and interesting read and quite a departure from those books I most enjoy by Ms. Roberts.  It was also a nice to finally meet up the fourth O'Hurley child even if he was the oldest.  But if Nora threw me a curve ball with part of the theme of this book, she more than made up for it with the wonderful ending where there was a poignant reconciliation between Trace, his sisters and his parents.  One thing Nora Roberts does so well is family stories and this series is no exception.  And then you might ask yourself what becomes of Gillian, and her family?<br />I guess you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Several years ago I finally read my first Nora Roberts book, Born in Fire. Since that time I am slowly making my way through all of her books.  While I have a preference for her pure romance books and family sagas like the McGregor series, I often read her romantic suspense books as well.

As I am a stickler for reading series in the order they're written, I did find after reading this book, that it can certainly be read alone.  As I said in my review of Round Robin, The Cross Country Quilters is another title which is very reminiscent of How to Make an American Quilt.<br /><br />Elm Creek Manor is now a quilt camp where primarily women from all over come to spend a week learning more about their interest in quilting.  Offering lessons in all sorts of techniques, for some the camp also provides bonding and camaraderie.  And in this book five very different women from different parts of the country meet and learn much more than quilting as they sort through their lives and in some cases eventually make life altering changes in their lives too. Pledging to meet a year later at quilt camp these women pledge to make a block for a quilt they will piece together the following year.  And the block they construct and sew will have to reflect can only be started once they begin this change.<br /><br />The end, while predictable as these people's lives fall into place, is sweet and reaffirms the power of friendship.  I enjoyed the first two books and look forward to read the others in this series.  And now I just hear that her newest book will be published in the spring of 2005.  Not only that but I just met a quilter and am thinking of trying my hand at one.  This book certainly inspired me to try something new.  As I always say a book is like a friend or interest, just waiting to be found.  And the Elm Creek Quilts books are certainly worthwhile reads which I do recommend to all who read this review.	2004-12-26

If you're reading this please don't think that the talented romance author Nora Roberts disappeared, or, I shudder at the word, retired, and is now making her comeback.  No, rather that she is back after writing less than ehr usual books in my opinion.  Series which included Jewels of the Sea, the Three Sister Island and the Key books in my opinion just weren't up to Ms. Robert's usual wonderful tales or characters found in her other trilogies.  But my opinion of her newest book is that Nora is back and better than ever.  The first book in the In the Garden trilogy, Blue Dahlia is Nora at her best and I couldn't be happier that I did read this book.<br /><br />To a grand home in Tennessee, which is also a business known as In the Garden, comes Stella and her two young sons.  Still reeling from the loss of her husband sometime before, Stella decides that a return to her roots from Michigan and living closer to her father is just what her small family needs. But what she never expected was to be so warmly taken in by her employer Roz Harper, a fiercely independent and shrewd businesswoman.  Stella proves to be an able bodied manager of Roz's business while her children adjust quickly to a househod which seems to delight in their presence. And for Stella the attention paid by a tempermental landscaper is just the tease she needs to get back into the world of dating.  Then a young pregnant woman arrives on Roz's doorstep claiming to be a distant cousin of Roz's and she is also included in the circle of these two women.<br /><br />Mixing in a legend and a hovering ghost along with a wonderful love story for Stella, I found this to be one of Nora's best books in recent years.  I highly recommend it and now look forward to reading the next book in this series as soon as it is available at the bookstores.	2004-12-26

From the first book I read by her, The Shell Seekers, to Winter Solstice the last book I still had to read, this author never fails to entrance me.  While I lover her tales set in England and Scotland and her descriptions of places I feel I know so well, it is her characters who reach out to me and set her books apart from others.  Strong and wise women like Penelope from The Shell Seekers, Violet from September, Judith from Coming Home and now Elfrida from Winter Solstice are among my very favorite characters from Ms, Pilcher's books and ones I wish I had as friends. And not only does she write about women characters one can't forget but especially in Winter Solstice, she introduces her readers to Oscar and Sam who are taken under Elfrida's very capable wings.<br /><br />The time is right before Christmas when Elfrida and Oscar, two friends travel to Scotland.  Oscar has suffered a tragedy and in addition must now find some other place to live. The house which he inherited with a cousin long ago will serve as a temporary refuge for Oscar since he knows few people in the area and hasn't been back in almost 50 years.  Neither he nor Elfrida plan on celebrating the holidays but then again they didn't expect Elfrida's cousin to join them with her teenage niece or Sam, an Englishman assigned to a new job in the area.  There are coincidences in this book, other endearing characters like the local minister, his wife and son and finally there is another inheritance from a relatively unknown person which will not only alter Oscar and Elfrida's lives but all of the main characters from this book.  Unfortunately this book went by way too quickly and as it ended I not only shed tears of happiness for the good fortunes of these characters but also because this was the last book I had left to read by Pilcher for the first time.<br /><br />I found it rather interesting that while I read all of Ms. Pilcher's older books after The Shell Seekers, the books she wrote after her large bestseller that eluded me for sometime.  Although I bought each one as soon as it was published, I couldn't seem to get into them.  I'm not sure I worried that no other large book by Ms. Pilcher could entrance me as much as The Shell Seekers or if I was simply saving these books so that I would always have something to read by Pilcher for the first time.  But this was the year that must have felt Pilcher deprived because not only did I read Winter Solstice but September<br /><br />and Coming Home as well.  Looking back on this, one Pilcher book just seemed to lead to another and who could fail to be captivated by Pilcher's world when they are in the mood to be swept away by this wonderful author.  And while I still think it will always be the first book I read by her which will be my favorite I have never read a book by Ms. Pilcher that I didn't enjoy.  Some I just enjoyed more than others.  And certainly Winter Solstice is among this group.<br /><br />If you have never read anything by this author run and either buy or borrow one of her books.  And if like me you've now read everything she's written place those books carefully upon your shelves and wait for the day when you feel a reread is a must.  I know that whether it is the winter solstice like now or a hot day in the summer, the season is always right to spend time with Rosamunde Pilcher and one of her books.ing that while I read all of Ms. Pilcher's older books after The Shell Seekers, the books she wrote after her large bestseller that eluded me for sometime.

Absence of Nectar by Kathy Hepinstall is a coming of age novel set in the early 70's in Texas.  This was a strange and distrubing novel which tells of the life of a young 12 year old and her brother who is 14.<br /><br />When their mother remarries these two  children are afraid for thier lives as their step-father becomes more and more abusive.  Parallel to this story is the tale of a young woman who has escaped from a prison and eventaully fits into the story of the two young protagonists.<br /><br />This was the third book I read by this author and while I found it a worthwhile read, I found the two previous books I read, The House of Gentlemen and Prince of Lost Places more intriguing.  Still, Hepinstall is a writer worth reading since she leaves you with a lot to think about.  I look forward to reading more books by her in the future.	2004-12-08

Both of these books left me with a desire to learn to quilt and an appreciation for my friendships, both in the present and past.<br /><br />Along with her young friend Sarah and members of the Tangled Quilters, Sylvia Compson has turned her ancestral home, Elm Creek Manor, into a camp and school for quilters.  While each member of this group work on a round robin quilt for Sylvia, each member of the group's past or present is explored. While  some of the women's lives and dillemmas are more interesting than others, this book continues to delve into the past realtionshup between Sylvia and her sister in law, Agnes Emberly who is also a quilter.<br /><br />This was a good read which was reminiscent of How to Make an American Quilt by Whitney Otto.  In Round Robin, the author presents her readers with wonderful characters who I now feel are like friends. I look forward to reading the next title, Cross Country Quilters shortly, as well as the other books in this series.  I do hope I enjoy the other books as much as the first two.	2004-12-08

For sometime now I have been hearing about graphic novels but never read any of them.  I often would see students in our high school reading Maus I and Maus II but for some reason I shied away from this type of literature.  Then while at the school library I saw The Metamorphosis and since I never read the book by Franz Kafka, I though I might begin reading graphic novels with this title.  While I'm not sure I like the concept of graphic novels which are basically black and white line drawings with words -- think sophisticated comic books, I am glad I read chose this title for my first graphic read.<br /><br />The Metamorphosis was adapted by Peter Kuper in a series of wonderful line drawings and with clever dialogue as an adaptation of the classic book by Franz Kafka.  The graphics and dialogue tell the tale of a man living with his family who wakes one morning and finds that he's a bug. The reactions of his family are a superb look at the themes of alienation, family loyalty and conformity and I finished this graphic book feeling quite sad about the fate of this young man.  it also left me in awe of how well Mr. Kuper was able to adapt this classic novel to this fairly new genre of books.  Now I am also left yearning to read the original book by Franz Kafka and other graphic novels as well.	2004-12-06

For many years I heard the name Nora Roberts touted on romance boards but never read any of her books.  Then for some reason I began collecting them and one winter's weekend picked up Born in Fire and the rest is history.  Now having read over 60 of Nora's romance and romantic suspense books, I find myself picking up one of them when I'm not quite sure what to read.  I also know that they provide me with a good comfort read and something which will make me smile at the end.  And as I tried to find a book that interested me after Thanksgiving weekend, I chose to read From This Day hoping it was the sure thing.  And as always a Nora Roberts book came to my reading rescue.<br /><br />The age old story of girl and boy, in this case a man and woman meet when a young woman is the manager of an old inn which has just been acquired by the man.  While they spar with one another neither of them can complain that they aren't physically attracted to one another.  And then as time goes on the man wears the woman down to spend more time with him while the woman weaves a spell of love and as promised in a romance novel, there is a wonderful happily ever after ending.<br /><br />I did enjoy this early romance novel by Nora Roberts published as part of the Language of Love series during the 1980s.  If you can find this title I suggest you read it and see how the queen of romances can enrapture you with her stories from the first page as she does to me time and again.	2004-12-03

You would have to be living under a rock if you're a reader not to know the name James Patterson.  While his earliest books never made a big splash with the publication of Along Came A Spider, this author burst upon the bestseller screen and hasn't been off there or the lists since the early days of Alex Cross.  And as if writing one suspense series wasn't enough, Mr. Patterson then began writing a second one which featured 4 women from different walks of life who band together to solve some real challenging murders.  Most writers would be satisfied with their career at this point, but then Mr. Patterson wrote a very popular romance novel which was quickly followed by another one this year.  And now to this ever growing list of genres, this year Mr. Paterson followed in the footsteps of other best-selling authors like John Grisham, Janet Evanovich and Fannie Flagg by writing a holiday book for children called \\"SantaKid.\\"  Once again I was curious as I've been before when Mr. Patterson wrote for a new genre that I couldn't miss the opportunity to read this book.<br /><br />When a giant corporation takes over the North Pole and the elves and Santa's job, thinking they can do it better and faster, sound familiar -- it's up to \\"SantaKid,\\" his beloved daughter to make things right.  While Santa falls into a depression at the thought of losing his job, his beloved daughter fights with the leader of the corporation to make Christmas like last year and continues to hope along with the elves that somehow they will triumph. How \\"SantaKid\\" ultimately saves Christmas that year from big business is the focal point of the book.<br /><br />This was a good read which I imagine children will enjoy.  It also serves as a good lesson concerning the real meaning of the holidays.  It should be added to other holiday books which tell a moral tale and can be read by all ages and appreciated. It is also much to Patterson's credit than he can cross over to other genres so successfully.  In addition, I also must applaud the illustrator of this book who did a wonderful job of conveying the story through pictures.  With bold colors and large figures I couldn't wait to see the next pages as the book became more alive.<br /><br />I do recommend this book and wish all a happy holiday and ho ho ho!!!!!!.

The Baudelaire children are in trouble again as readers find them tobogganing down a swift stream.  But careening to their possible deaths is nothing compared to what will happen to them when they are picked up by a submarine.  And as if that's not enough they must find their way through a grim grotto in search of a sugar bowl which has some great importance to their nemesis and possibly themselves.  Along the way they once again meet up with Count Olaf, who continues to pursue them, and his odd group of friends as they continue to search for the truth about their parents deaths and their missing friends, the Quigleys.<br /><br />This the 11th book in the series which has been as fun and intriguing as the first book, The Bad Beginning and all the others.  While series tend to drag for me and I usually give up on them midway, each new book in this series seems to be a better and better read.  And the end of this book which places the Baudelaire children where the first book began certainly has me looking forward to the next installment to find out additional clues or answers to these orphans series of unfortunate events.<br /><br />I recommend this series of books to mature children, young adults and certainly those adults who enjoy a bit of black humor and suspense.  I can hardly wait for the next book to be published but can now look forward to seeing the movie shortly.  It should be great fun to see Jim Carrey play the devilish Count Olaf.  I can't think of anybody better for this role than the man with many faces and voices.	2004-11-23

I Already Know I Love You, written by the comedian and versatile everything man, Billy Crystal, is a love letter to Crystals first grandchild -- the daughter of his daughter and Mr. Crystal's granddaughter.  In this small book Mr. Crystal speaks volumes as he describes what he plans to do with his granddaughter.  And as the author's feelings of joy gush from the pages as he explains he knew he already loved this child, the reader can't help but be caught up in these words.  This is a wonderful gift and book to read for parents, grandparents and children of all ages.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Crystal for expressing how every grandparent feels the moment they hear, \\"You're going to be a grandparent.\\"  And I bet no matter how many grandchildren people have, they always feel as though they already know they will love them too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

Today it is almost as if every author is trying to write a gooed holiday book.  And while many try, few succeed as well as Fannie Flagg does with her book, A Redbird Christmas.  Ms. Flagg does a wonderful job of not only describing the true spirit of hometown life but also how importanrt people are in our lives all year long, not only during the holidays.<br /><br />When a man from Chicago living on a government pension, is told by his doctor that he is dying, he seeks a place that will be affordable for his last days.  Moving to a small town in Alabama that his doctor recommends for the warmer climate, little does this man expect to find the people, community or even a redbird who change his life around for the better.<br /><br />A Redbird Christmas is a warm hearted and well crafted holiday book.  The characters are reminiscent of those found in Ms. Flagg's classic Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe and the setting will place you between the pages of her more recent book, Standing in the Rainbow.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as I do all of Flagg's books. They are books to be cherished and this is no exception.  It is the perfect size for a stocking stuffer which will give all readers a good time and even better journey to understanding human kindness. And the best part is the characters will stay with you long after you close the pages of the book.<br /><br />Happy holidays to all and especially to you Ms. Fannie Flagg.  Long may you continue to provide me with wonderful reads that spark my imagination about small town life in the USA.	2004-11-14

I do not read and then review books for Amazon to make an author or their publishers squirm.  Rather I am an avid reader who enjoys the time I spend reading and then reviewing books as a way of suggesting them to others.  For the most part my reviews have always been rather positive. And while I don't often speak poorly of a book, September by Bridget Marks, is most likely a book I shouldn't have taken off the library shelf and read.<br /><br />Here I must interject two comments I made about September by Bridget Marks.  One comment was I thought I would title this book for the review. \\"Move over Danielle Steel - you have competition,\\" but even Steel has written some enjoyable books. And then the other night I told my husband that this author made Jackie Collins look like Joseph Conrad. And believe me I have enjoyed Both Ms. Steel's books and Ms. Collins books at times, but I think you get my drift.<br /><br />The book begins on the morning of September 11th when a woman hears about a plane hitting the twin towers.  But this is no ordinary woman.  She is a socialite with friends in high place, the mother-in-law of a Lord and the mother of a precious son who works in the towers.  She knows everybody who is anybody and everybody knows this woman whom the author compares to Grace Kelly.  Now the author begins naming names of her<br />\\"friends\\" adn I began to wonder who were real people and who were made up by the author.<br /><br />At first the woman thinks, like many of us did, that this was a small incident but quickly the woman, as we did too, realizes this is very serious.  Commandeering a police car and policeman she manages to call Mayor Rudy Guiliani who instructs the policeman to take her downtown to look for her son amidst the total chaos.  If you're already shaking your head at how preposterous the author set up this scene, just wait, it gets better and better.  On her way downtown the woman is hit by debris and taken to St. Vincent hospital where she begins to lose consciousness and in a series of flashbacks relives her affair with a Pakistani man who turns out to be a terrorist.  This leads one to question why her daughter is described as fair like her parents and the son is dark and swarthy. The plot sickens. As the days go by the woman regains her strength, befriends the Muslim nurse who is taking care of her, learns of her son's fate and buries him.  And then in a real coup d'etat moment of the book she decides to extract revenge against the man who was her lover and manages to contact her in NY.  After 30 odd years of never writing, phoning or seeing her, her pakastani lover writes to her in NY begging her to join him at his compound in the middle east.  A compound where terroritsts are trained for future missions. And suddenly this is just the opportunity she need to gain revenge.  The woman she is off and running to the arms of her lover but it isn't quite as simple as that.<br /><br />As the book went from bad to worse, the writing isn't much better than the plot, I kept wondering why I felt compelled to read on and why I just didn't throw this book against the wall.  But read on I did and disgustedly finished this book.<br /><br />In the end I agree with the reviewer who said not to read this book.  To my mind this book was a travesty about a very serious subject.  The main character was unlike anybody I could even imagine -- a 57 year socialite who can't even shop at a supermarket without her maid, convinces the CIA and FBI that she can train for 2 weeks and kill the man who may have planned 9/11?  I'm afraid to say that this author and whoever published this book must think readers are idiots to buy into this premise.

I have read all of Shreve's books except for one and have loved her books way before Oprah made her a household author.  I also thought she was highly underrated so I was glad when Oprah selected one of Shreve's books even if it was The Pilot's Wife.  But if I felt that the theme of The Pilot's Wife wasn't deserving of a Shreve book, I felt that Light on Snow deserved better writng, certainly more emotion packed paragraphs since this book was abotu such serious subjects.  Funny but I kept turning to the front of the book to make sure I didn't make a mistake and this book was written by Shreve and not some other author.<br /><br />Basically the book tells the story or a father and his daughter while coming to terms with their own family tragedy who chance upon a newborn while wwalking near their isolated home in Vermont.  While the story is told many years later, it is the voice of the young adolescent we hear as she relates all that happens to her father and herself and to the baby girl named Charlotte.  The narrator wonders who could abandon a baby in the woods to die and where will the baby now go to grow up if her parents can't be found and where are her parents and how could they allow this to happen. And most of all she wonders if thsi baby can stay with her and he rfather and replace her little sister, Clara.  Then a young woman wanders into the father's workshop to buy a piece of furniture but becomes ill and can't leave during a snowstorm.  It is during this time that much is revealed about the young woman and her circumstances and father and daughter will have also learned a valuable lesson abotu grid, unconditional love adn forces beyongd our control which change our lives.<br /><br />Based partially on a headline case a number of years ago which Shreve fictionalized so that some may not even recognize it, I thought that this book which was somber and sad at best for some reason lacked some of Shreve's signature emotions.<br /><br />I still certainly would suggest that you read this because even a Shreve book I didn't love, is far better than som eof the other books around today.  But for me Light on Snow was a bit light and I just couldn't find that extra something which makes Anita Shreve's books almost perfect to me and a joy to read.daughter will have also learned a valuable lesson abotu grid, unconditional love adn forces beyongd our control which change our lives.   <br /> <br />Based partially on a headline case a number of years ago which Shreve fictionalized so that some may not even recognize it, I thought that this book which was somber and sad at best for some reason lacked some of Shreve's signature emotions. <br /> <br />I still certainly would suggest that you read this because even a Shreve book I didn't love, is far better than som eof the other books around today.

OK maybe its time for me to stop reading one of my favorite authors because this book really disappointed me.  Silver Bells isn't an altogether bad book if somebody else wrote it, but its certainly not Luanne Rice's finest moment. As a matter of fact I would venture to say she dashed this one off rather quickly to make it in time for the holidays.<br /><br />Yes, she weaves a rather sad story of two people who meet and help one another.  And yes she writes about a family in distress and she also resorts to the new wave of mysticasl happenigns at a pivitol moment and paves the way for some resolution to some people's problems.  So what went wrong for me.  I didn't really feel much for the characters -- they sort of were there but whereas in the past I would sink into their lives and cry with them and then be happy for them, I just found this book a sorry excuse for a holiday read.  And the premise was hard to believe - a tree grower's son runs away in Manhattan and now its Christmas time and the tree grower is back to sell his trees and find his son.  And he just happens to make friends with the woman who is harboring him?  This was such a disappointing read for me that even Rice's quasi  travelouge about Manhattan, a city I love and lived in for 24 years, left me wishing for one of her books in Black Hall or firefly beach.<br /><br />I know that in recent years many popular authors like John Grisham, Jan Karon,David Baldacci and Janet Evanovich have written small holiday  books just in time to purchase these books for gifts. And yes, while I read these books and thought they were OK, I can't say the same about Luanne Rice's attempt at her first holiday book.<br /><br />It really grieves me to write this review since for the most part I have always loved Luanne Rice's books. I'm afraid that I will approach her next title with a bit more skepticism which is sad for me and her other readers who have come to love her charters and their lives.  At best this was a rather somber book and didn't leave me with the joy or spirit of the holiday even as I closed the book.n't leave me with the joy or spirit of the holiday even as I closed the book.	2004-11-09

In recent years a new genre has emerged which I refer to as friendship or bonding books.  These are those books which chronicle the lives of four or five characters who may meet through various venues.  They may meet as college roommates or in book groups or cooking classes, writing classes, or even as tourists on a holiday or the newest place, Internet discussion groups.  Titles like Talk Before Sleep by Elizabeth Berg, Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons by Lorna Landvik, Outer Banks by Anne Rivers Siddons and Evening Class by Maeve Binchy are fine examples of these kinds of books.  And to this list I now add what I think is one of the best among them, Thursdays at Eight by Debbie Macomber.<br /><br />Four different women at four different points in their lives and four different ages meet during a journal writing class.  While the class proves to be less than worthwhile, these four women bond together and decide to meet weekly.  Thus begins these weekly meetings Thursday mornings at 8 am at Mocha Moment a popular coffee shop to continue their friendships.  And it is through these weekly meetings the four women learn more about each other, support each other through good times and bad times and ultimately learn more about themselves as well.<br /><br />Karen is a 28 year old women struggling with her desire to become an actresses and a disapproving mother.  Working as a substitute teacher seems to suit her for now as she continues to audition, but is this going to be the sum of her future?  Julia at 39 has just opened a knitting shop and with two teenagers in the house can look forward to spending more time with her husband and on herself.  But then a big surpass may change all of these plans.  Clare is in her 40's and has just been divorced from her husband who fell in love with a 20 year old.  Clare is angry and filled with hate for her former husband and can't wait till she can get some revenge.  But then she learns that life can turn on a dime and feelings can and do change.  And finally there is Liz, both the voice of reason and maturity among the four. At 57 and a widow for 6 years, Liz wonders if time is rushing by her and if she can ever find more meaning to her life now that her husband is gone.<br /><br />Through the year this book takes place, these four women<br /><br />lean on one another as they experience joy, pain, grief and profound changes in their lives.  The book is told from each woman's point of view at the beginning of each chapter as each character write their journal entry.  And then the focus shifts to the group at large as they connect with the event in each other's lives.  And perhaps one of my favorite parts of this book is the way the author chose significant quotes as chapter headings.  Some of these quotes were funny, some were poignant but all reflected events that were going to happen in this chapter.<br /><br />Thursdays at 8 is a well written book from the heart that one hates to see end.  Now, I would love to know how these four women, I think of as friends, are doing.  I think this book will appeal to any reader who treasures her friends and finds they are a wonderful antidote to what life throws our way. Most of all the women Ms. Macomber describes could be any one of us.  And in the end I couldn't help but think of the value of friendships in our lives.  I highly recommend this book and I think you will find as I did that Debbie Macomber is a writer to cherish.n and do change.

Since I have read all of her previous books I was curious about this book for sometime. It wasn't an entirely  bad book but considering how much I've loved most of her other titles, I'm almost sorry I went hunting for, found this book and then read it.<br /><br />This book does feature one of Rice's signature themes - three sisters and their realsionships within their family and other people.  In this case the three sisters are all reachign the age when marraige is possible and when the youngest marries a stuffy doctor, it is as if the otehr two are eager to also find their mates.<br /><br />While I genrally rip through a Rice title - I read Firefly Beach and Safe Harbor in a couple of hours, I foudn thsi book tedious boring and it took me several days to finally finish it.  I had a hard time believing this was a first book by an  author whose books I truly I truly love but I guess it happens.  And luckily for me, I read this book last and not first otherwise I might not have continued reading this prolific author. But this is the third Luanne Rice book in a row I read which I didn't rate that highly, the other books being Beach Girls and Dream Country but I am planning on reading Silver Bells and hopefully this holiday title will be the charm.	2004-11-09

Some are for large and extended families, others may be for a group of people who served in the armed forces or simply a group of fiends who haven't seen each other in some time.  Probably the most popular reunion is for a high school or university class years after the attendees graduated.  With this subject in mind, Barbara Rogan has written a good suspense book, Hindsight.<br /><br />In 1972, during their graduation ceremony, several friends and graduates sit on a hill and watch the proceedings.  From very different backgrounds and with very different plans for their futures, these students have boycotted the ceremonies when one of their friends wasn't allowed to attend the festivities.  Before they part company that day, they make a vow to return to the hill in 20 years precisely June, 1992.<br /><br />The years fly by and almost none of the gang have had anything to do with one another.  Willa, is now a famous author and widow with a teen age daughter.  During the winter of 1992, she is at a book signing in Manhattan when she runs into Patrick, a professor at New York University and one of the old high school gang. He has followed her writing career and expesses his sorrow at the loss of her prestigious husband. Then the talk turns to thier reunion pact and Patrick is very enthusiastic to find each memebr of the gang and spend the day in June together.  Will hires a privare detective and one by one the members are found except for bad girl, Angel Busky. Attmept are made by Willa and Patrtick to find out what happened to Angel when she disappeared the night of gradutaion but even trying to contact her father and others who knew her proves futile. It seem as though Angel just vanished into thin air.<br /><br />Then as Willa and Patrick contact their former friends, it seems as though time and distance has not been as kind to all of them. While some have achieved their goals, some habe met with frustration and disappointment and wonder if they even want ot see the old gang ever again.  And then they will need to address what happened to Angel as if they can solve this 20 year old mystery.<br /><br />As the friends do gather at Willa's house in June, not far from their meeting place, one can sense that all is not right with the group. There are already hostitlies, recriminations and a sense of evil pervading the surroundings.  And then when one  of the friends turns up dead, the others wonder if this has happened before or again.  And at the very worst, is there a killer amongst them?<br /><br />This was a good read although I felt as though the characters were caricatures of high school friends with rich, smart kids mixed in with bad, wrong side of the track students.  By the end I thought it was rather obvious what happened to Angel all those years before.  The book, which was a fast and easy read, did leave left me wondering how anybody could get away with crimes like these unless its that it makes for suspenseful  reading.  And finally I wondered why most peopel feel compelled to attend a reunion years later when they have had no desire to contact any of these old friends.<br /><br />Tom Wolfe said it best with the title of his book, You Can't Go Home Again, and maybe it's best to live in the present with memories tucked away.  Most people think twice about attending a reunion at best and after reading Hindsight you may think more than twice remembering that reunions can be deadly in more ways than one.tion and disappointment and wonder if they even want ot see the old gang ever again.

I buy all of her books as soon as they are published and place them on my keeper shelves after I read them. As much as I would like to save her new books for rainy days, I find myself gulping each book down too quickly, always regretting when the book is finished. For some reason, though, I never read Dream Country and found it calling out to me recently saying, \\"Read me, read me!\\"  While I may never regard this book as one of my very favorite Rice read, I do think that any any Rice book is worhtwhile and this is no exception.  And like most of Luanne Rice's books, Dream Country, is filled with a haunting tragedy, regrets for past actions but most of all the abiding love of parents for their children.<br /><br />Daisy, a jeweler lives in Connecticut with her 16 old daughter, Sage.  While she is content with her life and the freidnship and deotion of her sister, there is a deep void in her life which she can never replace.  As Daisy create one of a likd pices of art which represnte the strenght of realtionships, she remembers back to the raly days when she visited Wyoming.  Seeking the solitude and speactacular sights of thsi arewa, Daisy founds herself meeting and then marrying James Tucker, a rancher with a passion for the land that rivals Daisys.  family. The beautiful Wyoming land is also wonderful for Daisy's artistice bent while her love for James has few limits.  In time Daisy and James are blessed with twins, Sage and Jake.  But then tragedy strikes when the twins are 3 and while James turned his back for a fwe minutes, Jake is nowhere to be seen.  And while search parties and family and friends combed the area for months, nwo 13 years later he has never been seen or found dead.  Grief stricken Daisy eventually leaves James and the ranch with Sage for her roots on the Connecticut shore.  And it is to this area that she continues living, working and raising Sage alone.<br /><br />Time has passed and Sage is a bright girl who feels as though she is only half of a whole. Although quite young when her brother was found missing and then lost, she still remember the feeling of a family sand a sibling.  She also misses her father who refuses to leave the ranch even for a visit with Sage in case Jake is found.  Then tragdy strikes again when Daisy finds that Sage has run away from home. Wondering how she could bear it if something happened to Sage, Daisy is besides herself. But It doesn't ake too long before she realizes that Sage is with her boyfriend and most likely they are making their way to her Wyoming and her father. Unfortunately, though, Daisy doesn't know all there is to know about Sage and when her boyfriend returns and Sage continues alone, Daisy knows its time for her to stay at the ranch and wait for her arrival.  Daisy's  reunion with James, his family and finally Sage and a stanger who picked Sage up on the road will forever change their family and begin healing their difficult past. While the book is rather straight forward there is one element of surprise which even if you figure it out while reading, still has you cheering for these people at the end.<br /><br />While most of Rice's books are set in the East, this area was a new place for her and I found some of her descriptions intersting.  I also know that some reviewers complained that she didn't get things right about ranch life or Wyoming but I am in no position to comment about this since I knwo very little about either. I do know that I really enjoy when her  books are set on the Connecticut shore which feels liek home to me too.  And I also know that I continue to enjoy Luanne Rice's characters, wisdom and the satisfying resolutions of their lives at the end of her novels.<br /><br />I continue to look forward to this author's new books as well as rereading favorites like Blue Moon, Home Fires, the Firefly Beach trilogy and The Perfect Summer. This is one reader who has and will always be a most devoted fan of Luanne Rice.Home Fires, the Firefly Beach trilogy and The Perfect Summer.

Her books, which are reminiscent of Nicholas Sparks' themes, describe both the spirit and emotions of people falling in love.  In Night Train to Lisbon, her newest book, she presents her readers with two star crossed lovers at a time in the world's history which proved to be both passionate and tragic.<br /><br />In 1936, Carson Weatherell, the daughter of wealthy parents is looking forward to a suumer of leisure after her last year of school.  The young man who is fond of her is going to Yale in the fall and it is assumed that they will become engaged and married within a few years.  Carson isn't quite sure what she will do with her life and wonders if marriage is all that she can lookforward to. Coming from a sheltered society which expects nothing more from the daughter of wealthy parents to marry the right man, an opporunity presents Carson which will prove to be the adventure of a lifetime for her and those in her midst.<br /><br />Sailing to Europe meet her aunt and uncle, Carosn is going to spend the summer with them whiel talk of war is everywhere. Carson is accompanied by a chaperone but still has plenty of tiem to think about her future.  She is alomst ripe for something out of the ordinary when on a night train to Lisbon, she meets Alec Breve, a bristish physicist who is also spending part of the summer in Lisbon.  Carson and Alec are immediately attracted to each other. And they see one naother in Lisbon there love for each other grows stronger and strnger. But during this whirlwind romance, Carson is told some rather unsettling news about Alec when her uncle suggets Alec he may be someone other than the British physicist he claims to be.<br /><br />The book unfolds from here with a tale of intrigue, unconditional love and a startling revelation at the end.  It is a sentimental read which goes by much too quickly. If I had one criticism about the book it was that it wasn' tlong enough since I so enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />I hughly recommend this book and other titles by Emily Grayson which include The Gazebo, The Observatory and Waterloo Staion, also set during WWII.

If it's close to Thanksgiving, it's also the time of year when we find holiday themed books available.  And this year Debbie Macomber has written one which I predict will be a classic.  When Christmas Comes is the kind of book which will find you laughing out loud,, hugging to yourself when you finish it and hate to see end. It is also a wonderful example of a madcap adventure, the kind some of us remember from the days of Frank Capra and Billy Wilder movies.<br /><br />Emily is heartbroken when her daughter Heather who attends  Harvard tells her she's too busy with school to come home for Christmas.  Emily who lives in Leavenworth, Washington can't imagine a Christmas without Heather since its only been the two of them since her husband Pete died ten years ago.  Added to this is the fact that Leavenworth is one of those towns that does Christmas up in a big way and Emily worries that everything will remind her of her loneliness.  Deciding to surprise Heather in Cambridge, Emily finds an internet site and decides to swap her house in Washington for one in the Boston area for the holidays.<br /><br />The man Emily swaps houses with is Charles, a stuffy professor at Harvard who hates Christmas almost as much as Ebenezer Scrooge.  Working crazy hours, sometimes fogettinggn to eat or leave his office at night, Charles is often bugged by his mother who bemoans the fact that her two sons are still single. The thought of constant phone calls from his mother in Arizona asking him what he's doing for the holidays, has him searching for a place to spen Christmas elsewhere far from any festivities or social enagagements. Thinking that Leavenworth is the area of the federal prison and that Christmas won't be a be a big deal, Charles reaches Emily on the Internet and the swap is planned.  But what Charles failed to realize is that this swap is for a house in Leavenworth, Washington and not Kansas.<br /><br />What ensues when Emily arrives in Boston and Charles arrives in Leavenworth had me laughing out loud as Charles realizes he's in Christmas town USA and Emily's daughter if off to Florida with her new motorcycle riding boyfriend.  Addd to this story are two other people who change the course of thse holdiays.  First there's faith, Emily's good friend who arrives with Santa and six elves to cheer her up. And then when Charles's mother calls him and a woman answers, she insists that Charles's workaholic brother Ray travel from New York to see that Charles isn't being held captive by a gold digging woman.<br /><br />Previous to reading this book, I read Between Friends by Debbie macomber and loved both the theme and writing.  I promised msyself that I would continue to read this author. It was my lcuky day when I saw this book, grabbed for it and gulped it down.  Now I look forward to both the holidays and other good reads from an author I highly recommend.  In the tradition of John Grisham's Skipping Christmas and David  Baldacci's The Christmas Train, When Christmas Comes is a wonderful holdiay read and one which I look forward to rereading before the holidays again and again.n Leavenworth had me laughing out loud as Charles realizes he's in Christmas town USA and Emily's daughter if off to Florida with her new motorcycle riding boyfriend.

The Chisellers is the second book in a trilogy by Brendan O'Carroll which began with The Mammy.  As I found with the first book, this is a good book which continues the story of Agnes Browne and her seven children.<br /><br />When we first meet Agnes Browne she is newly widowed trying hard to take care of her children, the Chisellers of the title, and her stall in the market of the streets of Jarro.  In this book, Agnes is older, wiser and still trying hard to keep her children in school or at work.  Her oldest son is now working for an elderly man making furniture which presents the reader with a bit of a mystery while her daughter is keeping company with a local policeman.  Then there is Agnes's son who has become a hair dresser and is keeping the secret that he is gay fromthe family. The younger boys are in school where one son isn't doing well and will be expelled while another one has become a pickpocket in the local stores.  As Agnes continues selling her wares in the marketplace, she desparately misses her dear friend Marion while she continues her relationship with Pierre the owner of a pizza store.<br /><br />Life couldn't be more of a challenge for Agnes keeping everything together and calm when she receives word that the Browne clan will be relocated to a different area while renovations to the area of her flat in the Jarro is completed.  Naturally, this is quite unsettling to a woman who has never lived anywehre else and she wonders how her children will adjust.  What happens when they move and one son is gone from their midst and the days are good and then bleak fills the pages of this book with laughs and tears.<br /><br />This was a really good read and a worthy title to follow The Mammy. While reading this book, Agnes and her chislellers  become real fleshed out people that any reader feels they know well.  As I closed this book I looked forward to reading the last book in the trilogy, The Granny.	2004-10-29

An avid read about The Holocaust I began reading Songbird by Walter Zacahrius with great hopes but found myself quickly disappointed with the plot and characters.  While much of the information which the author presented has been written about before, I found this tale rather ordinary at best.<br /><br />Shortly before WWII, a Jewish family vacations in a resort where it becomes evident they may be in trouble when they return home.  Retruning home they are privy to daily insults when the father, a doctor loses his practice and eventually their home is taken over by the Germans.  When they are sent to a Ghetto their daughter and the main character of the book becomes friends with a man who is taking photos to sneak out and show the world what is happening.  From the Ghetto though they are put on to a train and are on their way to a concentration camp, when the family tries to escape. But only the daughter is successful and she is then aided by a kind elserly woman till she finds members of the Resistance who help her get to the US.  From here the book becomes rather imorobable although perhaps it could have happened as the young woman finds herself in Brooklyn with family members.  But even a love affair with a local boy can't stop her from returning to Europe where she will avenge the deaths of her family.<br /><br />Well aware of unbelivable stories and coincidences of reunions from the Holocaust, I found the beginning and then ending somewhat imprbable and tied up a bit too tidy.  Like a soap opera with a happy ending, I wasn't satisfied with what was written about happening 50 years later.  And perhaps the biggest problem I had with this book was the writing.  For a truly emotional subject I found this book severely lacking in any kind of emotion and never felt I knew the characters that well at all.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy this book more but didn't. I kept waiting till the last pages to like this book but the ending really confirmed my thoughts all along as I read this book. I think readers who are interested in fiction books about the Holocaust would be better off reading War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk, Exodus by Leon Uris and certainly Night by Elie Weisel.ghts all along as I read this book.

Although I bought The Mammy trilogy sometime ago, I didn't read the first book until an online book group selected this title as a group read earlier this year.  While reading The Mammy I learned that there was a 4th book, actually a prequel, called The Young Wan.  No sooner had I gulped down The Mammy, I rushed to read the next two books, The Chisellers and The Granny.  And since I was having such a good time with Agnes, I bought The Young Wan and unfortunately read it all too quickly. I say unfortunately because now I wish I had saved it for that time when nothing but a wonderful book will do. And while I am a stickler about reading books in order or reading a prequel first no matter how the books are published, I am so glad that I read The Young Wan last since it was the best of the four books im my opinion and ended this series beautifully.  Now I am so sad to see this book and series end and only hope that Mr. O'Carroll will write more about the Browne family in the future.<br /><br />The Young Wan begins on the eve of Agnes's marriage to Redser Browne.  Almost at once the reader realizes that not only is something wrong with Agnes's mother, Connie, but that Agnes may not be getting married in the Church after all.  And in what can only be described as the most revealing and poignant part of the series the author takes us back in time to find out more about Agnes's parents and grandparents. This portion allows us to see Agnes's mother, Connie, as the daughter of a wealthy family and a part of her father's foundry business.  We see how she meets the younger man who is to become her husband and how he eventually becomes a labor leader.  We also feel for Connie when her father disowns her when she marries against her father's wishes. We also see Agnes as a young child, as the older sister of Dolly who becomes part of a gang od burglars at a young age, as a student at a parochial school and then a merchant in the Jarro.  Parts of the book are laugh out loud funny especially when Agnes and her lifelong friend Marion are together but parts are also very tragic and sad.  Agnes grows up all too quickly taking care of her fragile mother and trying to keep her sister in school and not prison. She becomes the right hand of stall owner learnign the trade fast and a lover of rock and roll dancing where she eventually meets her husband.  But perhaps the most poignant part is the end when Agnes proves how special she is when she helps out her sister Dolly and than takes a stance backed by her mother and a priest who figures prominently in their family history.<br /><br />I must admit that after reading some rather ordinary books, I found The Young Wan was just the right book to lift me out of my book doldrums.  I so loved these characters and only wish they were part of my family or friends.  In addition, this book left with this burning desire to visit Dublin and walk the streets of the Jarro.<br /><br />If you read little else this year, please read The Young Wan and the trilogy and find out for yourselves that magic, music, laughter and tears can all be found in the Jarro and with Agnes Browne.especially when Agnes and her lifelong friend Marion are together but parts are also very tragic and sad.

The Granny by Brendan O'Carroll is the third and last book in the trilogy which began with The Mammy.  And its only fitting that in my opinion this is the best book of the three.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the girl Agnes of The Young Wan and mother and widow of The Mammy is now a grandmother but that's exactly what happens when her oldest son's wife has a baby. And while Agnes is adjusting to this endearing term, she still has her other five children to worry about. Her daughter isn't very<br /><br />happily married it appears, oen son lands in prison and anotehr one moves far away from home to puruse his dreams of being an artist.  And in a hilarious scene, Pierre, Agnes's lover attempts to adds some excitement to their love lives.<br /><br />While this is one of the sadder books in the trilogy it is true to life and has a fitting ending. Agnes is finally reunited with all of her children and grandchildren and knows that in addition to loving them, she is also loved by them.<br /><br />I hated to end this book since Agnes and her family were like mmebers of my family while I read this book.  Even now I  continue to think about them and hope they are well.  I  hope  that the author will continue to either write about Agnes's children or he will write a new book about an equally<br /><br />wonderful character as Agnes Browne.	2004-10-29

Once an avid reader of Maeve Binchy I must admit that I never did read her last three books which included Tara Road, Scarlet Feather and Quentins.  Perhaps I didn't read them because rumor had it that each book was a bit less exciting then the next one.  Or perhaps I decided to take a rest from an author I really did adore.  Whatever the reason I eagerly anticipated Binchy's newest book, Nights of Rain and Stars, and purposely didn't read anything about this book before I read it so I could form my own opinion.  Regrettably, I found this book rather disappointing from an author who I adored since I read her first book published in this country, Light a Penny Candle. And it trule grieves me to say that if Maeve Binchy's name wasn't on the cover I mighht not have finished this book.  At best by the end I thought this book was very ordinary and wondered if Binchy even wrote it.<br /><br />Nights of Rain and Stars tells the tale of four tourists to a Greek Island, Aghia Anna, who meet as they witness a tragedy.  While a boat used to showing off the area to tourists is burning in the harbbor, five people from four different countries their way up the hill to a tavern run by Andreas, a 60 year old local to the island.  Elsa, is a beautiful German woman who has left her career and lover trying to find answers to where she should go next.  Fiona, from Ireland has left with her boyfriend who her parents and friend feel is not the best man for her.  David, a quiet Englishman has left home despite that his father expects him to join his company.  And finally there's Thomas, a professor on a year long sabbatical who fears he will lose his 10 year old son's love to his ex wife's new husband.  While on the island these people are helped to understand their lives and decisions not only by each other but also by some of the local people.  Among them is Eleni who David teaches how to drive a car and Georgi, the chief of police, who finds a way to separate Fiona from her lover Sean.  But most of all these four people are helped by the wisdom and knowledge of Andreas who has a secret longing of his own and Vonni, a middle aged woman who came to the island from Ireland with her lover and has lived on the island for over 30 years.<br /><br />The book is filled with some signature qualities of writing one is accustomed to from Maeve Binchy.  Descriptions of the areaa, the climate, Greek food and music and dance fill the pages as the friends bond and ultimately make decisions which will alter their lives and lead them to new and and different futures.  The writing though is not lyrical or as intersting as in other Bindhy books. And more than anything I found these characters  rather wooden and at best the end is tied up a bit too neatly with almost everybody finding themselves in a better place than before.<br /><br />In the past Binchy has been a wonderful weaver of tales and storyteller about human conditions and the fragiel nature of life and loving.  Ultimately I feel that this book is not the best to offer by this author. I would rather suggest to those who haev love Binchy in the past to read this book fully aware that some readers didn't like this book as much as some of her other books. As for the newcomers to this author I would suggest spending time with Binchy's older books like Light a Penny Candle, The Glass Lake, Silver Wedding, Circle of Friends and The Copper Beech to see the real Maeve Binchy at work.<br /><br />While I fully expect to go back now and read the three books I missed and even reread soem favorites, I also look forward to another new Binchy book which I hope will be as good as her older titles.n.

As a baby boomer born shortly after the end of WWII, I would often ask family members who served during thr war to tell me about their experiences and ercollections.  For those who were at home I would also ask hwo the war impacted them esepcially if they were part of the war effort at home.  I therefore learned a great deal about the war from my parents, uncles, aunts, cousins and survivors of the Holocaust. As an avid reader I also found myself learning about WWII and the Holocaust through books such as The Winds of War by Herman Wouk,  The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk, Exodus by Leon Uris, Waterloo Station by Emily Grayson and Schindler's List by Thomas Keneally.  Recently the title Sentimental Journey by Jill Barnett was recommended to me and I found myself once again deep into the war in several digfferent locations.  Sentimental Journey now ranks among one of my favorite fiction books about WWII. So well does the author present her material and characters, that I am now looking foward to reading more books by this author and more about WWII as well.<br /><br />Sentimental Journey begins with a flashback and as we read we sense that the characters the author so vividly portrays will meet up with one another someday.  Stretching from the mideast to the plains of Texas to England and the skies over Eurpoe,  we meet five very special inviduals which include a blind woman held cative by the Germans, a female aviator, a Texas youth who longs to fly, an English pilot and lastly an American who finds love in the desert.  How these characters meet and influence each other's lives and survive during the war fills the pages of this book which goes by much too quickly.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the material about these five characters effotrst during the war and the glimpses into the backgrounds of these characters who remain with me still, a couple of days  since I've finished this book.  The author also cleverly used song titles from the WWII era as the chapter headings.  It was fun to hum a few bars of each song I knew as I began the chapter.  And the epilogue which tells us about the characters years after the war is a perfect ending.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book which I recommend to all.  Although there were some very sad moments in this book and some heartwenching outcomes, the book moved me as few others have done recently.  A grand tale told in a well written book. I truly hated to see this book end and know the characters and their lives will remain with me for sometime.  What more could any reader ask for from a book.  I end by urging you to read this book and see if you don't agree that Jill Barnett has written a wonderful keeper.dings.  It was fun to hum a few bars of each song I knew as I began the chapter.

And as I read the last page, I thought to myself that I can't remember the last time I read a book which was so fun filled, imaginative and enjoyable.<br /><br />As Aunt Puff and her niece Alexandra wait for Puff's old friend Minerva, I had no idea what an adventure I would take.  From cards that blow bubbles for a charade game to Minerva's cockatoo to flying fish, nothing is as it appears and anything is bound to happen.<br /><br />In the tradition of Dr. Seuss, Harry Potter, fables and folktales, David Whitewolf has crafted an excellent novel for children with an imagination, young adults who enjoy fantasy and adults with both.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by the author David Whitewolf in the future.	2004-10-24

As friends often say we get to play with our grandchildren and then they go home when they're dirty and tired.  And in the case of most grandparents, not only do they give their time and love, but also some of the best words of advice and wisdom because they have lived through so many experiences.<br /><br />But what happens when a grandchild lives far away from their grandmother and this child's mother dies when she's only 18 and the child as she grows older is bereft, alone considers suicide her only alternative. If you're an author of self-help books and a Rabbi like Jan Goldstein you might sit down and write a book with this theme and give it the title All that Matters.  And while much of this book does teach a lesson as to what really matters in life, somewhere and for some reason this book fell flat for me and I do regret it.<br /><br />Jennifer lives on the West coast while her grandmother Gabby a Holocaust survivor and widow lives on the East coast.  When Gabby's daughter and Jennifer's divorced mother dies suddenly Jennifer at 18 is left alone.  Her father five years later is remarried and the father of a second daughter. And as if her life has handed her lemons, Jennifer's boyfriend has just ended their relationship.  But after Jennifer is found on the beach in Venice, Ca with a stomach filled with pills, Jennifer learns she isn't entirely alone as her grandmother from New York journeys to Los Angeles and insists on bringing Jennifer home with her to recuperate.  Elderly and very ill Gabby is determined make Jennifer realize the gifts life presents to her each day through the stories of her survival during the Holocaust and her love for her husband.<br /><br />A somewhat sappy story of a young woman who thinks she had nothing to live with and her grandmother who is determined to show her what really matters, I thought I would love this book and why not.  I love stories about generations of a family and especially of survival during the Holocaust.  And the book is so nostalgic to me as it is sprinkled with Yiddish expression I remember my grandparents saying to me and my mother saying to our daughter.<br /><br />So what went wrong did I think as was reading this book. I thought something was missing from the first couple of pages but even now can't put my finger on exactly what was missing.  I think I felt that the young woman as sick as she might have been was portrayed as petulant, spoiled and was so unlikeable that she failed to garner much sympathy from me.  The grandmother on the other hand was a saint and offered the young woman unconditional love and wisdom as only grandparents can do. I wish I had a woman like this in my life today to hug and cherish me the way she did this for her granddaughter.  In the end I felt as though the author failed to move me to tears or even a sigh when I closed the book.  There were some rather unlikely scenes and what could have been explored and really developed just fell short all around.  Finally when the author casually pulled out the \\"I just met a guy but he really likes me and this could be the one\\" card, I really thought it was such a canned ending. I was ultimately disappointed in this book despite its wonderful cover filled with colorful leaves.  I had a hard time rating this book but in the end gave it a B because above all else I did think the theme was a good one if not the execution.<br /><br />Despite this review and considering how I have given Nicholas Sparks books countless chances to make me a lover of his writing if not themes, I will definitely read Jan Goldstein's next book hoping it will be better.ve stories about generations of a family and especially of survival during the Holocaust.

555854:US	53071190	RSP48JJAVF31A	0553587242	499659282	Beach Girls	Books	3	9	13	N	N	A Disappointing Book!	Usually when I read a Luanne Rice and especially when I review one for Amazon, I can't give it enough stars.  But I'm afraid that I found beach Girls to be one of her most disappointing books to date that I've read.  I'm not sure exactly what happened since it had all of the signature Rice themes like a young child at peril a lonely man and woman and sibling relationship, but this book failed to move me the way most Rice books have in the past.  And ironically enough I recently read Rice's last book Dance with Me which I also wasn't that enamored with that book either.<br /><br />I must admit that the first two pages which were devoted to describing the relationship between three young girls s on a beache in Connecticut had me gulping down these pages and wanting more and more.  I thought that I would find this book as entrancing as Summer Sisters by Judy Blume which was also about the friendship of two young women set initially on Cape Cod.  But as I continued to read the book, I did find that it fell apart and then flat rather quickly.<br /><br />The book opens when Jack and his young daughter Nell return to the beach where Jack's wife and Nell's mother, Emma spent some of her happiest summers with her friends, Maddie and Stevie.  The year before Emma dies in a car accident.  It turns out that Emma had married Maddie's older brother and she was driving at the time of the accident.  Nell is reeling from her beloved mother's death and while Jack is willing to spend a summer at this beach community, he harbors a dark secret about his relationship with Emma and the circumstances of Emma's death.<br /><br />On one of the first days at the beach, Nell goes in search of Stevie Moore, now a famous writer and illustrator of children's books who is thought to be the local witch of Hubbards Point, Connecticut.  But Stevie is no witch, just a lonely woman who has been married three times and is now a recluse.  When Nell finally finds Stevie, she finds not only one of her mother's best friends but a woman eager to give love and kindness to a little girl who is clearly hurting from the loss of her mother.  Stevie tends to Nell as she does so beautifully when she illustrates the birds in her books.  Nell also makes friends with Peggy whom Rice introduced to her readers in A Perfect Summer who also knows the heartbreak of losing a parent at a young age.  But when Jack meets and spends time with Stevie, he also finds himself falling under her spell and eventually in love.  How this book moves from Jack's refusal to see his sister, Nell's unhappiness, Stevie's seclusion from the world around her and finally Jack coming to terms with his secrets should have been a warm and endearing read. Instead this book turned out to be rather trite and predictable.  And if the destination was predictable, the journey along the way was rather uninteresting.<br /><br />Perhaps if I hadn't read 14 other books by Rice I might have thought this was an a rather good book. But knowing the depth and emotions I usually feel for her characters and books, I found this book to be simply an average book.  I didn't really feel too much for the characters and read through the pages without even a lump in my throat whereas at the end of her books I am usually sobbing.  In addition Ms. Rice spent a great deal more time describing the birds which Stevie drew and the beach areas rather than fully developing the characters which I didn't think too much about after I closed the book.<br /><br />A friend suggested that perhaps I had read enough Luanne Rice books and perhaps I should just remember the ones I loved.  But while this may have been a rather disappointing read for me, in no way will it signify the end of my reading Luanne Rice's books.  I will always cherish her books like Blue Moon, Home Fires, The Perfect Summer and the trilogy Firefly Beach, Safe Harbor and True Blue among others.  And titles which I recommend over and over again to people who thank me after they've read these books.  I still have two of Ms. Rice's older titles waiting to be read and not only look forward to reading these but also her new book, Silver Bells, which should be released sometime in the Fall. I just know that sometime soon Luanne Rice will write another book which will knock my socks off and be added to my list of cherished books I've read in the past.after they've read these books.

While comparisons may be made to Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, there really aren't too many similarities between these books except for the Irish brogue and working class setting.<br /><br />The Mammy is one Agnes Browne, a rercent widow and mother of 7 children.  The book opens as Agnes and her dear friend are trying to obtain death benefits from Agnes' husband.  This part of the book sets the tone for much of the book.  What should have been a very solemn part of the book, turned out to be hillariously funny. And much of this book continued throughout the pages to be outstandingly funny also.  But there were also very poignant scenes between Agnes and her childhood friend when an devestating illness strikes the friend.  And the end is just wonderful as Agnes finally realizes one of her great dreams.<br /><br />While the book focuses on Agnes' ups and downs, we watch Agnes grow stronger and stronger as she deals with her children's school problems which include one very nasty nun to thwarting the attempts of a pizza maker and Agnes' admirer.  There were some real laugh out loud parts to this book as well as those parts of the book which brought tears to my eyes. Th eaprts taken together made for a very uplifting and inspiring read.  And no better saying could be attributed to Agnes Browne and her brood then that they made lemonade out of lemons.<br /><br />I now look forward to reading the second book in the series, The Chisellers, to find out what happens next to the Browne family, most fo all what Agnes Browne is up to.<br /><br />I did rate this book with a B+.	2004-08-10

It could be any New England home, but if you look closely this home is the setting for Alice Hoffman's newest book, Blackbird House.As a long time reader of Alice Hoffman's books,  I looked forward to her latest title  with much anticipation. And now that I've read this book, I found it to be another one of Alice Hoffman's best books.<br /><br />Blackbird House is a series of interconnected short stories.  While they can surely be read one at a time, if they are read together loosely as a novel they will provide most readers with another of Ms. Hoffman's books steeped in wonderful characterizations and magic realism.  Every sense is awakened as one digests her  flowing words.  We feel her characters joys and losses, revel in her descriptions of nature and animals and hope for a good outcome for her characters lives as they unfold before our eyes.  With the house as a backdrop and one of her most endearing characters, Ms. Hoffman provides her readers with pages filled  with unusual people, magical places and events which challenge the emotions of the human heart.  So entranced was I by some of the passages and stories, I was forced to close the book for a few minutes and take deep breaths before I could go on to read more..<br /><br />As we read we come to learn of the history of Blackbird House from over 200 years ago.  We first meet the builder of the house John Hadley, a fisherman during Revolutionary times who builds the house as a monument to the endearing love he has for his wife.  When he goes off to sea with his two young sons, a blackbird, the youngest son's pet accompanies them and returns to the house now totally white after disaster strikes. This blackbird and its other white  descendants seem to hover around the house at other times during the tales as if a witness to everything which happens both to the hoseu and the people who occupy it.  In another story we meet Lysander who lost his leg to a giant halibut but finds love and courage with a woman thought to be the witch of Truro.  In turn we read story after story of succeeding families who inhabit the house.  Violet, who is betrayed by her lover, but then learns to love the local boy and gives birth to seven children eventually traveling to England to bring her orphaned grandson home.  And then we meet this grandson all grown home who meets a German Jewish survivor in Germany during WWII and bring her home to meet Violet. How these two very different women come to terms with loving the same man provides readers with a wonderful story of love and jealousy.  Finally we meet Emma, a 30 year old who rather lost after her divorce returns to her family's vacation home which she inherits from her parents.  But of all of the stories I think it was the story India which rally captivated me the most as a  young woman learns about the love her parents had for one another in a rather unusual household during the 60's.<br /><br />At one time almost every Hoffman book I read I considered a favorite.  But recently, being a bit more critical, I came up with the following list which  includes Fortune's Daughter, Practical Magic, Seventh Heaven, Green Angel and Turtle Moon. Now to this list I add  Blackbird House which takes its rightful place along with the other titles mentioned.  If you are reading this review I hope it will encourage you to read Blackbird House or at the very least some of the other titles I have loved. As I often say an even so so book by Alice Hoffman is better than most.  And while Blackbird is at times sad and overwhelming there is also much joy and lessons to be learned from within the pages of this book.eet Lysander who lost his leg to a giant halibut but finds love and courage with a woman thought to be the witch of Truro.  In turn we read story after story of succeeding families who inhabit the house.  Violet, who is betrayed by her lover, but then learns to love the local boy and gives birth to seven children eventually traveling to England to bring her orphaned grandson home.  And then we meet this grandson all grown home who meets a German Jewish survivor in Germany during WWII and bring her home to meet Violet. How these two very different women come to terms with loving the same man provides readers with a wonderful story of love and jealousy.  Finally we meet Emma, a 30 year old who rather lost after her divorce returns to her family's vacation home which she inherits from her parents.  But of all of the stories I think it was the story India which rally captivated me the most as a  young woman learns about the love her parents had for one another in a rather unusual household during the 60's. <br /> <br />At one time almost every Hoffman book I read I considered a favorite.  But recently, being a bit more critical, I came up with the following list which  includes Fortune's Daughter, Practical Magic, Seventh Heaven, Green Angel and Turtle Moon. Now to this list I add  Blackbird House which takes its rightful place along with the other titles mentioned.  If you are reading this review I hope it will encourage you to read Blackbird House or at the very least some of the other titles I have loved. As I often say an even so so book by Alice Hoffman is better than most.  And while Blackbird is at times sad and overwhelming there is also much joy and lessons to be learned from within the pages of this book. <br /> <br />	2004-08-09

On the surface was a mystery about a man who finds out he was adopted many years before and goes looking for his birth parents.  This quest leads him to a town in Oklahoma with interesting and quirky characters, a hallmark of Billie Letts previous books.  But if this was the surface the book really delves into how an act years before affects people years later and how these same people can help others to become whole again and allow them to take new chances in life.<br />Although I thought I was disappointed while I was reading this book, by the end I did realize how much I enjoyed many of the characters which included Teeve Harjo, the owner of the local pool hall, Kyle Leander, a man with a difficult past which included drugs and emotional breakdowns, Kippy, a man with Downs Syndrome who loves to fish, Ivy Harjo,  a pregnant woman who is accustomed to roaming the country, never willing to settle down but most of all Nicky Harjo, who is looking for his parents but finds families come in all sorts of packages.<br />I do advise you if you're going to read this book and have read Where the Heart Is and The Honk and Holler Opening Soon, to approach this book with an open mind.  While it isn't exactly the same as Letts' other books, there is enough here to keep any reader interested and in some parts the reason I loved her first two books also comes shining through in this one too.<br />Rating B+	2004-07-19

I first read Anne Rivers Siddons many years ago when I came upon Fox's Earth and The House Next Door, which I throughly enjoyed. While I continued to buy this authors books, it wasn't until I read Up Island that I revived my interest in reading her other books. Shortly after this I read and eually enjoyed Up Island,  Low Country and Colony which continue to be one of my all time favorite books. Then word reached me that a new book, Islands,  by this author was going to be published and I could hardly wait to buy it.  I even saved the book for a while before opening it and finally read it this past week. Early inhto the book, though, I wondered what happened to one of my favorite authors. And now that I finished the book I'm afraid to say that at this point in time Islands is my least favorite book by this author. For all of the reasons why I usually love Siddons books, her wonderful characters and poignant scenes, this book was truly disappointing.<br />Islands is the story of a group of life long friends called The Scrubs.As the book begins Anny is a 35 year old woman who meets a doctor named Lewis.  When they marry he brings her into his group of friends as its newest member. Always a nurturer, at first Anny feels rather out of place in the group but in time she becomes a solid member of the clan. She not only loves the other members but is loved by them in return. Through the years the four couples spend time together at a beach house they co own and form a family they all prefer to their own blood relatives. But then tragedies befall several of the Scrub members and the friends must weather these storms.Again they renew their vows to always there for each other. And they are as members of the group struggle with their grief, the passing of time and illnesses They seem to form a cocoon around each other which as long as they continue to be together will protecxt them from the outside world. But things aren't always as they appear and old events and resentments will cause another near tragedy and one in which the remaining members of the Scrubs will learn a very bitter lesson about their long standing friendships.<br />On the surface this should have been an endearing book about a group of people and places in and around the Charleston area. And desptie that Siddons descriptions of the area are worthwhile to read about, I had a hard time with the characters from this book. None of them ever really came alive to me and I couldn't feel too much for any of them eventhough they certainly had things happen to them which should have elicited some emotion on my part.I guess to some readers the ending was very surprising but to me it was as if Siddons changed her genre and offered her reader an ending worthy of a suspsense novel rather than a contemporary fiction novel. I almost feel as though the author  wanted to finish the book and therefore came up with a shocking conclusion.  But it made little sense to me cosnidering allthat came before and wasn't the resoltion I thought appropriate. On the plus side Siddons does a fine job of decribing the areas where these people spend their time and I did feel as though I was there when she described Anny sailing with the dog Gladys or dancing with Lewis at Booters, a friends clam bar.<br />Despite what I have written I did give this book an average rating.  I also plan on reading Peachtree Road, one of Siddons older books, in the fall with my book group.  I still consider Siddons one of my favoriter authors and chalk this book up to one title book I just didn't like. I know this happens from time to time to readers but hope this is the only book of Anne Rivers Siddons I didn't enjoy.  I know that I will continue to read her older titles I haven't read and her new books in the future.  And I will continue to recommend those books of hers which were mentioned in this review when asked about a favoties author's books.ll cause another near tragedy and one in which the remaining members of the Scrubs will learn a very bitter lesson about their long standing friendships.<br />On the surface this should have been an endearing book about a group of people and places in and around the Charleston area.

Beginning with a unique birthday celebration and lasting throughout the year we come to know the inner workings of these triplets and their desires.

While on a three week journey with his brother and last surviving member of his immediate family, the bestselling author of The Notebook and The Wedding, Nicholas Saprks and his co-atuhor Micah Sparks relate in this latest novel, Three Weeks with My Brother, the trip of a lifetime as they travel to some very exotic spots.  While describing this trip they also focuse on being raised along with their sister being raised by two rather unusual and rather eccentric parents.<br />While this book gave me some insight into Spark's themes and his motivation for writing the books that he did, I felt the parts concerning the actual trip had me thinking they were Ugly Americans considering some of their behavior as well as a rather simplistic travel journal.<br />I rated this title a bit higher than I originally thought I would because there were some very poignant moments when Nicholas wrote about the loss of his parents and younger sister, life in ahousehodo with 5 children, oen who suffers from an unconfirmed learning syndrome and the strains of traveling on book tours around the country while leaving his wife and family at home.<br />Unfortunately, I don't think this book will necessarily make me a lover of  Sparks's books anymore than I have in the past. I seem to have this love/hate relationship with most of what I've read by him but it still doesn't stop me from reading every new books he writes just to make sure of what I think.  In the final analysis I find him a rather mediocre author who appeals to the readers that he does because of his themes and not because of hsi fine writing skills, That said I am glad I read this book and despite these criticisms I did find both his and Micha's  soul searching while traveling about life and loss both inspiring and hopeful for their futures.	2004-06-05

Then when a book group I am with chose to read and discuss this book, I decided I just had to see what other readers always raved about.<br />Unfortunately I am finding that I am in the vast minority of people who have read this book since I really didn't enjoy this book all that much. I didn't find the writing particualrly good or moving and found most of the book much too wordy and  descriptive.  The moments of interest were too few for me to rate this book any higher although I do think it must have taken great effort to write this novel.<br />It may just be that historical fiction is no longer one of my genres of choice as I haven't really enjoyed the others I read this year either. But I haven't given up because during the summer I will be rereading an old cherished favorite historical fiction title, Katherine by Anya Seton.  I first read this book over 40 years ago so it should be interesting to see if this genre is no longer for me or in fact it was just the other  titles I rerad this year which I didn't enjoy. As for Follett, it may be that I much preferred his suspsense books of a number of years ago which included The Key to Rebecca and Eye of the Needle since I haven't managed to get through any of his other boosk in sometime.	2004-05-31

Harlan Coben, well known for his series featuring Myron Bolitar sports agent AKA as detective, has written four stand alone books. Previously I read the first three titles, Tell No One, Gone for Good and No Second Chance and found them somewhat remarkably similar but good and exciting reads.  His latest book Just One Look again is a roller coaster ride when a woman picks up freshly developed photos from a Photomat and events begin to spiral out of control jeopardizing her husband and family.  As in his other books, events from the past catch up with the presnt and the reader doesn't know who or what to believe as the good guys and bad guys change from minute to minute and the characters become more and more interesting.<br />As in Coben's other books, though, I found each stand alone a bit more and more convolutd and by page 300 of this one I was tired of trying to figure out what was going on.  I went with the flow and finished it up not really bothering to figure everything out to my liking.  I do think if you've never read Coben you may find this to be a very exciting book but I am getting a bit tired of his far fetched plots.  I did in the end rate it with a B since it had a few good moments but just not enough.<br />My favorite that he's written so far continues to be Gone for Good. I would certainly recommend that title as well as his first stand alone, Tell No One.	2004-05-05

On the banks of the Hudson River, Lily and Robert Brewster, sister and brother left paupers at the outset of the Depression continue to live in the white elephant house they inherited from their great uncle Horatio.  But they haven't inherited the house quite yet.  The house is known as a Grace and Favor home according to a custom once practiced in great Britain which requires that the inheritors live in the house and work in the area for 10 years to sustain themselves before they really inherit the house.<br />This is the backdrop for It Had to Be You by Jill Churchill the fifth book in the author's Grace and Favor series featuring amateur sleuths Lily and Robert Brewster.  As they have done in the previous cozy mysteries in this series, they are once again called upon to help solve a murder.  This time the murder takes place in a local nursing home when an elderly patient is smothered and where Lily and Robert are working while the home is severely understaffed.  With an interesting cast of characters the author has fashioned another charming book about the Brewsters, their unusual living arrangements and some of the other local residents chief among them the Chiefs of Police of two towns, a journalist for the local newspaper and the woman who owns the nursing home. The story does become even more interesting when a second body is found in a pond and readers wonder if the two murders are somehow related.  And who could have done these deadly deeds as the finger points to several suspects.<br />While I enjoyed this book and would suggest it to others who enjoy cozy mysteries, I do recommend beginning the series with the first book Anything Goes which remains my favorite titles of this series.  I would also suggest reading another series written by this author which features a housewife turned sleuth named Jane Jeffrey.<br />In my opinion Jill Churchill always provides her readers with a nicely spun mystery which is good reading and at times even amusing.  Once again I look forward to a new book in either of her &quot;must read&quot; series for me.fe turned sleuth named Jane Jeffrey.  <br />In my opinion Jill Churchill always provides her readers with a nicely spun mystery which is good reading and at times even amusing.

But  Philippa Gregory has taken thsi young woman and drawn a vivid picture of her, first as a young woman and then a maore matrue woman who not only suffers at the hands of Henry but then at the hands of her sister, Anne, in her quest for power.<br />Married at 12, Mary is a lady in waiting for Katherine of Aragon, wife of Henry VIII, when Henry expresses a lively interest in Mary.  Despite that Mary, now 14, already has a husband her parents, uncle and brother George are pleased at the idea that in time and if she plays her cards right she will become Henry's mistress.  And what if she gives him a son?  They can only imagine all of the good things which will come to their family if this happens, never considering what Mary's opinions or feelings are about all of this. Then Mary's sister Anne arrives from the court of France and she becomes Mary's chief advisor and confidante in the pursuit of the King's affection and love for Mary.  But outward appearances may be one thing and despite how kind Anne seems towards helping Mary, she really has her own agenda in mind concerning Henry.  Even the birth of Henry's two illegitimate children -- a daughter and son, makes no difference to Henry and in time he does spurn her for Anne.  Mary is once again relegated to being a lady in waiting when Henry divorces Katherine and Anne becomes his mistress and Queen of a very different England.<br />I often say as a reader that its not the destination that matters but the journey. In the case of The Other Boleyn Girl, I'm sure that most readers know the fate of the famous Anne Boleyn to say nothing of what becomes of her daughter Elizabeth I.  But before I read this book I knew very little about Mary Boleyn or her family in general.  Therefore I looked forward to reading this book from both a historical viewpoint as well as the fictional characterizations the author penned. Unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed in this title considering the raves I heard about from other readers.  At over 650 pages, I found this book quite repetitive and at times downright boring.  I thought early on it could have used a better editor and some pages might have been eliminated as well.  While many of the passages describing court life, the entourage of Henry's court traveling from one place to another set the stage for the book, it was the scenes between Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George which at times became most irritating.  As I read on, Anne became more and more of a shrew, being abrasive and abusive towards her silently suffering sister and at one point I wondered if I wanted to continue the book to the end. I did persevere but did think that the book could have been shorter and none of the tale would have been compromised.  In addition, despite the amount of research, there were some pretty obvious inaccuracies which took away from my reading pleasure.<br />Ultimately I did give this book a B rating based on the authors efforts in writing a book about this woman and her family and there were some parts which I really did enjoy.  Finally in closing, recently a sequel of sorts to The Other Boleyn Girl was recently published called The Queen's Fool.  As I am scheduled to read this with a book club shortly, I do hope I enjoy this title more than The Other Boleyn Girl.before I read this book I knew very little about Mary Boleyn or her family in general.

Richard Paul Evans in his newest book, A Perfect Day, has written a title which will appeal to his old and new readers alike.  Some will also recall Evans's rise to fame with the enormous popularity of his first book, The Christmas Box, which was self published for family and friends.  The book was also made into a TV movie starring Richard Thomas and Maureen O'Hara. Evans also recently chronicled the history of The Christmas Box recently in his book called The Christmas Box Miracle which for his previous readers showed a glimpse into a writer's struggle and what appears to be overnight fame.  Readers of a Perfect Day, therefore, should not be surprised if they consider that this book may not seem either coincidental or a thinly veiled autobiography when remembering back to Evan's Life.<br />Robert is a young man when he meets and marries the woman of his dreams.  early in their married life Robert works at various jobs while his wife Allyson cares for their daughter and home.  In his free time Robert pursues his dream by writing what he hopes one day will be a best-selling novel.  Success does come finally but at a bitter price when Robert finds himself on endless book tours and sending less and less time at home.  Although very lonely, Robert does respond positively to the many new people he meets. The temptation of a beautiful woman and the lure of a movie deal may threaten both his marriage and the very ideals and values he once had.  Then Robert meets a man with almost mystical qualities who not only knows all about him but also predicts his imminent death.  Who is this man and how will Robert settle his life if in fact he only has a matter of days left to him.<br />Although I did find the ending somewhat predictable, I also felt that the author provided a good journey. I also found the characters enjoyable and wondered how people who do achieve great success aren't blinded by the lights of fame and fortune.<br />While I hoped this book would be as inspirational as the titles from The Christmas Box Trilogy, I did think A Perfect Day was a good read.  Despite that a similar theme has filled countless other books notably You Can't Go Home Again and Youngblood Hawke, it did teach me once again valuable lessons about the true meaning of love and success.  As I usually do after reading Evans's newest book, I look forward to the next one.al as the titles from The Christmas Box Trilogy, I did think A Perfect Day was a good read.

In Seven Blessings the matchmakers are presented as hardworking and well intentioned women whose job it is to match people and see them married according to the laws of Moses.

September, by the beloved author of The Shell Seekers Rosamunde Pilcher, is another book in a long line by this author which most readers will enjoy thoroughly.  Set in Scotland, this book focuses on several people gathering together to celebrate the 21st birthday of a local girl.  While firmly set in the present through the use of flashbacks, we come to know these people and the events which bring them to this point in time.<br />Among the various people gathering members and friends of two well known families of the village.  Archie Balmerino is a major landowner of the area who is a Lord rather down on his income.  During a military exercise he suffered a tragedy which has altered his chance for a livelihood once he left the military as well as leaving him emotionally fragile.  Isobel his loving wife hosts tourist families during the season at their stately home while their daughter travels the continent trying to find a place for herself.  And then there is Pandora, Archie's sister who left the family home at 18, and is only now returning after 20 years to be with family and friends before it is too late.<br />The Aird family includes Violet, the 78 year old matriarch of the family and a woman reminiscent of Penelope Keeling from The Shell Seekers.

What they never expected though was the remote campsite, interesting guests and murder.<br />Fear of Frying is the 9th book in the Jane Jeffrey series which I first began reading in 1998. The series began with the recenly widowed Jane as she helps to solve the murder of a local housekeeper in Grime and Punishment and has continued with other murders and personal events. Note the clever titles based on other well known book titles.<br />For the most part I have enjoyed all of Ms. Chruchill's books and Fear of Frying is no exception. I am also in the process of reading the author's second series, the Grace and Favor series  which began with Anything Goes.<br />If you enjoy light and cozy tales of murder and mayhem, consider reading either of these series and enjoy.	2004-03-18

I know it certainly was for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />The author, an editor for a popular magazine,  challenged herself to read a book a week and offers her readers advice on among other things what to read, when to close a book and the joys of rereading a favorite book.  She also manages to weave in stories about her family, husband and child which gives the reader a better understanding as to how her reading helped her to understand the world around her. She also explains, how in some cases, reading influenced her choices in life as well.<br />While many avid readers already are familiar with what the<br />author discusses and perhaps could have also written this book, Sara Nelson is the one that did it and I appreciate her not only for taking this book odyssey but writing about it for readers everywhere. I found the book was presented in a witty and amusing fashion, sometimes even poignantly when she talks about her now decased father and Marjorie Morningstar by Herman Wouk, a real favorite of mine. In addition her suggestions are not only worthwhile but in some cases she made some books sound so wonderful I just had to add them to my to be read list.<br />I do recommend this book and if you should read it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  As I closed So Many Books, So Little Time, I couldn't help but think of a quote from CS Lewis,  &quot;I read to know I am not alone.&quot;	2004-03-04

This book, which told the story of the author's diagnosis of leprosy in her 20's, also described the years she spent receiving treatment for this disease at a hospital in Carville, Georgia.  Of the many books I have read since then, few have made as much of an impression on me as this title.  When I learned about the sequel, I immediately rushed to borrow No One Must Ever Know and felt the same way about this title too.  Recently I chanced upon the book Moloka'i by Alan Brennert and recognized the name of this area in Hawaii that was a former leprosy colony. I immediately had to read this book, and while no longer an impressionable adolescent as I once was, this book again filled me with compassion and love for the people who lived and suffered from this life threatening and alienating disease.<br />In the late 19th century surrounded by the beauty of the islands of Hawaii, 7 year old Rachel Kalma lives an idyllic live surrounded by family members who adore her.  While her father travels the world for his job, Rachel listens attentively to her father's stories and hopes one day to see the places her father vividly describes to her.  Although there are some in their area who contract leprosy and are removed from the surroundings like Rachel's uncle, nobody ever thinks this disease will affect Rachel.  Then she begins to show signs of a lesion which doesn't' respond to any of he mother's ministrations or medicine from the doctors.  Eventually the authorities receive word that Rachel may have this disease and when they investigate Rachel, her families fears confirmed, she must leave her family to live among other lepers.  Separated from her family except for occasional visits by her father and the company of her afflicted uncle, Rachel must make a new life for herself surrounded by an unusual cast of loving people.  Adversity strengthens her as she comes to know the kind sister who cares for her, a fellow leper who hides a dark secret and the love of a good man whom she marries and even becomes a mother.  By the end of this book, we weep with Rachel as friends die and cheer for her when she is able to fulfill some of her dreams.  But the best part for me was that these were no longer characters in a book but people who I considered good friends, so vividly were they portrayed by the author.<br />Told over six decades, Moloka'i tells the gripping story of adversity and the triumph of the human spirit. As I neared the end of the book I couldn't help but think of how we once viewed AIDS sufferers isolating them in many of the same way lepers were also once isolated. The author has written a compelling book and one worthy to take its place among other titles on this subject like Betty Martin's books and The Samurai's Garden by Gail Tsukiyama.comes to know the kind sister who cares for her, a fellow leper who hides a dark secret and the love of a good man whom she marries and even becomes a mother.

Anybody who knows me or has read my previous reviews for Nora Roberts's books knows that for the most part I am a loyal fan of Ms. Roberts's books.  When I found out that a new trilogy was about to be published, I couldn't wait to buy the three books and read them one after the other.  Unfortunately I was tremendously disappointed in the first book, Key of Light, and imagine it will be some time before I pick up the second title, Key of Knowledge.<br />Three women with very different backgrounds are summoned to a party at a mansion.  Mallory has just been fired from her job at an art gallery while Dana's hours at a local library have been cut dramatically.  The third member of the group, Zoe, is a single mother who years to open up her own beauty salon.  Once at the house the women find they are the only guests.  And as the evening progresses they meet two rather unusual people who make each of them a proposition that may ultimately reward them with a large sum of money.  Their tasks are complicated and while they may work together to solve each puzzle, in the end they are responsible for each of their own assignments. And they must all succeed or the monetary offer will not be given to any of them.  Now these three ladies are set on a wild adventure as they must find three keys to unlock three boxes that hold three women's spirits which are locked in the boxes by an ancient curse.<br />This book, like the Three Sister Island trilogy is filled with similar element like camaraderie, loyalty, romance, an ancient curse and mystical happenings.  But unlike her other trilogies, Key of Light failed to interest me in any of the characters or care about the curse.  And while her other books had mystical and magical elements, this time these elements just seemed a bit forced and over the top at that.  At times I even wondered if somehow I was reading Stephen King novel and the authors name was a misprint. Not that I haven't liked Mr. King's works in the past but that's not what I expect to read when I choose a Nora Roberts book.<br />I have often thought and written that of all of the genres Ms. Roberts writes, it is her pure romances which captivate me the most.  Having read Key of Light, I now long for Ms. Roberts to return to writing trilogies like the Born In series or books about families like the Mackades, MacGregors or Quinn brothers.  I am sure I will read the next two books in this trilogy to see if I enjoy either Key of Knowledge or Key of Valor more.  I hope that I will be pleasantly surprised and can write a glowing review afterwards.what I expect to read when I choose a Nora Roberts book.  <br />I have often thought and written that of all of the genres Ms. Roberts writes, it is her pure romances which captivate me the most.

Another book by Nora Roberts which once again clearly shows why this author is called the Queen of Romance.<br />Set in San Francisco, the book centers around a young woman Cassidy St.John who is young and vibrant but having soem trouble establishing a career. Enter Colin Sullivan, a well known painter who finds Cassidy on the strees after she has been fired from yet another job and he is out for a walk.  realizing how beautiful she is Colin asks Cassidy to model for him assuring her he will pay her a sum of money for the sittings.  While she is initially overwhelmed by his good looks and wealth her personality begins to win him over. As the sittings take place and these two people get to know one another better, it is clear to any reader that this is more than an artistic endeavor.  Slowly Cassidy and Colin are falling in love and I imagine any reader would find as I did there was a smile on their face by the end of the book.<br />As with all romance novels there is the requisite happily ever after and readers know this.  But in the hands of a wonderful romance author like Nora Roberts, it is truly the journey which thrills her readers and the destination is the icing on the cake.	2004-01-23

I first began reading the author Dennis Lehane several years ago when an online mystery reader highly recommended the first book in his Patrick Kenzie series,A Drink Before the War.  What began then was a series of books I looked forward to and titles which never failed to garner my highest praise.  Then Dennis Lehane wrote his first stand alone, Mystic River, and I wondered what he would do for a book encore after reading this book.  Unfortunately, after reading Shutter Island, I don't think that the author wrote as powerful or masterful a book this time as his previous titles.  While the author certainly set the gloomy scene of Shutter Island and the hospital, I found the first 100 pages tedious and never felt the plot, characters nor revelations by the end improved my opinion of this book. While readers are afforded a glimpse into the world of a former war hero who is now part of the FBI, the plot was far too predictable and reminiscent of a recent movie based on the true story of John Nash.<br />Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are summoned to Shutter Island where there is a hospital for the criminally insane to search for a woman murderer who has somehow vanished. A hospital situated on an island which can be reached only by ferry, it is surrounded by turbulent waters and there is little chance of anybody escaping and surviving.  Upon their arrival the two FBI agents are met with great resentment on the part of the staff.  And while these two men find clues to where the woman may be hiding in anagrams and other devices, the two men do find it unbelivable that anybody could just vanish from this facility with no trace.  While the men continue to be stalled in every direction, things are not what they appear to be.  During a violent storm certain truths are revealed which should surprise the reader and make them think this book was as terifiic a read as Mystic River ot Gone, Baby, Gone.  But by the macabre ending, though, I was less than surprised or shocked but instead was glad to see this book end.  I'm not sure why there was no AHA ending for me but instead sheer logic had me figuring out what was going on mid - way through the book and what happened to the missing woman.<br />I looked forward to this book with such great anticipation and obviously hoped for a much better and intersting read.  That said I know I will continue to read Dennis Lehane's future books.  Even now I am waiting patiently for his next title.ead was glad to see this book end.

As a member of several book groups from time to time members recommend reads from the world of children's literature and young adult titles.  In the past few years I have read and loved The Giver by Lois Lowry, Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson, Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt and The Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot.  When I learned that a movie based on Holes bu Louis Sachar, starring Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Henry Winkler was in the production stage, I decided to read this well loved book first.  And once again reading this book confirmed for me that a really great read can be found in a genre we may feel is for a younger audience.<br />While on the surface Holes tells a rather simple story of how an ancient curse affects a present day tale, this book touches on more profound themes which will keep any reader turning the pages quickly.  Chief among the themes is loyalty, independence, siolation, segregation, evil vs. good and above all else, love.  Told with humor and compassion, this book takes its rightful place among other wonderful titles and in my opinion is destined to become a classic in years to come.<br />Stanley Yelnats is a young man sent to the Green Lake Detention Camp for Boys after he is accused of stealing a pair of snearker from a famous basketball player at an auction.  Stanley's mother urges Stanley to look upon this event as an opportunity to have fun since he's never been to a camp. But as Stanley will soon learn, Green Lake Camp is neither green land, a lake nor an ordinary camp.  It is instead a camp where a group of young boys are at a facility overseen by The Warden, a woman, and Mr. Sir.  All that Stanley and the others are told they must do is dig holes of a specified size under a broiling sun and report on what they find as they dig. What is never explained to them, though, is why they are digging these holes and what they are supposed to find.  We as readers, though, learn about a curse from long ago, what the boys are really looking for and a woman bandit and the man she loved and lost.  But most of all we learn how Stanley's family heritage in a tale from long ago and how it brought him to Green Lake.<br />Considered a book for young adults, the author Louis Sachar presents two paralell stories which had me gulping down the pages.  Not only do I recommend this book to younger teenage readers but also to adults who enjoy a bit of humor and poignancy.  This is a one of a kind book and I look forward to rereading it again and again.re really looking for and a woman bandit and the man she loved and lost.

For a couple of years I have been hearing about a series of Young Adult books written by Lemony Snicket.  It wasn't until I taught a 7th grade Language Arts class this year that I was introduced to the first book when one of my students encouraged me to begin reading this series by lending me the first book, The Bad Beginning.  I felt compelled to read it immediately and was happy to tell both this student and others, including teachers how much I loved the first book and couldn't wait to continue reading the series. And having just finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I did marvel at how children's and young adult books have changed over the years.  Gone are some of the very sweet stories I was used to and found them replaced with child wizards filled with angst and a group of siblings coping with being orphans as well as villains and terrible events in their young lives.<br />The blurb on the back of The Bad Beginning warns readers that the book they are holding is extremely unpleasant.  Readers are also warned that the book will reveal an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children, known as the Baudelaires.  And a sorry tale this book does tell although the reader is rooting that these children will overcome whatever befalls them.  It is a credit to the author that despite the unhappy events described there is a sense of fun and some very quick thinking on the parts of the children.<br />I did find this a fast and most enjoyable read. Particularly clever was the author's explanation of words and emotions that most children would not know.  Some of the explanations found me even laughing despite the serious nature of the Baudelaire children's dilemmas. I also marveled at how Lemony Snicket so easily puts you right into these children's world. And I particularly loved the character of each child and their own inventiveness for getting them out of trouble. And the villainous Count Olaf who quickly becomes the children's nemesis is just devilish enough to entice you to continue reading.<br />I recently finished the last book so far in the series, The Slippery Slope, and am now eagerly waiting for the next book to be published.  And as if that wasn't enough I have just learned that a movie from this series with Jude Law as Lemony Snicket and Jim Carrey as Count Olaf will be coming to the silver screen shortly.  Like other treasured series that children and adults alike can look forward to and remember, I predict the series of unfortunate events will have a long and happy future.to entice you to continue reading.<br />I recently finished the last book so far in the series, The Slippery Slope, and am now eagerly waiting for the next book to be published.

Most of the students were familiar with this book but despite that all we eager to revisit the story of a tree and a boy.  Once again we found ourselves loving every word and page and it reminded is of some valuable lessons which included friendship, loyalty, giving, receiving and most of all about love.<br />As a young boy, boy loves to pay with a neighborhood tree.  Boy swings on the branches, climbs the trees branches, plays hide and seek and often naps under the limbs.  But as boy gets older, he abandons the three although the tree never abandons the boy and misses him terribly.  At various times boy returns asking the tree for something to sell, something to use as a boat and finally as an old man boy learns that the tree has given him almost everything it has to offer, it still has one more thing to give to him.<br />I found that this was a wonderful book to discuss with my class and elicited not only good conversation but wonderful essays where the students were able to relate their own stories about giving and receiving.<br />It is always a special treat to revisit some old favorite titles. And this time was no different than other times when I read The Giving Tree as an adult. As in the past I  realized how delightful it is to find a book which can and always will appeal to me no matter how old I am in years.	2004-01-20

What can any reader say about an author who hit big with her first book Evergreen during the 1970's.  The story of a young immigrant who goes to work at the home of a wealthy family and becomes involved with the dashing son, also gave birth to several other books in a series focusing on these two eventual families.  Evergreen was also made into a television movie with Armand Assante and Lesley Anne Warren which I still enjoy watching.  To say that I loved and continue to love the book , Evergreen, is an understatement and so with each book that Belva Plain wrote I was first on line to buy a copy. But in the succeeding years her books which took place during present day and grappled with many of the ills of our society like infidelity, embezzlement and betrayal, failed to move or interest me and most likely the last book I will read by this author.<br />The story of a man that goes from rags to riches in a retail operation beginning in the early 1900's, marries the girl of his dreams and has many children and grandchildren has certainly been told before and in my opinion better in books like As the Crow Flies by Jeffery Archer and A Woman of Substance. Plain fails to deliver memorable characters or anything else of much value in this book I'm afraid to say. Despite a rather odd brother and historical events like WWI and the Depression plus a dark secret about the main character's failed to interest me more than a ho hum and ultimately led me to rate this book as low as I did.  In addition I wondered why errors like words which were never used in this time period weren't caught during editing .It was almost as if this book took place now and the author simply used the early years to create a sense of a generational novel.<br />Perhaps once cherished author lie Belva Plain should know \\"when to hold them and certainly when to fold them. I keep hoping Belva Plain' newest books will be as good as her first one.  Regrettably this may be the last time I will read one of Belva Plain's new books preferring to revisit Anna and Paul Werner in Evergreen instead.va Plain's new books preferring to revisit Anna and Paul Werner in Evergreen instead.	2004-01-19

Her books, which are generally filled with wonderful relationships, usually find me hugging her books and crying at the end of them.  But unfortunately, Secrets of Paris was a grand disappointment when I read it recently.  I certainly looked forward to reading one of Ms. Rice's earliest books but found in the end it was a grand disappointment and held very few secrets for me as a reader.  I do wonder if I had read it when I first found this author if I would have continued reading her books.  Then again, perhaps if I read this one first I might have seen her progression into the beloved author I now think about when I hear her name or see a new book by her.<br />The plot revolved around three women living and working in Paris.  Lydie is a stylist who has accompanied her husband for the year as he works on an assignment at the Louvre.  Patrice is an American woman who is married to a Parisian businessman and meets Lydie at a caf&eacute;.  Rounding out the trio is Kelly, a Filipino woman who is Patrice's maid and longs to live in the United States.  What happens between these three women as they forge a bond and try to help Kelly get to the United States should be of interest but failed to move me.<br />Although I didn't care for this book, I do recommend that anybody who loves family stories and relationship consider reading other books by Luanne Rice.  Titles like The Perfect Summer, Blue Moon Home Fires and The Firefly trilogy are top reads from her and ones which even now just thinking about put a smile on my face.	2004-01-18

Other than the Alex Cross books written by James Patterson which I've read recently, Four Blind Mice and The Big bad Wolf, I haven't been having too much success with his stand alones.  I barely managed to get through The Beach House and never did finish The Jester.  Then along came The Lake House, which I did manage to finish, all the while wondering why I bothered to read this book.<br />There's an old adage that says, \\"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\\"  To this I would now add, \\"If a book is moderately OK though real quirky- DON\\"T WRITE A SEQUEL.\\"  Obviously James Patterson didn't take my advice and a sequel he did write.<br />The first book he wrote Where the Wind blows introduced us to a widowed veterinarian, an FBI agent and charming children whose only difference to other children is the wings on their backs and their ability to fly.  The very people who have scientifically engineered and altered them basically hold them prisoner in a facility.  By the end of the book, though, these children have escaped their captors and a re spending idyllic days with their rescuers - the vet and FBI man - at a secluded lake house.  And so readers were led to believe that the flying children could live in peace.<br />Several years have passed when the sequel The Lake House begins.  The children are now living unhappily with their parents after they were found and returned to their families.  Some of the children have been exploited for money like the twins who do cereal commercials while others want to return to a less stressful life at the lake house with their former guardians.  What ensues is a trial, another daring escape engineered by the children themselves and a sinister doctor who is conducting unheard of transplants and is determined to find and use these children for future projects.<br />One book with this subject I was able to tolerate, two was a bit much.  While I seriously thought I'd pass on reading The Lake House, I have so enjoyed some of Patterson's titles,<br />I thought why not give this book a chance.  And for some reason I felt compelled to read to the conclusion that turned out to be non-monumental and predictable if one could really think outside the box.<br />I do hope that Mr. Patterson in short time will write more good books about Alex Cross the Women's Murder Club.  If not I may opt not to read the stand alones and reread some of my real favorites of his like Along Came A Spider, 1st to Die and his two most recent Alex Cross books.<BR>I thought why not give this book a chance.

The Reptile Room is the second book in the increasingly popular Lemony Snicket series that is subtitled A Series of Unfortunate Events.  While not quite as good as the first book, The Bad Beginning, this book still provides reader young and old alike with a fast and enjoyable read.<br />Leaving Count Olaf behind at the end of the first book, the Baudelaire children who are orphans find themselves now at the home of another relative, Dr. Montgomery, who studies and collects reptiles.  Dr. Montgomery, who is kind and loving, to the orphans is about to embark on a fact-finding trip to Peru and plans to take the three children along with him.  Then a series of unfortunate events occur when Dr. Montgomery's assistant arrives.  Although well disguised it doesn't take too long before the children recognize him as none other than their archenemy, Count Olaf. Readers of the first book will remember Count Olaf as a villain of great proportions who the children lived with after their parent's died.  The only interest Count Olaf now has about these children is their large inheritance.  As they prepare for the trip, Dr. Montgomery is found dead in the reptile room of his home where he stores his vast collection.  Then the banker in charge of the children's money, Mr. Poe arrives but doesn't' realize that Count Olaf is once again involved in the children's lives and the doctors death. The children know the truth and once again fear for their lives.  By the end of the book Count Olaf and his one handed cohort are once again sneak away and the Baudelaire children, with the help of Mr. Poe, must once find a home for themselves.<br />I was encouraged to read this series when I taught 7th grade Language Arts this year and am so glad I began and continue to read this series.  While they these books are suggested for young adults, I do think that adults would enjoy reading these books along with their children or even by themselves.  I now look forward to continuing the series with the next book, The Wide Window.next book, The Wide Window.	2004-01-18

Like Fortune's Rocks and Sea Glass, All He Ever Wanted by Anita Shreve is a book filled with wonderful characters set against a historical background of social mores and traditions.  And as she did in he previous historical novels, the author offers her readers a wonderful novel and one that left me wishing for another book by Anita Shreve.<br />All He Ever Wanted begins during a fire when Nicholas Van Tassel, a professor at a small college in New Hampshire, spots a young woman and accompanies her home that evening.  Almost immediately Nicholas becomes besotted with the woman Ms. Etna Bliss and begins courting her.  From this point of the narrative, Shreve moves the scene to a time many years later as Nicholas recounts the story of his love for Etna on a train as he is bound for his sister's funeral in Florida.  At this point Shreve becomes almost a modern day Edith Wharton as through Nicholas we come to learn about his views of society in the early 1900's through 1930.  As readers, we watch as Nicholas becomes further obsessed with Etna, thwarts a rival for a competitive position at the college and eventually comes under scrutiny for a transgression he did many years before. And as these events are taking place we also watch as Nicholas' and Etna's relationship begins to spiral out of control and wonder how this will all be resolved.  For in the end all Nicholas ever wanted is the love of Etna.<br />I highly recommend this book to those readers who have enjoyed Anita Shreve in the past and for those who may want to read her for the first time.  The author has a wonderful ability to put her readers right between the pages of the book.  In addition the narrative evokes the language and society of the 1900's.  Shreve has done an excellent job of describing these events from the point of view of a man deeply in love and this book makes for a very worthwhile read.  I enjoyed it so much that I rated it among my ten top favorite reads for 2003.	2004-01-15

A new book by Luanne Rice is always an occasion for me to rush right out, buy the book and then wait a few weeks before I read it.  Why do I wait to read it? Perhaps its because I'm waiting for just the right mood or knowing that once I finish this book I'll have to wait a bit till Ms. Rice writes another one.  And while my wait wasn't that long this time since I recently read the Firefly trilogy which included Firefly Beach, Safe Harbor and True Blue almost back to back, The Secret Hour is Luanne Rice at her very best.  As she has accomplished in so many of her novels I loved, Ms. Rice introduces us to characters who have suffered tragedies in their family structures and find healing within themselves and through others.<br />John O'Rourke, a defense attorney and his children 14 year old Ted and 11 year old Maggie, are still reeling from the accidental death of their wife and mother Theresa.  Now two years later, John is desperately trying to save his client from the death penalty.  Isolated form his neighbors and community for representing this convicted killer, John and his family suffer greatly particularly the children who have barely begun to deal with their mother's passing.  Then one day a new woman, Kate Harris, arrives in town. The family mistakes her for a new housekeeper/babysitter whom they have been advertising for in the local papers.  But Kate has her own reason for being in Connecticut and wanting to get to know the O'Rourke family.  Thus begins a reader's journey and adventure where once again Rice's plots are filled with the themes of love between siblings, love between a man and a woman and happiness after tragedies.<br />Although not always a fan of the genre of romantic suspense, I loved this book.  I found that Rice's writing was emotional and heart rending without being sappy as characterized in books by Nicholas Sparks and others.  Her characters are well portrayed and I think about them now weeks after I finished this title.<br />While I always wait patiently for a new Luanne Rice book,this time my wait is almost over.  Her new book, Dance With Me, is due out in February and I for one can't wait.  I will purchase it immediately, put it away and read it at just the right time, which for me is almost any time.  I do hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did.always wait patiently for a new Luanne Rice book,this time my wait is almost over.

I recently read Birthright and found as Ms. Roberts has done again and again that she had me gulping down the pages till the end.  I not only found myself savoring the romance portion of the book but also was equally intrigued by the suspense, which this book provided.<br />Callie Dunbrook is an archeologist hired to work at a site where relics of an early Indian community are discovered. Expecting a certain amount of the unknown, she doesn't expect certain other events occurring at the same time.  Chief among these events is a woman who seeks her out and bears a remarkable resemblance to Callie.  In time the woman tells Callie that she thinks she is her daughter who was kidnapped many years before. And as if that wasn't enough suddenly Callie has to deal with the arrival of her ex-husband.  While they were married he all but ignored her but now seems to be very much in love with her. And then there are a series of mysterious murders that take place at the dig, which can't be explained.<br />Once again Ms. Roberts has presented well-depicted characters with a plot both suspenseful and interesting.  Touching on topics such as illegal adoptions, the rights of preservationists vs. land developers and legal issues concerning who profits from found antiquities, Birthright is another good Nora Roberts book which takes its rightful place among so many others good titles.	2004-01-12

Gail Godwin in her secretly veiled memoir has crafted a fine novel about love, compassion, loss and the human spirit to move on.<br />The title of the book Evenings at Five refers to that time of day when Christina, an author and Rudy a composer would meet for drinks.  Cocktails for this twosome are a ritual each evening at five, they even have special names for the knives they use to cut the lemons and limes.  This special hour at their home includes lively conversations about how that spent their days on their individual projects, their plans for trips and their futures together.  They never anticipated Rudy's premature death and now Christina spends her evenings at five thinking about her time spent with Rudy and her future alone.<br />While this book is poignant and very sad at times, the reader finishes the last pages content that Christina as well as Gail Godwin has had a fulfilling relationship and an amazing love.  And because of this she will be able to move on, perhaps a bit sadder,but complete in the knowledge of what they have had. And as the author intended it is a fitting book to be written by an excellent author about the man she dearly loved who did die two years ago.<br />I do recommend this book to those who love,to those who have loved and those who hope to love.  As the saying goes,&quot;'Tis better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all.&quot;  Evening at Five certainly proves this adage to be true.	2004-01-11

Or perhaps I don't speak to the right people.  I do know that reading her earlier books, The Gazebo and The Observatory provided me with good reads and lovely romance stories.  And now that I have read Waterloo Station, Grayson's latest book, I can certainly add this title to my list of books to recommend.<br />Waterloo Station takes place shortly before World War II as rumors of impending war between England and Germany fill the newspapers.  But not the news of war or her parents objections can deter the main character, Maude, and 18 year old student from crossing the Atlantic to study at Oxford.  Once there Maude falls in love with her married professor who shares the same feelings for her.  As their illicit affair continues war breaks out and Maude's lover, Stephen, joins the Royal Air Force. Refusing to return home, Maude, becomes a nurse and spends the next few years tending to wounded military men in England.  Unfortunately, a misunderstood communication from a friend about Stephen changes Maude's outward feelings for him and things change dramatically for the two main characters till the end of the book which provides the reader with a satisfying and happy conclusion.<br />Emily Grayson offers her readers a lovely novel set against the landscape of war.  Waterloo Station is filled with a sense of innocence, romanticism about war, love and loss. It is a short, worthwhile read and one I recommend wholeheartedly.	2003-12-06

One book for me was Keeper of the Light by Diane Chamberlain that was published over 11 years ago.  Imagine my surprise when it was announced earlier this year that Ms. Chamberlain was not only going to publish a sequel to Keeper of the Light but there would be a third book in the near future as well.  This news had me sorting through my keeper books to find Keeper of the Light for a quick reread.  And as soon as Kiss River was available I purchased this second book and gulped it down quickly.  While no nook of Diane Chamberlains will most likely ever supersede Keeper of the Light as my favorite read from this author, Kiss River is a very good addition to the many books I have read by Ms. Chamberlain.<br />Kiss River takes place in the same area as Keeper of the Light, the Outer Banks of North Carolina that the author describes beautifully.  The wonderful lighthouse, an integral part of the plot of Keeper of the Light has all been but destroyed and the Fresnal lens remains somewhere on the ocean floor.  To this beachfront community comes Gina Higgins, a stranger intent on finding and raising the lens for reasons known only to her.  While visiting the sight where the lighthouse once stood Gina makes the acquaintance of Lacey and Clay, a brother and sister who temporarily now occupy the home of the deceased lighthouse keeper.  Providing Gina to stay with them, She not only becomes involved in their lives but others from the area as well while trying to solve a mystery from World War II. And all the while we as readers are treated to the alternating story of Bess Poor the lighthouse keeper's daughter who at 14 fitted prominently into this mystery.<br />This is a gripping plot that does an excellent job of blending two stories set 60 years apart. How the story from 60 years ago affects the characters from the book today will have you turning the pages quickly.  This book is also filled with grand emotions that center around the love of a young woman for a man, the love of a mother for her daughter and the love of a child for her mother and grandparents.<br />I do recommend reading this book, perhaps this summer while you might be vacationing on the beach.  A word of advice, while this book can and does stand alone, I do suggest reading Keeper of the Light for the beginning of the Kiss River trilogy.  Now I eagerly look forward to the third book set at Kiss River.lled with grand emotions that center around the love of a young woman for a man, the love of a mother for her daughter and the love of a child for her mother and grandparents.<br />I do recommend reading this book, perhaps this summer while you might be vacationing on the beach.

Suddenly the careful world these parents have either created or hoped to create is falling apart and it is as if they are trapped inside a snow globe watching their carefully constructed world fall apart.  And not only are their lives and world changing but they are at the mercy of professionals who they must rely on to help them to literally help their child.  There have been many books written on this subject but nowhere is the horror of this situation any greater than it is as found in  Dani Shapiro's book, Family History.  Long familiar with Shapiro's writings about families including her own memoir Slow Motion, I found this book to be a realistic look at a family going through what most parents are afraid to even think about.<br />The Jensens are a somewhat typical family. The mother Rachel is a stay at home mom while her husband, once a fine painter, now teaches a prestigious private school in Massachusetts.  Their daughter Katie, the apple of their eye, has always been a perfect child until the past summer when she attended sleep away camp and returned with all sorts of adolescent angst. Matters aren't helped any when she learns that Rachel is expecting a second child, something that none of them anticipated.  And overnight it is as if Katie becomes somebody they don't even recognize.  Almost as soon as her baby brother is born, Katie rejects him and sets into motion a tragedy that which will forever change the fabric of their family unit.  Now her parents are forced to consider removing her from their home to a facility where she can be cared for and hopefully improve her outrageous behavior.  Questioning everybody who cares for Katie as well as themselves, Rachel and her husband now must make some difficult decisions. And all the while, they are left to wonder if what is best for Katie is what has been suggested or if she wouldn't be better off at home with her loving parents.<br />I read this book filled with the horror of what I would do or have done in the same situation.  I found the book was very well written but there were times when I couldn't wait to finish it since I so empathized and sympathized with these parents even though I never experienced what they did when our child was a teenager.  At times I even dreaded reading on and wanted to cover my eyes as if I was watching a horror movie peeking out from time to time and afraid to find out what happened next.  This was not an easy read and I can't say I enjoyed it in the traditional sense that I enjoy other books. I did find this to be a most worthwhile and excellent book as these parents reached the depths of despair wondering if Katie would ever be all right and how they would also survive this together. I found this book to be well written and that it achieved its aim of presenting a family in trouble not only with their daughter but with the parents own social pressures, their own  egos and even financial worries over how they can afford the expensive treatment indicated.<br />This is the third book I've read by Dani Shapiro.  The first book I read, Playing With Fire was a careful exploration of a character's rather unconventional relationship while the second book I read, Slow Motion, was the vivid memoir of Ms. Shapiro's own somewhat unorthodox relationship during college and the years after. Each of these books deals with the psychological makeup of individuals and the larger family unit. Each book in its own way has made me wonder about my own world and left me thinking long after I finished the books.

From almost the first line of the first page of Green Angel, Alice Hoffman's newest young adult book, I was transported to this author's special world of magic realism.  Once the domain of writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende, today Alice Hoffman takes her place alongside of them.<br />A parable of September 11th, Ms. Hoffman using sparse language in a small book speaks volumes. The book centers around the emotional plight of a young girl whose parents and sister fail to return home after a day spent working in the city.  After word reaches the young girl that a catastrophe has occurred and many are lost, she goes through various stages of grief.  The young girl tries to find her way and a place for herself and encounters many events and other people shattered by a world gone mad.  One cannot help but think back to those grim days after 9/11 and remember our own feelings that ranged from shock to sorrow and even anger.  And when I finished the last page of this book I realized how well Hoffman presented this material to both young adults and adults alike.<br />There are very few authors whose writing moves me the way Alice Hoffman's does. She is a master for making her readers feel all of the emotions she captures on paper as if we are within the pages of this book.  I finished this book with a sigh and wanted to begin it all over again.  I also fully realized once again why I love to read and most of all why I love to read a book by Alice Hoffman.	2003-07-18

I have been an avid reader of Barbara Delinsky since 1984 when I first came upon her book Fingerprints.  From that time until now I have read many of Ms. Delinsky's romance and romantic suspense books and enjoyed most of them. I even spent one summer perusing the used stores and online booksellers so I that could own every book she ever wrote including those written under her pseudonyms Billie Douglass and Bonnie Drake.  I also remember being excited when Ms. Delinsky made the transition from being published in paper back to being published in hard cover. When I heard that this author's newest book Flirting with Pete would be available in the spring, I couldn't wait to read this book.  Now I must admit that while I didn't think this was one of Delinsky's better books, it is still somewhat although I doubt I would recommend it to somebody as a first book to read by this author.<br />In the prologue of Flirting with Pete, we meet Jenny Clyde, whose father has just returned from serving a prison sentence.  When Jenny's father is found a few hours later severely injured, Jenny can't be located.  The reader is left to wonder briefly as Chapter 1 begins with the introduction of Casey Unger, a psychologist and illegitimate daughter of a renowned psychotherapist Cornelius Unger.  Cornelius, known as Connie, has recently died and Casey, although never recognized as his daughter, is attending his memorial service.  After the service, Casey is approached by Connie's lawyer who tells her that if she adheres to Connie's stipulations, she will inherit Connie's Beacon Hill townhouse.  The stipulation, which includes retaining the cook and gardener is no problem for Casey to follow and she moves into the house.  Then over the course of a few days and in a most mysterious fashion, Casey comes across a series of papers titled Flirting With Pete that tells the rather sad story of a young woman.  Now Casey is faced with questions which she must find answers to like who is Pete? And who are the cook, Meg and Dan the gardener that she must retain? What is their connection to Connie and even to Casey.  And most of all where did these papers come from and why did a man who abandoned her and then ignored her for all of her life even when she followed in his professional footsteps now want her to live in his home.  Finally we ask ourselves what has happened to Jenny Clyde, where is she and how does this all relate to Casey and Connie Unger.<br />While the book was intriguing at the beginning, I was ultimately very disappointed by the end. Even the inclusion of a plot involving Casey's mother who is in a coma did little to improve the book or the premise of the mother daughter or father daughter relationship. The book is told as a story within a story as the reader finds the pages of the Flirting With Pete story interspersed between the pages of Casey's story.  I did enjoy this unique format as I have also enjoyed in Anita Shreve's book The Weight of water and Diane Chamberlains recent book, Kiss River.  But in the end there were just too many  unanswered questions for me to really enjoy this book.  As I closed the last page I was interested to know why did Connie treat Casey the way he did and most of all what happens to Meg, Dan and Casey in the future.<br />While I realize than even a favorite author may write a book loyal readers may not enjoy, I am looking forward to her next title and am comforted in the knowledge that I have many older titles of this authors still to read.  I did rate this book with a B because I it the way I did because I thought the book was well written and I did enjoy the two storylines.  But in the end I did conclude that the story was very hard to believe and would rather have reread books like Shades of Grace, Sweet Ember or Three Wishes, which are among my all time favorites of Ms. Delinsky.ho are the cook, Meg and Dan the gardener that she must retain?

The Rebbe's Army by Sue Fishkoff is an excellent exploration into the world of Hasidic Jews, specifically the Chabad Lubavitch. For over a year Fishkoff interviewed members from this group with wonderful reesults for her readers.  The account she gives tells us what motivates the Chabad Lubavitch  and also explains about their far reaching attempts to engage the greater population in their causes.  From a somewhat small group of European Jews led by Rebbe Schneerson, today the Chabad Lubavitch are all over the world engaging and encouraging others to join with them  How did they go from a rather small group to a billion dollar organization recognized by celebrities and even the White House.  These and many other questions are answered in The Rebbe's Army which I found truly fascinating.  If you have any interest in religions and especially this specific group, which has in the past been little understood, you owe it to yourself to read this book.	2003-07-15

At the time Ms. Chamberlain was an author I wasn't familiar with but one I was soon to become acquainted with not only through her books but also through an early online book group.  I also had the pleasure of meeting with Ms. Chamberlain in person on several occasions.  I can still remember vividly how I felt after I read Keeper of the Light and how I felt when I realized that a certain screen name was for the author who wrote one of my favorite books.  Now eleven years later I reread Keeper of the Light, something I seldom do, in anticipation of reading the second book in a trilogy Ms. Chamberlain wrote about the people and area known as Kiss River, located in the Outer Banks.  And as I hope my thoughts on a second reading of Keeper of the Light was that this book was just as good as the second time and I would be happy to reread it again and again.<br />Keeper of the Light begins on the Outer Banks on a winter's night in the shadow of an old and grand lighthouse when a woman is brought into a hospital with a bullet wound.  Dr. Olivia Cole, new to the area tends to the woman's wound but her injuries are too extensive and the woman dies.  Only later does Olivia find out that this woman was Annie O'Neill a stained glass artist, known to the locals as Saint Annie for her many good deeds.  What Olivia is soon to learn is that her husband Paul Macelli has a history with Annie which after her death will impact on not only Paul and Olivia's life but Annie's husband and children.  While there are many secrets at Kiss River between these two families, the key to what happened many years before and continuing to Annie's death has been held by the lighthouse keeper Mary Poor who has been like a mother to Annie all of these years.<br />As I mentioned at the beginning of this review I seldom if ever reread a book for fear that I may not enjoy the book as much the second time.

When this book was first published and I read the dust cover, I thought I would never enjoy this book.  Even raving comments about this book from other readers never encouraged me to read this book.  But this year my book group chose this title and I decided to at least give it a try.  In other words I wouldn't judge the book by the dust cover.  And now that I finally did read it I am so glad that this group chose the book and I finally did read it. From almost the first page the book invited me in and and didn't let go until the last page which I still think about.<br />House of Gentle Men by Kathy Hepinstall is a poignant, lyrical read which at times is also violent.  The plot focuses on a former husband and father who after World War II establishes a house for men who have done wrong deeds.  In this house men will seek redemption by being kind to abused women and will in turn become gentle men and gentlemen.  Then a a former soldier seeks out the house hoping to be redeemed for a deed he did several years ago in the same town. There he will meet two very different women who will forever change his life as he will change theirs lives.<br />House of Gentle Men which deals with different kinds of love,unrequited love,loyalty but most of all redemption, is riveting and thought provoking.  From the very beginning I was entranced by the character of Charlotte and the occupants of the gentle house.<br />This was a wonderful book and I do recommend it if you are looking for a poignant book with vivid characters, an interesting plot and an ending which I never saw coming and to this day wonder what really happened. I now look forward to reading Absence of Nectar and Prince of Lost Places, Hepinstall's other books which I have heard are equally as good as House of Gentle Men.  I recommend you read this book and see if you found it as wonderful as I did.	2003-04-06

German twins, a boy and a girl raisd by an abusive father, become enamored with Hitler and his views.  At the same time a Jewish Polish family's world is rocked by the war and its consequences.<br />Although there were parts which I enjoyed like the first 100 pages, the book seemed too coincidental towards the end and hardly credible. Perhaps the book attempted to tell too much of a story over several decades but by the end the book seemed to become more of a soap opera than one which informed the reader about the war and its consequences.  And while there have been unbelievable and coincidental true stories concerning WWII and  survivors on both sides, the story presented in Hearts of Fire just didn't seem plausible.Perhaps the greatest failing of this book were the last few pages which tied up several decades into the neatest and happiest ending but also left too many unanswered questions. Bottom line is that this book wasn't as good as other books which I've read on this subject specifically Exodus by Leon Uris and Winds of War and War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk.  This book was highly recommended to me and I only wished I had enjoyed it more and could have rated it higher.  Since I always seem to gravitate towards books on this subject, I really looked forward to reading this title and was unfortunately disappointed in the end.	2003-03-30

In the tradition of other historical sagas like<br />As the Crow Flies by Jeffrey Archer and A Woman of<br />Substance by Barbara Taylor Bradford, Ms. Donnelly offers<br />her readers a wonderful book set in England and the United<br />States in the late 19th century.  This novel is filled with<br />wonderful characters and interesting events.  It is an<br />excellent read for those who enjoy old fashioned historical<br />novels.<br />Rather than tell you the details of the book, I will highly recommend that you to rush to your bookstore, buy this book (you'll want to own this book for a reread) and settle down for one of those never to be forgotten books.  I only wish I could have given this book more than five stars.  And the best part is that in a recent message Ms. Donnelly informs her readers that she is in the process of writing a sequel to this grand tale.<br />Thank you Ms. Donnelly.  I never expected in my lifetime to  enjoy any book as much as I did titles like Gone With the Wind and The Thorn Birds in addition to the titles I mentioned above.  You finally did it and I can't wait to read everything you write in the future.  With that in mind, I'm off to buy A Northern Light today.	2003-03-30

Still Waters by Jennifer Lauck is the sequel to the account she wrote in her previously published book Blackbird:  A Childhood Lost and Found.  After reading Blackbird, like many other readers who were so mesmerized by the first book, I could hardly wait to learn more about the next part of Lauck's life.  While I enjoyed (if that word can be used), Blackbird, I found Still Waters even more riveting and ultimately inspiring.<br />Jennifer now 12 and orphaned for a number of years is \\"rescued\\" by her grandparents.  The years before had been very unkind to Jennifer and her older brother as they watched their mother die, their father remarry and then suddenly when he died they were left with a cruel stepmother.  Either they never told any other family members about how they were treated or nobody bothered listening because time an again they were subjected to various forms of abuse.  Blackbird leaves off as Jennifer is put on a bus, the destination of which is her grandparents home in Nevada.  As Still Waters begins one hopes that Jennifer and her brother find love and kindness with family members. But this is not to be the case.  They are once again separated with Jennifer going to leave with her paternal father's youngest sister, husband and small baby while her brother goes to live with an uncle in another state. We now see Jennifer as she begins adolescense, attends high school and begins dating young men.  We follow her as she tries to pleasee her aunt and uncle, stay out of trouble and be helpful.  But no matter what she does, she seems to always be in trouble and pay a dear price for her failings. While a Senior in high school eager to attend college Jennifer is told that there is no money for this.  That she'll simply have to go ou to work.  But Jennifer fully realizing that her aunt and uncle promised to save her money from the government almost blackmails them to give her part of the tuition.  Now she is able to move out, rent an aprtment and pay her portion of school by maintinaing all sorts of part time jobs. We watch as once again tragedy strikes her world although in spite of all that has happened to her, Jennifer sets her sights on her goals and nothing can dissuade her from reacing them. And then finally we find her at a rewarding job, finding herself in love, marrying and then giving birth to her own child.<br />Again as she did in Blackbird:A Childhood Lost and Found, Jennifer deals with emotional and physical abuse, a loss of innocence and finally a search to find out what really happened to her brother who she had little communication with over the years.<br />This is a powerful book filled with gut wrenching scenes that make you want to find Jennifer, hug her and make up to her for all the years she spent as a child mired with abusive family members.  It also raises all sorts of questions about raising your own children or family member's children if circumstances dictate this. I highly recommend reading both Blackbird and Still Waters.

A rather grim portrait of Jennifer as a child, whose mother was chronically ill for most of her young years, and then dies when Jennifer is only 6 As if life hasn't already thrown her a curve ball her father quickly remarries and Jennifer's step-mother,a rather cruel woman at best, brings her own children to the Lauck family.  And sure enough her step-mothers children amuse themsleves by tormenting Jennifer knowing that their mother will always side with them.  When her father suddenly dies, the author is left with her brother, step-mother,step sisters and step-brother. Now she is at this woman's mercy and Jennifer's childhood spins totally out of control as her step-mother is quite nasty to Jennifer and her brother, then doesn't care properly for Jennifer or her brother and finally sends her away from her brother and step-family to live and work alone in communal home situation when shes not even 12.<br />I really can't say that I enjoyed this book. To do so would make me feel as though I enjoyed sombody else's misery.  What I can say is that on several levels I appreciated the writing and gut wrenching emotions which found their way into the pages of this book.  I also think there are many questions the book raises not the least is why Jennifer and her brother didn't go to the authorites when left with their step-mother or her mother and father's family now say that thes allegations were untrue.  But then one has to wonder why the author would choose to write a book as non-fiction rather than fiction unless her story was true.  And for those who wept at the book White Oleander for the young character, Astrid, Jennifer's story will reduce you to the same tears, only more if you believe what she writes is true.  As a mother and daughter my heart broke over the childhood Jennifer missed out on.  The ordeal she went through kept me up late at night questioning why none of her family members bothered to take either of these children in when they were first orphaned. And the revelation about Jennifer's true parentage had me wondering if life could have been any harder for her than the one she lived as a child in these circumstances.<br />This was truly a a difficult book to to read but also proved to me how some people survive against all odds.  The end of the book finds Jennifer on the way to her grandparents home and one can only hope that life will be better for her in the future. What happens as Jennifer continues to grow up is chronicled in the sequel to this book Still Waters which I read shortly after Blackbird.

The Quilter's Apprentice by Jennifer Chiaverini is the first book in the Elm Creek Quilt series.  Although I have never quilted and doubt I ever will, I found the suggestion to read this book a good one.  In the tradition of Whitney Otto's book, How to Make an American Quilt and Sandra Dallas' book, The Persian Pickle Club, Jennifer Chiaverini combines a love and knowledge and quilting with the story of two memorable characters.  Best part about this book is that there are several more in the series which I now look forward to reading.<br />Sarah McClure moves to a small town in Pennsylvania when her husband takes a new job.  With no friends and no job, she agonizes over leaving her former life in a college town.  While interviewing for jobs, she is offered a job helping an older  woman cleaning and sorting through her now decased sisters home. When Sarah remarks about the beautiful quilts in the home, Sylvia Compson, who grew up in this home, offers to teach Sarah how to quilt.  What happens as Sarah learns to quilt, makes friends with other quilters in the area and learns the story and history of Elm Creek ensues is a wonderful book in which the reader is captivated by these wonderful characters and the art of quilting.<br />Jennifer Chiaverini has a real gift in explaining quilting to those who know very little as well as presenting a most intriguing story.  And as I continue to read this series, I might very well consider trying to become a quilter's apprentice.  Only wish I could find somebody like Sylvia Compson to teach me how to quilt.	2003-03-22

As an avid reader and almost always a lover of Luanne Rice's books, I never thought I would ever find another title by this author which I enjoyed as much as Blue Moon or Home Fires.  Now after reading Cloud Nine I am happy to say I have have another Rice title to add to those I loved the most.  Despite that parts of this book were fairly predictable, I found myself moved by both the story of the main characters and their joining together as they race against time.  I also found the plot had many of Rice's signature themes such as the love of a mother for her child and parent, the love of a man for a woman and a budding romance between two young people.  If critics feel that Rice's books are too sad and sappy at times, I say while this may be true at times, nobody does these emotions better.  Now I can hardly wait to read her latest book, The Secret Hour, inwardly  hoping that once again I have another title to add to my best loved books by Luanne Rice.	2003-03-22

I looked forward to the book Welcome to Heavenly Heights by Risa Miller after reading the blurbs on the back of the book.  And I fully expected to enjoy this book since it was set in Israel where I have enjoyed visting. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would and seriously doubt I will suggest it to other readers.<br />The book takes place on the West bank of Israel.  There in a volatile setting in an apartment complex known as Heavenly Heights are several American couples who have chosen to make &quot;aliyot&quot; to the promised land. Imbued with a sense of urgency to live in this land some are ill prepared for the reality of the country and their very existence.  While the men worship together and seek out jobs, it is the women who form a support group to survive their days and nights in such a viloent climate. The book seemed to me more like interwoven stories  depicting each families trials and attitudes rather than one narrative.  And while some of the characters and events were more interesting than others, ultimately I felt the book was flat and failed as a good read.<br />This book is the debut novel of Risa Miller who obviously not only has an intimate knowledge of the land but also the feelings of those who emigrate expecting one kind of life and getting something else instead.  But I am still not sure why I didn't enjoy this book more. Even now several days after I've finished the book I can't put my finger on it.  Perhaps it is the state of world affairs at this time.  Or perhaps it is the news of what life is like in Israel today which overshadowed my enjoyment of this book.  For sure Ms. Miller fully depicted the difficulties American families have making &quot;aliyot&quot; although in the end I didn't find her characters all that interesting or sympathetic.<br />That said I now ask myself if I would I read this author in the future?  I am sure I will since I found the writing was quite good, at times even beautiful. I only hope I find her characters in future novels more compelling since I enjoy character driven novels best.ly hope I find her characters in future novels more compelling since I enjoy character driven novels best.	2003-03-22

And if that isnt' enough, her grandmother also finds herself in her granddaughter's body.Part romance, part supernatural this is considered by many fans of time travel to be a classic.

Unfortunately, Perfect Match left a rather bitter taste in my mouthand will be one Picoult book I won't recommend.  This book by an authorknown for her heart wrenching and thought provoking books, in my opinion, missed its mark.  The basic story involves one tragedy compounded by another tragedy. And a main character, an assistant district attorney that added up to some predictability and rather unlikely courtroom scenes.  Even a last minute twist didn't make up for a book I could have skipped.<br />Previous to reading Perfect Match,I read Picoult's books The Pact, Keeping Faith and Plain Truth.  For those interested in reading this author, who has always impressed me before,these are worthwhile titles to read and savor.  Because I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this author in the past, I now look forward to reading some of her older titles I missed and her new book due out shortly, Second Glance.	2003-03-18

I was so sorry to see the pages almost turning themselves for a book which turned out to be a very memorable read.<br />Opal is the 20 year old unmarried mother of a five year old son named Zack.  Refusing to live with her critical and overbearing mother any longer, Rose rolls dice from a Monopoly game and decides to fill up her car according to the number which appears.  Wherever her car runs out of gas is where she is plannign on staying. And soon enough she finds herself and Zack entering Normal, Mass. Moving next door to Rose and Ned, Opal settles into hometown life spending time with her son<br />and making dolls for a toy store in town.  Rose on the other hand isn't doing much of anything.  Shrouded in grief from a tragic death five years before, Rose's feels as though she has little in her life to look forward to and ignores Opal and Zack. But when Opal needs Rose's help, Rose  manages to set aside her grief.  How these two women help each other to be there when life turns on a dime for them is the focus of this book which I really enjoyed.<br />The book packs many an emotional punch and shows readers how friends can and do become family.  Rose and Opal are two wonderful characters who I miss already and will never forget. Similar to themes explored both by Jacquelyn Mitchard and Alice Hoffman, Anne D.

Sophie and the Rising Sun by Augusta Trobaugh is an excellent book which relates the effects of a strangers entrance into a Southern community.  The year is 1939 when Mr. Oto, a Japanese man wanders into the town of Salty Creek Georgia.  Arriving by bus, Mr. Oto is quite ill and is tended to by the local doctor.  After he recovers Miss Anne, a kindly widow hires him as a gardener and offers him a place to live.  As Mr. Oto he works hard and adjusts to his new life, he also tries to put behind him the shame and circumstances that led him to Salty Creek.  One day while working, Mr. Oto sees a lovely woman walking by.  In due time he learns that this is Miss Sophie, a Southern spinster lady who paints by the river.  Following her one morning, Mr. Oto finds the courage to talk to her and these two unlikely people begin a relationship that will be severely tested and threatened when Pearl Harbor is attacked. Although most of the townspeople think Mr. Oto is Chinese, Miss Sophie knows the truth.  As feelings of prejudice and tension towards anybody who looks foreign heats up in Salty Creek, Miss Sophie and Mr. Oto must made a decision that will forever change their lives.<br />This book, which speaks volumes about isolation and ostracism, is somewhat reminiscent of When the Emperor was Divine by Julie Otsuka and Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson, both excellent novels. A well written, well presented novel, Miss Sophie and the Rising Sun will have reader finding themselves pausing to consider the plight of many who are born in this country but have ties to a foreign land.

In the book The River Road by Karen Osborn, Kevin, a father says, \\"You think you know people, but when something like this happens, you really don't know anyone at all.\\"  Surely this new book by Karen Osborn clearly and unfortunately illustrates this point all too well.<br />The River Road, told from the point of view of the three main characters, immerses  readers in the story of two brothers who are in love with their neighbor Kay.  Friends since Kay moved into this rural Connecticut area, David and Kay become lovers during college leaving Michael out of their customary threesome.  As younger children, the three of them played childhood games and survived the angst filled world of high school in part because of their strong ties to one another.  But then a tragedy occurs leaving parents and these young adults to wonder what went wrong and what really happened.  As the remainder of the book attempts to unravel the mystery and what led up to this tragedy, readers have a front row seat as family and friends become accusatory and introspective,  The book, told partially through flashbacks culminates in an ending which depicts how  individuals suffer after a tragedy and the indomitable spirit to survive and love again.  Certainly for those who enjoyed The Pact by Jodi Picoult concerning teenage suicide, this book will serve as a comparison to the repercussions that can occur when young adults fall in love.<br />Previous to reading The River Road, I read Karen Osborn's second book, Between Earth and Sky, that was set in the late 1800's in New Mexico.  Told in the form of letters by a woman pioneer to her family in Virginia, Osborn presents strong women characters and wonderful descriptions of the land. While she does an equally fine job in this book of describing the characters and description of rural Connecticut, The River Road is a much sadder and more intense book in comparison.

I have been a fan of Nora Roberts for some time now and recently read Dual Image.  This book is an older title by Nora Roberts first published in 1985 as part of her Language of Love series.  It is a rather typical romance book.  Boy meets Girl and they fall in love but their is an obstacle to their love.  Finally  they are able to overcome the obstacle and true love reigns.  Despite the fact that we know the ending will be a happy one, the author does a fine job of taking us on both the journey and the final destination.<br />Dual Image is set in Manhattan and I particularly enjoyed reading about this city's landmarks as the couple travel around.  But it was a bit eerie when the Twin Towers were mentioned.<br />I do recommend this book and many others by this author.

Perhaps it isn't fair when an author writes several books that you loved in past that you keep comparing their latest book to the one they've just written.  But that is the reality of life.  Actor's performances are compared from one movie or show to another, artists' works are often compared and singer's latest recordings are compared to what they did in the past.  Therefore based on past books I read by Richard Paul Evans the mere mention of a new book by him fills me with great anticipation. Sometimes I can hardly wait when I've finished his last book for his next title to be published.  And so I picked up The Last Promise filled with the promise of a really good read and finished thinking this book was simply an OK read.  And while an OK read isn't bad from some authors, I'm accustomed to a book by Richard Paul Evans which really packs and emotional punch and even offers some spiritual guidance.  Even criticism of Evans being sappy and preachy never deterred me from enjoying his books.  Perhaps if I expected a romance novel I might have given this book 5 stars, but unfortunately even for a romance book this title had a rushed and rather unexplained ending and left me yearning for a better read.<br />Eliana Ferrini left America several years before when she married an Italian man that runs his family's business.  Meeting this man while she attended college, today she lives in Tuscany with her husband and young son Alessi.  By all appearances thy have a comfortable life and a wonderful future.  But appearances are deceiving and Eliana is miserable with her unfulfilled life and a future that stretches out with only boredom ahead.  Her husband travels constantly, has many lovers and if Eliana could have her way she would return to the United States and make her home there.  The only pleasure Eliana has other than her son is her love of painting but fears that her loneliness will someday break her spirit.  All attempts on her part to reason with her husband fall on deaf ears.  And when she finally finds to courage to suggest a divorce, Mauritzio says he will give her one but their son will have to remain in Italy with him.  This is out of the question for Eliana.  Then a mysterious stranger, Ross, rents the vacant apartment in their building and helps Eliana during an emergency.  This gentleman has come to Tuscany to wrestling with his own demons, but as the days and weeks go by, it become obvious that the these two lonely people are more than interested in each other.  Perhaps they have finally found a soul mate and a way out of their existing lives.  In the end, though, Eliana will be faced with a difficult choice, which may change her life forever.<br />Evans does a fine job of describing the Tuscany region, the city of Florence and harvest time at the Ferrini vineyards.  But as desperate as Eliana's situation was coupled with a sad event in Ross' past, they were rather superficial characters to me.

And when she finally finds to courage to suggest a divorce, Mauritzio says he will give her one but their son will have to remain in Italy with him.  This is out of the question for Eliana.  Then a mysterious stranger, Ross, rents the vacant apartment in their building and helps Eliana during an emergency.  This gentleman has come to Tuscany to wrestling with his own demons, but as the days and weeks go by, it become obvious that the these two lonely people are more than interested in each other.  Perhaps they have finally found a soul mate and a way out of their existing lives.  In the end, though, Eliana will be faced with a difficult choice, which may change her life forever.<br />Evans does a fine job of describing the Tuscany region, the city of Florence and harvest time at the Ferrini vineyards.  But as desperate as Eliana's situation was coupled with a sad event in Ross' past, they were rather superficial characters to me.

Writing a review for the book The Princess Diaries presented me with a bit of a dilemma.  Although I always try to read a book first and then see the movie, in this case I saw the movie first and then read the book.  And while I didn't expect the movie and book to be mirror images, I never expected the book to be as angst ridden as it was either.  So while I'm tempted to make comparisons between the book and the movie I do realize that isn't fair so this review will concentrate solely on the merits of the book and at another time I'll also review the movie as well.<br />The Princess Diaries is written in the form of a diary written by one Mia Thermopolis, a teenager living in Manhattan.  Mia, like many others her age, grapples with adolescent woes.  What should she wear to school? Will boys ever like her?  Why is her hair so outrageously curly and will she ever understand geometry?  But most importantly why is her single mother dating her geometry teacher and exactly what are they doing on their dates?  The basic plot of the young, somewhat nerdy, girl finding out that she is a princess is the stuff of dreams that many of us remember from the earliest stories our parents read to us as children.  But this book is unlike most fairytales we remember since this book takes place in the year 2000 and Mia Thermopolis is no longer a maid surrounded by two step-sisters and a wicked step-mother but lives in a loft in Greenwich Village with her single mother and cat.  Mia attends a private school and spends most of her time with her best friend Lily Moscovitz, pining over Josh Richler, the most popular boy in her class, and trying to pass algebra.  Weekends are devoted to directing Lily's on air radio program and hanging out with Lily's brother.  And her summers are spent with her father and Grandmama , in Genovia a small principality located in an unidentified area of the world.  The fact that Mia has no idea why her father lives there or what he does is one point which I found troubling since in all respects Mia seems to be inquisitive and bright. She is also very comfortable with the fact that her parents never married and she is the product of their college romance.  Now comes word that Mia's father cannot  have any more children no matter whom he marries.  But more shocking than this is news that Mia is a royal princess who will be her father's sole heir and she will now be expected to lead Genovia one day.  What ensues next is part My Fair Lady and part Billy Wilder comedy film that finds Mia reluctantly being tutored by her Grandmama for her future role as a Princess.  From royal lessons in etiquette and which fork to use for which course to stylish haircuts, to a wardrobe befitting a Princess, to dealing with photographers and reporters covering this breaking story to bodyguards dogging her every step, Mia is at first astounded, miserable and totally confused over her new status and wishes all of this would somehow go away. Most of all she worries if she will ever lead a normal teenage life again or if people will simply like her because she is royalty.  How she deals with all that is happening to her is described in this book and so far three successive novels, Princess in the Spotlight,Princess in Love and Meg cabot's newest princess book, Princess in Waiting.  And it would appear that the author most likely will continue this series based on the popularity of these books.<br />I enjoyed this book and most likely would have rated it with 5 stars except I really questioned how appropriate some of the subject matter is for the younger side of the young adults generation it was intended for.  And since Mia is rather tormented by the revelation of her being a Princess for most of the book, what appears to be humorous antics don't always come across as being all that funny.  Still the book had moments that are valuable lessons for those young women that long to be a Princess and adds new meaning to the expression, \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"you wish for.\\"	2003-02-21

Granted I had very high expectations for this book written by Lorna Landvik considering how much I adored her first book Patty Jane's House of Curl.  And granted it's hard to always measure up with two books in a row.  But I never expected to be as disappointed as I was with this second offering by Lorna Landvik.  As charming as her characters were in her first book and however compelling events were in Patty Jane's House of Curl, they unfortunately fell very flat in this her second title.<br />Essentially the book delves into the lives of two families brought together by friends who are now wives and mothers.  The women, now in their 40's, have been friends since their high school cheerleading and prom queen days.  Devara is a bit pudgier now still married to her high school sweetheart and the mother of two daughters.  Her friend, Bidi, on the other hand has maintained her girlish figure, is married for the second time and the mother of a daughter who is the star hockey player on the once all male hockey team.  And then there are the husbands, which include Sergio who adores his wife's daughter, but secretly yearns for one of his own and Dick who wants to open a nightclub in the basement of his home.<br />Your Oasis on Flame Lake offered little for me in the way of entertainment. Even the description of a harrowing experience and its consequences failed to move me emotionally. And unlike the characters from Patty Jane's House of Curl who still remain with me years later, these characters were almost wooden and less than memorable.<br />It may be regrettable now that I enjoyed Patty Jane's House of Curl as I much as I did. Not only didn't I like Your Oasis on Flame Lake but I also closed the book on Landvik's third title, The Tall Pine Polka Tree after almost 100 pages when the plot was going nowhere.  I still have her fourth published book to read so there is some hope. But if that proves not to my liking I can always go back and reread Patty Jane's House of Curl and once again visit with old and dear friends.and once again visit with old and dear friends.	2003-02-20

While browsing at the library years ago I first came across Crazy in Love and today I always look forward to a new Luanne Rice book.  That said I must now admit that Summer Light was one of Rices more disappointing books.  Yes it did contain many of Rices themes Ive come to enjoy which include the love of a couple for each other, the love of a parent for a child and relatives who disappoint us.  But ultimately this book was not a satisfying read.  And this may very well be the authors concentration on angels communing with the dead and the author also delving into the world of extra sensory perception.<br />May is a wedding planner in Hubbard Point, Conn. and the single mother of a very unusual young girl Kaylie.  After the death of her great grandmother and a traumatic event, Kaylie begins to see things before they happen and also talks to people who have died. Fearing for her daughters sanity, May seeks the help of paranormal experts who have few clues as to what is happening to Kaylie.  On a flight home from an appointment in Canada with these experts, Kaylie asks a man to help save her mother and herself when the plane crashes. The man is a great hockey player, Martin Cartier, who has secrets of his own.  These include the death of his young daughter a few years before, and his hatred for his father Serge, also a former hockey player, who is now in prison. This chance encounter between May, Martin and Kaylie and the subsequent plane crash which Kaylie predicted will have far reaching consequences which will lead to their association and the book progresses to another tragedy and a predictable conclusion.<br />Unfortunately for me this was a poor example of Luanne Rices plot and characters development.  I never found myself either interested in these people or their situation.  I do suggest reading some of Luanne Rices really good books like Blue Moon or Safe Harbor to see how good this author can present a book which leaves you yearning to read more by her.  Im sorry to say Summer Light just wasnt one of them..see how good this author can present a book which leaves you yearning to read more by her.

At a recent book signing I asked an author who were her favorite authors.  She answered by saying Alice Hoffman and Luanne Rice and I shook my head in total agreement.  From the first book I read by Luanne Rice, Crazy in Love in 1988, till now Ms Rice remains a very favorite author of mine whose books generally always make my top ten list at the end of the year.  I even met my first online friends in a book folder on AOL when she mentioned an earlier Rice title, Blue Moon.  And now my most recent read, Safe Harbor is a perfect example of why I love and look forward to any book by Luanne Rice.  Combining the bonds of family life with personal needs, Ms Rice presents a portrait of characters finely etched in the minds of her readers.  Characters we hate to leave at the end of the book and think about for some time afterwards.<br />Returning to Hubbard's Point, Conn. the scene of an earlier book, Firefly Beach and the recently published True Blue, we meet the central character, Dana Underhill, as she returns home after many years living abroad.  An artist living in Paris, she is still reeling from her husband's recent affair with a model and their subsequent divorce.  She claims to love her independence and few family ties but fate has something else in store for her.  Several months before, her beloved sister died with her husband during a boating accident.  Her nieces are now being raised by their grandmother but now Dana realizes that her mother is no longer able to care for the girls especially Quinn, a difficult and unhappy 13 year old.  While Dana expects to return home and then bring her nieces back to Paris to live with her, circumstances conspire against her plans.  Dana's arrival at her family home, her niece's unhappiness and the appearance of a younger man from her past, may force her to make a decision she never thought possible.<br />Ms. Rice captures the many moods of this book completely and perfectly.  The longings of young children for their deceased parents, the needs of a woman unaccustomed to raising children and love between an older woman and a younger man.  But Ms. Rice is always best at family relationships and in Safe Harbor, you will cry as I did when this authors writes about the relationship of Dana and her sister and ultimately Dana`s grief at her loss.  We finish this book on a hopeful note as new relationships are forged and the characters become safe harbors for one another.  And the best part is that we can visit with them once again in the third and final book in this trilogy, True Blue.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any reader who enjoys a wonderful story and characters.d parents, the needs of a woman unaccustomed to raising children and love between an older woman and a younger man.

Nothing and no one is exactly the way they appear and readers are held spellbound till the last pages.<br />Addie French is a woman who has led a varied and interesting life.  Once a con artist, Addie becomes the well-known owner of a chili stand in San Antonio, Texas earning the title of The Chili Queen.  But making chili isn't enough for addie so with an eye to making more money, Addie travels to Naglitas, New Mexico where she works in a brothel and eventually buys the house when the owner retires.  Through all of her experiences, Addie remains good-hearted and good-natured.  Returning from a meeting with one of her men friends, she makes the acquaintance of a young woman Emma who is deposited in the seat next to her by her brother.  With a warning to obey her husband, Emma's brother vanishes.  Emma, a prim and proper lady soon tells Addie that her marriage has been arranged and her reluctance to wed an unknown man has met with anger on her brother's part. When she finally arrives at the station, there is no man to meet Emma and she eventually makes her way to Addie's brothel, where Addie takes her in.  But as I said nothing is what it seems and both Addie and Emma are now on a course of intricate plotting, double crossing antics and general good roller coaster ride of a book which keeps guessing till the bitter end.<br />As Sandra Dallas did in her earlier book, The Persian Pickle Club, the author does a fine job of depicting the late 1800's in both New Mexico and Colorado.  We read about the landscape, small towns and feel the wide, open spaces and sweet smelling air.  And not only does the author present us with two memorable characters, Addie and Emma but several others which include Ned, Addie's, lover and an outlaw and Emma's brother who eventually journeys to Naglitas to find his jilted sister.  Finally there is Welcome, a black woman and Addie's maid, who in my opinion is the most intriguing character of all.<br />I do suggest reading this book, which is both mysterious and also funny at times.here is Welcome, a black woman and Addie's maid, who in my opinion is the most intriguing character of all.<br />I do suggest reading this book, which is both mysterious and also funny at times.	2003-02-16

Kitchen Privileges is the memoir written by Mary Higgins Clark's which begins with her childhood.  Clark, the prolific mystery author introduces her readers to her parents, brothers a there early life in the Bronx.  Surrounded by a large Irish family, Mary, relates a wonderful childhood until the death of her father.  Her mother hard pressed to earn money took in boarders with advertisement of an \\"available room with kitchen privileges, \\" which we learn annoyed their neighbors.  From her early childhood, we then learn about her job as a flight attendant, then marriage to John Clark and the birth of her five children.  Death takes her husband at a young age and now the book goes on to describe Mary's early efforts at finding a job and then writing her first book.  The end of the book hurriedly tells her readers about her great success at publishing umpteen popular books, some of which have also been made into TV movies.  Unfortunately the end was written in a matter of pages as she talks of her marriage later in life and playing with her grandchildren. This along with the weak writing may be the failing of the book.  The end was rushed and the writing was almost as if Clark was giving an oral history on paper rather than then editing and polishing.  She also spent little time on the more emotional aspects of her life as she was off and running to the next part of her life.<br />Once an avid reader of Clark in the last number of years I have tired of her formula books which are same old, same old.  This memoir is no exception.  While her rise to fame is well known by many, this book left me hungering for a bit more substance.  But on the other hand it does provide a glimpse of her life if only the Cliff Notes version.	2003-02-15

Focusing on a story set in China, Tan brings her wealth of knowledge about China and its folktales as well as her love for this country and its traditions. In addition, the illustrations by Gretchen Schields add a wonderful dimension to the story since readers can also visualize the tale by viewing these pictures.<br />On a rainy day as grandchildren whine that they can't play outside their grandmother tells them a tale based on her own experiences as a child.  Using this method Tan provides an allegorical tale concerning children and their wishes.  Telling the children of her wishes as a young girl, Ying Ying tells the children a story about her own wishes at the times of the Moon Festival.  And as all folk tales provide, Tan is adept at providing her readers with an adventurous tale compete with the mysterious Moon Lady and a moral to the story.<br />This is a good book for young children who cannot only learn about the Chinese culture but the saying \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"  I also recommend this book at any age since it is also important to remember this as we move on in life.	2003-01-22

I recently read and loved Summer in Tuscany by Elizabeth Adler.  Shortly afterwards I came across The Last Time I Saw Paris by the same author and while I enjoyed this book it wasn't nearly as good as Summer in Tuscany.  Whereas Summer in Tuscany was a fun-filled read which almost served as a travelogue of the region, The Last Time I Saw Paris had a rather silly premise and didn't describe Paris nearly as interestingly as the former book.<br />After almost 25 years of marriage, Lara plans a trip to Paris to celebrate this milestone anniversary.  But more than this it is an attempt to revitalize her failing marriage.  Remembering back to their honeymoon plans every detail exactly the same as it was during their honeymoon hoping they can recreate those fun-free and happy days.  Or at least this is the way Lara chooses to remember them.  But Lara's husband has a surprise for her.  Not only doesn't he want to recreate their honeymoon 25 years later, he no longer wants to be married to Lara preferring the company of a much younger colleague.  Licking her wounds, Lara retreats to their beach house where she meets the contractor they previously hired for some odd jobs.  He is young, good looking and Lara is immediately attracted to him.  During a hasty moment Lara invites him to accompany her on this trip and he accepts.  As one can imagine these two are now in for some very madcap and hilarious moments as everything that can happen to tourists happens to them.  They arrive in Paris to find their luggage is missing, they have no reservations in a small French town and during a violent rainstorm their car breaks down.  In a rather predictable plot, Lara and Don find themselves beginning a relationship in the city of love.  And things really become interesting when Lara's husband reconsiders and flies to Paris to  spend the rest of the trip with her.  Only then does Lara remembers her honeymoon the way it really was and not how she imagined.<br />This is not an altogether unpleasant read. It is a light fast paced book best suited for a vacation or time spent on the beach.  For travelers to foreign cities it will remind them of their own travel escapades, wondrous sights and events as well as the disastrous moments.  Ultimately I did enjoy this book and would recommend reading it.  Be sure and read Summer in Tuscany too for a mouth watering reading experience.npleasant read.

Imagine the pressure any woman would feel to always be pleasant and polite. Imagine what it must feel like to always be onstage.  In her novel, The Sunday Wife, Cassandra King explores this theme and others which answers some of these questions in an enjoyable novel.<br />Dean and Ben Lynch have been married for over twenty years when Ben becomes the Minister of a Methodist Church in Crystal Springs, Florida.  Ben is overly ambitious and from the very beginning courts the wealthiest and most prestigious families in this community.  Dean, the minister's wife is a bit more skeptical and cautious about the members of the congregation.  But when she voices her opinion about the people, then Ben never fails to remind her about her less than sterling family background, which he intimates is her reason for disliking these people.  He also frequently has to remind Dean to mind her manners and her mouth and behave more like a minister's wife.  Dean finds herself retreating from all social activities spending time playing her Dulcimea, an ancient musical instrument which soothes her nerves.  Just when Dean thinks she won't make friends with anybody, the August and Max Holderfield seek out Ben and Dean offering their friendship.  And when Dean and Augusta become quick friends, nothing in any of their lives will ever be quite the same again.  The Holderfields are among the oldest and wealthiest families in Crystal Springs and while they are Methodist they rarely if ever attend Church.  Their friendship opens the door for Ben to mount a campaign encouraging them to join with the congregation on Sunday mornings and ultimately to donate money to the Church.  Augusta, smart, witty and beautiful takes Dean under her wing much to Ben's disapproval.  Augusta encourages Dean to play the Dulcimea at her annual Halloween party and to break loose from Ben's control and oppressive ways.  And as Dean becomes friendlier and friendlier with Augusta, she finds herself at the point where she begins to question her own values and life.  All the while I sensed trouble brewing and then a senseless tragedy occurs which will change the principal character's lives forever.<br />I must admit that my initial interest in this book was one of curiosity.  Curious to see if the wife or a well loved Southern writer, Pat Conroy, could write an equally interesting book and worthwhile read.  And I found much to my pleasure that Cassandra King can not onyl write well but provided me with a most enjoysble title in The Sunday Wife.  From almost the first page of this book, Ms. King captures the essence of what it is like to be a minister's wife and the control exerted by thjis Minister over his wife.  And if King captures Dean's predicament, she also provides us with a wonderful cast of quirky characters like those found in books by authors Alice Hoffman and Anne Tyler. Characters like Celeste, the Roumanian fortune-teller and storeowner, who the \\"kind ladies\\" of the Methodist Church would like to see leave the community. Or the gay couple Rick and Godwin, who remain fiercely loyal to Augusta and Dean despite what this friendship ultimately costs them.  But most of all I will remember Dean, Ben, Augusta and Maddox who are set on a course which will leave them untethered and changed.  At times poignant and at times funny, Cassandra King offers her readers a good book set in the South.  In the tradition of other Southern writers like Fannie Flagg, Adriana Trigiani and Billie Letts, King has crafted a novel, which depicts a slice of Southern life.  I truly enjoyed this book.  I love to find new authors and look forward to reading more books by Cassandra King.friendlier and friendlier with Augusta, she finds herself at the point where she begins to question her own values and life.

From that time to a few weeks ago I enjoyed all of this author's books.  Then I read Summer Light, a Rice book published in 2001 and found myself thinking this might be the first Luanne Rice book I didn't enjoy that much.  But that was nothing compared to how I felt about Stone Heart, one of Rice's earliest books.  Somehow I couldn't believe the same author who wrote favorites of mine like Blue Moon, Home Fires and Safe Harbor wrote this book.  And before anybody says it was the subject matter of marital and child abuse which I didn't enjoy, I would counter by saying that while enjoy might not be the right word, I did appreciate books like White Oleander by Janet Fitch, Black and Blue by Anna Quindlen and Bastard Out of Carolina by Dorothy Alison.<br />Over the years I have found similar themes in most of Rice's books which include the love of parents for children, the love of siblings for each a other, a past or present tragedy which affect's a family or main character's life and the uniting of a couple who had their own share of disappointments. And while these elements are also present in Stone Heart, unfortunately the characters and their situation as awful as it is just wasn't as moving as those found in Firefly Beach or Home Fires.  Somehow the characters never grew on me and I couldn't wait to reach the final page and be done with this book.  In addition I thought this was truly a most depressing book, which left me thinking that life probably continues to be very difficult and problematic for these people.  I read to think, learn, feel and be entertained.  This book just didn't do anything for me and now I'm sorry I read this title.  Bottom line is skip this book and read anyone of Rice's other books and see why I have enjoyed her as much as I have in the past.	2002-12-26

The year was 1993 and I came across this book while browsing at the library.  I remember thinking when I closed this book that this title was the book, which deserved all the praise or at least sales that Bridges of Madison County was receiving at the time.  I thought the book Where or When better written in comparison to Bridges and that Eden Close had a more intriguing plot as well as a chilling outcome.  After reading Where or When I went back and read Shreve's earlier books, Eden Close, Strange Fits of Passion and then Resistance.  I remember thinking that Anita Shreve was one of the most overlooked new writers of that time.  Then a woman named Oprah selected Shreve's book The Pilot's Wife for her television book group and overnight, one of my favorite authors became a household name.  And her succeeding books, Fortune's Rock, The Weight of Water, The Last Time We Met and her latest title Sea Glass continue to illustrate why Shreve's books are such rich reading experiences.<br />Now that I have read all of this author's books at least once I gave some thought to rereading some of her books.  But it wasn't until one of my online book groups selected Close, Shreve's first novel, that I actually picked up this book and began reading it for the second time.  I did wonder what I would think about a book I read close to ten years ago and one that I remembered enjoying so much that I always recommended it to others looking for a good book.  I am happy to say that my second reading of the book Eden Close if anything has improved with age.  The plot of this book, the characters and descriptive passages glued me to my seat once again.  I found the subject matter continues to be as relevant today as it was when it was first published and the lives of the characters still as heartbreaking.  And as Shreve does with all of her books, this time she puts you smack into this midwestern town where within two farm homes side by side we watch innocent lives torn apart by an unspeakable tragedy.<br />If you have enjoyed Anita Shreve with her more recent books, be sure and go back and read her earliest novels like Eden Close, Strange Fits of Passion and Where or When and see why I considered Anita Shreve a favorite author before she was as popular as she is today.de by side we watch innocent lives torn apart by an unspeakable tragedy.<br />If you have enjoyed Anita Shreve with her more recent books, be sure and go back and read her earliest novels like Eden Close, Strange Fits of Passion and Where or When and see why I considered Anita Shreve a favorite author before she was as popular as she is today.	2002-12-26

In the tradition of Edith Wharton, and with a clever and witty look at New York society, Jane Stanton Hitchcock presents a fast paced read with her newest book, Social Crimes.<br />This is the third book I've read by Ms. Hitchcock and this is her best book so far.  With an almost tongue in cheek approach, the author presents less than sterling characters in a plot readers will long remember.<br />Jo Slater is living a life beyond her wildest dreams.  A former restaurant hostess from the Midwest, Jo is now married to an enormously wealthy older man.  She has become a true society lady owning an estate in the Hamptons, a fabulous apartment in Manhattan and a collection of priceless art and antiques, which includes a necklace owned by Josephine Bonaparte.  But Jo is about to suffer a fall from grace when she befriends a French Countess whose background is quite mysterious.  When Countess Monique has nowhere to stay for the remainder of the summer, Jo graciously offers her their guesthouse.  And while Jo and Monique become fast friends, and Jo reveals a bit too much about herself, Monique is soon to prove to be quite the manipulator at Jo's expense.<br />All too soon, Jo is living on the other side of great wealth and society life, while Monique is now one of New York society's latest society ladies.  After a period of disbelief as to what has happened to her, Jo moves into high gear and learns that revenge can have a higher price than she thought possible.<br />Like The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe, Ms. Hitchcock has a fine eye and ear for depicting life among the very wealthy.  One reads this book with a chuckle and realizes at the end that position and wealth can be fleeting at the best of times.	2002-12-23

Leave it to Elizabeth Adler to write one of the best books I've read in the past few weeks.  Then again from my earliest days of reading this author with books like Leonie, Peach, The Rich Shall Inherit and The Property of a Lady, Ms. Adler has never failed to entertain me, educate me and even introduce to me to some of the most unforgettable characters.  Recently the author has written a couple of books in the romantic suspense genre but it is Summer in Tuscany which is perhaps her most intriguing book recently which blends romance, a bit of mystery and the description of a country I now hope to visit.<br />Gemma is a 40 year old emergency room doctor concerned about both her rebellious 15 year old daughter Livia and her 60 year old widowed mother Nonna.  Exhausted from her intense life at the hospital, Gemma has little time for a social life other than the traditional Italian Sunday afternoon feast at her mother's house with their small family and a few friends.  While Gemma daydreams about changing her life, she feels stuck with her life and finds she has little to look forward to.  But then at Sunday dinner, Nonna announces that she has inherited a villa in the town of her birthplace located in Tuscany.<br />The deceased Count of the villa has left the estate to the surviving family member of a man who saved him from downing many years before.  Nonna who left Italy with her parents many years before can't wait to return to her village and take possession of the villa.  But first she must convince both Gemma and Livia to make the trip with her.  At first Gemma won't even consider the idea but then thinks a summer away from New York may be the perfect opportunity for Livia, Nonna and herself to bond.<br />Arriving first in Rome, Gemma makes the acquaintance of a gentleman and hois young daughter.  Almost immediately, Gemma feels something for this man. These are feelings she has long denied herself.  But when she meets up with this man a few days later in Tuscany, he claims that he purchased Nonna's villa and he is now the rightful owner.  Now while Gemma's relationship is heating up with this gentelman, the search is on for the owner or the villa or the heir to it.<br />While I loved the plot and many colorful characters, I think it was the description of Rome, Florence but most of all, the Tuscan region that found me reading late into the night.  And when I wasn't picturing the Ponte Vecchio, Colosseum or the streets of a Tuscan village, my mouth was watering from the many wonderful homegrown foods and restaurant meals.  There is even the appearance of Luchay, a bejeweled parrot with a wonderful history whom readers of Elizabeth Adler's previous book the Rich Shall Inherit will remember along with his owner Poppy Mallory.<br />It has been many years since I read my first book by Elizabeth Adler.  But now having read and loved Summer in Tuscany I have this great desire to reread all of the books I previously read by this author.

While some authors names aren't familiar household names, in recent years, it is apparent that popular authors from other genres are also writing or dashing off holiday novels.  In the past couple of years Mary Higgins Clark, John Grisham, Jan Karon have all published books with a holiday theme.  And in 2002, David Baldacci's book The Christmas Train, was published in time for the holidays along with Esther's Gift by Jan Karon.  And now for those lovers of Stephanie<br />Plum and her wild and wacky family, Janet Evanovich has joined the ranks of holiday writers with her newest book, Visions of Sugar Plums.  Now before I go any further into this review, I must admit I only read one Stephanie Plum book, One for the Money, and found it an OK read.  For some reason, I never had the urge to continue with this series. Then recently I read Full House, Evanovihch's recently reissued romance novel and found it rather mediocre.  Still, I didn't want to discount Evanovich for future reads and thought that many another go around would have me enjoying Ms. Plum a well liked character so I read Visions of Sugar Plums. And while I wish I could say this book was a worthwhile read or even an enjoyable holiday book it was sadly mediocre in comparison to other holiday books like Skipping Christmas by John Grisham, The Christmas Tree by Julie Salomon, Esther's Gift by Jan Karon or an old favorite A Cup of Christmas Tea by Tom Hegg.  While I found parts of the book laugh out loud funny and some of the characters endearing there just wasn't enough in this book for me to rate it higher or even consider rereading year after year the way I do with some holiday books.  Bottom line is if you have enjoyed the character of Stephanie Plum in the past will have to patiently wait for Evanovich's next book featuring this character.	2002-12-07

James Patterson these days seems to have a new novel every couple of months. Readers in the last year and a half could choose between a romance novel, Suzannes Diary of Nicholas, a second book from a new series featuring four women, 2nd to Die, an Alex Cross novel Violets are Blue and most recently a thriller co-written with Peter DeJonge, The Beach House.  And while these books were for the most part were somewhat satisfying reads, I kept waiting for James Patterson to once again write a book featuring Alex Cross as exciting as Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls and other titles from this series.  Four Blind Mice is just this book.  A return to old time Patterson known for his thriller plots, endearing characters and a plot filled with wonderful twists and turns.<br />And when Patterson is good, one cant help but enjoy spending time with out favorite detective/psychologist Alex Cross, his family and good friend John Samson.<br />Still reeling from a horrendous and violent experience spent tracking down the Mastermind, Alex Cross has finally made up his mind to resign from the Washington DC police force.  But before the day is over he finds himself once again embroiled in a baffling situation and one which may cause the death of his good friend John Samsons Viet Nam buddy.  Samsons friend is about to be executed for the brutal murder of three military wives.  But this decorated military man from the beginning claimed he was framed and is totally innocent although he cant really supply an alibi.  Alex promises himself this will be his last case and begins to investigate the murders.  As he and Alex move deeper and deeper into the case they suspect that men known as the three blind mice, massacres during the Viet Nam war and higher ups at West Point may be involved in the systematic murder of innocent people and the framing of military personnel who are equally innocent. As Cross and Samson crisscross the country it becomes clear that there is a fourth blind mice.  Who this is and why the cover up provides readers with an ending hard to imagine.<br />In Four Blind Mice, Patterson provides readers with a fast and thrilling read.  But if one expects only a thriller read, they may have to think again.  For within the plot the reader once again returns to visit with Alexs lovable grandmother Nana Cross, his three children, a new love woman in his life Jamilla and even a love interest for John Samson.<br />I highly recommend reading this book if youve followed the series up to now.  And even if youve never read any of these books you owe it to yourself to become familiar with this author and his Alex Cross characters.  As for me, my faith is restored in thisauthor.  After a couple of so so Patterson books, I finally read one that I truly enjoyed.  And I am happy to say that Four Blind Mice is exactly what I wanted.  An old time Patterson book.

Not content to write what I refer to as pure romance titles, Ms. Roberts is also well known as a writer of romantic suspense books and under the name JD Robb, a mystery series set in the future.  Three Fates, a recent book is a good example of both the authors romance writing, sense of adventure and even weaves an ancient tale within the plot.<br />The three fates of the title are three silver statues which when linked together are not only worth millions but are pieces supposedly with great powers according to legend.  Also according to legend, one of the fates was lost when the Lusitania sunk.  But was this fate really lost after the sinking?  Could it have been taken off the ship somehow by one of the few survivors?  And what has happened to the other two fates? Most importantly why are certain people being pursued, their homes being searched and then an innocent man murdered?  Six young individuals, all somehow connected to one another by family, coincidence and the three fates find one another and romances begin, alliances once thought unlikely are forged, and over two continents the search is on for the three fates.<br />This was a good book.  It especially intrigued me to learn of the history behind the statues and where they were hidden for almost 100 years.  The characters and each of their backgrounds were interesting and fine examples of Ms. Roberts ability to provide them with far reaching connection to one another.  If you enjoy romantic books with a dash of suspense and adventure,  Three Fates will surely be a satisfying read.	2002-11-20

Luanne Rice is one of my very favorite writers because her books never fail to interest, entertain or move me as she sets the stage with both wonderful relationships between her characters and intriguing plots. And while I always want to gulp down her books, I find myself sabing some of her books so I always have something to read by her.<br />Firefly Beach is set in Hubbard's Point, Connecticut, which will also be the location of two other books, Safe Harbor and True Blue, written by Ms. Rice.  It is in this beach town that Hugh and Augusta Renwick have raised their three daughters Clea, Caroline and Skye.  Now, many years later previous events in these women's lives continue to loom over them.  The oldest daughter Caroline owns the local bed and breakfast, which caters to an artistic crowd who continue to revere her well- known father and painter. Clea, the middle daughter is married to a local minister, the mother of two young children and provides the voice of reason and stability in the family. Skye, an artist and the youngest daughter has recently left her philandering husband continues to deal with her involvement in a family accident by drinking too much is prone to fits of depression and causes her family to constantly worry about her.  And presiding over the family is Augusta, now the widow of a famous artist who deals with all adversity by closing her eyes to the very real problems her daughters deal with in their lives.<br />Now Joe Connor arrives in Hubbard's Point on an expedition to salvage a ship that sunk many years ago.  As a young man his path crossed with the Renwick family when his father presumably died from a heart attack in the Renwick's home.  Caroline, a young girl wrote Joe a condolence note after this event which resulted in them corresponding for several years until Joe as an adolescent learns the truth about his father's death.  Now finally meeting Caroline in person, Joe can neither hide his hatred of Caroline's family nor his attraction to her.  And Caroline beset by the past and Skye's current emotional deteriaration cannotignore that she is quite taken with the man who she so adored as a young girl.<br />In my opinion, there are few writers today who present readers with family stories as well as Luanne Rice does.  Whether she describes the love between parents and children or siblings for each other, this author always manages to bring tears to my eyes.  And in Firefly Beach she presents a memorable relationship between Caroline and Joe and the three sisters and their mother which makes this book a most worthwhile read.<br />I now look forward to reading Safe Harbor and True Blue which continues the story of some characters readers first meet in Firefly Beach.

And an Accidental Woman has all of her the elements which have made her a popular romance authors these days.  And in this book as she did in For My Daughters, Delinsky adds a mysterious element as the book plays out while one of the characters is absent for most of the book.  And as an added benefit readers of the previously published Lake News will be happy to return to this area and meet up once again with some familiar characters.<br />During an early morning, Heather Malone, is escorted by the police from the home she shares with her significant other, Micah, and his two daughters.  Charged with the murder of her former lover which happened years before, the townspeople of Lake Henry, New Hampshire are astounded.  How is it possible the lovely woman they know and love could have been suspected of doing this? Or how is it possible that she could have done this. And then as the townspeople ask themselves how well do we know anybody, the stage is set for a wonderful look at relationships both in the past, present and future.<br />A virtual stranger in Lake Henry only a number of years before Heather has become a well respected member of the community.  Working as a waitress when she first came to Lake Henry, Heather virtually says nothing about her past which never bothered anybody before.  And while she remains unmarried to Micah, they share a wonderful home and Heather provides great security for his daughters from a previous marriage. But as Heather is imprisoned and she refuses to shed any light on her innocence or guilt, there are others who believe she could never have done this heinous crime and set out to prove this to the authorities.  Chief among them is Micah, the man who loves her dearly but now has to wonder where Heather came from and what is buried in her past.

In her debut novel, Ms. Singer who was inspired by family stories presents her readers with four generations of Jewish women spanning two continents beginning in the late 1800's.  Told in the voices of the four women of this family, the book reflects these women's own stories set against historical events.  Central to the plot is the relationship between the modern day and difficult mother Celia and her dutiful daughter Hannah.  And it is Hannah that the stories will someday belong as she begins collecting them as a way of understanding her mother.<br />This is a moving book which captures the readers attention particularly if one is from an immigrant background.  Interspersed in the narrative are Yiddish expression which loosely translated provide the reader with a language rich in humor and wisdom.  In addition I highly recommend this book to those with a Jewish background whose families may have experienced similar stories and histories.  And for those unfamiliar with this culture and traditions of Judaism, it is an opportunity to learn of a way of life which in some respects is sadly gone but in other ways is very much alive.<br />Ienjoyed this book so much that I now fook forward to reading future works by Katie Singer.  She is a gifted writer who has provided readers with an excellent first novel.  May she have a long and happy life and as we say, \\"May she have blessings on her head.\\"	2002-11-10

I know that many romance readers today cannot wait for the next Janet Evanovich book featuring Stephanie Plum and other characters to be published.  But what some of these readers may not realize is that Janet Evanovich began her writing career as an author of romance novels.  Now almost 13 years late, Ms. Evanovich, along with another author has reworked one of her earlier books, which she originally wrote under the name Steffi Hall.  And after reading this book, I'm left with the burning question why did she bother doing this.  From a financial point of view, I guess there were reasons for her doing this.  But in my opinion she might have been better off writing  another Stephanie Plum novel.<br />As a reader, who at one time couldn't gulp down enough romance titles, I thought Full House was less than an engaging read let alone as a romance novel. I do understand that some romances are light hearted and funny but instead this book at times was downright silly.  Of course there was the requisite romance theme of boy meets girl and the happily ever after ending but there seemed little if any reason for these two to fall in love.  Then there were also a couple of very quirky characters who included a wrestler, ditsy blond and even Billie's ex- husband which should have spiced up this book but didn't. And finally there was a bit about owning a horse farm and a small mystery.  But in the end the book never really seemed more than just words on paper and it just didn't matter.  I think what was really lacking for any novel was any real interest in the characters their circumstances or their outcome.  I even found that I forced myself to finish this title.  From the forward of this book readers learn that Evanovich plans on doing this again in the future.  In my opinion, she should consider writing new books and leaving her past books where they most likely belong, in the past.	2002-11-06

The book written by Julie Otsuka engaged me from the first  page and left me wishing for more when the book ended.<br />The book is divided into five chapters, each one told by a different Japanese - American family member at the beginning of America's entry into WWII.  Each of these voices, from the youngest family member to the oldest, resonates with the sounds of isolation and despair.  From the earliest days of the posters summoning Japanese - Americans to the return of this family to their homes, readers are held captive by this book.  All too soon we learn how dramatically life changed for these United States citizens who in most cases were interned for no other reason than they were Japanese and therefore thought to be the enemy.  While the woman's husband and her children's father is detained under suspicion in a prison, she relates the first story of coming upon the notice of the camps and then packing up her house for departure.  The daughter relates the train trip to an unknown destination while the son tells us what their lives were like when they lived among others in the camp. Then the mother's voice is heard once again as the war ends and they are allowed to return home.  But they return home to find that life as they once knew it may never be the same.  Their house has been looted and when the husband and father returns home he is a changed man.  It is this last chapter, the voice of the father, which is so haunting and remains with me still.  As I read the words more than once, I couldn't help but see Edward Munch's painting, Scream, before my eyes or think about  the emotional intensity in Alan Ginsberg's poem, Howl.<br />In this rather short title, Ms. Otsuka presents us with a magnificent debut novel. We come to feel for her characters fate as the book begins rather quietly and then reaches a resounding crescendo by the end.

Jan Karon, the author of the highly successful Mitford seies, last year provided her readers with a Christmas story called The Mitford Snowmen.  This year she provides us with an even more enjoyable story, Esther's Gift.<br />Esther Bolick is known far and wide for her orange marmalade cakes which she presents to Mitford friends as holiday gifts.  But this year while thinking about buying doilies and the high cost for them, Esther asks her husband, Gene, to calculate the cost for each cake she prepares. Upon hearing the staggering amount of each cake including her labor, Esther begins to scratch names off her list of those she feels has either slighted her or can do without her cake.  Then as she listens to the words of Christmas carols and imagine these people opening the door and receiving the cakes from her and her husband, Esther realizes the true spirit of giving during the holiday season.  And within a few hours left Esther lovingly prepares these cakes which rest on the doilies she originally thought way too expensive.  And then after Church, she and Gene go to deliver the cakes which are very much a part of the Mitford traditions.<br />This is an enjoyable short read.  It will certainly appeal to the many readers who enjoy Jan Karon's books.  And for those not familiar with the Mitford series it will serve as a nice introduction to both Mitford and the author Jan Karon.  I suggest this as a lovely gift for the holidays or as an addition to any readers holiday books.  And as an added treat Esther's recipe is included in the book.  I hope you will prepare this cake to give to friends as gifts or will serve it in your homes during the holidays season.  And as thoughts turn to shopping, wrapping, cooking and entertaining, I wish to all a happy and healthy holiday season.	2002-11-02

I n either base, Trevor presents us auth a wonderful story and memorable characters.  In a matter of a few pages he places his readers both geographically and time wise in both the present and at the beginning of WWII.  Central to the book is the question, \\"Who are those people we meet early on in or lives which influenced us then  and continue to influence us all of our days.<br />The book begins as Harry, a 58 year old, cinema owner in an Irish coastal town reflects back to his life and the time during the beginning of WWII.  On the brink of adolescence, Harry was quite bored with the days he spent at his boarding school and now with his days spent in his hometown where he was forced to return when the school closed down due to the war. But life is about to change for Harry when an &eacute;migr&eacute; couple move to this hometown and announce plans to open a cinema theater.  Mr. Messinger is a much older man from Germany while his wife is who is both elegant and beautiful is a much younger English woman. When the couple ask Harry to work for them in the ticket booth of the cinema Harry wil have one of the greatest learning experiences from his days and nights spent with this couple specifically Mrs. Messinger.  For it is this woman who ultimately will have the most profound effect on Harry as he spends his nights at the Alexandra and comes under her spell.  As the war rages about all of them Harry learns about life and love from this woman and even years later thinking back on this time period in his life, Harry realizes Mrs. Messinger she still holds a very special place in his heart.<br />As an avid reader I have long heard about William Trevor although Nights at the Alexandra was my first experience reading any of his works.  In this sparse narrative, Trevor wrote volumes about the innocence of youth, unhappiness, dislocation, memories, dreams realized and regrets we may have as we look back on our youth from a different place in time.

On the recommendation of online friends I read Whispers and Lies by Joy Fielding.  Familiar with this author's name I previously read Don't Cry Now and remember moderately enjoying this title.  I also somewhat enjoyed the made for TV movie based on Fielding's book See Jane Run.  Over the years while I've seen many of her titles and heard lots of positive news about Fielding's writings, I didn't read any of her books in recent years. Then as I read Whispers and Lies, I found myself shaking my head thinking I'm really not enjoying this book and also admitted to myself that I don't really enjoy suspense plots.  Then a funny thing happened to me midway through the book.  I realized that as obvious as the plot might be, or so I thought, and even if this isn't my favorite type of book, the author did a fine job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere. In addition, I found myself totally interested in this book and it would come to its conclusion.  And WOW is all I can say for the ending, which was a twist I never ever imagined.<br />Told as a flashback we first meet Terry, a lonely 40 year old nurse.  She appears to have little if any social life and occupies a home she inherited from her mother who died a number of years ago.  Also on the grounds is a small cottage Terry rents to a younger woman named Allison Simms.  Allison needs a place to live and Terry missed the friendship of her former tenant Erica who seems to have disappeared without a trace.  But as terry and Allison begin their friendship, many of Allison's stories and past appear to be lies.  And when Terry meets her friends who seem rather unsavory, Terry begins to wonder about Allison and her suitability to rent her cottage.  Suddenly Terry begins to hear noises at night, feels as though she's being followed or watched and persistent calls asking for her former tenant really set her on edge.  It isn't any wonder that as time goes by, Terry is convinced that Allison and her friends are planning her death.  But all is not as it seems.  Terry hasn't been entirely honest about her lonely life either.  And as tension mounts and events happen quickly even a non- suspense reader like myself found I was entirely entranced by this book.<br />I must admit that when I finished reading Whispers and Lies, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  This book wasn't at all as predictable as I thought and the end had one of the best twists I can remember in recent years.  I now plan on reading more of Fielding's book and hope they are equally as intriguing and enjoyable.ll is not as it seems.  Terry hasn't been entirely honest about her lonely life either.

It is often fun to read and book and try to figure out how the author came up with the title.  In the case of The Middle Ages by Jennie Fields, this is a most appropriate title since it describes the main character's place in life.<br />Jane Larsen is in her middle ages or as we say middle aged.  She is divorced from her husband who she remains on good terms with and is the mother of two teenage twin girls going through their own turbulent years. She is also an architect frustrated with her job.  As Jane describes herself she is a dumpy woman surrounded by young and beautiful woman.  And added to all of her insecure feelings is the thought that despite fix ups for dinner parties and blind date drinks, she may never meet another man who will mean something to her during her middle ages.<br />Then just as Jane thinks life is running at a dull speed, she is fired from her boring job.  Now she can finally do what she always wanted, build homes for clients.  And then Jane becomes very bold and decides to look up her college boyfriend Jack Craskin using the Internet.  After all of these years Jane suddenly wants to know how his life turned out.  And we as readers are along for the ride as we watch the perils and joys of being in one's middle ages.<br />This is a fast paced book which asks and then answers the questions, \\"What if I had married my old sweetheart, or at the very least, \\"Is love really lovelier the second time around.\\"  With a quick wit and good sense of humor, Ms. Fields does a fine job of presenting he characters.  At times she is reminiscent of Jeanne Ray, author of Step - Ball Change and Susan Isaacs, author of Lily White.  She is also wonderful at describing the tree lined brownstone streets of Brooklyn and the hectic working pace of Manhattan.  I did enjoy this book and look forward to reading more books by Jennie Fields in the future.	2002-10-13

Once an avid romance reader, these days with a few exceptions I hardly ever read from this genre anymore.  And while I was familiar with the name Debbie Macomber I never did read any of her books.  But when I came across Between Friends by Debbie Macomber while browsing at the library and read the dust jacket I immediately became interested in this title.  I am, a real fan of books written in the epistolary form.  Books whose stories are presented as letters or diary and journal entries and today may even be e-mail correspondence.  My favorite titles written as epistolary novels include A Woman of Independent Means, Between Heaven and Sky, These is My Words and more recently Dear Stranger, Dearest Friend.  And to this list I can now add Between friends which has a permanent place on my favorite books list of 2002.<br />The year is 1948 when Lesley Adamski and Jillian Lawton are born in Pine Ridge, Washington.  And while they become life long friends, their families couldn't be more different.  Lesley's parents marry after she is conceived and there never seems to be enough money to care for her and eventually her five siblings.  Her father who works on and off in the mines enjoys drinking a bit too much while Lesley's mother works hard to keep the family together.  With excellent grades Lesley hopes to attend college until history has a way of repeating itself and Lesley finds herself marrying her high school boyfriend.<br />Jillian's life is in sharp contrast to Lesley.  As the only child of a Judge and his wife<br />Jillian is afforded a life filled with a beautiful home, wonderful trips, pretty clothes and her own car at 16.  Jillian is able to attend college in New York and becomes a fast paced lawyer although a high school romance will leave her heart broken and unable to move on with other men.<br />Throughout the years, through good times, bad times, victories and tragedies the friendship of these two women help to anchor and sustain them no matter what life throws their way.  They manage to always be there for one another even when they are miles apart from one another.  At first we watch them as young girls writing notes in class to one another, then as teenagers writing in their journals, as young wives and mothers in letters crisscrossing the country and finally as middle aged women corresponding through electronic mail.  We are also privy to other pertinent correspondence in their lives like graduation invitations, wedding invitations, birth<br />announcements, telegrams from overseas and obituary notices.  And as we read the lives of these two women lay out before our eyes and we get to know them as if they are our family.<br />I really loved the characters from this book and the time period when it was set.  From the two women's writings the author also touches on many historical events.  From the civil rights movement to the assassinations of the 60's to the tragedy of 9/11/01, this book is a wonderful representation of what it was like to grow up in the 60's  For me, a child of the 60's and the same age as Lesley and Jillian, this book was a walk down memory land which I won't ever forget.hrows their way.

Books like Tender at the Bone which described the young Ruth Reichl's flamboyant and at times odd mother.  Or Stuffed by Patricia Volk which told the story of a family restaurant owend by the author's father. And of course we could add Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, Blackbird by Jennifer Lauck or All Over But the Shoutin' by Rick Bragg. Now I have just finished a recent addition to this category. The title is The Leopard Hat: A Dauhgter's Story and is the author's loving tribute to and portrait of her mother, Giselle.<br />Giiselle born in Europe personifies grace and elegance.  She survived the war by hiding out with her mother and then lived in several European cities before settling in New York City.  She meets and marries a very wealthy investment banker and move into k they have a large apartment on fashionable Madison Avenue.  In time two daughters would complete their family. First Valerie arrives and then her younger sister. The author reflects on this grand lady by giving us a glimpse of her life.  Shopping hairdresser  appointments, charitable functions, her home and her children fill her days, The author describes Giselle's home with its beautiful objects and her wonderful designer clothes.  She also explains about her mother's love for art and music and how she influences her daughters to open their eyes to world around them.  And throughout the book we find out more about Giselle's time spent in Europe as a child, which is so different from her life now.  We are witness to Valerie's rebellious teen-age years and her mother, so used to her two daughters being her best friends, had to let go to keep her child.  And then very lovingly and poignantly does Ms. Steiker describe her mother's death from cancer when Valerie is in college.<br />I enjoyed this book.  I did feel at times that the emphasis on the families wealth was a bit much.  I preferred the parts where Giselle spends time with her daughters reminiscing about her youthful experiences and she listens to her daughters.  This is a touching and warm book.  In the end one wishes they could have known this woman who personified a life filled with flair, style and a determined spirit.Giselle spends time with her daughters reminiscing about her youthful experiences and she listens to her daughters.

While she spoke on several topics, what I remember most was how she praised her many teachers, particularly her professors from Barnard who encouraged her to consider writing as a career.  As a teacher I was so overcome by Ms. Quindlen's words and I think this is when I fell in love with Anna Quindlen for the zillionth time.  Now looking back on this event, I can't remember a time when I didn't love, admire and couldn't wait to read anything written by her.  From her earliest columns at The NY Times to her wonderful fiction books, to a quasi memoir How Reading Changed My Life, to the Commencement speech, which ultimately became the book, A Short Guide to a Happy Life to her columns today for Newsweek, I am always interested and intrigued in what she writes about.  Is it any wonder that as soon as Blessings her newest book hit the stores, I was first on line.  And while I hated waiting, it was well worth the wait.  I was so sorry it had to end knowing that once again I have to wait for another book by Ms. Quindlen.<br />As she has done in her previous books, Ms. Quindlen introduces us to two memorable characters.  Skip Cuddy is a young man who has had his share of problems over the years.  He fell in with a bad crowd and a botched robbery landed him in prison for the past ten months.  But a chance encounter with an elderly woman in a Wal-Mart parking lot will begin a series of events that will change his life forever.  Lydia Blessing is the elderly woman Skip has helped out with her car.  Mrs. Blessing has lived almost all of her life in Mount Mason first as a child and then as a war widow raising her only child and now into her golden years. But she likes Skip and before the day is through, Mrs. Blessing will offer him a place to live and a job as a hired hand at her home.  Mind you, Mrs. Blessings home isn't any home but a magnificent estate, which was owned by her father.  And Mrs. Blessing is no ordinary woman.  Born to wealthy parents, Mrs. Blessing was raised in New York, attended private school and debutante balls. These days, Mrs. Blessing is somewhat of a recluse who watches her every penny although she is still immensely wealthy.  Now fate will turn these two people's lives around.  What neither of these two people can imagine is than in a short time their lives will become intertwined and they will form a friendship others could never understand.<br />Shortly after Skip takes up residence in the apartment above the garage, two teenagers leave a baby on the doorstep of the garage. Skip finds the baby and instinctively he decides to keep the baby although he has very little knowledge about caring for a baby.  One thing Skip does know is that he has to keep this baby a secret fearful of what the police might think if they found out the baby was in his care.  During the day, Skip goes about his daily chores with the baby in a sling with a shirt covering the baby.  His nights are spent poring over child rearing books and he agonizes over the baby's position while sleeping.  After several weeks he names the baby Faith.  Then one evening Mrs. Blessing finds the baby in Skip's apartment and she becomes part of hiding Faith from the authorities.  Mrs. Blessing has her own secrets and as she helps Skip to care for the baby she reflects on her past.  She thinks about her parents and the lack of love from her mother.  She also reflects on her melancholy brother and his good friend, her husband who is killed early on during WWII.  And then she reminisces about her daughter who was reared by nannies and boarding schools and had little to do with Mrs. Blessing as she grew up.  She begins to see her life more clearly and her blessings.  As the weeks pass, Lydia and Skip learn true values from one another.  They also learn that blessings are all around. And the ending reaches its climax with some surprising twists as readers fully understand the blessings Faith has bestowed on both of these people.<br /><br />So beautifully does Ms. Quindlen describe the grounds Blessings that readers will feel themselves smelling the flowers, seeing the trees and hearing the rustle of the leaves as the seasons change. They will also feel as though they are sitting in Ms. Blessing's living room or picnicking on the porch in the heat of the summer.  And so lovingly does she describe the moments between Skip and Faith that readers surely will feel a baby napping on their shoulders or sitting on their laps. And more than anything we feel the love between a parent and a child as Skip protects Faith.<br />In Hebrew we say the words, \\"May you be a blessing.\\"  Anna Quindlen is truly a blessing.  Her books speak volumes on themes of loyalty, devotion, redemption but most of all love.  We come to know her characters well.  We care about these people and long after we've closed the book we continue to think about them.  But most of all Ms. Quindlen's words never fail to place her readers smack in the pages of her book.  Her words and the emotions she evokes are unforgettable and you are left with the desire to revisit these people and places again and again.<br />Thank you Ms. Quindlen.

Long before he became famous for his Alex Cross series I read and enjoyed Patterson's earliest titles such as The Midnight Club and Season of the Machete.  In recent years, in addition to loving the Alex Cross books I have also enjoyed some of this author's stand alone books like Cradle Will Fall.  Now that I've read The Beach House by James Patterson and Alex DeJonge (the co-author of the previous Patterson title, Miracle on the 17th Green), I do wonder why Patterson wrote this book, why it required two authors and what went wrong.<br />The Beach House tells the story of the \\"accidental\\" drowning of a young part time waiter during a gala party in the Hamptons.  While many of the residents are \\"summer people,\\" this young man is a high school dropout and what we call a townie.  To Peter's family it seems unlikely he would be at the beach at this hour let alone drown since he was a strong swimmer. And despite the police's initial investigation his law school brother Jack and father decide to do a little investigating on their own.  They both feel that Peter was lured to the beach on some pretext but they can't figure out why.  Their first attempts meet with icy glares and then threats as it becomes apparent that the ultra wealthy couple, the Campions had something to do with it.  And it doesn't help matters that this couple's daughter is Jack's former girlfriend.  What follows next is a roller coaster ride of a book, which includes drugs, pornography, large sums of manner in unknown bank accounts, a bit of romance and surprising facts about the lifestyles of some of the characters.<br />Sounds like it would make a good book, right?  But it didn't.  The book becomes mired in same old, same old and while it only takes a few hours to read, Patterson does favor short paragraphs, it really has no pleasant after taste.  And the writing is so simplistic that one wonders why Patterson wrote this book.  One would think with his fame and fortune Patterson might slow down a bit and take more time to pen a well-written book.  Either that or people are left to wonder why two authors aren't better than one.is book.

When I wrote my review of A Bend in the Road for Amazon, the subject line said, \\"Hooray  - finally a Nicholas Sparks book I loved.\\"  I wish I could say the same about Sparks's newest book, Nights in Rodanthe.  Unfortunately, I felt about this book the same way I felt about Sparks's other books, The Notebook, Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember.  The plots, for the most part have been done before and better in addition to which the characters never grew for me and in the end I didn't care much about them either. The book, which I finished in a couple of hours, includes some standard Spark's literary devices which include the use of a flashback to tell the story and a bit of mystery as to how the book would end.  And while the book had some glimmering moments, there just weren't enough for me to think much about once I closed the book.<br />Adrienne begins this narrative at the age of 60, a divorced woman for 17 years and the mother of three grown children.  In order to help her daughter, a recent widow at only 29, to cope with the future, Adrienne relates the following event in her life. We move back in time and meet Adrienne who is 45 and has recently been divorced.  We also meet Paul, a newly divorced doctor, who has just left his practice in North Carolina and is estranged from his only child who is a doctor working in Ecuador.  On his way to try and reconcile with his son, Paul stops off at a bed and breakfast in Rodanthe, North Carolina to meet with a former patient's family. And Adrienne, trying to make some extra money, is at this bed and breakfast helping out the owner.  The stage is set and over a weekend when North Carolina is hit by a violent Nor'easter.................... I think you get the message.<br />I find the premise of people falling in love so quickly a bit hard to understand and may be it does happen but Sparks didn't convince me in within the pages of this book.  And an attempt at a second theme, which concerned Paul's former patient, did little to help out this book from being rather mediocre.  As for the writing, I think Sparks tries too hard with too many flowery words to describe the landscape and the dialogue is almost always hard to believe.  I imagine Sparks's loyal legions of fans will enjoy this book, but not me. I remain disappointed once again with his attempts to write a romantic novel.

In some cases these are often authors of books I've reviewed and in some cases they are authors suggesting I read their books.  Carole Bellacera is an author who contacted me, suggested I read her latest book East of the Sun, West of the Moon and then offered to send me a copy.  Immediately I responded that I would love to read this book and would review it once I finished it.<br />I must admit that when I first looked at the book I didn't think I would enjoy it that much.  To begin with except for one or two favorite romance authors, I've more or less stopped reading this genre.  And of the romance books I do read and those I loved the least favorite theme I enjoyed is that of a younger man and older woman.  Now that I've said that I must now add, that I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  In the tradition of authors like LaVyrle Spencer and Barbara Taylor Bradford, Bellacera presents characters who are on the brink of changes in their lives and are also forced to make difficult decisions.  And these decisions may ultimately cause hardships for some involved and joy to others.<br />Central to the story is 40 years old, Leigh Fallon wife of a Congressman and mother of 3 children ranging in age from 10 to 19.  While Leigh closes her eyes concerning Bob's emotional abuse towards her and his frequent absences from home, she can't deny the fact that he has been an unfaithful husband when evidence stares her in the face.  But she puts her feelings aside until her son suggests housing a 27 year old exchange and graduate student from Norway.  Suddenly Leigh has feelings for this young man that she thought she had long buried and when Erik seems to feel the same way, events are set in motion for a good book.<br />Bellacera weaves an interesting tale as Leigh comes to grips with her own feelings, her deceitful and philandering husband, her judgmental children and two men who offer her<br />Happiness.  Interspersed between the pages of this book are Norse folktales and legends along with well-written descriptions of various parts of Norway.  And the book which is divided into two parts gains interest as a new man enters Leigh's life and there's also a bit of mystery surrounding the parentage of a young child and Erik.<br />This novel was a fast read for me and I did enjoy it.

Have you ever hired help who become part of your lives and then they never leave.  Remember the painter Eldin from Murphy Brown or more recently the general contractor from the delightful book Step - Ball Change who comes to renovate a screened porch and becomes a member of the family?  Or perhaps, most famous, is the hired servant who becomes the master in Harold Pinter's play  The Servant.  Now author Peter Abrahams, in his most recent book, The Tutor, introduces us to Julian Sawyer the mild mannered tutor.  But is Julian really a helpful tutor or an evil person, stay tuned to find out.<br />Linda and Scott Gardner are living the American dream. Or so they'd like to think. In a typical suburban tree lined community, they work hard at their jobs and hard at raising their two children.  They are busy people, adjusting schedules to allow for their children's tennis lessons, soccer games, car pools to events and music classes.  And all they while they feel extreme competition and tension from their neighbors and families children as compared to their son and daughter. Because as many people think, the seeds of suceeding begin very early on. Ruby, the Gardners 11 year old daughter, is precocious and wise beyond her years.  Although seemingly well adjusted she harbors some rather odd ideas about life and senses that something is not right in her home.  But Ruby isn't the Gardners focus at this time.  It is their high school aged son whose less than sterling grades concern them more and more.  And with each report card it seems that Brandon is headed for less than an prestigious college. Even talking to their son about his future has done little to motivate him and they are increasingly worried that the only school he will be able to attend is the local community college.  Not that there's anything wrong with a community college but after all the time effort and money they've puit into their son's life it's not what they had in mind. Then Scott learns that his brother's son, a star athlete, received almost a perfect score on the SAT'S and will surely be a top applicant at one of the most prestigious colleges in the country.  Suddenly the Gardner's visions of their son's present and future failures loom in front of them and consider the hiring of a tutor the possible answer to their problem. The seacrh is on and using an educational consultant finds one Julian Sawyer hired as the answer to their prayers.  Unfortunately, though hiring Julian Sawyer is not hiring your typical tutor and over the weeks, while he presumably works with Brandon, Julian has his own agenda in mind.  As Julian works on his own plans, he becomes an important confidant of the family.  He begins to suggest changes and strategies to the Gardners and at first all seems well and Brandon's grades improve, Ruby is doing better at winning in tennis, Linda clinches a difficult deal and Scott takes a big chance concerning his business which Julian assures him will work out just fine.  Somehow, though, as the pages turn we as readers know something is quite rotten and you just have to read this book to find out what happens next.<br />While this was an exciting plot at first, it was far more predictable than other books by Abrahams.  I kept waiting for that twist which I associate with Abrahams's titles, but unfortunately it never came.  The end most of all fizzled and I even found myself a bit bored.  Bottom line - The Tutor is a fast, ok read but if you want to see Peter Abraham at his best, read The Fury of Rachel Monette, Tongues of Fire or Revolution #9, some of his best books in my opinion.son, a star athlete, received almost a perfect score on the SAT'S and will surely be a top applicant at one of the most prestigious colleges in the country.

As Julian works on his own plans, he becomes an important confidant of the family.  He begins to suggest changes and strategies to the Gardners and at first all seems well and Brandon's grades improve, Ruby is doing better at winning in tennis, Linda clinches a difficult deal and Scott takes a big chance concerning his business which Julian assures him will work out just fine.  Somehow, though, as the pages turn we as readers know something is quite rotten and you just have to read this book to find out what happens next.<br />While this was an exciting plot at first, it was far more predictable than other books by Abrahams.  I kept waiting for that twist which I associate with Abrahams's titles, but unfortunately it never came.  The end most of all fizzled and I even found myself a bit bored.  Bottom line - The Tutor is a fast, ok read but if you want to see Peter Abraham at his best, read The Fury of Rachel Monette, Tongues of Fire or Revolution #9, some of his best books in my opinion.	2002-09-22

Set in Ireland I found this book to be sad, eerie and poignant and surprisingly a rich and ultimately most rewarding read.  When I came upon Moira's Crossing by Christina Shea, again set partially in Ireland, I looked forward to a similarly engaging read. Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed with this book.  Yes, it was poignant and described raw emotions but somehow it missed its mark for me and I found myself frustrated with this book since it could have been so much better.<br />Beginning in the year 1921 we watch two sisters as they deal first with their mother's death during childbirth and then the death of a young sister.  We watch them leave their father in Ireland as they cross the seas to America to  make better lives for themselves.  Arriving in Boston they become domestics and eventually move to the coast of Maine.  All the while through marriages, illnesses and loves they remain close although there are secrets well kept from both.<br />While we are introduced to characters who might have become memorable, we really never get to know them or their motivations for the things they did or will do.  And this in my opinion is the greatest failure of the book.  Both sisters seem to be severely isolated both geographically and socially.  The bonds of the two sisters never fully remove them from Ireland or from events which happened there.  And at the end one feels as though they may have wasted much of their lives with their closeness, secrets and yearnings.<br />This is the first book written by Christina Shea and while I didn't entirely enjoy it, there were enough possibilities, which left me hopeful for future books or writings by this author.  I certainly am curious enough to read her next book hoping it will include fully developed characters who will remain in my memory the way the characters from The Nature of Air and Water have all these months later.	2002-09-18

Someone to Watch Over Me by Jill Churchill is the third book in her Grace and Favor series.  The previous two titles, Anything Goes and In the Still of the Night were delightful mysteries and Someone to Watch Over Me is a welcome addition to this series.<br />Set during the Depression, the once wealthy Brother and sister Lily and Robert inherit their uncle's mansion on the Hudson River. But the inheritance is predicated on the English law of Grace and Favor where they must live in the house for a period of time before they can rightfully own it.  And their uncle added one more element to this inheritance in that both Lily and Robert must have jobs in the area and live only in the house before they inherit anything.  The house comes with an array of interesting people who work for them in addition to some of the townspeople who quickly become part of their lives.<br />Unfortunately, times are tough for all including Lily and Robert who few in the village know that their family was a casualty of the Depression early on and their fortune no longer exists.  With both their parents now gone, they must figure out a way to make ends meet.  They come up with one idea after another to bring in some much needed income while they also somehow become amateur detectives.  As she did in her two previous  books, Ms. Churchill presents first one murder victim and then another as Lily and Robert become entangled in solving the murder  And not content to have only one main plot at work, Churchill fully explores the plight of the average person as they deal with the Depression.  A most interesting part of the book is when the author describes the workers march on Washington, DC for wages as well as their living conditions in tent cities erected around this area.<br />While I enjoyed the mystery angle of this book, which is enough to satisfy most mystery readers, it is the description of the area around the Hudson and the characters that really interest me in these books.  Now once again I am waiting for the next title in this series to find out what everyone is doing and how life has been treating all of them.ain I am waiting for the next title in this series to find out what everyone is doing and how life has been treating all of them.	2002-09-12

And nowhere is learning achieved more than in Gail Tsukiyama's novel Women of the Silk, her first published title.  Not only does the author provide her readers with memorable characters but introduces us to the world of women silk workers and their sisterhood.<br />Pei Ling is the first-born daughter of Chinese peasant farmers.  Although her mother has been pregnant several times only Pei and her younger sister Li survive past infancy.  When she turns 8, Pei is brought to an area of China known for their silk factories.  Although she is unaware of what will happen to her once her father leaves, it is evident to the reader that she has been sold and her parents will receive a stipend for providing her as a silk worker.  Pei is at first shy and lonely but slowly learns her job and makes friends with an older silk worker, Ling.  After several years when Li become comfortable with her surroundings, Pei chooses to be bound to the sisterhood by partaking in the hair ceremony.  Once this ceremony is over, Li will not be free to marry or work elsewhere but pledges her life to the Sisterhood of silk workers.  Then as conditions worsen for the workers, it is obvious that change within the silk factories is necessary.  And then when Japan begins  to occupy China, the world Li and her sisters have known for so many years begins to crumble.<br />For me as reader this was a wonderful title and one filled with many learning experiences.  In the deft hands of Tsukiyama, I felt as though I was the silk worker learning my trade and making friendships with the other girls and women.  This book is not to be missed and when you finish it, I hope you will consider reading The Language of Threads which continues the story of Pei as China is occupied during WWII.	2002-09-05

This is the third book in the O'Hurley series and my least favorite so far.  Although there certainly was a love story between Chantel O'Hurley Hollywood actress and Quinn Doran the man hired to protect her, the wasn't the type of book by Roberts which I most enjoy.  As I often say, I really love Nora Roberts' pure romance books, not the romantic suspense titles.  Having said what I did, though, this is still an entertaining read.<br />When Chantal receives obsessive phone calls, flowers and notes her agent hires private investigator Quinn who is quite a good looking man.  At first there's the usual cat and mouse games between Chantal and Quinn, as she doesn't think he's necessary to protect her and he stubbornly refuses to leave.  Clearly there is an attraction between the two of them which both denies and they continue to resist these urges even though it's clear to everyone else something is brewing.  As usual there's the standard Nora Roberts reunion of the O'Hurley family as first sister Abby who is now pregnant arrives with her second husband (The Last Honest Woman) and then their parents Frank and Molly arrive for sister Maddy's wedding (Dance to the Piper).  But once the family wedding is over,  Chantel must reveal a long held secret that none of Quinn's snooping has unearthed and one which may forever change their relationship.  As romance readers and Nora Roberts fans know there always must be a happily ever after ending.  Quinn eventually finds the stalker, but not before Chantel's life is in danger, and finally Quinn and Chantel are able to pledge their devotion and love to one another.<br />I imagine that those readers who enjoy the romantic suspense genre will find this book a most enjoyable read.	2002-08-25

I read Skipping Christmas last November and while I wrote my review then, never got around to posting it.  Must have been the holidays that interfered.  In any event, as the days of summer dwindle down and thoughts turn to school beginning and cool weather, I thought this might be an appropriate time to remember what's around the corner.<br />As November turns to December who hasn't thought about skipping the holidays, whatever they may celebrate.  The very thought of shopping, sending cards, wrapping presents, cooking, baking and then entertaining is cause an anxiety attack even for the calmest of people.  Is it any wonder, then, that when I saw this book I just had to read it.  Now before you laugh at the name of the author, better known for legal thrillers, allow me to say this is an entertaining title and a perfect read before the holidays.<br />With their daughter off to Peru to serve in the Peace Corps, and Luther Krank figuring just how much they spent on Christmas last year, he makes the decision to skip Christmas.  At first his wife, Nora can't imagine forgoing the rituals and traditions of Christmas.  But when Luther proposes a cruise instead, Nora is only too happy to think of sun and surf instead of snow and shopping.  At first their decision seems to only affect the Kranks, but soon their neighbors and community observe they are skipping Christmas and now the Kranks must explain their decision which their friends and neighbors.  And when the Luther and Nora's circumstances change and these events unfold, Grisham has the perfect opportunity to send his readers a message about the true meaning of friendships and the real spirit of the holidays.  For as we all know it's the people in our lives that really count more than the gifts, decorations and food.<br />This is a worthwhile and most enjoyable read.  Just right to spend a few hours with when you're bedraggled from the holidays and start thinking about \\"Skipping Christmas.\\"	2002-08-25

Gulping this book down in a matter of hours and loving every page, I then read her newest book Dreaming Water and Tsukiyama's first book Women of the Silk.  Both books were wonderful and now that I have finished the sequel to Women of the Silk, The Language of Threads, I wish I could be reading all of these books for the first time.<br />The Language of Threads picks continues the story of Pei wh we first met in the previous book Women of the Silk.  The Language of Threads begins in 1938  Pei at 28 is bound for Hong Kong and the Japanese have begun occupying China.  At the age of 8, Pei who was given by her parents to the Sisterhood to become a silk worker.  But now the silk factories are all but gone and the other silk workers are scattered around China trying to steer clear of the Japanese.  Accompanying Pei on this voyage is Ji Shen, a 14 year-old girl, who after watching her parents and sister killed by the Japanese made her way to the girl's house of the Sisterhood where the silk workers vowed to care for her.  When the time comes for Pei to leave the area, she cannot forget the promises made to Ji Shen and makes plans to travel and care for her.<br />Once in Hong Kong, Pei is reunited with other sisters of the silk factory who now work as domestics in grand homes.  Pei is immediately employed but learns the hard way that she won't be treated as fairly as before in Hong Kong.  When she is accused of stealing from her employer, she is forced to leave her job.  But fate steps in and Pei finds herself working for a kindly English woman, Mrs. Finch who also allows Ji Shen to live with them.  As the months pass and the Japanese become more and more of a presence, these three women become very important to one another and act towards each other as if they are family members.  But once again life turns and when Mrs., Finch is sent to an internment camp for British citizens, Pei must not only find a way to care for herself and Ji Shen but to survive the Japanese takeover of Hong Kong.  And when tragedy strikes, once again Pei must make a life for herself and all those she holds dear.<br />The Language of Threads is a wonderful book although at times it is equally heart breaking.  We first meet Pei at 28 and when the book finishes she is 62.  Her story is well told and like the strands of silk she once handled comes together quite poignantly at the end.  And we, as readers rejoice in her life filled with dark days overshadowed by triumph and ultimately joy.  Like the characters from Tsukiyama's other books Pei is a well-crafted character who you will think of as a real person and won't soon forget.<br />I really loved both Women of the Silk and The Language of Threads and cannot recommend them enough.  Besides offering solid characterizations of the people, I learned about the lives of those young women sent by their families to work in the silk factories and life in Hong Kong during the Japanese takeover of China before and during WWII.  Most of all what I will always remember about these two books is the courageous woman who made a worthwhile life for herself and others against all odds.camp for British citizens, Pei must not only find a way to care for herself and Ji Shen but to survive the Japanese takeover of Hong Kong.

In her newest book, True Blue, Luanne Rice once again returns to the scene of two of her earlier books set at Hubbard's Point, Conn.  As she did in Firefly Beach and Safe Harbor, this author fills the pages of True Blue with an emotional and ultimately rewarding journey.<br />Rumer Larkin and Zeb Mayhew were always the typical boy and girl next door.  They filled their days with school, paper routes and meetings at the town diner where they carved their initials into an oak table and left notes for one another in a desk drawer, a tradition at the diner.  Their nights were spent on the roof of the Mayhew house where they star gazed and tested their knowledge about the heavens above.  As the years went by they become closer and closer but during college their relationship changed forever and Zeb moved far away while Rumer returned to Hubbard's Point after her education was completed.<br />Now, Zeb a well-known astronaut, is returning home in order to spend the summer at Hubbards point.  A crucial event in Zeb's life finds him re-evaluating the past twenty years since he's seen Rumer and he;s beginning to realize that Rumer  may be the only true blue woman in his life.  Traveling along with Zeb is his rebellious 17 year-old son who has suddenly dropped out of high school.  And as we realize from almost the first  page, Zeb's former wife and his son's mother is none other than Rumer's older sister Elizabeth.<br />Rumer, now a veterinarian, is content with her life. Caring for animals and a<br />well-respected member of the town, she finally feels as though she has put to rest any feelings she may have once had for Zeb.  But has she really put her feelings aside?  And  can Rumer  ever forgive her sister who is now a famous actress and the mother of her only nephew?  And what happens when Zeb's former home is to be torn down by the new owners forever changing the landscape of Hubbard's Point?.<br />From the first page to the last, I was entranced by the life and people of Hubbard's Point.  Besides Rumer, Zeb and Elizabeth, we meet the women of the Point who have lived there forever and are known as les Dames de la Roches and reminded me of the women from Colony by Anne Rivers Siddons.  We also become familiar with Quinn, Rumer's orphaned young teen-age friend who becomes a good friend of Michaels as they both help each other to become happy.  And we also become acquainted with Sixtus, Rumer's father, a man more prone to sailing the seas rather than staying at home who wishes true love for both of his daughters.  I loved all of these characters, but most of all really enjoyed reading as the plot evolved and Rumer and Zeb consider taking a second chance at love.<br />As a loyal reader of Luanne Rice's books for sometime, she never fails to offer me a wonderful and entertaining title. Not only does she describe family relationships beautifully, but strongly tugs at my heart and I suspect many other readers as well. True Blue is certainly no exception and I strongly recommend this book to those readers who enjoy an emotionally charged book. title.of Hubbard's Point.

Then a friend recommended Marrying the Mistress and now I have found a new author to explore further.  In the tradition of Maeve Binchy and Rosamunde Pilcher, Trollope introduces us to ordinary people who are faced with changes and new challenges in their lives.  And like Binchy and Pilcher, Trollope's characters become like family members who we come to appreciate and love.<br />Marrying the Mistress begins near London when Judge Guy Stockdale announces to his wife of 40 yeas that he wants a divorce.  Not only does he want a divorce but he has already made plans to marry a woman, a 31 year old lawyer, who has been his mistress for the last seven years.  As readers we now begin to see this revelation from different perspectives, the judges, his wife Laura, their two sons, a daughter-in law, grandchildren and finally Guy's mistress, Merrion.  While sides are drawn over this dilemma, most of the characters would agree that the mistress is quite lovely.  But as the plot develops and Guy's wife, at first pitiful and dependent becomes more assured leaving the reader to wonder what will happen next.  When a series of startling events occur we watch as these people's lives are further disrupted and the changes in their lives have far reaching consequences.<br />Joanna Trollope, a resident of England and a descendant of Anthony Trollope, has a keen ear and eye not only for characters, but for their homes and surroundings areas.  When the story takes place in Guy and Laura's suburban home we feel as if we are there and can see Laura's wonderful garden and the their dogs barking. And when Guy first meets Merrion during a train ride to London, we are seated next to them and privy to this meeting.  Marrying the Mistress is a wonderful read whose characters and their lives reach our hearts and make us think about our own decisions, mistakes and regrets.  Now that I've been introduced to Joanna Trollope's writings, I look forward to being further entertained by reading more of her books.a Trollope's writings, I look forward to being further entertained by reading more of her books.	2002-08-20

An ongoing relationship and an unfinished journey!<br />In 1999, Joan Anderson's book, A Year by the Sea was published to unanimous acclaim.  Written primarily as a memoir, the author focused on the year she separated from her husband and lived alone in their Cape Cod cottage. This slim volume spoke volumes to legions of women and quickly became a bestseller.  Now in her newest book, An Unfinished Marriage, Anderson continues her story as she reconciles with her husband and he moves to the Cape.<br />Certainly, Joan Anderson took a bold step by separating from her husband to find herself and perhaps in part to add a new dimension to her married life.  And while many women who are married for sometime would find this the thought of a solitary year intriguing, Anderson admits it was not always an easy experience.  Neither is everything so wonderful during the time Robin and Joan joined together again.<br />For Joan, the reunion is initially fraught with tension and compromise. While Robin has retired and is now seeking a new meaning and purpose to his life, Joan has already found this during her year of solitude.  Joan feels crowded by his presence both physically and emotionally.  As Anderson also described unearthed emotions in her first book, she continues to reveal her innermost thoughts concerning the changes and growth for them as individuals and as a married couple.  Month by month for the year of their reunion, Anderson charts the ups and downs of her marriage and their lives.  With total candor<br />and great insight, she presents a vivid look into the inner working of this union.  Drawing upon glimpses of their early, married life and their years as parents of two young boys, for many readers these scenes will serve as reminders of their own lives.  While at first I was put off by Anderson's thought and words likening them to literary whining, this was short lived as the book intensified with emotions and resolutions.  And all at once I came to fully understand the author's desires and wants not only for herself but for the two of them as a couple.<br />I do recommend reading both A Year by the Sea and An Unfinished Marriage.  Both books evoke memories of Nan Martin's journey in the fictional title Pull of the Moon by Elizabeth Berg.  This is a wonderful renewal of spirit both as a woman and wife.  I think that many would agree after reading this book that for Joan and Robin Anderson their journey continues and readers everywhere I imagine will wish them well.stand the author's desires and wants not only for herself but for the two of them as a couple.<br />I do recommend reading both A Year by the Sea and An Unfinished Marriage.

Step-Ball Change by Jeanne Ray is one of the most delightful books I've read in a long time and I highly recommend it to one and all.  In the tradition of authors like Susan Isaacs and Elinor Lipman, Jeanne Ray approaches family life with both tears of joy and sorrow.  And we as readers can't help falling in love with both her characters and writing.<br />Mimi and Tom McSwain have raised four children over the course of their marriage while Mimi owns and runs a dance school while Tom, a lawyer, works for the prosecutor's office in their town.  During a rare and tranquil evening come almost two simultaneous phone calls.  On one line comes the voice of their third born child announcing her engagement to a most eligible bachelor, while on the other line comes a sobbing phone call from Mimi's sister, Taffy, announcing that her husband has left her for a much younger woman.  While their house is undergoing what was supposed to be a  minor renovation, Tom and Mimi are beset by a host of problems with Ray treats with great wit and pathos. While Mimi worries if they have enough money to host a wedding of nearly 800 people, she must also contend with her sister's arrival and her poorly trained dog who bites everyone, her daughter's future mother-in-law who is busy choosing colors for bridesmaid's dresses and making appointments with a wedding party planner, her dance studio and a contractor and workmen who are now making the McSwain residence their second homes.  As you can imagine this book is filled with wonderful characters and some of the funniest scenes I've read recently.  Mimi who at 62 dreams of retiring although she still likes to do a step dance number or two, her husband Tom a calming influence for all who insisted that he and Mimi elope many years before, their youngest son, a law student, who also teaches at the dance school and everyone thinks is gay, Taffy, Mimi's younger sister who typifies a high maintenance  woman and who also has a few dancing surprises in store for Mimi and finally George, the black man hired to build a sun porch who winds up teaching the McSwain family a thing or two about life and love.<br />This is the perfect book for a hot day in the summer or come of think of it at any time.

Consider the following older titles, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Catcher in the Rye, The Temple of Gold by William Goldman or more recently Ellen Foster, Durable Goods and Bastard Out of Carolina.  Now consider the eloquent first novel, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold who introduces us to the character of Susie Salmon.  Susie, a 14 year old, was raped and murdered and in one of the most innovative plots in recent years narrates her story from heaven.  And before you say, Oh no, this book sounds morbid and not for me, let me be the first to say I never thought I would read this book, let alone enjoy it.  And now that Ive finished this title, I cant wait to let some time elapse and then rereading it for more thoughts on this book.<br />Susie Salmon is the oldest of three children living in a suburban Pennsylvania community.  Somewhat of a loner, before her death, Susie dreams that high school will change her life measurably. Susie is bright beyond her years and exhibits a unique curiosity and great wit even while relating incidents about her family from heaven.  Walking home from school one day, Susie is lured away by someone she knows and then meets her violent death.  From this point on till the end of the book, Susie relates the effect her death has on her parents, siblings and grandmother.  She watches as her parents cope with the preliminary news and then ensuing investigation while Susies body is never found.  We watch along with Susie as their lonely neighbor, Mr. Harvey is scrutinized and questioned although never arrested or charged.  We observe Susies friends, Paul the shy Indian student initially accused of the murder and Ruth who is able to communicate with Susie.  And our hearts ache as Susies younger sister Lindsey finds friendship and ultimately love during the years after this event, their brother Buckley grows up never really knowing Susie and their grandmother becomes a vital part of a family she hardly knew.  But most of all we cry as Susies father never gives up trying to find out what happened to Susie and her mother who most leave the family in order to rejoin them at a later time.<br />Sebolds writing is candid, poignant and heart rendering.  There are passages that took my breath, found me sighing away and reduced me to tears particularly the last two pages.  And her sense of irony at the end is more than worth the journey.  I truly think this is a must be read book.  The author, herself a rape victim has the rare gift of exploring what must be one of the most difficult events in a famiilys life making it enticing and ultimately a most rewarding read.uring the years after this event, their brother Buckley grows up never really knowing Susie and their grandmother becomes a vital part of a family she hardly knew.

I first became acquainted with the name Harlan Coben when I  signed onto an Internet book list several years ago.  At that time many of the readers were touting Coben's series, which featured Myron Bolitar, the feisty sports agent/private investigator. Although I never read any of these books, it was the premise of Coben's recent stand alone book, Tell No One, which interested me enough to read.  Literally gulping down this book, I looked forward to either reading the first book in the Bolitar series or another stand alone by this author.  And suddenly there was news of a new book, Gone for Good, which found me snatching it from the shelves the first day it appeared.  Now, I consider Harlan Coben one of my favorite thriller/mystery author and I do look forward to making the acquaintance of Myrom Bolitar shortly.<br />Gone for Good is set in and around Manhattan and the suburban community of Livingston, NJ.  Life in Livingston is presumably idyllic where children grow up thinking the world is theirs.  But this isn't the case for the ----------family.  Eleven years ago the oldest son Ken was accused of brutally murdering Julie Rogers, a neighbor and his brother's one time girlfriend.  Feeling from the scene and his family, and while there have been unconfirmed sightings of him in different countries the family chooses to believe he is dead.  That is until Sunny, Ken' smother dying from cancer tells her son Will that Ken is still very much alive.  With nothing more than these words and then a revealing photo and also realizing that Sunny was on heavy medication before her death, Will decides this might be just enough to find out in fact if his brother is till alive.  And while the plot certainly takes off from here, it certainly escalates when Will's girlfriend leaves him a cryptic note and then disappears leaving reader's to wonder if there is any connection between Sheila and Ken. And now the twist and turns come so fast and furiously that as you rush through the pages, you need to pay serious attention to the plot to keep up.<br />For all of the reasons I really enjoyed this book, not the least of them are Coben's wonderful characters.  Beginning with Will and his family, we meet Ken's two old school buddies The Ghost and Phil McGuane, both violent men who will stop at nothing to protect themselves or their interests.  We also meet Squares, a one time racist now turned Yoga guru who is more brother to Will than friend.  From the seamier side of Manhattan, we meet Wanda, a transvestite who leads Will to Sheilah's former boss, Louis Castleman, an unsavory man who is now a quadriplegic and is care for by Wanda.  And as we meet these characters We walk the mean streets of Manhattan and the tree lined streets of Livingston where Will and his father spend time reminiscing about Little League games, Ken and their family life.<br />This book is a hair-raising roller coaster of a read, which never lets up or disappoints the reader.  Imbued with family values the book also explores the themes of friendship, loyalty and betrayal.<br />The ending can best be described as both shocking and poignant. From the first page to the last, you will be riveted and when the book ends you'll wish you were starting it for the first time.<br />Sorry I must hurry but I must get to the bookstore to pick up Deal Breaker, the first book in the Bolitar series.

Readers of Adriana Trigiani's first two books in this trilogy, Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Holler, certainly have a great deal to look forward to when they pick up and read Milk Glass Moon. What reader wouldn't enjoy another visit to this mountain town in West Virginia, which the author describes so beautifully and fills with such vivid characters and events.  And if by chance you read this book without realizing it's the third installment in a series, you have the added pleasure of being able to go back and savor the first two books putting all of the pieces in the puzzle together.<br />At the beginning of Milk Glass Moon, which refers to what Jack's grandfather described as a smoky, hazy moon, life is pretty much the same for Ave Marie and Jack MacChesney.  Their marriage is a good and fulfilling one after several years and they look forward to the future together.  Ave Marie continues to work in the pharmacy she once owned while Jack is busy with his construction company.  Rounding out their lives is their daughter, Etta, a bright and adventurous 13 year old who is bound to turn Ave Marie's hair gray.  But life really never stays the same and once again Ave Marie is faced with new challenges in her life as well as the changes in her friends lives. Once again, we get to spend time with Ave and her beloved mountain friends from the first two books. Theodore Tipton, the former marching band leader who suddenly moves to New York City, Peter Rutledge who Ave Marie first met in Italy five years ago, Iva Lou, the brash and sexy book -mobile driver, Fleeta, the grouchy but big hearted employee of the pharmacy, Spec the paramedic Ave Marie used to work with and Ave Marie's large family in Italy. But ultimately it is the relationship between Ave Marie and Etta which Trigiani explores as Etta marches into adolescence and love.<br />This is an old fashioned book with old fashion ideals about family, friends, unconditional love and loyalty.  As Ms. Trigiani wrote so eloquently about love and marriage in Big Cherry Holler, this time the author writes beautifully about the pains of motherhood and children growing up.  The saying that \\"we give our children roots and wings\\" is never demonstrated better than it is within the pages of this book.  This is a wonderful book and evidence of why the first two books have captured so many reader's hearts and imaginations.  Although the author hasn't said definitively that this is the end of the series, I for one am hoping that she will continue to amuse us with the antics of the people both of Big Stone Gap and Italy.

The author is paid $4 million for the title and the book is hyped for months, one publication going so far as in March to call it \\"the best book of the summer.\\" Then the rights to the movie are optioned. And finally consider that John Grisham selects this book as the first selection of the Today show book club.  Sound familiar?  Well, unless you've been living out of the country or under a rock you didn't hear or watch this scenario play out and are not familiar with the book The Emperor of the Air or the author Stephen Carter.  I for one had read so much about forthcoming book and couldn't wait for it to be available and gulp it down.  Now that I have read it I do wonder what where all the cheering went to and if I missed something which others saw in this larger than life novel.  Yes, the first few chapters intrigued me,  but was 600 pages of detailed characterizations and an improbable scenario, (\\"Was there an editor,\\" I kept asking) worth my time and effort?  Not to me I'm sorry to say.  And before you think I was scared off by the size of the book or the many themes including current political race relations, I say again that I really did look forward to this book.<br />The book begins with the death of a Black judge.  Well known and well liked for the most part, this judge retired soon after his nomination for the position of Supreme Court judge in part because of his association with a well-known Mob leader.  His last days are spent dividing his time between his home in Washington and on Martha's Vineyard at Oak Park where he has long been considered an emperor. But shortly after his death the judge's daughter reveals to her brother Talcott and the main character that their father was killed and she's determined to find out why and who did it.  Enlisting his brothers aid won't be easy as Tal's wife is involved in her own nomination for a government position and their marriage isn't all that stable either.  Now the stage is set for what should have been a hair raising roller coaster ride of a book which quickly took on many convoluted plots and went downhill quickly.  As one reads on and on they begin to wonder what the author was really trying to say.  Was the book really about whether a judge died naturally or was killed or about his bid to become a Supreme Court Justice or was it really about another of the judge's daughters hit and run death and his attempts to find out who did this vile act or was it about Tals and his wife's marital problems and who is Angela and her boyfriend.  Finally was this really an attempt to explain to whites about prominent blacks living on the Gold Coast and the Vineyard.  Any one of these themes might have filled one book alone but in this case all these subjects were discussed and the book moved along at a tedious pace leaving me to wonder why I spent my time on this title.<br />Perhaps law professors are more verbose than other writers and if this is the case, then other readers knowing this may very well enjoy this title. But, despite all that I have said and my awarding this title with only one star which I rarely do, there were parts of the book which were somewhat interesting and well written.  Unfortunately there just weren't enough of them. Now I will be curious to see what Carter writes next if he decides to return to the world of fiction.  Despite all that I have said I would be willing to give him another chance hoping the next book would be much better than this one.ion for a government position and their marriage isn't all that stable either.

Nora Roberts is a romance writer who has the unique gift of being able to put her readers right between the pages of her books. In the case of Dance to the Piper, the reader feels as though they too are a dancer as a new show is about to open on Broadway.  And as always with this author there is double the reading pleasure as there is also a delightful romance too.<br />In the second book of the saga about the O'Hurley family,  Ms. Roberts tells the story of the dancing O'Hurley daughter, Maddy.  Preparing for a new show, Take It Off, this spirited young woman knows she cannot rest on accolades from her ;ast performances. She fully realizes that it will take both physical and mental strength to make a hit of this show and falling in love at this time is what she least expects to do.  But fall in love she does as she meets and then pursues a principal investor of the show, Reed Valentine.<br />I thought this book was a wonderful read.  So adeptly does Ms. Roberts present the life of a Broadway dancer and star that I often wondered if she patterned this character after a real dancer she knows.  I actually could see the dance numbers and feel the energy, to say nothing about how enjoyable was the romantic aspect.  And as an extra benefit of this book the reader is introduced to Reed's charming father and spends more time with the other members of the O'Hurley family.  I always think Nora Roberts's series books are her best and Dance to the Piper is another one of these which I highly recommend.	2002-07-26

As an avid reader I couldn't help but feel this way when I read the following opening lines from Big Stone Gap by Adiana Trigiani, \\"This weekend will be a good weekend for reading.\\"  And I felt my fingers skipping to turn the pages and begin reading more of this book.  Now that I've finished the novel by Ms. Trigiani , I too must add my kudos along with the many other readers who have also recommended and enjoyed this title. Like the authors Fannie Flagg and Rebecca Wells, Ms. Trigiani has assembled a cast of Southern characters who are homespun, fun loving and just quirky enough to appeal to reading audiences everywhere.<br />Ave Marie Mulligan at 35 is an unmarried pharmacist in Big Stone Gap, Virginia.  The product of an Italian mother and Scotch Irish father, who died some years before has come to accept her father's cruelty when she was younger.  She also has come to accept that her life most likely will never change either.  Running the local pharmacy, which she inherited, making deliveries to the hollers, working with the ambulance squad and directing the Outdoor Drama musical every summer fill her days and years.  But when Ava reads a letter from her recently deceased mother, she is left with some revelations and unsettling questions.  Now Ava must find out the answers and we as readers fully  realize that Ava's life will never be the same again.<br />Ms. Trigiani offers her readers a delightful book which will surely be read and reread by her many fans.  And the best part is that once you finished reading Big Stone Gap you can return to the area and people once again by reading the second book in this trilogy, Big Cherry Holler, and the recently published third and last book, Milk Glass Moon.  Take it from me, spending time with Ave Marie Mulligan with her friends in Big Stone Gap is a perfect way to spend any weekend.	2002-07-25

It is to a house in the area of Fortune's Rock located in England, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and a secluded beach, that newly married Honora and Sexton move to in June of 1929.  Honora looks forward to keeping house while Sexton will continue his job as traveling typewriter salesman.  The house they occupy is rather run down but in lieu of rent, Sexton has agreed to fix it up for the owners.  But when the house becomes available for them to buy and while they don't have all of the money, Sexton jumps at the opportunity to purchase it for their futures.  Unfortunately, for this couple and other characters in the book, the stock market crash is only weeks away and will ultimately test them economically but also emotionally.  In an eerily foreboding manner reminiscent of Shreve's earliest works, the author depicts the lives of characters caught up in events that will shatter their world as the book takes hold and readers race towards the climactic ending.<br />Told in alternating voices are a cast of wonderful character whom Shreve portrays so well that we feel as though we know them.  In addition to Sexton and Honora who spends time collecting sea glass on the beach, there is also the very wealthy Vivian who meets Honora on the beach and her one time lover and once wealthy Dickie.  Rounding out the characters are McDermott, a factory worker and labor organizer and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; 11 year old Alphonse who dreams of becoming a pilot. These are vivid characters we come to care about whose stories once set in motion, keep the reader wondering how their lives will play our and what will become of them at the end of the book.<br />And all the while, we are witnesses to these character's lives as they struggle with loyalty, trust, betrayal and solid marriages during a time when our country was gripped with both economic and moral dilemmas. And as we come to know more about them we fear for their lives as the climate of the country grows darker and darker.<br />While Honora continues to collect her beautiful sea glass, the reader marvels at how Shreve parallels her characters lives with the sea glass. How glass remains intact despite the pounding of the ocean waves and its journey to shore.  But people are more fragile as Shreve reminds us in this book and we mourn for these people as the pages turn almost by themselves.  While some might say that this title is a historical novel and few do research as well as Anita Shreve, it is also the portrayal of vastly different people who come together under difficult circumstances as they try to survive their own waves and pounding.  Few authors can evoke a period of time and place the way Shreve can and does.  Once again Ms. Shreve has written a worthwhile read and engaging title.mmas.

Elizabeth Berg is one of those writers who seldom if ever fails to entice her readers with a good book. Whether she is writing about a woman going through a divorce, Open House, or an adolescent on the brink of her first love, Joy School, to a woman turning 50 and questioning her life(Pull of The Moon), it's as if she writes about the breath and sole of women everywhere. As I've often said a so-so Berg book(which there has only been one in my opinion) is better than most other books.<br />And now Berg offers her readers a new book which contains short stories called Ordinary Life: Stories.  And while this may be a genre which man of her readres are not familiar with, it isn't a minutes too soon for them to fall in love with them as I did.  I will be the first to admit that while I seldom if ever read short stories, I did find that Berg's writing and her characters, as always, imemdiately beckoned to me, intrigued me and left me sighing for more when I ultimately finished the book.<br />The stories themselves are small vignettes about life and love among ordinary people. But in Berg's hands these peopel are anything but ordinary, quite the oppostie as for us the readers these people become extraodinary. The stories revolve around many of the themes Berg explores in her books.  Unconditional  love, betrayal, growing up , dealing with an illness but most of all how people affect each other's lives.  One can't help but see the similarities between the character of Mavis from the story Life, A Love Story and Nan from Pull of the Moon.  And  comparisons can also be made betwen the young woman Katie Nash from Durable Goods and the narrator of Matchmaker. Or again between the nurse in Never Change to the nurse in Sweet Revenge. But most of all I was blown away by the relationship between Lizzy and her ill mother in What Stays and couldn't help but think about the story the dauhgters and mother from What We Keep.  Finally for Elizabeth Berg readers who loved Pull of the Moon as I did, Berg offers us a glimpse into Martin's thoughts in a very poignant letter he writes to Nan as she travels about during her soul-searching odyssey.<br />Berg is a master of describing the emotional fabric of her characters lives and often gives her readers the impression that she is writing about them. How many times, while reading this author have I wanted to say to her, &quot;You write about me so well and we don't even know one another.&quot;<br />If I had any obejctions to this book of short stories it would be that it was over much too quickly.  As hard as I tried to read slowly, I couldn't help but gulp down the pages.  And like eating a good piece of chocolate, Berg's writings leave me yearning for more.n as I did, Berg offers us a glimpse into Martin's thoughts in a very poignant letter he writes to Nan as she travels about during her soul-searching odyssey.<br />Berg is a master of describing the emotional fabric of her characters lives and often gives her readers the impression that she is writing about them.

Once again as she did in her first novel for younger readers, Aquamarine, Alice Hoffman delights readers of all ages with her book Indigo.  Focusing on the magical nature of the sea, the author introduces us to memorable characters we won't soon forget.<br />Oak Grove is a town which fears water. Years before there was a devestating flood and now there is little water anywhere - pools are covered over, showers are taken with a minimum amount of time and few if any even think about a vacation at the sea.  In this dry town live three children linked by the parched land who do dream about seeing an ocean, river or even a stream.  Martha is best friends with Eel and Trout, adopted twins. For this young woman the loss of her mother and her father's unremitting grief and loneliness fill her with a need for the friendship of these brothers.  Martha is also beginning to think that life away from Oak Grove, near water would be much better for her as well as the twins.  For it is the the twins who have always had dreams about living near the ocean although why remains a mystery to them.  And then one day Martha decides its time for them to find the ocean but shortly into their journey,  the town of Oak Grove is threatened by a flood and the outcome of the flood and their adventure will forever change these young peoples lives.<br />In this slim volume, Hoffman has written volumes about the forces of love, friendships and following ones own paths and desires.  This is a book well suited for adolescents and adults alike. It is always a joy to read anything by Alice Hoffman, particularly when it is a moral tale.  And Nobody does realtionships and love better than Hoffman. I hope that she will continue to write books for younger adults and adults as well with these wonderful themes and I will surely continue to read all of her books.  In case you couldn't tell Alice Hoffman is one of my very favorite writers.	2002-06-28

Unfortunately this book didn't quite measure up to Sleepers for emotional impact but I also seriously question if any book on this subject will ever  equal the magnitude of Mario Puzo's, The Godfather.<br />In the prologue of the book, Angelo Vestiere, the gangster of the title, lies in a hosptial bed dying.  Next to him sits a man named Gabe who we have yet to learn how he figures into this story.  A woman named Mary enters the room, introduces herself to Gabe and offers to tell Gabe the complete story of Vestiere, the gangsters life.<br />Part I begins with Angelo and his family living in Italy.  From there we watch as the family journeys to America as part of the mass immigration which took place to this country and then Angelo's life on the streets of New York.  Finally we read about his rise to power as one the most feared gangsters. Interspersed in the chapters are relationships Angelo makes along the way which influence him; his marraige to Isabella which ends in tragedy and the gang wars which make him more and more feared and stronger and stronger within the organized crime network.  Perhaps its a bit too much of same old, same old but Part I of the book was rather ho hum and I only continued at this point to see if Part II would be more interesting.<br />And Part II did prove to be much better.  The character of Gabe,a 10 year old oprphan is introduced as the reader watches him come into Angelo's world, is taken under his wing, tutored by Angelo to become a ganster and the decision which Gabe must  make about his future.  And now we are able to make the connection between the man sitting at Angelo's bed and the young orphan from years go.  As Mary concludes her telling of Angelo Vestiere's life with a startling revelation, Gabe is finally able to complete a puzzle which has haunted him and ths tale of Angelo and Gabe comes full circle.<br />I finally did enjoy the book and now look forward to Mr. Carcaterra's next book.of Angelo and Gabe comes full circle.<br />I finally did enjoy the book and now look forward to Mr. Carcaterra's next book.	2002-06-28

Finally in the most moving parts of the book, Leo comes to terms with his and Jeannes inability to have a child from their marriage.  And as we read on we wonder what the outcome of this journey ultimately will be for Leo as well as Adam.<br />Terence Green's plot, characters and writing envelop the reader from the first page to the last one.  And if readers find  themselves ending the book with tears as I did, it is because the Nolans have become part of your family and you hate to leave them.  I look forward to reading more books by Terence Green but now am content to read his second book Witness to Life which also discusses another aspect of this families history.	2002-06-27

If one were to ask me who writes good romance books there might be many names I could offer.  But if someone were to ask me who is a wonderful romance writer, surely Nora Roberts would be the first name I would think of to suggest.  In addition, when it comes to writing family series, there are no other authors who even compare to this author.<br />Affaire Royale was originally published in 1986.  But time has done little this this engrossing read. From the first page when we meet Her Serene Princess Gabriella we are swept away by her, other members of the royal court and the small country of the fictitious Cordina.<br />The book opens in a hospital room where we learn that Brie, as she is commonly known, was recently kidnapped, returned but is suffering from amnesia.  With her kidnappers still not known, Bride's father Prince Armand has hired Reeve McGee, a family friend and former private investigator to protect his onyl daughter.  But Bride ghas other plans for Reeve and instead of dogging her every step as a bodyguard, wants him to help her remember her past.  Add a dose of mystery, political intrigue, smoldering passion and romance and once again you as the readers are captivated by the writing and characters Nora Roberts presents.<br />The first book in the Cordina Royal series, this series was continued with Command Performance published in 1987 and The Playboy Prince published in 1988.  Then just this past year Cordina's Crown Jewel, the 4th title was published which I'm<br /> sure was greeted with great happiness by Nora's many loyal fans.<br />While Nora Roberts has written sevevral trilogies and the 11 book MacGregor series, each book stands alone on its own as well as beckoning to readers.  Each time we close the book we are grateful to enter the worlds which Ms. Roberts writes about in such detail and characters who we come to feel we know personally.<br />Now I am looking forward to reading all of the books in this series.	2002-06-25

In his book, The Eyre Affair, the author Jasper Fforde has written a clever and humorous book which bookaholics will truly enjoy.  Set in England in 1985, Mr. Fforde has taken certain liberties which provide the reader with an intiguing and unforgettable plot.  Time travel and cloning which are both realities should delight readers in the imaginary world the author introduces us to.  England is now a police state with the government divided into Special Operative Units with each Unit  having a specific task.  And in a book about books and characters from books, the author cleverly uses names of book related characters and authors for this books characters which provide some nice recollections of other books.<br />Thursday Next, the main characters of this book is a member of Special Operations, SO-27 the Literary Detective Division.  Almost from the first page the reader is captivated by this feisty character who reminded me in some ways of an older Pippi Longstocking.  Once a Corporal assigned as a driver to the Armored Brigade, Thursday saw first hand fierce and bloody battles in the Crimea where her brother also lost his life.  Now in 1985, she spends her time finding those criminals who steal valuable editions of books or alter the characters which affect the outcome of the books. But her life away from work is rather mundane as she broods over her man who got away and is visited from time to time by her father, a time traveler who is out of favor with the government.  But suddenly, things are heating up as prime characters are being murdered in books and when Jane Eyre is missing from the pages of this book, Thursday knows she has the biggest case of her life right in her hands.  Helping her out are a wonderful cast of characters which include an executive for a powerful company up to no good, an arch villain with the name of Archeron Hades, Thursday's ex- lover, her father whose \\"face could stop a clock\\" and even Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre herself.  What takes place in the rest of the book is a roller coaster ride filled with many hilarious and unusual book moments.<br />Mr. Fforde has crafted an innovative plot which is successfully achieved by his equally wonderful characters.  The best part is the recent announcement that the author's next book will continue with the life and times of Thursday Next and I for one will be happy to see what she has been up to. This reader always likes to have something to look forwrd to and I can't think of anything better than another title by Jasper Fforde.s place in the rest of the book is a roller coaster ride filled with many hilarious and unusual book moments.<br />Mr. Fforde has crafted an innovative plot which is successfully achieved by his equally wonderful characters.

The first book in a series featuring four females, 1st to Die by James Patterson, is a hair raising action packed title.  Known for his detective novels featuring Alex Cross and now the romantic novel Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, Patterson once again pleases his reading audience with this thriller title.<br />The book which begins as a flashback features four women, with interesting careers who form a a club to investigate similar murders. It seems as though newlyweds are systematically being killed on their wedding nights confounding the authorities in San Francisco as well as other nearby areas.<br />Lindsay, a police detective has recently been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness.  Determined to continue her life as before, she seeks the help of three other women.  Her other cohorts include Claire a medical examiner, Cindy a young reporter assigned to cover the case and Jill a district attorney who may very well prosecute the possible murderer.<br />As the women bond topgether and alliances are forged, the women find themselves looking for a very crafty and cagey serial killer.  They also continue to deal with their own personal lives.  And when they finally are closing in on the probable suspect, each of them faces the possibility of their own demise.<br />Once again Patterson has written a fast paced book where the pages virtually turn themselves.  As he did in his series featuring Alex Cross, the author provides readers with interesting characters and twists and turns its hard to imagine. I for one can't wait to read the next intallment of this series to find out how life is treating these women.	2002-06-24

In recent years, many fiction titles written by women authors focus on female relationships featuring a particular location or occupation.  In the past these relationships have taken place  in a beauty parlor as was described in Lorna Landvik's book Patty Jane's House of Curl or the Hollers as in Big Stone Gap by Adriani Trigiani and even a friendship group as in The Saving Graces by Patricia Gaffney and now a bakery as in Bread Alone, the first book by Judith Ryan Hendricks.  And while the topic isn't entirely new the author did a fairly good job of conveying the plot in an enjoyable manner using an interesting location and city.<br />Wyn Morrison is an unfulfilled woman.  Married to a succesful man with a poor job record before her and no encouragement from her husband, she is a familiar face on the ladies luncheon circuit, tennis courts and charity events.  In every sense of the word Wyn is David's wife, dressing up for him when they go out and smiling at dinners with clients.  Somehow, though, Wyn becomes rather complacent about her life which can't be said for her husband. Suddenly Wyn finds herself with a husband who is seeking a divorce from her so he can marry another woman.  While Wyn is somewhat adrift at first, as we read on we sense that now Wyn has the opportunity to strike out on her own and find her way alone.  And all the while we are the witnesses as she stumbles into a bakery while visiting a friend in Seattle.  Finding out that extra hands are needed at the bakery, Wyn finds herself suggesting that she become part of the satff.  And within days she has flour up to her elbows as this job brings back a flood of memories about her student days when she apprenticed to a baker with a small shop in a town near Paris.  As Wyn bakes bread she also tries to figure out why her life turned out the way it did and what she can now do to make it better.  In no time at all Wyn becomes ingrained in the life of the Seattle bakery making friends with other workers as well as neighbors eager for her company and Wyn knows she ia at home finally.<br />If this book is somewhat reminiscent of other titles where a newly divorced woman first alone and lonely, finds a job, grows up and begins to lead a productive life, it is Judith Ryan Hendricks pleasant writing and attention to emotions which does set this book apart.  And as an added bonus the author manages to capture the vibrancy, sights, sounds and smells of the wonderful city of Seattle.as well as neighbors eager for her company and Wyn knows she ia at home finally.<br />If this book is somewhat reminiscent of other titles where a newly divorced woman first alone and lonely, finds a job, grows up and begins to lead a productive life, it is Judith Ryan Hendricks pleasant writing and attention to emotions which does set this book apart.

And when I think of why I did there are several reasons.  To begin with I also grew up in Manhattan like Ms. Volk and lived next door to and around the corner from my large multi-generational Jewish family.  Like Ms. Volk I can also remember leaving for camp via Grand Central and shopping at now defunct NY stores like Best & Co.with my mother. I might also have loved this book because for close to 40 years my father was in the catering business and I too can remember our food being delivered and that general feeling of being stuffed. And wasn't I surpirsed as I read this book that I even knew a couple of people the author wrote about in this wonderful memoir. But most of all I loved this book because it brought back to me many of my childhood memories and a way of life which I remember and is now sadly gone as we grow up and our world today is so differnt from the way it used to be.  No matter what the reason, though, I lapped this book up and gulped it down.  And now I keep suggesting it to everyone who will listen to read this book because as much as this is a New York tale, I think it has a broad appeal for readers everywhere who enjoy the story of a family not only devoted to the restaurant business but to each other as well.<br />Like Ruth Reichl's two memoirs, Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples, the author has done a fine job of describing her family, the restaurant business and her own accomplishments.  This book was a pleasure to read and now I say Bon Apetit to you Ms. Volk.  I know I will read this book again and again and and will savor it a bit more each time.	2002-06-24

Hannah, knowing she is not what she appears contains her feelings for Prince Bennett lest her true position at the Royal Palace is revealed. For Hannah is neither an ordinary companion, plain or demure woman.<br />Nora Roberts is perhaps the most prolific romance writer today. With over 140 titles to he name she is well known as a writer of romantic suspense novels, trilogies, family series as well as futuristic romantic mysteries written under the name JD Robb.  Whie I have read books from each of her genres, it is her trilogies and series which I enjoy the most. Its always with a feeling akin to coming home when I pick up a book in one of Nora's series and learn more about a family member or friend.  And The Playboy Prince is no exception.  Now I look forward to reading Cordina's Crown Jewel which was published this year and continues the story of yet another royal family member.	2002-06-05

First appearing in the title Durable Goods, Katie is a motherless 11 year old living on an army base in Texas.  Next we meet up with Katie in Joy School, as Katie moves to Missouri and falls in love with an \\"older man.\\"  Now in Berg's newest book, True to Form, we find Katie feeling the tugs of adolescence as her father remarries and she continues to meet new people and experiences new adventures.<br />As summer vacation approaches, Katie has all sorts of plans in mind which include getting a great summer job, winning a local radio contest, which offers a trip anywhere in the US, and most of all becoming popular.  But her plans are severely altered when her father tells her has has found two summer jobs for her.  These are baby-sitting for the rowdy Wexler boys and helping out an elderly couple.  As if matters weren't bad enough, her only friend Katie informs her that her mother has become a Girl Scout leader and they expect Katie to join their troop.  Now instead of the summer she planned, Katie spends her days breaking up arguments between the three young boys, helping Mr. Randolph care for his ailing wife and spending an overnight in Cynthia's living room with the Girl Scouts. Even winning a trip to Texas and seeing her best friend does little to lift her spirits. But then an opportunity to attend a prestigious private school and invitations from a popular group may turn this into the very best summer, or so Katie thinks.<br />As we all know life is a series of lessons to be learned and by the end of True to Form Katie learns about some of lifes most important ones.  Katie will learn how friends can and do come in all ages, what makes a good friend and how one can even betray a true and loyal friend. In wonderful passages, Elizabeth Berg reminds us what it means to be a young adult feeling their way and learning about life through the eyes of those who have experienced all of this before.  Through her ups and downs, though, Katie retains her feisty spirit and a maturity beyond her years.  She is Durable Goods, a Joy Scool to learn from and always True to Form.<br />To many readers, Elizabeth Berg has the uncanny knack of making her readers feel as if they are participants in her books and not merely bystanders.  And sometimes I almost feel as though I am the main character of the book so well does Berg capture the moods and feelings of these characters.  In The Pull of the Moon, I truly thought Berg was writing about me so closely did I identify with the feelings expressed by the character Nan Martin.  And then in Open House, although never divorced, I was  Samantha when her marriage failed and she moved onto new relationships and confidence.  So it was when I read True to Form that I was Katie Nash baby-sitting, helping out the Randolphs and being accepted by the in crowd.  I was Katie Nash  learning about life as maturity begins and we take on new and different responsibilities while watching as other people's lives are ending. As one reads the pages of this book one can't help but feel the warm summer breezes, hear the voice of Mr. Randolph talking to Katie and truly feel Katie's longings for acceptance and love.  Few authors today evoke such strong feelings for me as a reader as Elizabeth Berg does.  And it is because of her wonderful characters, witty dialogue and poignancy that I consider Elizabeth Berg among my very favorite writers today.  While any Berg book is cause for excitement, I sincerely hope that she will also continue to let us into Katies world so we can learn more about her life and also more about ourselves.of those who have experienced all of this before.

I seriously doubted that I would ever find another book by this author which I would ever love or think about as much as this title.  But now that I have finished reading Dreaming Water, her newest title, I must admit that I loved this book just a bit more.  Perhaps it is the mother in me as to why this book had such an impact on me or because Tsuliyama has the rare ability to entice her her readers with her first words and doesn't let go until the last ones.  As she did in The Samurai's Garden, in this novel, Tsukiyama introduces us to wonderful charcters who live unusual lives due to physical and emotional limitations which in part are forced upon them. Told in alternating voices, we come to know these characters, feel for them and grieve along with them.  And all the while one keeps asking themselves, why do bad things happen to good people?  Not an easy questions to answer. But in the hands of a gifted writer like Tsukiyama, this book which takes place over two days is written as delicately and beautiflly as the gardens and flowers she so often describes in her books.<br />Against prejudices fueled by WW II, in 1960,Cat and Max, establish a life in Nothern California in a small university town.  Max, a Japanese Amercian, teaches while Cat takes care of their one precious daughter, Hana.  It is this child, who is raised with the background of her mother's Italtian family and her father's Japanese heritage that is at the center of Dreaming Water. While Hana is a bright and lively child she is very small for her age which concerns her parents.  Then at the age of 13 she is diagnosed with Werner's Disease, a disease which brings on the rapid onset of old age although the effects won't become obvious till she is in her 20's.  Terrified for her future Cat and Max are determined to bring Hana up with as normal a life as possible. Now the years have passed quickly by and Max is dead and Hana at 38 resembles a woman of 80. Her mother, at 62, is Hana's solecaregiver and still grieves for her husband who has been dead for three years. Cat also mourns for the missed opportunites and life her daughter has missed out on because of this disease.  She worries about how much time she has left with Hana and what she will do once Hana dies.  And Hana also thinks about her missed opporutunities and adventures and worries about her mother's life without both her husband and someday her daughter.<br />Then Hana's childhood friend, Laura, on the verge of a divorce, comes to visit Hana with her two young children.  Hana hasn't seen this friend in many years although they correspond frequently and she is the god-mother to her children. Josephine, the older of the two children, at 13 is sullen and angry at her mother and father over their impending divorce. Clearly she is not an endearing child to anybody but is intrigued by Han and her illness.  For Hana, Josephine is just what she needs. Suddenly Hana has a goal and purpose to whatever time is left to her.  And in the end Josephine and Hana give to each other a precious gift of understanding and friendship.<br />This is a tender, poignant and at times heartbreaking novel.  As the author weaves this tale, her characters reflect on their past and their concern for the future.  And as I read, I couldn't help but feel these characters burdens and ultimate joys with each other and their lives.  Certainly the book speaks to the human spirit and to every parent and caregiver as Tsukiyama says, &quot;Mothers and their children are in a category all their own.  There's no bond so strong in the entire world.  No love so instaneous anmd forgiving.&quot;  To my mind there are few other books which portray this wonderful, and at times confusing relationship between a mother and daughter so memorably and gracefully as this book does.<br />Thank you, once again , Ms. Tuskiyama foraffording your readers such a wonderful and insightful journey.for affording your readers such a wonderful and insightful journey.	2002-04-25

But becoming a distance walker forced me to evaluate what I coud be doing while walking miles and miles.  While music seemed like one idea, knowing my love for books, listening to a tape seemed a more apporpriate choice.  Today I finished Firebird, written by Janice Graham and read by Richard Poe.  I must also tell you that previously to listening to this book, I also read the book several years ago.<br />And while I enjoyed the reader, Richard Poe, very much, I had the same feeling about the tape as I did about the book.  I sensed in both cases that Janice Graham is a good writer but tends to over do things and tried a bit to hard to covey both emotions and descriptions.  Some of her paragraphs and sentences were lengthy and at times bordered on pure sap. And while at times I really felt the emotions or could see the land, it became just too much to absorb them and then continue on to the next passage. I'm not sure I could also believe the love triangle and the outcome of both betrayal and tragedy but I wouldn't say the book didn't have some merit.  I guess I just wanted fewer words or less adjectives to describe the land and feelings. All and all if we say some books are too sparsely written, this one really won an award for being too verbose.<br />On the plus side, though, I must have thought that Graham could do better and I recently also read her newest book, Sarah's Window, which I found to be a poignant and well written book.	2002-03-31

In the tradition of Harold Pinter's works and Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland, Norris has told the story of the Mahoney family using the technique of presenting the family in present times and revealing more about them by moving through the past.<br />Ww first meet the Mahoney clan at the Jersey Shore as the Mahoney parents wait for each of their four children arrive to celebrate Christmas.  Each of these children have past histories with each other and themselves and as in any family there are many emotional dynamics at work.  The oldest daughter, a doctor, is coping with her demanding lifestyle and a reliance on alcohol to get through her days.  The second daughter, who is married, is dealing with an emotional illness and her reliance on drugs to \\"keep her normal.\\"  The third child, a chef in England, longs to be with his girlfriend and is most content living far from his parents and siblings. Finally trhere is the youngest daughter, a vetenarian who can't bear to be separated from her woman lover whom she met in college.  And presiding over this holiday reunion are the Mahoney parents who aren't quite sure who these adults belong to.<br />As the name of the book implies, readers are offered verbal vignettes about this family which serve as literary snapshots of this family.  The book ends when the children are quite young and have spent the day at the Jersey shore with their parents.  As they pack up and head for home all is before them but already one senses that some of the seeds have been planted for their futures.  And while we as readers know most of the future, it is intriguing to see the children evolve and to put the puzzle pieces together till we finish the book.<br />This was a poignant novel especially for anybody who has raised a child and wondered \\"what if\\" or \\"why?\\"<br />This was a fine first novel to read and savor.  And now I look forward to another book by William Norris.forward to another book by William Norris.	2002-03-28

For sometime I have been told by many readers how much they enjoyed this book and now I wonder why it took me so long to pick up this title. Now I can only agree wholeheartedly with these readers and add my grateful appreciation to this author for writing such a wonderful book.<br />Beginning in prewar China, we travel with Stephen a 20 year old man recuperating from tuberculosis, to his grandfathers beach house in Japan.  Isolated from his family and friends in Hong Kong and his studies at the University, Stephens sole companion in Japan is Matsu, caretaker and gardener of the beach house. At first there relationship is strained and they have little in common.  But as Stephen begins to paint and Matsu works in the garden, they begin to interact with one another and eventually become the best of friends.  As Matsu introduces Stephen to the surrounding villages of Tarumi and Yamaguchi, Stephen also becomes acquainted with Matsu's friends which include Sachi and Kenzo.  And as Stephen becomes more familiar with them he also learns more about their lives and entanglements and we as readers are first intrigued by these three people and then become enchanted as their stories unfold.  Ultimately we learn as Stephen does about life, loyalty to family and friends, betrayal, attachments but most of all unconditional love.  We watch as Stephen becomes more and more ingrained in the daily lives surrounding the beach house while Japan begins to invade China and Stephen's own family is going through their own eprsoanl upheavals. All too soon, with his health restored, Stephen knows he will need to leave this solitary life at Tarumi.  The approaching war and distance leaves both him and readers to wonder if he will ever see these people again.<br />Gail Tsukiyama has crafted a marvelous novel with layers placed upon layers to tell the story of extraordinary friendships.  I found that when I read this book it was as if I was a next door neighbor to the beach hosue and priuvy to all that happened in these people's lives. And as I closed the book I had a profound sense of loneliness that my visit with them had come to an end. Although I seldom yearn for a sequel, I would love to know how life treated these characters in the future.gain.  <br />Gail Tsukiyama has crafted a marvelous novel with layers placed upon layers to tell the story of extraordinary friendships.

The book I chose was The Christmas Box by Richard Paul Evans which was actually a re-read for me but proved to be even more meaningful this time than the first time I read it sevevral years ago.  Coincidentally earlier in the month I read The Christmas Box Miracle where Evans described how he came to write The Christmas Box and the tremendous popularity this small book has received.  Both titles, seemed then and now, most appropriate choices.<br />Today many readers are familiar with the book and the movie based on this book which starred Maureen O'Hara and Richard Thomas.  Originally written as a gift for Evans's two daughter, The Christmas Box provides readers with a rather simplr and inspiring story of an elderly woman and the young family who she hires to help her out with her large home.  As they live with this woman, her story of love and devotion is told through an antique Christmas Box that is also connected to the elderly woman's daughter.  The message which is time;ess allows one to realize not only the true spirit of the holidays but a parents unconditional love for their children.<br />The events of Septemebr 11th were certainly on my mind then as they are now, and as I finished this book I grieved for the many parents who lost children and the many children who lost parents.  In some ways I found this inspirational book provided me with the profound hope for better days in the future.	2002-03-26

Several years ago I watched a TV movie called The Christmas Box, which starred Maureen O'Hara and Richard Thomas.  I'm not sure exactly what attracted me to this prsentation, most likely the cast, but not only did I enjoy the perfromances but more importantly the message of this made for TV movie.  A few weeks after this I came across a book with this title and read the dust jacket. Immediately, I realized the TV movie was based on this book and I just had to read it.  Not only did I gulp down this book the time I read it but almost as soon as I finished it I just had to read it again.  And since that time I have read The Christmas Box almost every holiday season and all of Richard Paul Evans other titles as well.  Today, this small book continues to speak volumes and has affected the lives of many readers, perhaps most of all the author and his family.<br />One would have to say that the success of this book is truly a miracle.  And it is this very sucess which Evans addresses in his new book titled The Christmas Box Miracle.  Part memoir, part philosophy, in this book Evans offers his readers the story behind the writing of The Christmas Box, which was intended only as a gift for his two small daughters.<br />Evans begins this book by discussing his basic philosophy and the premise that there are forces at work, some known and some unknown, which alter our lives.  He then depicts his large Mormon family and the prophecy of hsi grandfathers who said that, &quot;He (Evans) would walk among noble men and royalty.&quot;  He describes his fathers lucrative job and the material lives his  family was afforded and then his fathers loss of his job and their move back to Utah.  Moving on to his college years, Evans relates sevevral instances when divine intervention led him to decisions whih altered his life.  And in some instances even saved his life. Finally and for me the most intersting part of the book is when Evans explains to readers how a small book which was originally self published and handed out to 20 family members and friends became a number one bestseller and continues to be sold around the world.<br />As I finished The Christmas Box Miracle, I thought about the role of miracles, angels, faith, dtermination and most of all the greatest gift in our lives, the gift of love.  Mr. Evans always supplies these basic themes in his books and offers his readers hope during devestating times and even healing from life's cruelest blows.  May he continue to reach out to audiences and spread these messages.ally self published and handed out to 20 family members and friends became a number one bestseller and continues to be sold around the world.<br />As I finished The Christmas Box Miracle, I thought about the role of miracles, angels, faith, dtermination and most of all the greatest gift in our lives, the gift of love.

The previous two books, Anything Goes and In the Still of the Night were delightful light mysteries which introduced us to a wonderful mansion on the Hudson River occupied by wonderful characters.  And now with this, her third book in the series, she continues to engage many of her readers who also remember her Jane Jeffrey mysteries.<br />Set during the Depression, the once wealthy Lily and Robert, brother and sister, continue to occupy the home left to them, with certain stipulations, by their great uncle.  Their eventual inheritance is perdicated on the English law of Grace and Favor whereby they must not only occupy the home, but also work in the community for a period of time before they inherit anything.  The house comes with an array of interesting people who work for them as well as townspeople who quickly become part of their lives.<br />But times are tough for all including Robert and Lily who are unaccustomed to worrying about money or working.  Few in the village know who their parents were or the fact that they are now broke.  As it happens in Churchills previous books a murder takes place which seems to occupy Robert and Lily's interest.  Not only does the reader become involved with first one murder and then another, but at the same time Churchill gives us a mini Depression history lesson describing conditions as the towns local newspaperman covers thw Workers March on Washington for Wages.  We become familiar with tent cities and the people who are forced to live in them as they too seek out ways of earning money and being renumerated fairly.<br />While I enjoy the mystery angle of these books, which is enough to satisfy any reader, for me it is the description of the area surrounding the Hudson River and the characters who really interst me in these books.  Now I am once again waiting for the next book in this series to find out what everybody is up to.up to.	2002-03-25

Finally a Nicholas Sparks Book I Loved	Generally speaking when I read a new author, I use a three book rule. If I'm not real happy after reading the first book I will always try another book by the author, sometimes even two books to see if I feel any differently. Then and only then do I allow myself to say I won't read the author again.  But sometimes I even go the final distance and try a fourth book to make up my mind. And it may very well be this book which makes me a loyal fan and future reader of the author.<br />What I just described above is exactly what happened to me concerning Nicholas Sparks and his books.  While many readers loved The Notebook, Message in the Bottle and A Walk to Remember (in my opinion a rehash of Love Story by Erich Segal), none of these books even remotely moved me as they did so many other readers.<br />And so I passed on reading The Rescue and never expected to pick up another Sparks book again, but then a funny thing happened to me while browsing the library shelves.  Seeking a comfort book shortly after 9/11, I found msyelf looking at A Bend in the Road, thinking I'd try another Saprks book.  Over the next two days I literally gulped down the pages and loved every word, characters and description.  Finally, now I can shout out loud that I read a Nicholas Sparks book I loved.<br />The story of A Bend in the Road begins two years after Miles Ryan's high school sweetheart and wife dies in a hit and run accident.  The responsible party has never been found and looking for this person consumes Miles who is also the town's deputy sheriff.  Miles isn't the only one who misses Missy Ryan.  There is also their 6 year old son Jonah who can't imagine what happened to his mother when he was so young.  Now as each day passes, Miles is more and more determined to find the man or woman responsible for this tragedy.<br />Then Sarah Andrews, newly divorced and transplanted to the area, becomes Jonah's teacher. Discovering that he is weak in elementary skills she offers to tutor Joanh after school.  This puts Sarah directly in Miles' path.  At first reluctant to become involved in a realtionship with a woman who he is attracted to, Miles tries to steer clear of Sarah.  But eventually their mutual interest in each other finds them dating and pursuing more than a friendship because of Jonah.  Then as their relationship grows stronger, the past comes back to haunt the two of them.  And all the while I was left furiously turning pages while sitting on the edge of my seat wondering as to the outcome of the book.<br />I truly loved this book and have learned a valuable lesson from reading this title. Just as we were taught never to judge a book by its cover, I also now understand why its important to sometimes give an author several chances before dismissing them entirely.  For one may find, as I did, that it is the very next read which may be that special book that they will always remember.

I will be the first to admit that I really enjoy books and movies which take place at a boarding school, i.e. Daddy Long-Legs by Jean Webster and New Girls by Beth Gutcheon or on a college campus setting as in Red Leaves by Paullina Simons. I also seem to enjoy a good psychological mystery as well.  That said, I'm afraid that reading The Lake of Dead Langauages never seemed to interest me as much as when I first opened up the book and read the dust jacket notes.  Perhaps it was the comparison to Donna Tartt's well reviewed book, The Secret History, which put my nose out of joint or maybe it was the fact that this book quickly wallowed in murky V.C Andrews territory while  all the while this book pretended to be something much grander with its talk about Greek mythology and the high school subject of Latin, often referred to as a dead langauge.<br />Jane Hudson, on the verge of a divorce and the mother of a young child, returns to the boarding shcool she attended as a scholarship student.  The very sight of the school Heart Lake and the lake itself, where school activities and private assignations took place, is enough to send Jane reeling back to her senior year when scandal rocked the once very proud and illustrious institutuion. Suddenly Jane begins receiving messages which seem to have been lifted straight from her writing journal which has been missing since that fateful last year. And as if this isn't bad enough, copy cat incidences from that year seem to be happening once again.  It is at this point that the book takes off on the most dizzying and wild roller coaster ride which eventually had me scratching my head wondering why I bothered to finish this book.<br />On the plus side I wil agree with the readers who said the writing and descriptions especially about the freezing lake, cold weather and ice storms was most lyrical. But I found I didn't much care for the main characters or some of the other principl players. Try as I might I found these people and the plot so bizarre and much too much of a convoluted tale.  Way before the end of the book, I netiher cared what happened to Jane or her students or the school itself. After a while I found myself comparing this book to a maudlin romantic suspense book.  And don't get me wrong.  If this was the authors intention that would have been fine and I might have expected it but she tried so hard to make this such a serious book.  Finally it was the last two pages and coincidences which were simply too much as the author provided her readers with a happily ever after ending which was truly ridiculous.<br />Guess the next time I expect a good read from a boarding school or college campus, I better think twice.idn't much care for the main characters or some of the other principl players.

With wonderful illustrations of stamps from far away places and beauiful calligraphy on notes which fold out from actual envelopes, the author engages his readers with further tales about Griffin and Sabine.  While this book is  a bit darker than his others and also engages two more characters in the search for Griffin and Sabine, overall this title is a welcome addition to the first three books which were so very unique when they were first published.<br />Now, after almost a decade's absence from the literary scene, its nice to know that Griffin and Sabine are alive and well. But if we still don't know exactly where they are in the world, one wonders if Mr. Bantock is having too much fun writing these books to ever let us find out.	2002-02-12

Whether you are traveling by car cross country or simply strolling in the park with a walkman, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone narrated by Jim Dale, is one of the best ways  to spend time with Harry and his friends.  And Jim Dale is the perfect reader for this book as he makes life at the Durlseys and life at Hogwart's School come alive.  It comes as no surprise that it isn't hard to imagine Hagrid or Mr. Dursley or even Hermnione uttering the words while listening to the tape.  But what is hard to do is imagining that Jim Dale is able to capture their voices so well that its as if they are played by individual readers.<br />While I don't ordinarily enjoy audiotapes, listening to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone made a convert out of me. While I think I will always prefer reading a book first, I really had a good time listening to this tape.  But a word of advice from me, skip the movie and if you'ver already read the book, move on quickly to the audiotape of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets which I am currently listenig to and enjoying just as much.	2002-02-12

Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Papers also tells of the warm relationship between Mary and her ailing sister and model Lydia.  Long an admirer of Mary Cassatt's works, I looked forward to reading this book but unfortunately I never found myself in the Cassatt world as I did with Vermeer's works when I read the books mentioned above.<br />Lydia Cassatt, the older sister of Mary, is afflicted with Bright's disease a debilitating illness that ultimately leads to death. While Lydia suffers for weeks on end, when she is feeling good, Mary urges her to sit for her paintings.  And as Mary paints, Lydia reflects on the artisty of her sister as well as her life filled with family and travels.  Lydia also reflects on Mary's relationship with the artist Degas and her younger sisters creative passion for all things both artistic and spiritual.<br />While reproductions of the actual paintings Lydia sat for are included, the book was never as intersting as imagining what the paintings were all about. This is a rather short novel which I'm afraid didn't shed enough light on Mary Cassatt or her sister.  Finally, it didn't leave me with the feeling of doing moreresearch on these women as I did about Vermeer after reading the Chevlaier and Vreeland books.	2002-02-07

It may be true that when an author becomes enormously popular while writing a suspenseful series, they're under some sort of pressure to keep writing more and more covoluted or even more and more bizarre plots to keep readers interested.  Enter James Patterson not entirely unknown for some strange plots in his stand aloen books or even bizarre premises i.e., his older title When the Wind Blows where children are gnetically altered in the womb so they are born with wings and can fly. Once again in his latest Alex Cross book, Patterson introduces several more bizarre elemnts to a case Alex tries to solve.<br />In the novel, Violets are Blue, two brothers are featured as grisly serial killers whose murders at times either resemble the work of vampires or tigers.  Now thousands of readers favorite psychology/detective is on a mission to find the killer when his partner is found dead.  And if this isn't enough, almost immediately in another part of the country another murder occurs which almost mimcs Alex's partners death.  As Alex crisscrosses the nation investigating these bizarre murders and some other very weird folks, somebody known as the Mastermind is keeping track of Alex's every move.  Its as if this individual, who some readers may remember from the previous book Roses are Red, is always one step in front of Alex taunting him with warning phone calls and threats agaisnt his family.  Alex spends the majority of the book preplexed, confused, overworked and overwrought.  By the end, Patterson ties up at least two parts of the plots neatly but leaves one danglgnthread.  And it is this thread which left this reader perplexed, confused and overwrought.  For it seems that this may be the end of Alex Cross or is it?<br />Fear not Patterson fans if this is the end for dear Alex.  We can eagerly wait for the second book featuring the Womens Murder Club from 1st to Die and perhaps another romance goodie like Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas.

As a middle aged woman long out of high school, I have very little, if any recollections of student government elections.  But if I did, I seriously doubt they would resemble anything which took place in this book.  Election, by Tom Perrotta,  is a fast read filled with satirical nuances and some rather wild goings on.  Narrated by the teacher Mr. M, one can't help but be both amused and then shocked at some of the events which take place during this simple election.  Using the election as the backdrop, Perrotta entices his readers into viewing what at times is both a hilarious story but then oddly sad as well.<br />Tracy Flick, the first one to have her name entered for President, is an A student and goody-two shoes.  What few members of the high school body or staff know is that Tracy has had an affair with one of her teachers.  This teacher a good friend of Mr. M's then loses his job, his wife and is eventually found selling shoes in his father's store.  Fearful of what Tracy might do next Mr. M, encourages Paul Warren, the star of the football team to also run. Mr. M. concludes that Tracy and Paul will run for the office and Paul, by virtue of his popularity, will win the election.  That is until Paul's sister Tammy, who is grappling with her own sexual preference also decides to run.  As the election and relationships both in and out of school heat up, the reader is drawn into the world of Winwood High School.  And the outcome is anybody's guess.<br />Generally speaking I always read a book before seeing the movie. In this case I did see the movie first and then just had to read the book.  Both experiences were worthwhile, even if the ending of the movie differed from the book (both were great in my opinion).  Now I look forward to reading more of Tom Perrotta in the future.  And when I hear about a high school election, I'll never think about them quite the same.	2002-01-20

Lois Lowry is the well known author of childrens and young adult books which include titles such as The Giver and the Anastasia series.  In the book, Number the Stars, winner of the prestigious Newberry Award, the author presents her readers with a thought provoking tale filled with memorable characters and plot which readers can think about long after they've closed the book.<br />This story begins in Amsterdam as the Nazis begin to occupy Holland. Life as it once was for this city will never be the same again especially for the two families portrayed here.<br />Ww first meet two young girls of separate families as they walk home from school.  One girl is Christian, the other Jewish and they have always been the very best of friends.  When they are questioned by two Nazi soldiers they are reluctant to tell their parents for fear they will worry. But also fearing what might happen to all of them, they eventually describe the incident to them.  The parents, fully realizing that the situation is getting worse and worse for Jews and other minority groups, begin to make plans to insure the the safety of the Jewish family. Not only will these plans and decisions test their friendships but will alter the course of their lives.<br />Written primarily for children, this is a wonderful book which succeeds in presenting primarily school age children with some of thr ramifications of World War II and the plight of those persectuted by the Nazis.  It also describes to readers at any age the role of courage and acts of extraordinary kindness during these dark days of the Nazi Occupation and World War II.  By describing the plight of two families from Amsterdam, the reader is caught up in these tumultuous times and feels as though they are living next door to these people.  While many books, both fiction and non-fiction have been written about this period in history and for all age groups, Lowry first presents the subject matter in a calm manner but one where emotions mount as one turns the pages. And certainly the book allows us a glimpse of how ordinary people risked their own lives to save others.  As I closed the book I prayed for the safety of both families as if this was happening today.  I do hope that they were reunited and finally the Jewish star could be returned to its rightful owner.e turns the pages.

There was a time when holding a new Rita Mae Brown book was cause for rejoicing. But unfortunately, having just finished this book, there is no joy from reading Alma Mater. While I can remember so many pleasurable hours as I read Riding Shotgun, Outfoxed, Bingo, Rubyfruit Jungle and other titles by Ms. Brown, I'm now wondering if this was the same author I once really enjoyed reading.<br />The plot of the book, while fairly simple, has a new and very much Rita Mae Brown twist.  Boy loves girl, girl loves boy but suddenly girl also loves a girl.  And while I don't mind reading about either heterosexual or homosexual relationships, I didn't find these characters in the least bit interesting, rather almost annoying. And because of the undeveloped portrayal of these people, it didn't make too much difference to me who was pining for whom and who would eventually wind up staying together. In the tradition of Alice Hoffman and Anne Tyler, Rita Mae Brown did try filling the pages with some of the quirkiest people even if they are Southern Virginians.  But even there, she fell short in her attempts. Instead of them being endearing and lovingly eccentric to readers, they seemd foolish and I  began to tire of their complaints and antics. The ending when it finally did come, and believe me reading this rather short book found me dragging my feet if not eyes, was rather predictable.  I did wonder if perhaps Ms. Brown had continued the book for a couple of more years, so we could see the lives of these three later on, if her readers might not have warmed up to this book a bit more.<br />I would have to admit I found this book rather boring and am not sure I will continue reading Rita Mae Brown in the future. But knowing me and how much I once enjoyed Brown's books I probably will.  But I will also be hoping that the next books will be a better book than Alma Mater.	2001-12-26

Rosamunde Pilcher is one of those authors, at least for me, who never disappoints with any of her books.  Like coming home from a hectic day and changing into a favorite robe and comfortable slippers, Pilcher's books take me away to a serene place filled with wonderful characters and a happy ending.  And based on the popularity of her books, I imagine there are many other readers out there who also feel the same way I do.<br />The Shell Seekers was the first book I read by her many years ago. After gulping down this wonderful family saga, I couldn't wait to read all of her previously published titles and wondered how she had eluded me in the years before I found The Shell Seekers.  Now I am saving her latest title and supposedly last book, Winter Solstice, for that proverbial rainy day. And I suspect that once I've read all of Pilcher's books, I'll simply begin to reread them once again.<br />Victoria Bradshaw at 18 fell hopelessly in love with London playwright Oliver Dobbs.  But their romance was short lived and Victoria hasn't heard from him in years.  She has finally moved on with her life when suddenly who should appear on her doorstep but Oliver with a young child in tow.  As if no time had gone by, Oliver proposes that Victoria and he along with the child take a trip to Scotland.  At first the reason for this trip isn't at all clear to Victoria and she is somewhat  skeptical.  But then Olvier is very convincing and Victoria is eventually willing to go along with his proposal.  Once in Scotland, Olivers motives become painfully too clear and while Victoria sees Oliver for what he is, we as readers are also treated to Piclcher's special brand of characters and plot developments.<br />This was another one of Pilchers satisfying reads and one which I hoped would never end.	2001-12-26

What can I say about the book She's Come Undone which hasn't already been said?  How much I loved the writing and character? How the author Wally Lamb captured a woman's life so poignantly?  How this book just doesn't stop giving pleasure to readers all over the world? Or finally what a wonderful reading experience I had and wish others will also have?<br />I did come rather late to this reading party.  Putting off this book for sometimes despite the rave reviews, I suddenly decided I just had to read what everybody had been talking about for some time.  And what has been said over and over again by the many readers of this book is so true.  This is one of those once in a lifetime reads and Dolores Price is one of those once in a lifetime characters.  I know, for sure, that in the future this book will always appear on a top favorite book list of mine.<br />Dolores is one of those characters readers don't forget too quickly.  The daughter of a philandering father and a mentally ill mother, Dolores is set up at an early age for disappointment and a difficult life.  Eating her way through school, by the time she attends college she is grossly overweight with some previous expeiences which teach her the harsh realities of life.  When Dolors is a young child, her father abadons the family while her mother spends time in mental hospitals leaving Dolores to be raised by a strict and critical grandmother. When Dolores's mother remarries and is killed afterwards, Dolores is left in the sole care of her grandmother's.  When a truly devestating incident occurs, Dolores has nobody to turn to except food which becomes one of her only comforts. At the same time she builds a wall around herself for protection. While Dorlores contemplates giving up on life several times, she persists, she fights back and she endures.  And how she becomes fulfilled and loved and loving and certainly not undone is the meat of this wonderful book.	2001-12-06

While browsing at a bookstore recently I was attracted to this title by the lovely cover of the book.  I quickly read the dust jacket and decided to purchase this book and couldn't wait to read it.  But when I returned home and read about the author on the back of the book, I realized that I had read Janice Graham's first book, Firebird, and didn't much care for it. I really did begin to wonder how I would enjoy Sarah's Window.  Well, I come here now to say that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover and always give an author a second chance.<br />Sarah Bryden is a young woman living in the area of the Flint Hills of Kansas.  With dreams of studying art at the University, she's foced to return home when her grandfather suffers a devestating accident.  Raised by her grandparents after her mother dies, Sarah works as a waitress at a local cafe, paitinting in her spare time and attracting the heart of a widowed high school teacher who once taught her.  Unfortunately, an ill fated love affair a number of years ago has left Sarah resigned to the single life she now leads.<br />Into her midst comes John Wilde, a professor of physics from California, who will be working in the area for a couple of months.  He also brings with him his wife, a former resident of the town, and their difficult adopted baby.  When Sarah becomes acquainted with the family there is almost an instant bond between baby, Will and Sarah. It seems as though only she can quiet him down, feed him and put him to bed.  When Will's mother is hurt in an auto accident she is only too happy to care for the baby.  As the weeks go by, Sarah and John Wilde find their relationship slowly changing from friends to something more leaving readers to wonder how this wil be resolved in the end.<br />Graham, with beautiful words and pasages not only captures the landscape of this area but the interior landscape of these characters.  I literally gulped this book down holding my breath till I read the last page.  Not only was this a memorable read but again was a valuable learning experience. When a book beckons for whatever reason or you have a gut instinct while holding a title, do read it despite any previous experiences.  You may be as suprised as I was with this book or another one. Now I am planning on reading Firebird again.  I'm hoping that the second time around I enjoy Graham's first book as much as I enjoyed Sarah's Window.cape of these characters.

In this stand alone title, Coben  takes his readers on the ride of a lifetime.  From the first page till the last, my heart raced and I found myself staying up late at night to finish this book.<br />David Beck, once married to Elizabeth, has finally rebuilt his life since the kidnapping, disappearance  and assumed death of his beloved wife several years before.  Now, a respected doctor with a practice in New York City, David finds himself experiencing some very strange events which lead him to wonder if Elizabeth could still be alive.  First, an e mail arrives with information known only to the two of them, then two bodies are found on property owned by the Beck family which may have been involved in the kidnapping, and finally an image appears on a web camsite which looks suprisingly just like Elizabeth.  With fury and determination, Beck begins to investiage Elizabeth's kidnapping and what has happened in the intervening years.  Along the way Becks efforts are thwarted by a billionaire who may or may not be involved, the father of one of his patients who uses his street smarts to help out and a cast of other characters who are quite memorable.<br />The pace is fast, the book becomes wet from holding it too hard with perspiring hands and you most liely will might find yourself holding your breath as the book moves along to a startling conclusion.  But readers need to be warned to slow down a bit for the last 50 pages as the plot and action moves quickly fronm page to page with complicated and somewhat convoluted twists and turns.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and instead of Telling No One I tell everyone to read this book.  This may have been my first Harlan Coben book but it certainly won't be the only book of his I plan on reading.	2001-12-02

Recently released in one volume are two books written several years ago by Nora Roberts. The book titles are Time Was and the sequel Times Change.  I recently read Time Was and it is this book which I am reviewing here. As the titles imply these are both time travel books dealing with the future as the time period.<br />Once when there were only a handful of time travel books they were primarily thought of as science fiction titles with somewhat complicated theories on how time travel was possible.  Authors included names like Madeline L'Engle, Alan Brennert, Jack Finney and the gradaddy of them all H.G. Wells.  In the last number of years, though, many romance writers and other authors have also enjoyed dabbling in this genre.  Today Nora Roberts writing under the pseudonym JD Robb is also well known for her In Death series which features the character of Eve Dallas, a futuristic policewoman and her boyfriend/husband Roarke.<br />Time Was tells the story of a young woman holed up in her  parents cabin trying to finish an anthropological research project. Suddenly there is a badly injured good looking man at her doorstep who has survived a plane crash. As she nurses him back to good health she senses that something isn't right with him although she fears it is the result of the accident.  What she doesn't know is that the young man is hiding more than just his spaceship and how long he can continue to play dumb is less and less possible. All too soon she is stunned by the news that her visitor is not only from another century but from another planet.  This revelation will ultimately test this couple's relationship as they become more and more enamored with one another all the while knowing that the man from another place and time will need to return home shortly.<br />A long time reader and lover of Nora Roberts books I have never really enjoyed her In Death books and found Time Was simply OK.  Since I also own Times Change I most likely will read that sometime in the future but from here on in will stick to Roberts present day books and will leave the time travel genre to other authors.the future but from here on in will stick to Roberts present day books and will leave the time travel genre to other authors.	2001-11-25

The reader also has an opportunity to visit with Alex's wise grandmother, his two children, a detective friend of his and the mother of his youngest child.<br />Alex's girlfriend reeling from her kidnapping and birth of her son in the book Pop Goes the Weasel, now wants no part of Alex or his lifestyle unless he quits the force.  As as Alex ponders what to do, he is once again called in to solve a series of robberies and murders by a person who this times calls himself The Master.  As Alex mounts a campaign to find this killer and bring him to justice, his family life is threatened when his daughter falls ill and his girlfriend decides to leave her son with Alex while she leaves Washington to live far from her former home.<br />The book moves along with Alex juggling his family life with his obsessive quest to find The Master.  As in most of Patterson's Delaware books, there are twists and turns and the reader moves along somewhat stymied ast to figure out who is doing what.<br />Eventually Alex is able to figure out who The Master is but the revelation, at least to me seemed to be plucked from the air and reminded me of the revealation of the killer in Kiss the Girls. And an explanaiton as to how, why or what isn't fully explained either.<br />I did enjoy this book and perhaps if The Master seemed more logical I would have given this book a five star rating.  Even so, the next book in the series Violets are Blue has just been released and I do look forward to reading the new book shortly.  Now with Patterson writing a romantic fiction book, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, and the beginning of a new series featuring four women in the book, 1st to Die, Patterson's fans are assured of many future books to keep us happy.<br />I must admit that I enjoy Patterson's books which are fast reads although some, including the Delaware series are better than others.e better than others.	2001-11-22

I fell in love with the story of the three Irish sisters and since then became an avid Nora Roberts reader.  I even spent one summer collecting all of her books. And the more I read, the more I enjoyed these books and the more I became a loyal Nora Roberts fan.<br />What then happened while I was reading Jewels of the Sun to turn me off to this series is anybody's guess.  Was it a case of same old, same old or have I reached my Nora Roberts saturation point?<br />The plot of Jewels of the Sun is a familiar one especially for Roberts.  In Ireland, two brothers and a sister run the family pub. Aidan, finally home from years of traveling is the keeper of Irish legends. Content to run the pub he doesn't expect to meet up with Jude Murray, who flees America with a broken heart to live in a cottage to study Irish folklore.  When Jude finds the cottage has a ghost, she seeks out Aidan for advice and finds herself clearly on the path into his arms. Now it should have been interesting to see how the lonely and unhappy Jude and the fiercely independent Aidan will get along and what happens next but instead the plot fell all too flat.<br />I do have the next two books in the series, but truthfully haven't had the oomph to pick them up. And now Nora Roberts has written another series, the first book is titled Dance Upon the Air.  Naturally I bought this when it was first published. Some things die hard. Now I'm hoping I enjoy it as much as my first Nora Roberts reads, Born in Fire, Born in Ice and Born in Shame.	2001-11-22

I'm afraid to say that her last few titles have left me shaking my head thinking back to some of her earlier books and hoping her newest books will be as good. Sadly her latest book, Looking Back, didn't do anything for me and fell into the category of, &quot;I wish I hadn't bothered.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, Looking Back, was a rather dreary and almost predictable read which had me had me thinking same old, same old.  And while I realize that themes are often repeated these days, this one wasn't well developed or the characters either memorable or even interesting.  Like many of Plain's more recent books with present day themes of rape, incest, child abuse, sibling rivalry and embezzlement, Plains newest title further explores family life at its worst and fits right in with other titles such as The Carousel, After the Fire and Secrecy.<br />Looking Back begins on a college campus where three good friends are about to graduate and proceed with their lives.  In time they will all marry, some for better, some for worse.  But then jealousies arise between the three friends,  two of whom who are sisters in law and one woman goes so far as to have an affair.  The climax and end of the book, while fairly predictable is also rather ridiculous but by then I was looking forward to selecting my next read.  I doubt it would have even bothered me if I hadn't bothered to finish this title.<br />I think I continue to read Belva Plain's books hoping for another one as good as Evergreen or other titles in that series. It hasn't happened recently except for Legacy of Silence published a few years ago. So I offer a bit of advice for those not familiar with Ms. Plain's books.  Either get a copy of Evergreen, her first book and other titles in that series or  her later book, Legacy of Silence, which I loved to see how good she once was at writing family sagas.  And if you've already read these books, eithe reread them or join me in looking forward someday to a better read from this author.hem or join me in looking forward someday to a better read from this author.	2001-10-16

And like some of the younger characters from this book, the reader wonders how much Ms. Mirvis questions the way she was raised among Orthodox Jews and their strict compliance to their religion.<br />The Ladies Auxiliary opens as the women of a suburban Memphis community prepare for the Sabbath or Shabbat, the holiest of days among Jews the world over. Into their midst, arrives Batsheva, a new neighbor. For this is no ordinary new arrival, but the young widow of a former resident of the communtity who comes with a daughter. As if that doesn't set them apart enough, Batsheva is also a convert. Almost from the beginning Batsheva seems different than the other women. It is almost as if she forgets everything they hold in high regard. How can a young woman question what the Laws of Moses and study of Torah (which only the men can do)has taught these women? Batsheva sets herself apart from the religious women and this community in the manner of her dress, compliance to certain household traditions and her attitude towards the other women. But worst of all, Bartsheva goes so far as to question rituals in the synagogue and a woman's right to participate in services. What Batsheva fails to realize is that in her own way she's having an effect on some of the congregation particularly the young Orthodox women she teaches. More importantly, the Rabbis son home from his Rabbinical studies for the summer, spends way too much time talking to Batsheva. Its only a matter of time before he also begins to question these religious ways, his interest in becoming a Rabbi and his ability to faithfully lead a congregation. And what the ladies of the auxiliary gradually suspected about Batsheva is happening before their eyes. Not only is Batsheva questioning their ways but somehow beginning to change their children and even themselves. And they cannot allow this to continue. Finally, how Batsheva with her visions of growth and change, and the ladies auxiliary with their time honored traditions will finally come to terms with each other is the stunning climax of this book. This is the first book by an author who certainly knows her material first hand and gives life to her characters. The ladies of this community are microcosms of many women each of us may know. They interfere, they're concerned, they tell tales, they mean well while they hurt other women, they want to eat foods which their religion forbids, they're funny, overwhelmed by their husbands and children, witty and humorous, repressed and sometimes sad. You can laugh at them, nod you're head in agreement with them or astonishment at their views, you may even know them or you may even be them. But you will never forget them or Batsheva. For it is the ladies of the auxiliary and Batsheva who form the very fabric and importance of this book. And the real strength of Tova Mirvis' book is in her portrayal of Batsheva, a wowan who forces the women and men of this community to hold up a mirror to themselves and question what they truly believe is important to them.<br />In the tradition of The Chosen and The Promise by Chaim Potok, Tova Mirvis allows her readers to enter the world of Orthodox Jews living and worshipping in a Southern communtiy. And it is a world we know much better after reading The Ladies Auxilary. Nwo I look forward to reading more titles by her in the future. Shalom!eir eyes.

When I read and then finished Billie Letts's first book Where the Heart Is, I seriously doubted that I would ever read another book by this author I could enjoy more than this, her first title.  But then I read The Honk and Holler Opening soon and I am now hard pressed to say which book I enjoyed more. So now let me say that perhaps Billie Letts's third book will break the tie.  At least I am waiting ever so patiently for this book to be published as I imagine many of Ms. Letts's loyal fans are also doing.<br />The Honk and Holler is a roadside diner whch is populated by some local men who come in daily and truck drivers passing through.  The diner is owned by Carney, a Vietnam veteran who lost both of his legs in the war.  Carney is a former rodeo star who is so depressed that he never leaves the diner nor his bedroom in the back. Carney who is now confined to a wheelchair, dwells on that he lost his legs during a fall from a helicopter and not on the field of combat.  But Carney has great suppport from a waitress named Mollie, who not only misses her husband but also worries about her runaway teenage daughter who has dreams of becoming a country western singer. And then one day two people seeking refuge and kindness arrive at the diner. One is Bui, a Vietnamense man, who works as a cook and is saving money to bring his wife to the US.  And the other is Vena Take Horse, a Native American woman, with a history of drug abuse, a bad marraige and now has to deal with the suicide of her sister.  How these four people help each other to put their lives back together with meaning and love provides the reader with many hours of pleasure and poignancy.  It is as if the author allows us to take this wonderful journey with these memorable characters with us asking only to know more about them as we close the book.<br />Billie Letts has written a one of a kind book which ranks with other novels about lonely and unfulfilled people who finally find camaraderie and love.  The setting of a dismal roadside stand with an opening sign never fixed right is the perfect place for these people to come together.  How they try to brighten the diner for the holidays and ultimately brighten their own lives, is not only the background of this book but where the roots of this book are planted.  This is a wonderful read and will appeal to those who have enjoyed books like The Bingo Queens of Paradise by June Park and Patty Jane's House of Curl by Lorna Landvik.  Strong on emotion and characters, I can assure you that once you have read this book, you will never pass a roadside diner without thinking about Carney, Mollie, Vena and Bui and wondering how thay are doing.tting of a dismal roadside stand with an opening sign never fixed right is the perfect place for these people to come together.

The Bingo Queens of Paradise by June Park is one of a handful of books which did this to me and I am so glad I found this author.<br />In her first novel, June Park, has written a keeper in the tradition of Billie Letts' books Where the Heart Is and The Honk and Holler Opening Soon.  Like these books, The Bingo Queens of Paradise introduces the reader to memorable characters who remain part of our lives long after we finish the book.<br />Paradise is a small town in Oklahoma where trailers are found almost everywhere.  The nightly activity in this town is a good game of Bingo where an interesting group of women who name themselves the Bingo Queens assemble.  Among the women is Momma Moon, mother to Darla and Rhonda.  These two sisters have grown up taking care of each other while their mother pays more attention to her male customers and Bingo games.  While Darla works in Paradise, she dreams about moving to New York City to design dresses.  Her younger sister, Rhonda, already the mother of two children, is married for the second time to an abusive husband she can't seem to leave.<br />The one man the two sisters have relied on for most of their lives is a black man, Elijah, who is the only person who is consistently there for them. It is Elijah who more than anybody encourages Darla to put Pardise behind her, and move on with her life in New York where she can pursue her dream. As Darla finally plans to leave events occur which will not only test her but may force her to face a great loss and perhaps alter her dreams.<br />This book is not always easy to read.  There are scenes which are quite sad particularly when the reader learns all that Darla and Rhonda had to endure as they grew up. I found that at times Momma Moon was so cruel, uncaring and selfish, I had all but to do to compose myself and continue reading. For me it was as if these were real women living in a small town nearby and I had a glimpse into their lives. But I did continue reading as I knew I would and now consider this title one of my top ten reads for 2001. I did wonder at the end if Darla would ever leave Paraidse and found tears on my face when I closed the book and wished her a godspeed on her continuing journey.<br />I do hope that you enjoy this book as much as I did. As for me, I've already reread this book twice and am eagerly waiting for this authors next book.  For me, this title can't be published fast enough., I had all but to do to compose myself and continue reading.

Dear Stranger, Dearest Friend by Laney Katz Becker was suggested to me shortly after I successfully completed my first Avon 3 Day Walk to raise money and awareness for breast cancer research.  As the daughter of a mother who succumbed to breast cancer and an online member for many years, the subject matter of this book is one which intrigued me and unfortunately remember well.  Having witnessed the ravages of this disease not only from my mother, but from friends and men and women I walked with both in October of 2000 and May of 2001, and then being part of e mail circles, I found this book to be both memorable, insightful and informative.<br />It doesn't take long before the reader realizes that the author herself was diagnosed with breast cancer.  And so I imagine this book will not only appeal to those who either suffer from this disease or know somebody who does but also those who want to read about what can happen when somebody is diagnosed with breast cancer.<br />This book begins when Lara, a young suburban wife and mother, discovers a small lump in her breast. At first she ignores it but when she continues to feel it, she makes an appointment with her doctor, only to be told she needs to wait several weeks.  She then seeks out an online service for support from other members who have also been down this road. Fearful and unbelieving that this coudl be happening to her and thinking &quot;what if,&quot; most of the members reassure her by saying, &quot;It's probably nothing.&quot;  But one poster, a survivor, writes by e mail with important information which includes finding another doctor with an earleir appointment.  And what at first begins as letter writing dedicated to breast cancer slowly grows into the most magnificent friedndhsip.  In time these women not only discuss their illness and doctor's visits but become true friends sharing stories about their children, husbands, fears and expectations.  Along the way there are laughs and joy, tears and sorrow.  And then, it as if the book comes full circle when several years later and on the anniversary of her own discovery, Lara is able to help another woman who suspects she may have breast cancer. And once again the circle of support,friendship and information begins again.<br />Much of the more technical information which I read is also available through medical books and journals but it is the manner in which Laney Katz Becker chooses to present it to her readers which is so compelling.  While you many not enjoy all of this book, which at times is diffciult, it will make further aware of not onyl takign care of yourself but being your own health advocate and certainly empathy for those who suffer from any terminal disease.<br />I will never forget Laney Katz Becker and wish her the very best of health as I do all those who suffer from any disease.  In closing I must add that over 20 years ago I read what was then considered a ground breaking book about one women's fight against breast cancer.  The title is First You Cry by Betty Rollin.  Be assured that Dear Stranger, Dearest Friend is a book worthy of being placed alongside this book and should be read!.

She wrote about the stuff which dreams are made of, about fairytale people with lots of money and power.  She also wrote about the not so wealthy and powerful who by the end of her books always seemed to have a happily ever after ending.  And she wrote about famous cities and fairytale places and her books always dripped with designer names, famous hotels and restaurants and great descriptions of the clothes and jewelry worn by the main characters. Steel wrote about single women, divorced men and women, abused women, women orphaned by the Titanic, women who covered wars and women who had to start all over after WWII or the Russian Revolution.  She wrote so many books so quickly that her loyal readers could look forward to at least two meaty books a year from her.  And I was one of her most loyal readers who just had to buy and read each of her books as soon as they hit the shelves. Sad to say but now after almost 30 years of reading Steel I must admit that I think twice before picking up one of her books.  It's not that some of the plots of her books are all that bad for a fast read, although her writing which was never great is still the same, its just that it seems to be same old, same old. Change the names and the places and you think you've been there before. And to be very honest, I continue to hope that I will enjoy one of Steel's newer books as much as Season of Passion, Legacy of Silence, The Promise or Ghost.<br />With that said I picked up Leap of Faith and read it in a matter of an hour during a recent plane ride.  Once again I was looking forward to a good read but Leap of Faith, again fell short.  And if I thought same old, same old about Steel's books, she did try introducing a new element to her books, suspense, but even this attempt didn't do much to the enjoyment of my read.<br />Once again in Leap of Faith, we have a young woman living an ideal life with her parents and brother in France.  Suddenly she is orphaned, her beloved home is sold and she is forced to live with an aunt on a farm in the middle of the United States. The aunt is straight out of Cinderella, forcing the young girl to live a meager life with hardly encouragement or love.  But when the she turns 21, the young woman learns that she is a millionaire leaving readers to ask why her aunt never used any of this money for her.  Immediately the young woman leaves for Paris to find out what happened to her beloved home all these years later. What happens next is most improbable and for sure there is some happily ever after at the end of the book, but by this time one doesn't seem to care too much what happens.<br />This is a short read which once again left me wondering if Steel will write another one as enjoyable as her older titles.  And if you still must read this book, I suggest doing it either on a plane or at the beach when you're a captive audience.<br />Sign me STILL WAITING -----fe with her parents and brother in France.

I guess like many others I approached this book with a certain amount of skepticism.  All the same I just had to read James Patterson's newest book, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. And if I was skeptical, I must now admit that it was a perfect read for a two hour flight this past week. I found myself gulping down this book, wanting to find out what happened to Suzanne, Nicholas, Matthew and Katie.  I came to feel as though I knew these characters well and also their love stories. While reading this book, I did find it a bit sappy in the grand tradition of Bridges of Madison County which Patterson mentions in his book, but I also found myself shedding tears towards the end of the book and applauding the happily ever ending for at least two of the characters. And ever the master of suspense, Patterson even manages to provide a bit of a twist in his love story.<br />Readers who enjoy tear jerker books will certainly enjoy this book.  But don't expect great writing.  Patterson's choice of words and use of grammar leave something to be desired but then again if you're reading a book while flying or vacationing at the beach, this one is perfect.	2001-08-03

A long time reader of Charlotte Vale Allen, I was excited to see a new book by her on the shelves.  I couldn't wait to begin this title shoving away others which were waiting. By about page 60, I found myself sadly disppaointed. Yes, the book and its various plots had all of the elements long time readers of Allens are familair with but for some reason this time the book didn't appeal to me. While the premise isn't an entirely new one, there was nothing special about this title which made me want to continue reading it. As a matter of fact, in the face of some terrible problems which should make one care, I found Allens  characters to be wooden and never felt as though I knew them or wanted to. And the medical portion of the book was a bit much for this type of book, I thought.  All in all compared to one of my favorite books by Allen, Leftover Dreams, the end of this book was a welcome parting gift.	2001-06-02

Since this book was published seven years ago, I have consistently promised myself and others that I would finally read this book. And whie I read all of Ursula hegi's other books, thsi one managed to elude me. But this time around I was determined to finish it. And so I did. Now I wish I could go back and be reading it again for the first time.<br />By now many readers are familiar with Trudi Montag, the dwarf born shortly before WWII in Burgdorff, Germany. In many respects the first part of the book are a series of character studies of other inhabitants of Burgdorf.  We come to know about their daily lives, their secrets, their hurts and their loves.  And all the while we are learning about these people from Trudi's eyes and lips.  Then as the war threatens and becomes a reality, Many of these &quot;good Germans&quot; are faced with a moral dillemma.  Who do they help and what do they think about the actions of others from the town&gt;  And as we continue to read we learn of the courageous acts of many of these villagers, led by Trudi and her father, to protect Jews who are trying to escape from Germany and remain alive.<br />As a reader of novels pertaining to WWII and the Holocaust, I found Ms. Hegi's book to be a masterful work.  It was also so timely to rearead Floating in My Mother's Palm after this title and reamember back to some of these characters from Stones from the Rivers.  Ursula Hegi is to be congragulated for writing what surely will someday become a classic.	2001-04-09

There was a time when Barbara Taylor Bradford's books were a light piece of fluff and an enjoyable read.  But her last few books were tiresome and I didn't really think I would ever read her books again.  Then I found her new book, The Triumph of Katie Byrne, at the local library and being in between books, I thought, why not?  The good news is it wasn't an altogether bad read, the bad news is it wasn't an altogether good read either.<br />The Triumph of Katie Bryne is actually two books and if Bradford had published them this way, they might have been right on the money.  The first book is concerned with three young women yearning to become actresses who plan on moving to New York City when they graduate from high school. But their plans are shattered when in a single afternoon, one girl is killed and another one is hurt so badly she lapses into a coma.  The third woman, Katie Bryne, who was on her way home when the attack takes place, is understandably  forever changed.  Although an invetsigation takes place the guilty party is never found and the years begin to roll by.<br />The second part of the book takes place 10 years later where we find Katie studying drama in London.  When she is offered the role of Emily Bronte in a play about the Bronte family, a friend suggests, as a means of inspiration, that Katie visit the countryside where the Brontes lived and wrote their classic works.  Katie then travels with this friend to the ancestral home of her late husband's family in Yorkshire where Katie spends time walking the moors, visitng the Bronte library and learning more about the Brontes from another guest in this home.  And for me this was the more interesting part of the book and the one which I would have enjoyed continuing to read more about.<br />The last part finds Katie returning home on the advice of a psychic who tells her she must be at home to help solve the mystery. And when Katie opens on Broadway to rave reveews she not only finds love but........and to find out what happens you will have to read the book.<br />Known for her romance and family saga books, this is Ms. Bradford's first attempt at a murder mystery as she calls it or romantic suspense as I call it.  But she included too many bits and pieces of irrelevant information for a book of this size and somehow all of this only detracted from honing in on the main plot of the book.  I do wish somehow she could write another book like A Woman of Substance but perhaps that only comes along once in a lifetime.  As for whether or not I'll read another Bradford book, I guess only time will tell.and to find out what happens you will have to read the book.<br />Known for her romance and family saga books, this is Ms. Bradford's first attempt at a murder mystery as she calls it or romantic suspense as I call it.

Yes, Icy was a spunky little girl and one who seemed to have dealt well with Tourette Syndrome. But she could have been the kind of character that one would never forget.  And while the book dealt well with the idea of accepting people who are different, it could have been a one-of-a-kind book dealing with this idea if only it went a bit deeper.<br />I began Icy Sparks with all sorts of hopes that this would be a book I could read and really enjoy and then say wow at the end of it. While the beginning was poignant and informative about Tourette Syndrome, the rest wasn't all that much to write about. Sadly at some point during my reading, I lost interest.  And I felt that the author rushed the ending and simply wrapped up Icy's future with a neat red bow.<br />If there is anything which I will remember vividly it is the portrayal of Icy's grade school teacher.  She has now earned my award for being the nastiest teacher I have ever learned about. It certainly makes one glad we live in the year 2001 and have a better understanding of children who are different.  I certainly hope that anybody who needs kindness and compassion in their life is surrounded by the kind of peole who will help them.  Luckily for Icy she had the kind of spirit which allowed her to grow and mature happily. I would be curious to revisit Icy ten years after the book left off to find out what did happen to her.	2001-03-22

After reading A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank, Until the Real Thing Comes Along by Elizabeth Berg and Welcome to My Planet by Shannon Olson, I didn't think this book measured up to the other three titles which did have similar plots.  Although this book was a short read, the characters were severely underdeveloped as well as bland and boring.  Bottom line, I really didn't care about them or their love life.<br />Head on the heels of the success of Bridgette Jones' Diary and Sex and the City and more and more young people marrying later, many single men and women authors are writing books about finding the right man or woman.  Out of the singles scene for many years I would advise young people facing this part of life to read Marjorie Morningstar by Herman Wouk which remains as a wonderful guidebook for a young woman seeking true love.  What I would give to be reading that book for the first time instead of the book I just reviewed.	2001-03-22

While reading House of Sand and Fog earlier this year, I was reminded of another book to read called The Tortilla Curtain by TC Boyle. Friends of mine who live in Southern California had recommended this book to me for sometime and shortly after I finished the Dubus book, I picked up Tortilla Curtain.  Now that I've read both of these books I can't stop thinking about both of them, their stories, the characters or unbeliveable outcomes. And if I were to give House of Sand and Fog a 5 star rating, I would surely give 6 stars to The Tortilla Curtain.<br />Tortilla Curtain is the phrase used to describe the thin borders between Mexico and the United States which immigrants cross over in their attempt to live better lives. In this &quot;blow you away novel,&quot; TC Boyle offers his readers a plot and characters who are not only involved in the world of illegal aliens but whose lives will never be the same. And for many of us it is as if this novel's premise was lifted off the pages of our daily newspapers and one for which there is no easy solution.<br />Candido along with his wife America are illegal aliens living in the canyons and brush areas of Southern California.  When the book opens Candido is hit by a car driven by Delaney a writer  for an environmental magazine.  Although Candido hurries away from the scene for for fear of being caught and questioned his injuries prevent him from working for the next few days.  In eloquent words, the author then describes how America seeks work and is both verbally and physically abused which causes Candido great regrets about crossing the border and bringing America to the US.<br />At the same time nearby in a prosperous planned community, Delaney lives with his wife Kyra, a real estate broker, and her son.  The residents of this community are hounded by intruding coyotes in their backyards as well as suspected illegal aliens who rob their homes. Plans are underway to erect a large fence which should keep out all intruders except that Delaney voices his concerns about the fence wondering if the residents aren't locking themselves into their fancy homes. But as the novel continues the people of this community only become more and more incensed and Delaney's words fall on deaf ears  Soon enough, though, and after a series of events, Delaney, begins to feel differently about the fence.  Even when he knows the truth, he finally becomes out of control concerning any and all who cross the borders illegally.  And then one day Candido and Delaney finally meet up again, in what has to be one of the most gripping and stunning conclusions of any book.<br />We read this book through chapters told in the alternating voices of Candido and Delaney until their two voices are ultimately linked together as one struggles against his better judgement and the other struggles to maintain his dignity.<br />This is a powerful and masterful book which describes lives spiraling out of control and should have every reader asking themselves what they would do when faced with similar circumstances.xcept that Delaney voices his concerns about the fence wondering if the residents aren't locking themselves into their fancy homes.

Now with his latest book, Taking Lottie Home, Mr. Kay capitaves his reading audience with a sentimental tale which not only evokes a different era but wholesome and well meaning characters with the very best of values.<br />On a train home, two men recently discharged from a minor baseball team meet Lottie, a young woman with a questionable past.

I'm happy to say that Mr. Martin's first fiction novella resonates with the same appeal we also find captivating in his performances both in the movies and onstage.  Because Mr. Martin has proved to be so multi-talented in the last number of years, perhaps we can only do him justice by dubbing him our 20th/21st century Renaissance man!<br />Shopgirl, which is set in Southern California, tells the story of one 28 year old Mirabelle who sells gloves and weaves tales of what she would be rather be doing as time passes by without any shoppers.  One has only to work for Neiman Marcus,which I did to know what one can think about during down time as shopgirls arrange and rearrange the stock.  Then one day an older gentleman makes a purchase from Mirabelle setting off a chain of events which allow the reader to experience not only Mirabelles affair but life in LA among the single set.  And all the while we experience this through the written word of Mr. Martin which is alternately witty, satirical, humorous and sarcastic.  Not only does Mr. Martin provide us with the geography of LA as we ride down a fwe blocks but we also sense the subtle nuances of what its like to live and work there.<br />Shopgirl is a well written novel with wonderful characters and although it isn't exciting in the sense that you will go wow!, it does have soem great passages filled with analogies that are ost appropriate.  While this is a fast read with a predicatble outcome, it is well worth the trip getting there.	2001-01-19

Several years ago, Richard Paul Evans became known for his book The Christmas Box.  In this short novel we are presented with the story of an elderly woman and her devotion to her family.  Shortly thereafter, Evans followed this book with two ore about this woman and family in Timepiece and The Letter.  Again readers were regaled the spirit of loyal relationships and caring individuals.<br />Through the years and in future books, these values would become the benchmark of an Evans novel as they became a recurring theme.  And this is certainly true of hsi most recent book, The Carousel. In this book we, as readers, learn more about Faye Morrow and Micheal Keddington whom we first met in The Locket.  While The Carousel deals with loyalty, sacrifice, salvation and ultimately redemption, it is also a beautiful story of a great and abiding love between two people during a diffciult time.  And while the storyline borders on sappy at times, the reader comes to love the characters of Michael, Faye, their friend Hallie and Sarah so much that even the predictable ending is overlooked.<br />I do suggest that others read and take to heart Evans's words and views especailly when they think life has little left to offer them.<br />And while it might be too late to purhcase this for the holdiay season of 2000, be sure and put it on your list for reader's for next year.  It is perfect for the spirit of the holidays as  are most of Richard Paul Evan's' books.	2000-12-22

Cook, nothing I previously read prepared me for the emotional roller coaster journey I took while I read this title.  The opening lines of the book, &quot;This is the darkest story I have ever heard,&quot; certainly rings true as Cook takes his readers on a time machine ride back to Choctaw, Alabama in the year 1962.  And what the reader finally learns on this journey in the last few pages will have them aggreeing that Thomas Cook is the the master of a genre hard to categorize. At first glance one assumes that he is a mystery author while a second glance has you thinking he writes psychologial studies dealing with the relationships of people and what pure and simple evil does to their lives.  And some readers may even think that Cook borders on being a thriller witer.  Whatever your conclusions, its safe to say that a Cook book will have you reading late into the night.

Several years ago, Anna Quindlen, was asked by Villanova University to give that years commencement speech.  But as the date of graduation approached, Quindlen found herself in a conflict which resulted in her cancelling from attending.  A graduating senior, though, wrote to Quindlen asking her for a copy of her speech which then made its way onto the Internet and private e mails.  Many readers weren't satisfied with the unbound pages and urged Quindlen to publish this as a book and so A Short Guide to a Happy Life became a book with an interesting story about its birth.  But least any reader think this is the end of the story or destination, doesn't know Quindlen that well for within the pages of this small book, she sets her audience on a thought provoking journey which doesn't end when one closes the book.<br />Fueled by the loss of her 40 year old mother when Quindlen was 19, she reflects on how she learned at this early age what is important in life.  And not just a life to be lived chained to one's desk or a life which forces one to covet material things but a life of exploration and unbridled happiness.  When Quindlen urges her readers to &quot;get a life,&quot; she forces them to reevaluate what they find precious and dear.  And as Quindlen continues to describe what she finds important, I also found msyelf, as I'm sure most of her readers did, shaking my head in agreement and shedding a tear.  If Tuesdays With Morrie explained to many readers how to die with dignity, then this book shows us how to life lives which are meaningful and presonally productive.<br />Quindlen, a long time favorite of mine, beginning with her columns for The New York Times, has written a perfect book not only for a new gradate but a gift of words to be cherished for any age at any time.<br />And now, I will always remember to look at the view!	2000-11-22

In, at times, heartbreaking clarity, this book describes the life of Gordon and Calvin, set adrift and learning to cope as a twosome instead of a threesome.  Managing hard to put his life in order, Gordon a part time lawyer, reflects not only on his marraige to Katie as he goes through the day to day living of rasing a son, but also his own realtionship with his father.  Then when Gordon is finally comfortable in his role as a single parent and when  Calvin seems to be well adjusted to his situation, Katie returns.  Complicating matters further is Gordon's developing realtionship with a new woman.<br />Although the subject of fathers and sons has been explored by other writers, particularly Russian authors, Jaffe's book prsents this realationship in a somewhat predicatable and contrived manner. But in the end the predicatement had me rooting for the futther sucesses of Calvin and Gordon.<br />While I enjoyed most of the novel perhaps its my memory of Kramer vs. Kramer, both the book and movie which I read first and enjoed more, that somewhat spoiled this book for me.	2000-11-20

Alice Hoffman is a wonderful writer known for her books filled with magical realism, similar to authors like Isabel Allende (House of Spirits) and Laura Esquivel(Like Water for Chocolate). This author also write the book Practical Magic which was made into a movie starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.<br />And while Alice Hoffman's latest book, The River King, is also filled with imagery and a writer's vivid imagination, as a reader I felt as though something went wrong with this book.  And I'm stil not sure what happened since I have always enjoye dHogfman's books mreo than other authors'.<br />The River King takes place at a boarding school where previously all sorts of strange things have happened.  It is a classic tale of the haves and the have nots as students from various backgrounds assmeble the first day.  One motherless young man is sent by his father to try and make his way in the world while a young woman,a scholarship student, feels very out of place.  The teachers have made their own alliances while the old timers reminisce about the way things use to be. And rounding out the characters are the townspoeple clearly though to be the have nots and yest the ones who are keepers of the Haddan School secrets.<br />What a young man is found floating in the river, an investigation begins to see, if in fact, he killed himself by drowning or if he was killed. With a cast of interesting and eccentric charcters, I thought this book would have been as good as some of Hoffman's other titles. Unfortunately, nothing in this book really grabbed me or caused me to gulp it down. Also, the topic wasn't that new or or presented in a fresh manner that I finsihed it with that feeling that I was sad it ended.Ultimately I was left disappointed in the plot and outcome.<br />If you're interested in reading Hoffman books which will captivate you then do read Turtle Moon, Practical Magic or Local Girls. These titles are among the very best I've read from her so far.  And luckily, I still have quite a few titles left to read.ily, I still have quite a few titles left to read.	2000-11-19

Almost 30 years ago, I stumbled upon a book by the new to me author, Sidney Sheldon.  The title of the book was The Other Side of Midnight and once I read it, the rest is history.  History in the sense that from that day forward Sheldon became one of those authors I just had to read as soon as a new book was published.  And while I fully acknowledge to others as well as myself that Sheldon never wrote highbrow literature, his books for the most part provided me with a fast paced escapist read.  Unfortunately, this hasn't been the case now for several years.  I became increasingly tired of Sheldon's books and while I continued to read most of them, some of that old fashioned pizazz was clearly missing.  Whne I first saw The Sky is Falling, on the shelves, I seriously thought, for one minute, of not reading his latest book.  And that would have been my mistake since this boosk is as intrigiung and page turning as Sheldons' other now vintage titles like If Tomorrow Comes, Rage of Angels, The Naked Face and The Other Side fo Midnight.  Part political thriller, part mystery with a dash of irony mixed in The Sky is Falling is a book in the old time tradition of the Sheldon novels many of us have come to enjoy.	2000-11-15

Although I saw the movie based on this book several times, its only now 15 years after this book was published that I finally decided to read it. And now that I have gulped down the pages, I'm wondering what took me so long to envelop myself with this delightful book filld with Southern charm. And while it's also  safe to say than many readers and viewers are now familiar with the stories about Idgie and Ruth and Ninny and Evelyn, rarely does a book today offer such wonderful and endearing characters and a plot which has you racing to the last page.<br />While describing a friendship between two women some 60 years before and a present day relationship between a nursing home resident and her loyal visitor, the reader is set off on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  Dealing with subects as far reaching as women's liberation, homosexual relationships, rights of minority groups,integration and growing old, Fannie Flagg never fails to entice her readers and allow them to view a slice of American life now sadly gone.<br />It may have taken me all of this time to finally read a book by Fannie Flagg but if her any other titles are as good as this one, I surely will be in reader's heaven.  I already have Welcome to the World, Baby Girl and am eagerly waiting to begin it.  Maybe today's the day.	2000-11-12

A wonderful tale of three generations of women living in Harvester, Minnesota, where Faith Sullivan's first two books also took place.<br />Kate is 59 and has cared first for her niece Celia and now her niece's child Bess after Celia and her husband are killed.  A simple woman she now looks back on her life as a farmer's wife and wonders how they lost the fdarm and life has managed to slip through her fingers.<br />Her cousin Harriet is 39 and looking for love. Rejecting her farming family to live in a more advantageous community for work, Harriet moved in with Kate providing ming a real source of comfort to both Kate and Bess. But Harriet no longer wants to be a career woman and has fallen for a local farmer and doesn't quite know what to do.<br />Finally there's Bess on the precipice of adult life and about to leave for college.  Although she is tired of her small world, she also has ambivalent feelings about leaving home.  And when a marrid man begins paying attention to her, she is really caught in a dangerous web of lies and guilt.  And when Harriet announces that she soon will be soon marrying, both Kate and Bess's lives are turned upside down.<br />This book is well written in a lovely and slow moving manner.  It reminds one of other novels set in farming communities like My Antonia by Willa Cather and more recently Plainsong by Kent  Haruf.  I found both the plot and characters reaching put to me me from the beginning to end and continue to think about them even now.  Looking forard now to reading Faith Sullivan's other books.	2000-11-08

The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is one authors retelling of the story of Dinah from the Old Testament. For those of us who have studied this protion of the Bible, this account is worthwhile since there is one or two references as to what happened to Dinah, Jacob's only daughter.  And I would imagine that many can't even recall this woman or how she fits into any Biblical story.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely despite the criticism that the auhtor didn't always hold perfectly true to the retelling of other parts of this story.  What I also found interesting about this book was that the majority of readers found out about it from word of mouth.  I also know that today it is being read by many book group as well as women's studies groups.  It is a wonderful guide to see what womens lives were all about at that time and even if this is only a fictionalized account based on the author's research.<br />While I found many parts of thsi book both compelling and poignant, what I found most fascinating was Dinah's relationships with her birth mother and aunts and their relationship with Jacob.  The writing at these times and the views expressed are almost modern in feeling.  Especially worthwhile reading is when Dina, who serves as the narrator, says that in order to learn about a person, one must first listen to the story of their mother.<br />When I first heard about this book from a friend, I didn't expect to read it.  After all hadn't I studied enough about the Old Testament while attending religious school and in my house of worship. But then as I read more and more recomemndations for this book or heard about it from other readers, I decided I had to at least try it. I am so glad that I did and know that this book will always be among my very favorite titles.	2000-10-06

If I found the second entry into the Harry Potter books a bit less appealing than the first one, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, or the third title in this series, is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter books.<br />Once again the wonderful characterizations of Harry and his friends we've come to know and love are present along with some very well drawn new characters.  In addition there is also a wonderful plot featuring an old family friend of the Potter's who is a key character to Harry's past.  As the summer ends, Harry can't wait to leave his aunt and uncle's home and return to his friends and the Hogwarts School. Unfortunately, when another aunt comes to visit, Harry is angered enough by her to perform some dark magic and flees the house in the middle of the night.  At the same time, a prisoner, Sinius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and suddenly Harry is being warned to be on the lookout for this notorious prisoner who supposedly killed his parents.  How Sinius fits into Harry's past, why somebody among Harry's friends appears to be a traitor, how and why wizards turn into animals, and finally how it all ends is what awaits readers of this book.<br />As usual J.K. Rowling sends her fans on a roller coaster ride as chills run up and down ones spine, sighs are heard during poignant moments and smiles are on readers faces as they close the book. And surely once you've reaed this book you won't be able to wait too long until you pick up Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br />A first rate book for children and adults alike.	2000-10-05

Emperor Norton's Ghost is the fourth book I read in the Fremont Jones series written by Dianne Day and I'm afraid to say I didn't care for this title too much.  Compared to the first two books, The Strange Files of Fremont Jones and Fire and Fog, I found this mystery rather dull and almost boring.  Even some of the more poignant scenes between Fremont and her aging father did little to pique my interest in this book and I really had to force myself to finish this title.<br />For those readers familiar with Dianne Day's books, please understand that Fremont is still as feisty as ever and still thwarting any marraige proposals from her lover Michael Kossof.  And she most certainly will continue to endear herslf to you but the rest of the book falls short.<br />When a new friend enters Fremont's life and Fremont attends a seance with this woman, once again Fremont finds herself helping out another person.  Fremont's friend Frances McFadden unfortunatly is tightly controlled by her domineering husband and seeks out a medium to add something to her otherwise stilted life. But when she and Fremont attend a seance and there are some bizarre happenings, Frances prevails upon Fremont to find out more about the evening and the other participants.  Afraid for Frances' life, Fremont begins investigating the world of mediums and almost within two weeks two well known Bay area mediums are found dead.  Now Fremont along with Michael and Wish, the friendly cop Fremont met in Fire and Fog, unearth a tale which includes empty graves, a rather shady character posing as a doctor and Wish's own mother who is almost as feisty as Fremont.  But the most baffling plot of the book are  instructions from Emperor Norton, the self proclaimed Emperor of the United States and Defender of Mexico, who died many years before.<br />Despite how I felt about this title, I am looking forward to the next book in the series, Death Train to Boston.  Fremont Jones and the other characters found within these pages are much too unique to stop reading about without another chance.pages are much too unique to stop reading about without another chance.	2000-09-25

I said run, so don't be walking.  Of the several other books which Phillip Margolin has written, and I have read all of them, this is his very best.  The action is so fast paced that the pages turn themselves and before you want it to end, you will be closing the book.<br />In Wild Justice, I found the characters to be so finely drawn and described, it is as if we know them well. And be prepared for a plot which twists and turns and scenes which will send shivers up and down your body as an out of control doctor is arrested and tried for a series of gruesome murders, only to be let go due a technicality.  Then years later when it appears as though Dr. Vincent Cardoni is long dead, the police find evidence of bodies murdered in the same manner but this time the doctor's ex-wife Justine Castle is found guilty.<br />Added to this roller coaster ride of a book, is a young laywer employed by her father's legal firm who not only represents the good doctor but also his wife.  And while I won't say anything more I would love to see Mr. Margolin write another book with some of these same characters.<br />Wild Justice is a wonderful thriller which can easily take its place among the novels written by both James Patterson and Jonathan Kellerman among other noted writers of this genre.  I only hope it doesn't take Mr. Margolin too long to write his next book because until then, I'll be waiting.	2000-09-25

Lynn Harris introduced me  to a world which before this was truly invisible and unknown to me.  The  chronicle of Raymond over a number of years described not only the life of  a black man but one who was bisexual as well. Meeting Raymond Daly first as  a young Southern college student deeply involved in a heterosexual  relationship with his college sweetheart, to the days of his affair with a  gay black man and then a black actress, to an acquiantance dying of AIDS,  this book is especially memorable and poignant. It isn't any wonder then,  that by the end of the book Ray is beset with uncertainties as to his  sexuality.  Pressure from his family not to even think of himself as a  homosexual, hiding his bisexuality from the stodgy law firm he works for  and then meeting a beautiful black actress who falls in love with him, by  the books end, Ray must finally decide to consider the direction of his  realtionships and his sexual life.<br />I found this book to be an easy read.  Perhaps a bit too easy.  It only took me les than a day to finish the book  and at times I found the writing was like a very long coversation, instead  of a novel. Despite this The characters were finely drwan and I am looking  forward to reading the next two books in this series to see the final  decisions Ray makes regarding his life.	2000-09-19

I have long maintained that reading a book by Rosamunde Pilcher is like  coming home from work and putting on ones' robe and slippers.  Both  experiences are so warm, inviting and ultimately comfortable.  And once  again while reading Under Gemini, I had that old feeling that I was being  enveloped not only with the wonderful characters but also with the locales  that Pilcher  describes so well.<br />Trying to put her life back into order,  Rose is startled, while dining one evening in London, to see her face  looking back at her. Realizing that she has a long lost twin Flora, Rose  must at first adjust to the idea of a twin and the circumstances concerning  their separation.  Then when Flora suggests that Rose spend a few days in  her apartment and Flora then must leave for Greece, Rose comes face to face  with a man who thinks she is actually Flora. But Flora doesn't reckon with  the fact that this man has given her twin a ring and now expects her to  accompany him to see his sick grandmother in Scotland.  His grandmother who  met Flora five years ago wishes to see the more grown up Flora now in case  she dies. Having nowhere to live and no job at the moment, Flora decides to  go with the young man but has second thoughts when she meets his  grandmother and other family members.  The rest of the story moves along  pleasantly.  A real romance is in store for Rose, all loose ends are tied  up in the end a la Pilcher style and there is a happy ending.<br />This is a  sweet book with lovely characters during a simpler time. Written before  Pilcher's best selling books, earlier titles like Under Gemini showed the  earmarks of Pilcher's grander books like The Shell Seekers and Coming Home.  Lucky for me that while I have read most of Pilcher's titles, I still have  saved some of them and now can look forwrd to reading them along with her  newest title Winter Solstice.	2000-09-12

Considering how much I enjoyed the first three books in the Donovan  series, I can't understand why I disliked this book as much as I did.  Until I read Enchanted, I literally gulped down Nora Roberts's books and  couldn't wait to begin an unread series.<br />The story of Liam, another  Donovan cousin, and his relationship  with a new female neighbor begins in  remote cabins place in rural Oregon.  As Liam presents himself to Rowen,  who he later learns is a very distant cousin, he is at first a friendly  wolf.  Readers quickly realize that Liam is a shape shifter along with his  parents.  And again as his relationship becomes more serious he wonders how  he will explain not only his powers to Rowen, but his place in the family  as the rughtful leader.  There is the requisite meeting of the entire  Donovan clan, who readers of the trilogy have met before, but by then the  family closeness and words of wisdom came a little too late for me as a  reader.<br />I regret that I didn't enjoy this book more but even with a  favorite author, I guess readers would find one or two books they just  didn't care for as much as others.  But it certainly won't stop me from  reading other series by Mrs. Roberts.  As I sit here and finish this  review, I'm already thinking about what books I'll read next by Nora  Roberts.	2000-09-01

As time goes on Boone is drawn more and more into  Anastasia's spell and begins to fall in love with her.

And in this book she also begins to introduce more adult  themes such as prejudice between Muggles and Non - Muggles children and  parents, intolerance and even status. And while I am no longer a child, I  found myself joyfully gulping down the first two books in this series.

It would appear that I have arrived late at the party since Turtle Moon is  only the third book I've read by Alice Hoffman.  And while Practical Magic  will most likely always remain my favorite, Turtle Moon, will be a close  second. Once again as she does in her other books Alice Hoffman presents  her readers with wonderful characters who remain with one long after they  close the book.  In Turtle Moon, she also describes a place both  geographically and spiritually so that if we were set down there tomorrow,  we would know our way around.<br />Verity, Florida is the place where more  divorced women come to from New York when they leave their husbands.  Some  come with  children who are difficult like Lucy Rosen, while others like  Bethany run away on the spur of the moment to leave abusive husbands. Some  work at jobs while others hide out with their small children and pawn  jewelry for extra cash. And some dread going home to confront their  children or to learn that their child has once again been suspended from  school.  And in this quiet town lives Julian Cash, a policeman with a  difficult dog  and a difficult past which continues to haunt him.  And as  if the month of May isn't difficult enough for the residents of this town  as sea turtles begin their migration across the streets of Verity, a young  woman is found murdered, her baby missing along with Lucy's son who is the  worst boy in Verity.  Now its up to Julian and Lucy to join together and to  find him and the truth out about the murder. And we as readers are like  spiders in a web as we move along with the plot, setting and characters of  this first rate novel.<br />Hoffman, as usual has filled her book wth many  mystical occurrences and images. She has also filled the pages with themes  present in some of her other books.  In this case, themes such as  relationships between spouses, parents and children, guilt for survivng a  tragedy and moving on with one's life despite disappointments.  Most of all  I see this book as a testimony ultimately to running towards and dealing  with ones problems.  And as in the past books I've read Hoffman fills her  pages with a cast of the most endearing characters. From Lucy and her  ex-husband to her Aunt and Uncle, from Julian to his cousin, Ghost, from  Bethany to her slimy husband, these are people who will live and breath for  you within these pages.<br />And eventhough I may have been a late arrival, I  am now a happy  Alice Hoffman fan looking forward to catching up on her  older titles as well as her newest book The River King.l  I see this book as a testimony ultimately to running towards and dealing  with ones problems.

But  if I was looking for a sweet read depicting mother knows best and daughter  is listeneing, I should have read something else. For in What we Keep, the  author relates the story of a mother and her two daughters in an  overwhelmingly sad story.<br />The opening pages of this book begin on an  airplane ride as Ginny, Marion's younger daughter and sister of Sharla,  explains to another passenger the nature of her trip West. Ginny is meeting  up with her sister to visit the mother they haven't seen in 35 years. Then  in a series of Ginny's reflections throughout the plane ride, we learn the  how and why Marion left her daughters when they were only 14 and 12.  Naturally thoughout the book we hear and feel Ginny's struggles with this  trip, her recollections of their family life and how she will ultimately  feel about her mother.<br />I found this to be one of Berg's more difficult  books for me to read perhaps because I had such a wonderful bond with my  mother. And I found msyelf dragging through the book not because I didn't  want it to end but because it was so painful for me to think about what  Marion did despite the fact that I somewhat understood her actions. And at  the end I was waiting for parts of the puzzle to be solved and it finally  left me wondering why this  happened and what the future held for these  three women after this meeting.<br />I did find this book evoked some of the  same feelings I found in other books by Elizabeth Berg like Durable Goods  which explored feelings among siblings and Joy School which described the  painfgul days of a first love.  And sections of it detailing what its like  for a woman to grow older and what we expect from  mothers were so  beautifully written that I found myself crying.<br />Although this wasn't one  of my favorite books written by Elizabeth Berg, pleae do read it and decide  for yourself.  Even a book by Berg which I liked less than her others is  still a most worthwhile read.d decide  for yourself.

Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory,  though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional  family but rather one of great strength.<br />Although Jim's father dies only  a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three  uncles who never married.  Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn  their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest  lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends  devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man  lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his  tenth and eleventh birthday.<br />Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style  found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a  summer's day.	2000-08-12

Reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has finally confirmed to me  something which I have long thought.  That is, that within every adults'  heart and soul beats that of a childs  wonderful imagination.  And it could  also be that for grownups who read and enjoy the Harry Potter books, it  allows us to rememebr back to when we first discovered authors like  Madeline L'Engle, Roald Dahl and C.S. Lewis.<br />By now unless you've been  stranded on some deserted island, most people are familiar with the young  wizard Harry Potter.  And even if you haven't read the books, you would at  the very least be familiar with the circumstances surrounding the writing  of these books and the enormous popularity of them.<br />As a new reader to  the world of the Hogwart school, wizards, spells and games played on flying  brooms, I am happy to say that the two days I spent reading Harry Potter  and the Sorcerer's Stone were absolutely delightful ones for me.  And if I  began the book with some skepticism, or doubts, it didn't take long for me  to fall in love with Harry or his friends, Hermione, Neville and Ron.  As  for the villains they were portayed so well and were just so good at being  bad, that these parts of the book  caused me to  cheer even louder when  Harry and his cohorts were victorious.  By the time I finished this book, I  was running out the door to buy the next three titles.  Now I'm sitting on  my hands not to gulp them all down but rather space them out and savor  them.  Hopefully Ms. Rowlings next addition to these books will be ready by  the time I am finished with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br />A first  rate book and read for children and adults alike.  Don't miss it.	2000-08-09

It isn't that the book Omerta by Mario Puzo won't hold your interest,  becaue it will.  And it isn't that its not a fast paced read, filled with  what Puzo fans have come to expect, because it is.  And it isn't that I  didn't enjoy this title, because there were parts that I did. It's just  that Mr. Puzo did this before, and much better at that, in The  Godfather.<br />Billed as the third and last book in a trilogy devoted to the  Mafia which includes The Godfather and The Last Don, Omerta tells the story  of the Aprile family. Once the head of this  Mafia organization, Don  Raymonde worked hard to see that his  three children and adopted son have  hardly ever been involved in the family business.  But when he's killed  gangland style in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, it is up to his adopted  son to avenge his murder and bring the family legitimately into the 21st  century.<br />Since Mr. Puzo died in 1999, unles he left some unpublished  manuscripts, this will be his last book.  And while this is an enjoyable  read, I think his loyal fans may prefer to reread better books like The  Godfather anbd The Last Don, two of my favoties.	2000-08-09

Linnea in Monet's Garden is one of those books which will be loved by all ages through the ages. The reader journeys along with young Linnea and her neighbor, Mr. Bloom, first to Paris and then Giverny to see the painter  Monet's home and gardens.  Providing the story of Monet't life with words  and wonderful illustrations, it is as if the reader is standing on one of  the bridges viewing the water lillies in person.<br />For those readers who  have had the opportunity to see Giverny and the gardens in person it will  be a special treat to read this book and reminisce. And for those who  haven't been there and read this book, certainly it will provide a  wonderful travel destination in the future.  At the very least I imagine it  will have most readers looking for an art book to view more of Monet's  paintings or visiting a musuem which has his works.	2000-07-24

While I really looked forward to reading this book after hearing so many favorable reviews and while the pages turned themselves at the beginning,  midway through, I began to dislike almost everything about this title. As a  lover of words and a practicing Jew, somewhat familiar with Kabbalah  studies, I found this tale ultimately so depressing and the family so out  of touch with everything around them, that this became a most uncomfortable  read.  And lest you think I shy away from uncomfortable reads, this isn't  usually the case if I see some merit to the read.  Somehow this book left  me feeling out of sorts and perhaps that was what the author intended.  Most of all, though, I never really felt anything for the characters,  especially the mother. How could a woman keep from her husband that she  hasn't worked as a lawyer for 10 years but spends her days instead  acquiring objects? Does her husband Saul really know so little about family  members that he doesn't see whats happening around him when his wife isn't  at work?  Or that his son is spending time away from theit home and in a  Hare Krishnah Temple?  Or that he expects something from his daughter which  she really isn't capable of doing?<br />While I found the premise of this  book, how an 11 year old special education student begins winning more and  more competitive spelling bees and the effect this has on her family,  interesting, it just wasn't enough to explain all that happened to them  afterwards.  Instead of providing me with a good read, instead, all I can  think about is what does happen to this young woman who has experienced  some fame, and what happens to her brother who used to share a speical time  with his father then reserved for his sister and most of all what happens  to the father when he no longer has a favorite to invite into his  study.<br />I will say that the subject matter was thought provoking and the  writing kept me going long after I wanted to close this book even if the  theme didn't. But I just found it too depressing  and too unlikely. I will  be curious to see what Myla Goldberg will write about in the future.ng kept me going long after I wanted to close this book even if the  theme didn't.

About this time of year there always seem to be a rash of books which chronicle the lives and loves of 20, 30 or 40 somethings.  Over the past few years readers have been introduced to characters from books such as The  Diary of Bridget Jones, The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, The Diary  of Bridget Jones, Until the Real Thing Comes Along and this year Dating Big  Bird, Jemina J and Getting Over It. Now there is another new entry into  this genre  which I most heartily recommend.  The title is Welcome to My  Planet by first time author Shannon Olson and certainly a welcome addition  to this genre.<br />Shannon, tha main character in this book is a refreshing  30 something with considerable  agendas in her life.  She already has had  one major failed relationship which she describes for almost half of the  book along with a less than interesting job and mounting credit card debts.  Further complicating her life is her mother who also seems to question her  marriage and life as well as Shannons.  And as if questioning Shannon's  life isn't enough then her mother Dorothy always offers her unsolicited  advice as well. Along the way we find Shannon attending graduate school,  finding a new lover, traveling with her sister and brother-in-law during  their honeymoon and finally resloving how she will change not only herself  and her life by not telling her mother too much.<br />Although I am well past  this stage of my life, I still enjoy reading these types of books.  And I  also find that I can still relate to some part of the angst the main  character is going through.  Welcome to My World is a humorous and clever  book which I really enjoyed.  At times I even found myself laughing out  loud which is always a good sign.<br />Thanks for a good read, Ms Olson. I  think you have a bright future ahead of you and look forward to reading  your next book.	2000-07-19

Perhaps because I am still waiting for one of them which will entrance me the way her earlier ones did long ago. But if I'm waiting for another book like  Season of Passion or The Promise, then her latest The House on Hope Street,  while not an altogether bad read, didn't have enough of the old Daneille  Steel for a five star review.<br />Danielle Steel often tells the same tale  merely by using new names, locations and different professions for her  characters. For sure her heroines or heros always suffer some loss and then  must carry on.  And The House on Hope Street is no exception to her well  worn formula books.<br />In her new book, Steel begins by introducing  us to  Liz and Jack, two divorce attorneys and parents of five children, one with  special needs. They are a warm and wonderful family who appear to be bullet  proof. But a crazed husbad of a client puts an end to all of that when he  kills Jack on Christmas Day before turning the gun on himself.  Now as Liz  struggles with her own emotions and loss, she must also take care of her  children and the law practice she shared with her husband.  Now perhaps in  the hands  of another author the reader would see this woman make it on her  own as she rememerges as a single mother and lawyer.  But Steel isn't  content to let her character move on alone so after suffering what could  have been another disaster, Liz meets a kindly doctor and the rest is  history. And while there is some conflict between the two, Steel readers  pretty much know the ending from page 1.<br />This wasn't an altogether bad  read.  And while Steel has never been known to write beautifully, I think  her readers enjoy her characters especially when they overcome their  personal challenges. In any case, this might be just the book for a day at  the beach.  One can polish it off in a matter of hours and think about it  as an overgrown magazine article on how to continue on after a loss  provided you meet a man which isn't necessarily the way it is in the year  2000.er a loss  provided you meet a man which isn't necessarily the way it is in the year  2000.	2000-07-19

In her book, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, the author Susan Vreeland presents her subject matter in a unique way.  Focusing on an unknown Vermeer portrait, the author takes her readers from the present back to the time when the  painting was actually done.  But this premise isn't conveyed  in the  traditional manner of a flashback but rather as a series of inter-related  stories as the painting goes backwards from the previous owner's hands to  the next previous owner's hands.<br />Who knows what treasures lurk in an  ordinary home?  When an art professor is invited to a to the home of a  colleague, he is shown what the owner says is an original Vermeeer which  nobody knows anything about.  How did this professor get the portrait,  wonders the art professor and why is there no provenance or mention of it  anywhere in the art world?  Could this in fact be the 36th portrait done by  Vermeer which somehow became lost over the centuries?  And now the author  has set us on a course as wevhead backwards in time.  And among the periods  of time we travel to are the early days of the rise of Hitler, then to the  court of a count, to flooded areas of Holland and finally to Delft where we  first meet Vermeer in the home of the man who has bought most of his  paintings so that Vermeer can feed his 11 children.  And finally we are  there as Vermeer begins to paint his daughter Magdalena.  And it is up to  Magadalena to tell the story of what happens to Vermeer, her family,  herself and and what happens to this very portrait in the future.<br />While I  enjoyed this book, I did have some reservations.  Close on the heels of  reading Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier which also focuses on  Vermeer, I felt that Girl in Hyacinth Blue lacked some of the wonderful  descriptions of the artist and his craft.  Whereas in Tracy Chaevaliers's  book one could smell the paints and see Griet who served as Vermeer's model  for the portrait with the pearl earrings and turban, Girl in Hyacinth Blue,  seemed to gloss over these aspects concentrating on the characters in each  story.  And while the characters were well drawn, some of the stories  failed to hold my interest as much as the others. But all in all, these  were minor reservations and I would recommend this book to others who also  enjoyed Girl With the Pearl Earring, the movie The Red Violin and even  Jerry Seinfeld's espisode which also began with the end.nth Blue,  seemed to gloss over these aspects concentrating on the characters in each  story.

Since I began reading her books in 1989 with Garden of Lies, I have always looked forward to her next book. And now that I have  read all of her books except for One Last Dance, I'm afraid to say her  books are going steadily downhill.  Even her newest title The Second  Silence, failed to interest me the way her older titles once did.<br />I  think my main objection to The Second Silence is that it was much too  contrived and coincidental.  In 1969, a friends suicide leaves her  schoolmate, Mary bereft.  And some how, some way Mary just knows that her  friends slimy boyfriend Robert had something to do with it.  Now we move to  the year 1999, where Mary's daughter Noelle a recovering alcoholic and  mother of one young daughter, wants to divorce none other than this same  man, Robert whi has become very prominent in the community.  Unfortunately  for Noelle, Robert doesn't plan on giving Noelle a divorce too quickly  without getting what he also wants.  And when he takes his daughter from  Noelle's grandmother's home where she's been staying, Robert fails to bring  her home telling Noelle instead that the child will live with him while he  sues for custody. He claims that Noelle is an unfit mother and it seems as  though every one including their next door neighbor is afraid of Robert and  therefore is against Noelle. Gearing into action to help Noelle are her  parents who have been divorced for almost all of her life.  And now come  the abounding  coincidences.  Mary, again, falls in love with her former  husband.  Noelle and the local doctor fall in love.  Robert, who seems to  have everyone in his hip pocket is proven to be a scoundrel and even their  neighbor's wife who was once Noelle's friends, is found to be having an  affair with Robert.  The ending wasn't at all surprising and the whole plot  made me think of many other romance books I've read which were the same in  feeling and characters.  And while I've come to expect some repetition,  this book hardly held my interest and I was sorry I even finished  it.<br />Sorry I couldn't offer a better review.

Since I collected all of Nora Roberts' books  a few summers ago, I am slowly reading her titles to make them last.  But considering she writes three books a year, I will most likely always have a Nora book to look  forward to.  And once again as she has done in the past this author has  entranced me with the first book in the Donovan series, Captivated.<br />When  Nash, a Hollywood writer, needs help with facts for his next thriller  movie, he seeks out the beautiful Morgana, known in the community to be a  bona fide witch.  But what he doesn't reckon with are her powers which he  doesn't at first believe are anything more than pranks. And he certainly  doesn't believe that her two cousins, Sebastian and Anastasia are anymore  witches than their parents are either.<br />Like many of Nora's other series  book, this one is light and entertaining and has me looking forward to  reading the next title, Entranced.<br />Note - Although it says that this  title is out of print, in 1999, the first three Donovan titles were  published in one book called The Donovan Legacy.  And at the same time the  fourth book Enchanted about cousin Liam Donovan was also published.<br />So  happy Wiccan reading and afterwards tell me you don't believe there is any  truth in this paranormal tale.	2000-07-11

And today, its as if Maeve Binchy continued this premise when she  wrote her newest book, Aches and Pains.<br />Maeve Binchy is primarily known  as the best selling Irish author who writes wonderful tales filled with  memorable characters.  Some also know her from her meaningful columns which  appear in the Irish Times.  But now readers everywhere will be introduced  to a very different Maeve Binchy as learn about Binchy as a patient when  she first had surgery to replace her hip and then during her recuperation.  And readers will have an extra bonus from the illustrations done by Wendy  Shaw who had the same operation as Ms. Binchy.  The book is really funny,  filled with all sorts of advice on how to survive a stay in any hospital  and some anecdotal dopctor and nurse stories.  And strange as it may seem,  Binchy and Shaw make it a pleasure to read about their  confinements.<br />Consider reading this book to see how it is possible to  make light of your aches and pains or think about giving this as a gift to  somebody who is also recuperating.<br />And an extra benefit is that all of  the proceeds from the sale of this book will be contributed to the  Arthritis Foundation.	2000-07-07

Since I have read all of Ms. Kagan's previous books, I literally couldn't wait till her next title was published after finishing Somebody's Baby.  And then as soon as I saw No Good-byes on the bookshelves, I couldn't wait  to read it.  But now that I gulped down No Good-byes, I am once again  eagerly waiting for her next title.<br />In No Good-byes, Elaine Kagan, no  stranger to Hollywood herself, has written a wonderful tale about the lives  of three very different women as they interact with each other in  Hollywood.<br />First we meet Chassie, a big star in her own right, who is  also the daughter of a very famous actress. But Chassi can't forget the day  when at 12, she watched as her mother was killed by an out of control car.  Now at 25, she suffers from dizzy spells and the sudio suggests she see a  psychiatrist named Eleanor Costello.  Eleanor, who in many ways becomes a  surrogate mother to Chassi, as she listens to Chassie reflects on her  relationship with her own daughter and what went wrong.  And finally  rounding out these women is Ionie, the waitress in the coffee shop  downstairs from Eleanor's office. As Ionie forms friendships with both of  these women, she becomes pretty much their backbone and sounding board as  they confide in her and from an alliance.  Ionie unlike the others is  grounded in the present and looks forward to the future which she hopes  will also include her becoming a famous actress.  As the months go by and  their ties to one another become stronger and stronger, all three of these  women will learn the truth about their lives, each other and most of all  themselves.<br />While this book was somewhat predictable, I enjoyed getting  to know these characters who became very real to me.  And of course I found  myself staying up much too late to finish this captivating read.<br />So, Ms.  Kagan, when can I expect your next book?	2000-07-06

The first was that the book almost instantly reminded me of Rosemary's Baby which I had recently watched.  And the second was that I  almost chose not to borrow this book from the library.  Why?  Because I  truly have disliked James Patterons' books which don't feature Alex Cross.  And I especially didn't care for the preposterous When the Wind Blows from  several years ago. That said I now have to say that while I may always  think of Cradle and All as Rosemary's Baby of the year 2000, I really did  enjoy this title and would certainly recommned it to others as a fast  summer read.<br />Two young women in different parts of the world are both  preganant and remarkably both appear to be virgins.  As their time draws  near and the world is host to epidemics, floods, famines and other  predictions of Doomsday, the Church strives to determine the validity of  these virgin births.  Also they want to learn which woman us carrying the  Savior and which one the Anti- Christ as predicted by the legend of the  Lady of Fatima from long ago.  The Church, in their quest, hires a former  nun now turned private detective who has her own history with one of the  priests also assigned to the case.  Between them they are to dsicvoer the  real truth about each of these women as well as their offspring and  themselves.<br />Although other readers have complained that this book is  rehash of an earlier Patterson book, Virgin, which the dust jacket notes  that Cradle and All is reworking of that title, I never read that first  book so this read was fresh and brand new to me.  Certainly it more than  held my attention as I gulped it down in less than two days.  And of the  book didn't satisfy my urge for a thriller read, the irony of the ending  certainly had me closing the book as I was finally able to stop holding my  breath.<br />But the truth be told, this book really whetted my Patterson  appetite and I am now eagerly waiting for the next Alex Cross book.<br />Mr.  Patterson, I'm sure you're tired of hearing this but please hurry up and  write faster.I am now eagerly waiting for the next Alex Cross book.<br />Mr.  Patterson, I'm sure you're tired of hearing this but please hurry up and  write faster.	2000-07-05

It's not that I don't like paranormal stories or romantic tales or even the romance genre, but this title just didn't do anything for me.  Unfortunately, Marc Levy has repeated an oft told tale without anything new  or interesting.  While the first half is an OK read, the second half falls  into trite rhetoric which any romance reader has already read in a newer  and fresher manner.<br />The basic premise of the book is that while a young  woman lies in a coma, her ghost visits a man who has much to learn about  love.  And while Arthur at first can't believr whats happening, he then  goes on to fight to save Lauren's life when her mother is advised to remove  her life suppport system.  During their time together, both Lauren and  Arthur learn more about themselves, love and the meaning of life. And while  the premise could have been somewhat interesting, Levy tends to be overly  sappy including a message makes the e mail rounds almost weekly.  This  message, which asks the question of what is the meaning of a year, month,  week, day, hour or even a tenth of a second has been hashed and rehashed so  much, I was surprised to see this once again in this book.<br />This is the  first book by Marc Levy.  I hope that his next book, if there is one, is  better.	2000-07-04

In her new book, Mortal Sins, Penn Williamson offers her readers a taut mystery which they won't forget too quickly.  The author, AKA as Penelope Williamson, is also well known for her historical romances.  And it is  obvious from this book as the author calls attention to detail when she  describes New Orleans so that we as readers feel as though we are walking  down these streets.<br />When a well respected society member of New  Orleans  is killed, all fingers point to his beautiful actress wife who has recently  returned to her hometown and married this man.  What may appear to many to  be an open and shut case,  provides readers with a roller coaster ride and  page turning read as the plot takes off.  And complicating matters further  is the detective who is investigating the murder.  Not only is he a widower  with an unusual background but he is also this womans former lover and he  is desparate to prove her innocence.<br />Throughout the book Ms. Williamson  introduces us to a book filled with interesting characters and a myriad of  plots which twist and turn and in the end keep us reading late into the  night.<br />This is the first book I read by this author but it certainly  won't be the only one.	2000-07-04

But he didn't call or even write.   At least not unitl the night he was flipping through TV stations and found  his old professor's face staring back at him.  There was Morrie Schwartz  being interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline.  Morrie, once a man that  danced wildly among the college set in Boston, was dying from ALS (Lou  Gehrig's disease), but instead of folding up, Morrie chose not to go  quietly into that good night.  Instead surrounded by his family, friends,  colleagues, students and books, Morrie discoursed daily about &quot;this  business of dying.&quot;  When he came to the attention of Ted Koppel,  Morrie agreed to do a series of interviews for the public to learn mpore  about his disease,ideas and himself.<br />And so Mitch now knew where and what  his professor was up to and paid him the first of many visits.  Flying from  either his home or job as a sporswriter, Mitch would travel to Boston every  Tuesday where he spent the day with his mentor and essentially continued  his education with this is his professors final course.  The subjects they  discussed ranged from money to careers, family, values, love, self-pity and  dying.  And as Morrie weakens and approaches the end, Mitch is finally able  to put his own life into its proper perspective.<br />A poignant quote from  Morrie, &quot;We have to know about dying in order to live.&quot;<br />A warm  and very moving book.  Makes me wish I had a professor like Morrie  Schwartz.	2000-06-29

I also imagine that  Jeanne Ray has a real bright future ahead of her as an author.<br />When and  how do family feuds begin?  Thats exactly what Julie Roseman Roth and Romeo  Cacciamani would like to know when they meet at a business seminar.  For  almost all of their 60 odd years, through marraige and children, all these  two can remember is their families feuding in the manner of the Montagues  and Capulets although nobody knows the origins of the feud.  But this isn't  Verona in the 17th century and we're not reading about two teenagers.  Instead the story takes place in Boston in the 90's where these two adults  continue to run their small florist shops.  And as if the budding  relationship between the two isn't already complicated, both now have to  contend with their children who would just as soon continue the  rivaly.<br />The book unfolds as a most delightful read as these two older  people find love in all the wrong places and we move along with them  laughing and sighing as their tale reaches its conclusion.<br />A fun and  poignant read you won't forget too quickly.

As she did in her first book, Animal Husbandry, Laura Zigman entertains her readers with both a witty and poignant read in her new book Dating Big  Bird.  The plot of this book is not a new one, but in this skilled writer's  hands we really come to care about Ellen Franck, a 35 year old single woman  who hears her biological clock ticking away.<br />Ellen has a good job, a  nice apartment and one lovely 4 year old niece who suggests she takes Big  Bird to bed with her to keep her compnay.  And then Ellen, in one of the  more humorous chapters of the book contemplates what it would be like to  have a child with Big Bird. But being a bit more realistic Ellen thinks  about her choices for parenting which include Malcom, her present lover who  is emotionally frozen since his young son died several years before. As  Ellen struggles to make sense out of her relationship and the passage of  time, Ellen's sister and boss give birth to their second children leaving  Ellen totally desparate to have a child even if she's alone.<br />I did enjoy  this book and it will most likely provide readers with a light summer  offering but every reader must also be prepared for some serious moments  which offset the humor and wit.  And while today there are other novels and  many magazine articles about this subject, Dating Big Bird is one of the  better fiction reads one can experience on this topic.	2000-06-20

In her recent books like Talk Before Sleep and Range of Motion, Elizabeth Berg has become known as a writer of &quot;buddy&quot; books.  By this I mean that some of her books revolve arround women dealing with a medical  crisis and the support system of the buddies who surround these women.  But  as many of Berg's readers also know, she has tackled other subjects such as  the coming of age stories in Durable Goods and Joy School and passages in a  woman's life in my favorite book of hers, The Pull of the Moon.<br />Now, in  Until the Real Thing Comes Along, Ms. Berg once again takes on a subject  near and dear to many, the plight of single women who hear their biological  clocks ticking away.  Patty Murphy is a 30 something woman who not only  feels pressure from her family about finding Mr. Right and having a baby,  but also finds herself longing to settle down and become a mother.  And  while she dates some good prospects every now and then, she is waiting to  meet a man like her friend who unfortunately for Patty is a homosexual. And  when Patty and her friend make an unusual decision, the reader can't help  but be curious about the outcome.<br />This book is hardly a new subject and  one would expect that in the hands of Elizabeth Berg, this books would be  both witty and poignant but sadly to me as a readers it wasn't one of  Berg's better books and somehow missed the mark.  For me, the characters  didn't ring true and I found myself listening to whining throughout the  book.	2000-06-17

And I imagine that I'm not alone what I say that  there were many other readers who felt the same way I did.<br />Nan is turning  50 and her life hasn't turned out quite the way she expected.  Now her only  child, a daughter, is about to leave for college and she wonders where her  life is headed.  Unexpectedly Nan decides to take a trip which turns out to  be a journey of discovery and self-renewal.  Leaving a note for her husband  and daughter, some clothes and a leather bound journal to record her  thoughts, Nan takes to the road in her car not completely sure where shes  headed to.  And what she finds out about herself will have readers  thinking, &quot;I feel this way, &quot; or &quot;This is me,&quot; or  &quot;What will my life be like in the future.&quot;<br />As for last lines,  this book provides some of the most memorable ones I can remember in some  time.

In her memoir Tender at the Bone, Ruth Reichl, the former NY Times food critic serves to her readers a witty and poignant slice of her life growing up in a kitchen.<br />At a young age, Ms. Reichl who grew up in Manhattan,  began learning to cook and experimenting with recipes in her parents  kitchen at a young age, in what would become her first foray into a  lifetime interest and then career.  Ms. Reichl writes lovingly of her  passion for  foods and preparations, and how to come up with innovative  recipes and the world of chefs and restaurants.  And she also writes about  how this passion helped to sustain her during difficult times in rather  unusual family.<br />As the reader, we journey along with her as she covers  over for her schizophrenic mother who invites hordes of people and has  nothing to serve to them. We sit by her side as a wonderful houskeeper  takes Ms. Reichl under her wing and entertains her, where else, but in the  kitchen as Ms. Reichl begins to love the culinary world. And then we are  there when she attends college in Wisconsin and first waits on tables and  then is promoted to assistant chef.  And finally we have a front row seat  as Ms. Reichl takes her first job as a food critic in Berkeley where she  addresses her own concerns about inheriting her mother's illness and  overcomes some of her own fears.  And all the while we read about mouth  watering dishes and long for the book to go on and on.<br />I read this book  much too quickly and am now longing for another slice of her life as she  eventaully moved on to the NY Times.	2000-06-15

Many years ago I stumbled upon a book I borrowed from the library for no other reason than it had a most beautiful cover.  The book was The Shell Seekers by Rosamunde Pilcher and the rest is book history.  History because  this book about Penelope Keeling, her family, her life in the Cotsowlds  area of England and her memories of WWII has become a most beloved read  throughout the world.<br />Then recently, again while browsing the  libraries  audiotapes, I came across the tape of The Shell Seekers and thought, why  not listen to it.<br />Now there are few audios I would compare to the reading  experience. Clearly I enjoy reading more than listening and most often I  don't finish the audiotape preferring to experience the reading of a book  first. But in the case of The Shell Seekers audiotape, I found the tape  provided me once again with a wonderful experience as I was surrounded  totally by the characters, sights and sounds of Ms. Pilchers now classic  book The Shell Seekers.<br />This is now perfect walking weather and what  could be better than strolling along and listening to this pleasurable  read.  Believe me, before you know it, you'll be walking miles and miles  and won't want to stop till you hear the last word.	2000-06-15

Many years ago Rabbi Harold Kushner wrote the now classic book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People.  Now it is as if Rabbi Naomi Levy has written a companion book with To Begin Again, which also discusses constructively  what we can do when our lives are turned upset down.<br />Drawing on her own  experience when her father was killed and the author was a young woman,  Rabbi Levy explains how she turned away from God and questioned how God  could allow this murder to occur to her religious father and family.  But  she also goes on to describe the change in her thoughts abotu God as she  attended college and then decided to become a Rabbi. Rabbi Levy explains  how she came to think of God as by our side during our lowest times and the  power or force that guides us back to productive lives.  The author also  helps us to see how other things in our lives like nature and friends and  even community actitivites can help sustain us as we begin to live  again<br />As I enjoyed reading Rabbi Kushner's book almost 20 years ago, so  did I enjoy Rabbi Levy's equally inspiring and informative book.  And to  add to my reading pleasure was the wonderful experience I had when I was  able to hear Rabbi Levy speak in person and meet with her afterwards. I do  hope she will continue to write and look forward to reading her books.	2000-06-14

Ilene Beckerman, a few years ago thrilled readers when she told the story of her life through her clothes in the book Love, Loss and What I Wore.  In Ms. Beckerman's second book,What We Do for Love, she wrote about her  courtship, marraige, divorce and remarraige.  And now in her latest book,  Mother of the Bride, this witty and poignant author describes to her  readers the true story of what it means to be the mother of the  bride.<br />And what a fun and insightful book this turns out to be.  Because  nestled between the quest for a suitable mother of the bride dress and a  menu which won't cause indigestion, and other stress factors which are off  the Richter scale, the author also tells us what it means to raise a  daughter and watch her walk down the aisle towards her own married life.  What every mother thinks she longs for becomes bittersweet for Ms.  Beckerman as her days as an important Mommy to her daughter are now  replaced by her daughter's Prince Charming.<br />I not only loved the words  Ilene Beckerman wrote but the clever illustrations she did to depict events  and her feelings.  And I especially like the way she summed up this event  at the end by saying that, &quot;the planning took a year, the ceremony  took 20 minutes, the wedding recpetion was four hours long and I'd do it  again in a heartbeat.&quot;  Actually Ms. Beckerman has two other daughters  so hopefully she got to do this again or will be doing it in the near  future.<br />As I closed this book I thought how much I am looking forward to  my turn as the mother of the bride when our daughter finds her Mr. Right.  For now I am conetnt to clutch Ms. Beckerman's book in hand and dream of a  long aisle and wishes for health and happiness as our daughter is married.	2000-06-09

As I finished The Boomer by Marty Asher last night I sensed that this book was one which would keep me thinking for some time to come. For as I read the book I became painfully aware that the main character, Boomer, is  destined to live a life filled with angst, frustration and ultimately  disappointment.  And I imagine that most readers will feel as I did that  the author has perhaps glimpsed a part of many of the baby boomers lives  and written about them within the pages of this book. And how many of us  born before the 60's, who lived through such interesting times on their way  to maturity, have been disappointed with what has become of their lives and  are now only too painfully aware of this. Expecting so much, its as if not  only the boomer, but an entire generation found that all they hoped for  sadly didn't materialize.<br />The Boomer is a short book written with few  words and meaningful illustrations that had me sitting up and saying WOW!  As a child of the 60's and baby boomer who walked on many protest lines  throughout the years, the book at times made me sad to think of what  happened to many of us as life caught up with us and sadly interfered. In a  most clever manner, The Boomer, asks us to evaluate what went right or what  went wrong. I did find that at the end there was a general feeling of  sadness as to some of the things which may be passing by my generation  today but if this was the point of the read, then Mr. Asher has done a fine  job.  And more important, The Boomer made me sit up and think about the  direction of my life.<br />I did enjoy this book and do recommend it.  I also  hope that it will not only appeal to the baby boomers among us but also to  older and younger people as well.	2000-06-08

This book told the story of Dee Cunnane, recently arrived from Ireland, and Travis Grant the owner of a large horse farm in  Maryland.  Continuing the story in Irish Rose, published a few years later,  readers were introduced to Dee's cousin, Rose, also from Ireland, who finds  herself falling in love with the owner of another horse ranch in the United  States.  Since that time, Ms. Roberts has become a most beloved romance  author continung to dominate the field with her trilogies, romantic  suspense, category offerings and even futuristic mysteries written under  the name JD Robb.<br />Now Ms. Roberts returns to Maryland's green fields and  horse country in her latest book, Irish Rebel, where we meet Dee and  Travis's oldest daughter, Keeley.  Keeley Grant is very much like her Irish  born mother, headstrong and determined to succeed in all that she tries  with little time for romantic interests.  But she more than meets her match  in Brian Donnelly who has journeyed from Ireland to work as a horse trainer  for the Grants.  Sparks fly almost immediately and the before the reader  knows it, they are once again furiously turning the pages to see what  happens next.<br />Although I have read many of Nora Roberts's titles, she  never fails to interest me as she  weaves a wonderful tale and this book is  no exception.

But things are not always as they  appear for Mikaela has hidden a secret past from her family which will come  back to haunt all of them.<br />In her latest book, Angel Falls, the well  known romance writer Kristin Hannah has written a contemporary title which  is filled with great emotion and poignancy.  During a typical morning's  ride, Mikaela, is thrown from her horse and sustains a head trauma which  results in a coma.  While Liam and the others talk to her and pray for her,  Liam learns about Mikaela's secret past.  Then sacrificing both his love  for her and family life as they know it, he seeks help from the one man who  may ulitmately change the Campbells lives as they know them.<br />While this  book is a fast read unlike most romance novels it is told from the man's  point of view.  But as I read it I couldn't help but feel as though  something was missing.  While most romance novels are somewhat predictable,  I have always enjoyed Kristin Hannah's wasy of enveloping her readers with  her characters lives and situations.  Unfortunately, this time, I didn't  find her characters as finely drawn nor the events during Mikaela's coma  plausible. Then again, if you're looking for a good beach read this summer,  Angel Falls may be just the right book.	2000-06-03

As her readers have come to expect, Elizabeth Berg's book, Joy School, is a wonderful sequel and continuation of the story about Katie, whom we first meet in Durable Goods.  And while this book can easily stand alone, I do  suggest that both books be read.<br />Joy School now finds Katie once again  living with her father but this time on a different army base and in a  different part of Texas.  Her sister is still off with her boyfriend and  instead of her neighbor and confidant Cherylann, Katie now has a  housekeeper who becomes her close friend.<br />Although Katie has found it  difficult to find true friends, after an accident she does meet an older  man, and he becomes her main interest.<br />As Katie forms a serious crush on  this 25 year old, it's as if all of the bad in her life is somehow being  erased and she thinks to herself that &quot;He will be my joy  school.&quot;<br />This is a poignant and memorable story of young love which  I imagine many readers will identify with from their own first love  experiences.	2000-05-27

And like these other adolescents, Katie, has lived more years  than her age. Still dealing with the loss of her mother to cancer several  years before the book begins, Katie now lives with her abusive father and  her older sister Diane.  It's the beginning of the 60's and as if life  isn't complicated enough, Katie lives  in Texas on an army base where at  best people come and go. Completing Katie's circle is her older, next door  neighbor Cherylann who is determined to teach her about love and life.

But then the show became successful and Camryn won the Emmy and who could ever forget her acceptance speech when she said.  &quot;This is for all the fat people.&quot;<br />And now Camryn in her book,  Wake Up, I'm Fat, provides her viewing public with a memoir of sorts about  her life not only what its like to be fat but to be a fat actress.  Camry  begins her story when her parents moved the family to to Long Beach, Ca  where everybody had skinny figures to her days in high school as a band  groupie to her working at Renaiisance Fairs where large women were in  style.  Then onto college years and her time at NYU studying drama, her  days as a signer for the deaf and then her initial roles on Broadway and in  the movies.<br />And all the while Camryn talks about her other life as a  woman desperately trying to lose weight, her love life, the underground  movement which applauds fat people and finally her acceptance of herself  and her advocacy on the part of fat people.<br />Manheim describes her plight,  shared by so many others, so well that you just can't help but cry and  cheer for her when she finally accpets herself and begins to enjoy life as  a large woman.<br />The book is also filled with fun industry gossip- her  admiration for David Kelly and Kathy Bates and how she even once picked up  the Marlboro man.<br />For anybody who has ever struggled with being too  large, this book is a wonderful antidote.	2000-05-25

Getting used to small town life on the Hudson has  proved to be pleasant but these two young people must now begin earning an  income.  Athough they live as wealthy people in the year 1932, according to  the terms of Horatio's will they won't inherit anything for almost ten  years.  Lily and Robert come up with an idea to provide some income by  hosting a weekend of paying guests and a celebrity who will entertain all.  The assortment of people who gather for their weekend, though, have links  to one another from previous days and suddenly there's been a murder and it  seems as though almost everyone has a motive.<br />This book was very charming  and evoked an era and style which is now forever gone.

And while Mary Pat Kelly's book, Special Intentions, provides one with a small glimpse of a  nun's life, it left me as the reader pondering why this young woman took up  this calling in the first place.<br />The year is 1962 and Margaret Mary Lynch  becomes a postulant shortly after graduating from high school.  Almost from  the very beginning Margaret proves to be an outspoken woman who questions  almost everything including her own devtion.  Attending college as a  postulant and then becoming a teacher in a ghetto neighborhood does little  to make her feel mroe compoftable about  her ulitmate vows.  But even when  Margaret becomes more comfortable as a teacher, the leaders of her convent  find her at fault over most issues and then assign her to a parochial  school where her students will be very different from what she had been  used to.  This new assignment proves to be too much for Margaret and now at  the age of 22, when m,ost young peopel are first graduating from college,  Margaret decides to leave the convent. It didn't surprise me as I read on  that her first act once she leaves the religious order is to help out in a  tent city in Selma, Alabama.<br />As the 60's were a time of change both  socially and racially within the United States and other countries, so did  the times change within the Catholic Church.  Young women who once thought  they were well suited for life within a religious order suddenly began  questioning everything and other nuns and priests like Margaret gave up  their religious orders for lives within secular communities.  I suspect  this book might have been somewhat autobiographical and if so I couldn't  help buy wonder why the author ever entertained the idea of becoming a nun  when she was so ill suited for this vocation.  Despite this, though, on  some level I did enjoy reading about Margaret's changes both personally and  religiously.th personally and  religiously.	2000-05-24

Several years ago I read my first Anne Tyler book, Ladder of Years, and became a devoted fan of this author's books. Catching up on some earlier titles,I have just finished another one of her books, Earthly Possessions.  And once again this author has captivated me and tugged at my  heartstrings.<br />Earthly Possessions focuses on two of Tyler's most  endearing characters, Charlotte Emory and Jake.  Charlotte is at a bank one  day when Jake bungles a robbery.  Holding Charlotte as his hostage and with  200 $1 bills in his pocket from the robbery, he steals a car and the two  set off to find Jake's pregnant girlfriend somewhere in Florida.  What may  appear as a horrific kidnapping to others in the bank, provides Charolotte  with an exciting adventure, once she knows she won't be harmed in anyway.  Unfortunately Charlotte has never set foot outside of her small hometown  and was at the bank to withdraw her life savings in order to run away from  her husband. As Charlotte and Jake travel South, with the police searching  for them, Charlotte reflects on her life and earthly posessions till the  ending which is thought provoking and poignant.<br />The end of the book and  some other parts are reminiscent of some cental themes which Tyler seems to  explore in many of her books.  But the author relying on tried and true  themes never seems to matter to me when I read Anne Tyler as once again she  introduces me to quirky and memorable characters who stay with me long  after I've finished the book	2000-05-23

When the boyfriend doesn't die, the book probes not only the previous relationship between this young man and his girlfriend  but their parents' reactions as well as the legal ramifications concerning  the one who survived.<br />In her newest book, Plain Truth, Ms. Picoult enters  the world of the Amish sect who still today live by priciples contary to  the 21st century.  And again as in The Pact, when a young unmarried woman,  Katie Fisher, is accused of murdering a newborn which she has presumably  given birth to, the law steps in and these events tear apart a family and  community steeped in the Amish traditions and mores.  For Ellie Hathaway,  an urban sophisticated lawyer somewhat related to this community and the  other major character in thsi book, defending this client provides her not  only with a world filled with &quot;plain&quot; truths and different rules,  but also a glimpse into the failures of her own life.<br />Jodi Picoult has  written another fascinating book.  One which can takes its place amongst  many of her other books such as Keeping Faith, The  Pact and Harvesting the  Heart.  Her characters in Plain Truth, as always, are well pprtrayed and  stay with the reader long after they close the book.  Also, it is apprent  that Ms.Picoult did a great deal of research as well as live amongst the  Amish to learn more about the ways of the plain.<br />Finally, the author  sheds new light on events often in the news today along with presenting a  lifestyle which I as the reader knew very little about before reading this  book.<br />Bravo for a first rate novel, Jodi.	2000-05-19

Just Revenge also explores the legal ramifications  when one man takes the law into his own hands to settle the score over  incidents which occurred almost 50 years ago.<br />By now many of us have read  accounts of old men brought to trial for crimes committed during WWII and  the Holocaust.  And when as a lawyer Abe is asked to defend an old friend  who has meted out his own form of justice, it not only becomes a questions  of legality but one of historical significance as well as ethical and moral  questions as well.<br />The book moves along at a good and interesting pace  until almost the end when it becomes much too convoluted, unlikely and even  predictable for those readers who like a happy ending.	2000-05-19

In the case of Pay it Forward it may be sheer curiosity by the public as it was in my case.  While I imagine many will view this book in the same light as another cult favorite from many years ago, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, I will not be recommending this book to too many people.  I did think the premise of paying forward good deeds sounds wonderful and there is a nice love story within the pages of the book, but my opinion is that the book wasn't well written and became predictable after only a few pages.  Even the ending which should have evoked some emotion from sentimental me did almost nothing - only provided me with a bit of happiness that the book was finally over.<br />Bottom line - wait for the movie.	2000-05-19

Some of his more newsworthy clients have been have been Claus Von Bulow, OJ  Simpson and Mike Tyson.  And while Dershowitz may be in a position to write  a legal brief or scholarly work about the law, after reading this book, I  seriously questioned his ability to write a compelling piece of ficiton.  While The Advocate's Devil moves along at a quick pace,it's as if  Dershowitz lifted it from the front page of a newspaper describing a  sensational rape or murder case.  Either he tried hard to write a  worthwhile book or possibly wrote this book to explain to an unkowing  public how and why he as a lwayer could defend the clients he has in the  past.<br />With a superior knowledge of both the actions of defense lawyers,  prosecuting attorneys and the ins and outs of the court system itself, one  would have expected a more worthwhile read.	2000-05-19

As if  that wasn't enough, Michael is now calling himself Misha and not only has a  new group of artist friends, but also a new lady friend on his arm.<br />The  descriptions of the artist's colony, like Day's descriptions of San  Francisco from the early 20th century, were vivid and informative, and the  relationship angle between Michael and Fremont is more intriguing, overall  something was missing from this latest entry into this series.	2000-05-18

And now that I've read it, I  must say Anything Goes, is a delightful and fun read even if you don't  always favor murder mysteries.<br />Lily Brewser and her brother, Robert, are  unfortunate vitims of the Depression.  Born to wealthy parents they lived a  life of luxury until that fateful day when the market crashed and their  father committed suicide.  Working at tiresome jobs and sharing a small  apartment in Manhattan, they experience great difficulties in making ends  meet.

Grace and Favor is an English term which refers to living in a home  and maintaining it for a period of time after which you totally inherit the  house. And as the Brewsters feared they cannot sell the house for a very  long time if ever.  There is the requisite murder which  involves their  great uncle and a growing affection for Lily on the part of an area  newspaperman.<br />Just the other day I came across the second book in this  series called, In the Still of the Night, which was recently published.

Fremont who  takes her name from her pioneering relative John Fremeont is a woman living  in the early 20th century with a 21st century feminist attitude.  The  mystery which hold one's attention is nothing compared to the relationships  which Day creates and will have readers eagerly waiting to pick up the  second book in the series.	2000-05-15

I have been a loyal and devoted reader of Diane Chamberlain's books for the last ten years.  Unfortunately, I didn't care for Summer's Child nearly as much as I did Breaking the Silence, her last book, or even some of her  earlier books.<br />For some reason her characters never grew on me and I felt  the outcome was predictable.<br />This doesn't mean I'm not eagerly waiting  for her next title.  I only hope it will be better than this one.	2000-05-12

Since I always enjoy multi-generational sagas, I was most enthusiastic when I first picked up this book.  But I'm afraid that I didn't enjoy this title nearly as much as I thought I would.<br />Lippi's writings, at times,  did invoke the spirit and solitude of the isolated Alpine farming village  and the women who lived there.  And these images and characters did fill  the pages of the  interlocking stories over an 80 year period.  While the  reader becomes familiar with these women's lives, losses and regrets, all  of the stories weren't nearly as spirited or poignant as they could have  been.<br />And for some strange reason, the family trees appeared as endpapers  at the back of the book and since I didn't see then till I was almost  finished with the book, I felt that having them in the front might have  made things less confusing and I also might have enjoyed the book more.<br />I  know that Rosina Lippi spent time in a village similar to the one she wrote  about and I am sure this book was factual but I was hoping for stories with  a bit more.  I have since learned that Rosina Lippi also writes historical  fiction under the name of Sara Donati.  I now plan on reading one of these  books to see if I like them better than this one.	2000-05-12

I knew nothing about this book before it was nominated for and won the National Book Award.  But then curiousity got the better of me, and once I began reading this tale set in China, I gulped dpown the pages of this  intriguing novel.<br />Ha Jin, who teaches at Emory University in Atalnta, has  written a well constructed tale set agains the political climate of  Commusinst China almost 30 years ago.<br />The main character, Lin Kong, a  doctor tries year after year to obtain a divorce from his country wife whom  he only married so she would take care of his aging parents.  But Lin Kong  works in a a large city most of the year where he has a mistress who is  urging him to marry her after all this time. And while his city mistress is  more  worldly than his country wife, it still doesn't change the fact that  every year there are  stumbling blocks to Lin being free to marry  anyone.<br />And in an ironic twist worthy of O. Henry or Alfred Hitchcock, by  the book's end Lin King is found still waiting.<br />I really enjoyed this  book and while I'm not sure it should have won the National Book Award I do  think its well written and very interesting.	2000-05-11

Many of us have read so many books and tales of experiences from the Holocaust that I seriously wondered if this book would shed any new light on the subjct matter.  Well, for me as a reader it certainly did.  While I  have read many first hand and fictional accounts about the camps and even  life after the war, this book did a fine job of describing the early years  of WWII and then life on the run and with the Resistance movement.  I shed  tears when Elia learned of the fate of his beloved and the ending certainly  was heart wrenching.  I also enjoyed the way the author involved a  teenager, who thought she knew everything, into a relationship with Elia  which ultimately changed the direction of her life.<br />I was saddened to  read the the author died shortly before the book was published.  I would  have looked forward to more books by her.	2000-05-08

Although I have owned this book for several years, it wasn't until I saw the ad for the movie that I decided I had to read it.  And am I glad I did! This is a wonderful read filled with memorable characters. I'm only sorry I  gulped down the pages as fast as I did. I would love to read more books  with characters like Novalee Nation and some of the others from this book  and wouldn't mind finding out what they are doing 10 years from now. Cannot  wait to see the movie (only hope it's as good) and read more books by  Billie Letts.	2000-05-05

Unfortunately I am sorry that I spent time reading his newest title, Crying  Wolf.  By the middle of this book, I was tired of the innocence of the  freshman and left cold by the twins.  I found myself seriously skimming to  get to the end and be finished with it.<br />If you still are interested in  reading a good novel set on a college campus which is a good psychological  thriller, then pick up Paullina Simons title from a few years ago called  Red Leaves.	2000-05-05

In recent years, several authors have tried to cash in on what I call The Bridges of Madison County syndrome.  These are small romantic books which provoke sighs and cries.  And to my mind no recent book better fits this  description than The Observatory. Focusing on twin sisters who coulnd't be  less alike, one a small town librarian, the other a sophisticated divorcee  and mother of two.  When her worldly sister suffers a devestating tragedy,  the librairan comes to her twin's aid but not without reprecussions to  their relationship. And then the librarian meets her nephew's teacher and  the rest of the book becomes a classic romance tale. Man and woman meet,  man and woman begin a relationship, the man betrays the woman and then  returns with apologies and pledges eternal love. And to me the ending was  about as predictable as one could imagine.<br />Last year I read Grayson's  first book, The Gazebo, which as much as it was sappy and equally  predictable, was a much better read.	2000-05-05

Towards the summer, when thoughts turn to sun and sand, there are ceratin titles which are published that are geared towrds the twenty and thirty something dating scene. In 1999, two books were published shortly after the  success of Bridget Jones' Diary which meet this criteria.  They were  Otherwise Engaged and The Girl's Guide to to Hunting and Fishing.  Although  I read all three of the above mentioned books I really would recommend  Girl's Guide to the other two.<br />Written as a collection of interweaving  and interlocking stories all but one entranced me and had my fingers  hurriedly turning the pages.  The central character isJane Rosenal who we  are first introduced to in the story Advanced Beginners, when she is 14 and  her 20 year old brother brings home his 28 year old girlfriend.  And from  there we follow Jane as she lives with a considerably older man to the  title story where Jane finds love when she gives up playing by the  &quot;rules.&quot;<br />This book was filled with a good dose of humor and wit  and at times, great poignancy. I imagine that many will be waiting to read  Banks' next book -I will most probably be first in line.	2000-05-05

Perhaps too much ground was covered.  And as I read through the first 200 pages of the  book, I was hoping that by the end, some questions would be answered, but  instead I found the last few pages even more confusing.<br />I am aware that  this book recently won the Discovery Award from Barnes &amp; Noble for a  first time author and I wondered why. Perhaps I need to read this book  again to confirm my primary opinion.	2000-05-05

And while some may find this book depressing, I found parts of it quite humorous.  And if you read this book you will never forget the last scene of the four sisters riding off to deposit two sisters to a nursing home.	2000-05-05

Colony was written by Anne Rivers Siddons sometime ago, but I only just read it recently.  And now that I have, I imagine that this title will always remain one of my very favorite books from this author.<br />The reader  of this book is treated to 70 odd years in the life of the main character  Maude Chambliss as she spends the season at a small summer colony in Maine.  You come to know her life and its joys as well as its tragedies.  You also  learn about her life, not only with her husband and domineering  mother-in-law, but with her children and other islanders.<br />And when you  close the last page of this book you will sigh, wish it could have lasted  longer and think about the characters and plots as I did.	2000-05-04

A longtime reader of this author, I found More Than You Know  totally different from her other books and applaud her ability to change  both tone and style of this title.  Paralleling two tragic stories,  Ms.Guthecon allows her readers to glimpse life in small town Maine almost  100 years apart with an equally paralleling story.  The reader not only  comes to know the characters well but also the landscape of the island and  town. The story, while sad, has wondrous moments of first love and  devotion.  Finally, I found the book fairly reminiscent of The Weight of  Water by Anita Shreve, another very compelling and different read.	2000-04-21

A Sudden Change of Heart is the newest title of a novel written by Barbara Taylor Bradford. In the past I have really enjoyed some of her books like Her Own Rules and Act of Will and also disliked some of her titles like  Angel and Dangerous to Know. And I am one of the few people who could never  get into A Woman of Substance (Bradford's blockbuster saga which has two  other books in the series and was also made into a mini-series). Well, I'm  afraid that her newest book is one which I can't wait to finish.  Unfortunately, this time around, Bradford brought much too much to her  writing table, so there are too many plot lines that are underdeveloped as  well as characters.  If you've ever read Bradford and enjoyed her- skip  this one.	1999-02-27

The Long Road Home, though, has me wondering if I will ever read another Steel novel. This book was so very grim and of course Steel wrapped it up into a neat package where her readers are to assume that Gabriella will lead a happy and normal life after her horrible tale of woe.  But the world doesn't work this way and in the hands of a better writer one would have felt the abuse without Steel's resorting to sensationalism. Perhaps Steel would have made this reader happier if instead of Gabbie going off with the perfect doctor to a perfect life she would have had her use the money she inherited and set up a faclility for other abused children, learned to take care of heself and then meet a man who will walk alongside her in all of her endeavors. Finally, if one wants to see Steel at her best, read her earlier books and forget the more recent ones except for The Ghost.	1998-06-01

Unfortunaty, this is the only book that Morrissey has published in this country.

There was Morrie Schwartz being interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline.  Morrie once a man that danced wildy among the college set in Boston was dying from ALS  (Lou Gehrig's disease)  but he chose not to go quietly into that good night.

The subjects they discuss range from money, career, family, values, love, self pity and dying. And as Morrie weakens and approaches the end, Mitch is finally able to put his own life into its proper prespective.<br /> A poignant quote from Morrie, &quot;We have to know about dying in order to live.&quot;<br /> A warm and very moving book.  Makes me wish I once had a professor like Morrie Schwartz.	1998-02-07
