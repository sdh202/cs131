XSLT is one of those technologies that takes awhile to get the hang of.  Once you've learned the basics, you'll end up needing to refer back to reference material often.  One way to make that process a bit quicker would be to have a copy of Even Lenz's XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference on hand...<br /><br />Contents:  Data Model; The XPath Language; How XSLT Works; Elements; Functions; Extending XSLT; XPath 1.0 Grammar; XSLT Pattern Grammar; Index<br /><br />Looking at the back cover, the impression is such that you could use this book to get \\"up to speed quickly\\" on XSLT.  Perhaps you could, but if this was your first and only exposure to XSLT and it works out that way, you're a far better IT professional than I am.  The information is concise and correct, to be sure.  But it's not going to walk you through the subject in a tutorial fashion.  Conversely, if you understand the basics and need a quick visual reference on how to use a feature, say like &lt;xsl:sort>, this book shines.  You don't have to wade through a dozen pages of conversation to find out the format and syntax.  Two pages total in this book, and you have all the details.  And that's what an O'Reilly's Pocket Reference title is for...<br /><br />If you're working with XSLT already and need that \\"cheat sheet\\" material, I'd recommend this book.  You'll get a lot of value from it.  If you're looking to learn XSLT, you'll probably want to start with something more tutorial in nature first.  Once you've got that down, head over here for ongoing reference...	2005-10-09

The podcasting titles are starting to show up fast and furious.  I recently received a copy of O'Reilly's Podcasting Hacks - Tips & Tools for Blogging Out Loud by Jack D. Herrington.  It's a very good choice for both the rank novice as well as the person who wants to take their podcasting to the next level...<br /><br />Contents:  Tuning into Podcasts; Starting Out; Quality Sound; Formats; Interviewing; Blogging; Publicity; Basic Editing; Advanced Audio; On the Go; Videoblogging; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Some of the Hacks titles cover a wide range of tips and hints on a subject, and you end up picking and choosing what works for you.  There are a few that seem to go a step beyond and provide a pretty complete coverage of how to get started with something, as well as how to improve your skills if you've already started.  Podcasting Hacks seems to fall nicely into that second category.  There is some coverage on how to get going with listening to podcasts, like #8 - Listening to Podcasts on Your PDA and #9 - Podcatching with Your PlayStation Portable.  There's even a number of Perl hacks you can use to do some \\"roll your own\\" development.  But the book really shines when you get into the main areas of how to produce a podcast.  You'll learn how to pick the right microphone (#13) for your needs, how to set up a home studio (#61), and even how to produce your podcasts in surround sound (#16).  Add in a number of recommendations of hardware and software, and you've got a valuable guide to becoming the next voice to be heard...<br /><br />Unless you're already an Adam Curry in the podcasting world, this is a book worth reading.  You'll either get off to a good start, or you'll take your podcasting to the next level.  Either way, your audience will thank you...	2005-10-09

I finally made it through the hold list at the library for Robin Cook's latest novel Marker.  I'm never quite sure if I'm going to like or hate each of his novels, as the story lines seem to hit me as varying in quality.  Marker is better than some of his other ones, and I enjoyed it.  It's not without some nits in my opinion, however...<br /><br />Laurie Montgomery is a medical examiner at the city morgue.  She starts running across a number of deaths that are unexpected and have no pathology to indicate their cause.  Just perfectly healthy people dropping dead after routine procedures.  Her suspicions start to move towards a serial killer loose in one of the local hospitals, but of course no one wants to hear or believe that.  Amidst all of this turmoil, she's also got a number of personal crises issues to deal with, including a troubling genetic test and a relationship that's not going where she wants it to end up.  As she slowly starts getting people to buy into her killer scenario, she ends up in a situation that just might make her the next victim...<br /><br />Overall, the story wasn't bad.  It seemed to be a bit long in the middle, and I felt like we went through a few iterations of events that didn't advance the story at all.  It was just activity for the sake of activity.  The ending was great, in that I had to pick up my reading pace because I needed to find out how it all ended.  My biggest problem was the agenda that Cook is pushing in the book.  I'm not one much for personal crusades wrapped in popular fiction, and Cook seems to excel in that.  In this story, he paints the managed care industry as the evil boogieman, with genetic testing being the final invasion of our personal privacies.  While there are issues there to be sure, the \\"insurance is evil, doctors are good\\" theme got to be much too heavy for my likings.<br /><br />Fun read, and perhaps the underlying theme will resonate more with you than it did for me.  In my case, it flawed what would have otherwise been an excellent novel.ould have otherwise been an excellent novel.	2005-10-09

I finally got around to reading a book that's been talked about a lot in blogging circles...  Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.  I found it fascinating, and it certainly explains a lot of things that I've often wondered about...<br /><br />The main question here is what happens in those first couple of seconds when you observe something?  Without often knowing why, you make some snap judgements that can often be extremely accurate.  But when asked to explain why you felt that way, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint the correct reasons.  This process of decision-making is called \\"thin-slicing\\", and it's the stripping away of various inputs that don't end up affecting the outcome of your decision.  If faced with 100 items of information about a decision, it's often just a small handful of items that consistently predict success or failure.  The subconscious can often find those points and sift out the pattern without us being able to know why.  Experts in a field, due to their exposure to the subject, can thin-slice even more quickly.  They stand a better chance of being able to explain the \\"why\\" behind it, but even then it's somewhat iffy.  Once you're aware of the thin-slicing phenomenon, you can start to accept it as a valid way to aid in the decision-making process.<br /><br />It wasn't covered in the book, but an application of this is something I've always found irritating in sports broadcasts.  You have color commentators taking a play and dissecting the smallest movements in the players, explaining how each one made conscious decisions to shift the hips here or move the arm there.  In reality, there's little conscious decisions made at all.  The players are really thin-slicing the situation based on their past experiences, and making split-second reactions.  The more experience and practice, the better the thin-slicing.  All the extraneous action and information is stripped away, and the things that matter are handled instantaneously.  If this type of thinking was more well-known, color commentators could be out of a job...  :)<br /><br />Definitely worth reading and pondering.  You may not agree with Gladwell, but it will force you to think about things...ntaneously.

RFID Sourcebook by Sandip Lahiri is a very well done title that you should investigate if you're starting to look into how RFID technology might be used in your organization...<br /><br />Contents:  Technology Overview; Advantages of the Technology; Limitations of the Technology; Application Areas; Privacy Concerns; RFID Versus Bar Code; The RFID Strategy; Creating Business Justification for RFID; Designing and Implementing an RFID Solution; Standards; Closing Thoughts; RFID Vendors, News Sources, and Conferences; Passive Tag Manufacturing Overview; Glossary; Index<br /><br />I found this book to be the type that you could legitimately use in order to plan your company's approach to RFID.  It's not a \\"rah rah\\" book that pretends that RFID is a panacea to all the manufacturing problems that exist.  It's an even-handed coverage of the subject, and he doesn't have any qualms about covering the pros and cons that you'll have to consider if you use RFID.  There's a degree of technical information in the book, but not so much that a higher-level decision maker would get bogged down in details.  I guess I'd consider it more of a strategic book to make good fundamental initial decisions, and to get your project moving in the right direction early.<br /><br />If RFID is something that your organization or industry is pursuing, grab this book to get grounded in the fundamentals.	2005-10-09

So...  have phone books become outdated in the world of on-line access?  No, because not everyone has a computer or on-line access.  But isn't a \\"yellow pages\\" of websites by subject rather useless with the abundance of search engines.  Perhaps not as much as I originally thought...  I got a chance to review Que's Internet Yellow Pages (2006 Edition) by Joe Kraynak, and the concept of a \\"paper search directory\\" does have a few merits...<br /><br />The book (all 1100 plus pages) looks nearly identical to a real yellow pages directory.  The web sites don't have ads, but the contents are listed by subject matter (like Reference or Cigars), and then the sites are listed alphabetically within those areas.  Each entry has the title, the web address, and a brief description as to what the site offers (or how it's different than others like it).  There are also some icons that help you get a bit more out of the directory.  There's a \\"Best\\" icon given to the site that the author deems the best in that category.  The dollar sign icon means you can purchase stuff on-line.  The usability guide is one to five stars that rank how easy it is to find information.  And finally, there are children ratings that indicate the appropriateness of the site for different age groups.  It's well designed to find the information, and to get a feel for what you'll be visiting before you get there.<br /><br />So back to the main issue...  Why is this any different, never mind \\"better\\", than a search directory like Yahoo?  It's a legitimate question, as I always used to snicker when I saw this book in the bookstores.  But after leafing through the pages, I'm of a different opinion now.  Online directories are driven by a single focus.  You go on-line to find information about subject \\"X\\", and that's all you search for.  You may miss other sites of interest due to a bad keyword choice, or you may not even know that other sites on similar subjects exist.  And it's for sure you're not going to get much meta information about the site, such as the age target or how easy it is to navigate.  The book gives you that advantage.  And there's something to be said for finding an interesting subject and going off on a side trip that could pay unexpected benefits.  Searching for specific terms make that much more unlikely.  This book gives you the chance to broaden your view and allow various ideas to grab your attention...<br /><br />Does this book replace or challenge Yahoo and Google?  Not hardly.  Searching for specific information is still something that the search engines excel in.  But if you're looking for opinions on sites covering a subject, or if you just want to \\"surf something new that you've never though of before\\", the Yellow Pages might offer some interesting insights and diversions...

I haven't had the chance to read and review any books from the Pragmatic Programmers series.  I decided to change that with the book Ship It! - A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects by Jared Richardson and William Gwaltney Jr.  After finishing the book, I put in an order for a few more titles.  If all the titles are this practical and useful, I'll be a happy camper...<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction; Tools and Infrastructure; Pragmatic Project Techniques; Tracer Bullet Development; Common Problems and How to Fix Them; Tip Summary; Source Code Management; Build Scripting Tools; Continuous Integration Systems; Issue Tracking Software; Development Methodologies; Testing Frameworks; Suggested Reading List; Index<br /><br />Richardson and Gwaltney don't try to add yet another methodology that guarantees your life will be rosy.  Basically, that methodology doesn't exist.  But there are a number of best practices that they've found from real-world experience, and they share those here.  The key word is \\"practical\\" (hence the \\"Pragmatic\\" part of the series title).  Even if you can't necessarily adopt all of their suggestions, you can easily take one or two and merge them into your routine.  Once they've changed the way you work, you'll be ready for a few new changes.<br /><br />For instance, they are really big on automated build processes for your software development that requires a compile and packaging process.  Having the process done manually means that it won't get done as often as it should, or it will be machine dependent.  Taking the time to learn something like Ant can dramatically improve your effectiveness and productivity.  Same with using continuous integration software.  If your project is constantly being built and tested without intervention, it's a guarantee that new problems will be caught early and resolved quickly.<br /><br />After reading this book, I'm planning on investigating the use of a wiki for \\"The List\\", as well as possibly downloading Bugzilla to have a formal issue tracking system.  For me, that's the sign of a great book...  you walk away with a few action items that will change what you do today, not sometime in the future.

I've always been fascinated with listening to unusual broadcasts like shortwave radio and emergency frequencies.  Therefore, I was happy to have the opportunity to review the book Two-Way Radios & Scanners For Dummies by H. Ward Silver.  It's an excellent way to get started in this hobby (or obsession)...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Making Radio a Habit, a Hobby, or a Helper: Introducing Radios and the Wireless Word; Discovering the Art and Science of Radio; Making Radio Fit Your Life<br /><br />Part 2 - Two-Way Radios at Home, Work, and Play: A Radio in Your Pocket - FRS/GMRS Radios; Breaker, Breaker - Using Citizens Band; Communicating in Emergencies; Workaday Wireless - Business Radio Services; Ladies and Gentlemen, Ships at Sea - Marine Radio; Citizen Wireless - Amateur Radio<br /><br />Part 3 - Listening In - Scanning and Shortwave Listening: One Adam 12 - Scanner Basics; Scanning Public Service and Safety Radio Transmissions; Radio Aloft - Aviation Radio Transmissions; Radios in Uniform: Government Radio Transmissions; Radio in Action - Recreational Radio Transmissions; Surfing the Air World - Shortwave Listening<br /><br />Part 4 - Getting Technical with Your Radio: Building Your Radio Toolbox; A Spark of Electronic Know-How; Installing Radios Right; Getting a Charge Out of Batteries; Putting Your Computer to Work; Troubleshooting Your Radio<br /><br />Part 5 - The Part of Tens: Ten Radio Secrets; Ten Emergency Tips; Ten Radio First-Aid Techniques; Ten New Ways to Have Fun with Your Radio; Glossary; Index<br /><br />There's not much that Silver doesn't cover in this book.  He works both sides of the radio spectrum, from just listening to actually participating.  If the usage of the airwaves in a particular category require having a license, he covers the requirements in order to make sure you stay legal.  The basics of the hardware for each type of activity is illustrated in a very easy-to-understand fashion without getting overly technical.  Same with subjects like antennas.  There are some really heavy-duty scientific principles behind how antennas work and how different frequency ranges really require different antenna types.  Silver is able to get you through this without the eyes glazing over...  My personal favorite part of the book was on the shortwave listening.  I remember listening to shortwave broadcasts from Radio Nederlands when I was young, amazed that I could be hearing stuff from the other side of the earth.  This book brought back some of those same feelings.<br /><br />This book is a very good way to get yourself started in the business of voice communications over the airwaves.

I've actually had a bit more time lately for recreational reading, and I decided to start a book I was sent by an author...  The Devil's Halo by Chris Fox.  It's an excellent cyber-war novel, and it's a future not hard to imagine...<br /><br />Fast forward a few years into the future...  The United States is one of the most despised nations in Europe (and in the rest of the world, for that matter).  Their military posture is intolerable to many, and especially in terms of how they view space.  The European Union has decided to include Russia for their space technology, and the French leadership of the Union wants to strike a decisive blow to America's military superiority.  The plan is to launch an \\"electronic Pearl Harbor\\" that will strip America of any technological advantage.  Terry Weston and his wife are sent over to Russia to recover a stolen movie file encrypted with \\"unbreakable\\" military encryption.  He was an economic spy for many years, but he thought he was out of the game.  A little blackmail brings him back in against his will.  After recovering the movie, the \\"E-Day\\" scenario starts to heat up, and he's once again coerced into continuing the spy game.  This type of life-and-death espionage isn't his forte, but he's the only asset on the ground.  The plot is uncovered, but the question is whether he'll stay alive long enough to get the information back to the proper authorities....  or if they'll even listen if he does...<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot, and on a number of levels...  For one, I enjoyed the cyber-warfare angle.  It's becoming a more important tool to both use and attack, and it adds a whole new element to the art of war.  Next, the scenario of America as an international pariah seems to be more realistic each day.  The near-future world that Fox paints in the novel isn't a stretch, and the headlines aren't that far away.  And finally, this isn't necessarily a \\"good guys win, bad guys lose, and life goes on\\" story.  Actions happen that have ramifications for all sides, and \\"winning\\" can also mean \\"losing\\"...<br /><br />Definitely a recommended read that will keep you turning pages even as the hour grows late...en that have ramifications for all sides, and \\"winning\\" can also mean \\"losing\\"... <br /> <br />Definitely a recommended read that will keep you turning pages even as the hour grows late...	2005-10-01

Elizabeth Benedict.  She found me on Amazon and suggested I might be interested in her latest book, The Practice Of Deceit.  I picked up a copy at the library, and just finished it last night.  Very impressive...<br /><br />Eric Lavender is a psychotherapist, visiting California to help clean up affairs after his father's death.  Before he heads back to New York to resume his life, he happens to meet Colleen Golden, an attorney, single mom, and survivor of a nasty divorce where the father left her while she was pregnant.  Eric falls for her hard, and ends up moving in with her.  To his surprise, fatherhood agrees with him.  She's quickly pregnant with their own child, and all seems to be wonderful...<br /><br />But life is hardly ever all that it seems...<br /><br />Eric gets a client who is having problems with his marriage.  After a couple of sessions, the wife files for divorce and kicks him out.  Eric finds out that the man's wife is represented in the divorce by his own wife, Colleen.  Ethics dictate that they both have to sever their associations, but Colleen is insistent that Eric drop his client but that she keeps hers.  The strain of this issue is the beginning of some eye-opening revelations for Eric.  He finds out that her prior divorce may not be exactly what she told him.  Her best-selling handbook for divorce, ghostwritten with a freelance writer, has a murky past that Colleen won't discuss.  And the divorce aspect of her business is a lot more substantial than she's let on.  When he starts digging in earnest to find answers, life comes crashing down.  The police show up at his door with an arrest warrant, charging him with sexually abusing his own child.  Eric has to clear his name and come to grips with the two different sides of his wife...<br /><br />I found this book to be completely absorbing.  So often the legal arena is littered with \\"he said, she said\\", and the truth is nearly impossible to discern.  I don't think you could pay me enough to be a judge.  There's no doubt that accusations like this happen on a far too frequent basis, and the mere hint of sexual abuse on a minor, regardless of truth, indelibly marks the accused for life.  Benedict's writing is spot on, especially considering she's a woman writing a first-person novel from a guy's perspective.  Hard to pull off, and impressive when you do.

Think your wireless network is secure from unauthorized use or attack?  It's probably not.  I just finished reading Hacking Wireless Network For Dummies by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, and this is one of the most practical books I've ever read for testing a network against attack.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Building the Foundation for Testing Wireless Networks: Introduction to Wireless Hacking; The Wireless Hacking Process; Implementing a Testing Methodology; Amassing Your War Chest<br /><br />Part 2 - Getting Rolling with Common Wi-Fi Hacks: Human (in)Security; Containing the Airwaves; Hacking Wireless Clients; Discovering Default Settings; Wardriving<br /><br />Part 3 - Advanced Wi-Fi Hacks: Still at War; Unauthorized Wireless Devices; Network Attacks; Denial-of-Service Attacks; Cracking Encryption; Authenticating Users<br /><br />Part 4 - The Part of Tens: Ten Essential Tools for Hacking Wireless Networks; Ten Wireless Security-Testing Mistakes; Ten Tips for Following Up after Your Testing<br /><br />Part 5 - Appendixes: Wireless Hacking Resources; Glossary of Acronyms<br /><br />Index<br /><br />The target of this book is the security professional involved in testing networks to make them more secure.  There's a heavy emphasis on \\"ethical hacking\\", or learning how to test a network's security without doing harm or using the information in a destructive fashion.  A security consultant using this book would learn how to pre-plan a test, work with the company to make sure they were properly authorized, and then write up the results in a professional manner.  That aspect of the book is impressive, and it helps to frame the information in the right light (not as a textbook on how to break into networks).<br /><br />From a practical standpoint, this book excels.  Each of the chapters covers the theory behind how or why a certain aspect of a wireless network would be vulnerable to an attack or exploit.  Then the authors cover a number of open source and commercial software packages that are available to focus on that area.  For instance, chapter 14 goes into why WEP encryption is flawed and how it can be broken with relatively little effort.  It's followed by an explanation on how WPA addresses some of those issues.  Finally you get coverage on available tools that are used to crack WEP and how you can use them to test your own network.<br /><br />Highly practical and heavy on application...  If you're a security professional with responsibility for your organization's wireless network, you need to read this book.

Many of them have been more geared towards the consumer application of VoIP with services like Skype and Vonage.  The business titles have been more into technical details of VoIP implementations in an organization.  This book fills a nice niche on the business side.  Kelly effectively takes the reader through phone technology, both past and present.  Building on that information, he then transitions into how VoIP offers alternative solutions that save a lot of money.  The book doesn't go into details on packages like Vonage, but you'll walk away understanding the entire spectrum of phone systems and how to plan for a successful VoIP implementation.<br /><br />I'd see this book being a good read for a networking or communications professional who wants to explore VoIP for their company.  It'd also be a good read for someone who wants to put VoIP to work for them in their house, but also want to know exactly how phone systems work.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone who just saw a Vonage commercial and wants to sign up right now.  There are better titles out there for those types of consumers.<br /><br />Bottom line...  really good read for the right audience.  I don't think I've seen a book this readable that explains telephony in a way that makes it understandable for someone who hasn't worked for Ma Bell for years...e a good read for someone who wants to put VoIP to work for them in their house, but also want to know exactly how phone systems work.

Rather than just read RSS feeds, would you like to *do stuff* with RSS and Atom?  I received a copy of a really good book that goes beyond the nuts and bolts of RSS formatting...  Hacking RSS and Atom by Leslie M. Orchard.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Consuming Feeds: Getting Ready to Hack; Building a Simple Feed Aggregator; Routing Feeds to Your Email Inbox; Adding Feeds to Your Buddy List; Taking Your Feeds with You; Subscribing to Multimedia Content Feeds<br /><br />Part 2 - Producing Feeds: Building a Simple Feed Producer; Taking the Edge Off Hosting Feeds; Scraping Web Sites to Produce Feeds; Monitoring Your Server with Feeds; Tracking Changes in Open Source Projects; Routing Your Email Inbox to Feeds; Web Services and Feeds<br /><br />Part 3 - Remixing Feeds: Normalizing and Converting Feeds; Filtering and Sifting Feeds; Blending Feeds; Republishing Feeds; Extending Feeds<br /><br />Part 4 - Implementing a Shared Feed Cache<br /><br />Index<br /><br />This book starts with the assumption that you either already understand all the details of RSS/Atom formatting, or that you're willing to learn the details on your own as you go.  This is *not* a reference book on RSS standards.  Rather, Orchard answers the question \\"what can you *do* with RSS that's cool and useful?\\".  Using a series of projects, he starts to get you thinking about how you might use RSS technology in ways you haven't considered.  For instance, having your log files report things via RSS feed could give you immediate notice of unusual situations.  Or perhaps having RSS feeds go to your IM client would allow you to react quickly to news and information.  The possibilities are endless, and Orchard does a good job in getting you to think.<br /><br />The caveat here is that he assumes a particular software language and platform for building these hacks.  Python is the language used, so this book would be most helpful if you already knew the language (or were willing to figure it out on the fly).  Likewise, he writes for the Unix platform primarily.  You can use Unix emulators like Cygwin to run Unix-like command in Windows, or you can mentally adapt the concepts to whatever hack you want to build.  At first I was thinking that single focus might be a liability for the book.  But after thinking about it, I don't think it's that bad.  It maintains the focus on the hack instead of on how every different platform needs to be coded, hence the book is more concise.  Also, his goal is to get you to hack and experiment, not to teach you a technology via a tutorial.  Since hacking is experimenting, you may end up hacking these ideas on a couple of different fronts...<br /><br />Excellent idea and application book...  If you're interested in going beyond simple feed readers and building stuff for yourself, this is a definite purchase you want to check out..., he writes for the Unix platform primarily.

I don't think I've ever seen a book as detailed as this on \\"subverting\\" an operating system...  Rootkits - Subverting The Windows Kernel by Greg Hoglund and James Butler.<br /><br />Contents: Leave No Trace; Subverting the Kernel; The Hardware Connection; The Age-Old Art of Hooking; Runtime Patching; Layered Drivers; Hardware Manipulation; Covert Channels; Rootkit Detection; Index<br /><br />Hoglund and Butler have devoted a lot of time to understanding how the Windows kernel works, as well as how rootkits can be utilized to manipulate the kernel.  This knowledge led to the website rootkit.com, and subsequently to this book.  They explore the definition of rootkits, how they work, and how they can remain hidden from detection.  Using the C language, they go into great depth on how rootkit kernel manipulation can be accomplished.  If you have a basic knowledge of C, you'll be able to follow along and learn the intricacies of the kernel.<br /><br />It'd be tempting to wonder why all this dangerous knowledge should be put in book form for junior hackers to use.  For one, this isn't script kiddy material.  If you don't know how to program (and in C), the book is basically far over your head.  I suppose if you were bent towards building your own rootkit for world domination, this material would help.  But in reality, this information is probably already accessible to those who would abuse it in the first place.  Having a compiled volume of the information helps \\"the good guys\\" understand the risks involved as well as how you can protect yourself from rootkit attacks in your own environment.<br /><br />While programming geeks will likely get the most value from this book, all security experts need to understand the concepts covered here.  The worst thing isn't finding out you've been \\"owned\\" with a rootkit on your network.  It's *not* knowing the rootkit is there...	2005-09-24

It used to be that buying a laptop meant you gave up a lot in terms of power and features.  Now you don't give up much (if anything), and gain a lot in the process.  If you're new to the laptop game, getting a copy of Anywhere Computing with Laptops - Making Mobile Easier by Harold Davis might help you exploit your new toy a bit more...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Mobile Computing Quick Start: Understanding Intel Centrino Mobile Technology; Buying a Mobile Computer; Configuring Your Mobile Computer<br /><br />Part 2 - Getting the Most From Your Mobile Computer: Software That Makes the Most of Mobile Computing; Taking Digital Pictures from Your Laptop; Using Your Mobile Computer As a Telephone; Let Your Laptop Entertain You - Streaming Media, Gaming, and More<br /><br />Part 3 - Mobile Computing On The Road: Entering a World Without Wires; Finding Hotspots; Working with National Wi-Fi Networks<br /><br />Part 4 - Your Own Wireless Network: Networking Without Wires; Buying a Wi-Fi Access Point or Router; Setting Up Your Access Point; Configuring Your Wi-Fi Network; Advanced Access Point Configuration; Adding Wi-Fi Antennas to Your Network<br /><br />Part 5 - Securing Your Computer and Network: Protecting Your Mobile Wi-Fi Computer; Securing Your Wi-Fi Network<br /><br />Part 6 - Appendixes: Wireless Standards; Where the Hotspots Are; Intel Centrino Mobile Technology Platform; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Given the right audience, this book is pretty good.  It caters to the person who is a first-time laptop buyer (or owner) and doesn't quite understand the things necessary to start connecting to the internet sans cat-5 cable or modem.  Davis does a good job showing how a laptop with Intel Centrino technology and Windows XP can connect to hotspots and allow you to access the 'net anywhere.  Some of the material (like gaming, streaming media, internet telephony) isn't solely the domain of laptops, but it's worth covering to let the newbie know that everything they do on their desktop machine can also be done on their laptop.<br /><br />The only thing I found a little annoying after awhile was the constant reference to \\"Intel Centrino\\".  He's making the assumption that you have Centrino technology, so information on wireless cards and such is pretty light.  Since wi-fi is built-in with Centrino, there's not much need to cover wi-fi cards.  From the perspective of focus, it's an OK decision to do so.  But Centrino is pushed really hard, and I almost felt like the book should have been sent to me from Intel, not Que.  The newbie might think that if it's not a Centrino processor, it's no good.  In reality, it's all a matter of trade-offs.  I just bought a new laptop, and I don't spend hours on the road or in planes.  Therefore, battery life (a Centrino plus) isn't that important.  CPU processor power is, so I got a Pentium 4 3.33 GHz.  Reading this book, it'd almost appear that I made a mistake, when it's really just a matter of what's important to the user.<br /><br />So... if you're a new laptop user or owner who is using Windows XP and a Centrino processor, this book was written for you.

The last couple of James Patterson novels have given me hope that titles like London Bridges were an aberration...  that he hasn't lost his touch.  At least in my mind, Lifeguard is my proof that he's back to running on all eight cylinders (with the help of Andrew Gross).  This was a great recreational read...<br /><br />Ned Kelly is enjoying life as a lifeguard and go-pher for a rich Florida resident.  He meets a rich socialite woman on the beach one day and falls hard for her.  But before he can get beyond the first afternoon fling, she's found dead in the hotel room where they romped.  What's worse, he left her to try and pull off a one-time art heist with some long-time friends that would net him a cool million.  The planned burglary goes sour when they are double-crossed and all of his partners are murdered.  Panicking, he goes on the run, knowing that the killings and art deal all make him look utterly guilty.  He compounds the issue when Ellie Shurtleff, an FBI special agent shows up at a place he's at, and he ends up taking her hostage to get out.  He tells his story, and she actually believes him.  The art theft was most likely an inside job, and the \\"victim\\" is looking like he could be both the mastermind of the theft and the architect of all the killings.  She needs to prove who did the killings in order to clear Ned and save her job.  Other than falling in love with Ned, the complicating factor is that she can't trust her boss at the Bureau as there's someone on the inside...<br /><br />Written in typical Patterson fashion (short three and four page chapters), the story speeds along at a rapid pace.  While the story of \\"FBI agent falls for honest crook who's not guilty\\" might be somewhat implausible, the characters are likeable and it's easy to find yourself empathizing with and rooting for them to win.  It's obvious early on that all the players probably aren't who they appear to be, but you're kept guessing until pretty much the end.<br /><br />If you have a day or two where you don't want to accomplish anything important and just want to get lost in a book, this works just fine.  I'm glad to see that Patterson is back...f you have a day or two where you don't want to accomplish anything important and just want to get lost in a book, this works just fine.

If you already have a Java background and are looking to learn how to use Struts for web apps, a good concise tutorial title would be Learning Jakarta Struts 1.2 by Stephan Wiesner.<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction to Struts; Hello Struts; The Struts Shop; Internationalization and Taglibs; Logging and Configuration; Forms; Logic; Exceptions; Controller and Templates; Putting It All Together; Struts Validator and Plug-In Classes; JSTL; Tools and Tricks; Solutions; Glossary; Literature; Index<br /><br />This is a 200 page tutorial that assumes a basic background in your IDE of choice and Java in general.  It's written well, but there's not a lot of hand-holding going on.  The author dives right in and brings you up to speed on the concepts you need to know to work with Struts.  The associated platform choices are all open source (like Tomcat and MySQL), so it won't cost you anything to get started.  Conversely, the coverage of these other software packages aren't covered in great detail.  You're told where you can download the software, and quickly how to install it.  If you have problems, you'll probably need to check out other sources to fix them.  The book follows a common development project throughout (a book store application), so it does a nice job of building on itself as it goes along.  Couple that with the exercises sprinkled throughout the book, and you should be able to learn enough to become competent on the basics.  For long-term Struts work, you'll probably want to get a Struts reference book or check out the project website.  Still, as a first book to learn by doing, Learning Jakarta Struts fairs well...	2005-09-24

It's *amazing* what you can find in the \\"For Dummies\\" series...  :)<br /><br />I've always enjoyed the Dummies series, especially when it comes to a complex subject where \\"I don't know what I don't know\\".  A book that can explain the subject in simple terms gives me the mental framework on which to build my learning.  This book is a perfect example...  Nanotechnology For Dummies by Richard Booker and Earl Boysen.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting Small with Nanotechnology:  The Hitchhiker's Guide to Nanotechnology; Nano in Your Life; Gathering the Tools of the Trade<br /><br />Part 2 - Building a Better World with Nanomaterials: Nanomaterials Galore; Adding Strength with Composites<br /><br />Part 3 - \\"Smarter\\" Computers!

But if asked how it all works, I'd be at a complete loss.  In this Dummies title, Booker and Boysen do an excellent job in making the very, very tiny...  very understandable.  You won't be ready to launch your own nanotech firm or get a degree in nano-medicine, but you'll at least walk away with a better understanding of the subject.  While the authors do tend to be wonderfully enthusiastic about the nanotech future, I think that their optimism is somewhat warranted.  They show you the edge of the future that we are about to enter, and even after dismissing the hype, there's some intriguing stuff out there.<br /><br />I think I was most fascinated about where the medical field is going with nanotech.  Customized delivery systems for medicines that can put the dosage right where it's needed.  Nanocells that can attach themselves to cancer cells and then respond to laser stimulation and fry away the cancer.  Obviously not next week's cure, but the authors show you it's closer than you might think.<br /><br />If this subject is something you've thought interesting but still don't understand very well, it's well worth getting a copy of Nanotechnology For Dummies.

Obviously I'm familiar with blogging, as I've been doing it for the last 2+ years.  And I'm aware of the quick rise of \\"podcasting\\" but I have to admit I've remained willfully ignorant of the details.  A copy of Podcast Solutions - The Complete Guide to Podcasting by Michael W. Geoghegan and Dan Klass arrived in the mail the other day, and I'm ignorant no longer...  at least about podcasting...<br /><br />Contents:  Podcasting 101; Listening to Podcasts; Podcasting How-To; Planning Your Podcast; Podcasting Tools; Recording Your Podcast; Putting It All Together; Preparing Your File; Serving It Up; Getting Heard; Making Money with Podcasting; Conclusion; Glossary; Podcasting Resources at a Glance; Index<br /><br />Geoghegan and Klass have taken a subject that can be a bit intimidating and made it extremely approachable.  They don't target the techno-geek who understands all the technology.  Instead, they assume that the reader is someone who is reasonably intelligent, just getting started in (or interested in) podcasting, and needs assistance to get up and running.  They cover some of the more popular tools and techniques currently on the market without trying to cover every last option.  Because of that, you get the benefit of their experience and can avoid the dead-ends that are so common when you get started with a new toy.<br /><br />I was impressed with the span of coverage they gave the subject.  Everything from \\"what is a podcast\\" to \\"how to do preproduction\\" to \\"how to do postproduction\\".  While you may not end up being an A-List podcaster, everything you absolutely need to know to start down that path is in here.  I don't know that I'm personally ever going to produce a podcast, but after reading the book, I'm much more likely to check into listening and subscribing to a few.  And who knows what will happen from there...<br /><br />Very good book, clear information, and great writing...  Highly recommended if podcasting in on your radar screen...	2005-09-22

If you're a techno-geek, it's easy to find material on how to secure your computing environment.  It's considerably more difficult to find readable and understandable material that you can give to Uncle Joe to prevent him from becoming the latest spam zombie.  A good entry into this niche is the book The Symantec Guide to Home Internet Security by Andrew Conry-Murray and Vincent Weafer.<br /><br />Content:  Understanding Internet Risk; Preventing Identity Theft; Firewalls; Getting Rid of Unwanted Guests, Part 1 - Viruses and Worms; Getting Rid of Unwanted Guests, Part 2 - Spyware, Adware, and Trojan Horses; Just Say No To Spam; Securing Windows; Keeping Your Family Safe Online; Wireless and VoIP Security; Privacy and the Internet; Conclusion; Index<br /><br />This book doesn't attempt to \\"entertain\\" the reader or dazzle them with funny graphics or drawings.  It's just solid material on internet security presented in a clear and concise manner.  The target is for nontechnical Windows users, and in my opinion the authors pretty much nail it.  The heavy duty jargon is either avoided or explained clearly, and nearly any internet user with a small amount of interest should be able to use this book.  Each chapter ends with a Checklist that covers the things you need to do (or things you shouldn't do) in order to enhance your security.  Even if you can't get Uncle Joe to read the entire chapter, he can get the gist of the useful info in a short page or two.  I'd prefer they understand *why* they are doing something, but I'll take whatever I can get with some people...<br /><br />If you're the target audience for this book, it's a definite recommended purchase and read.  And if you're a techno-geek who's tired of incessantly cleaning spyware and viruses off the neighbor's computer, buy them a copy of this book.  It's a relatively cheap way to get your life back...	2005-09-19

Next up in my catch-up reading of Lee Child is Die Trying, the second book in the Jack Reacher series.  As with the first one I read, it's a good \\"mind-candy\\" read...<br /><br />Reacher happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in Chicago.  He attempts to help a woman coming out of a dry cleaners shop with an armful of clothes and a pair of crutches.  At the same time, two other people show up with plans on abducting the woman.  Since Jack just happens to be there and appears to be paired with her, he ends up going along for the ride.  He eventually figures out she's an FBI agent, recovering from a knee injury, and is also the daughter of a very well-known general in the US military.  The kidnappers belong to a militia group who want to use her to extract concessions from the government, chief of which is the formation of their own country within the borders of Montana.  Regardless of how much of a pain she is, they can't afford to kill her.  Reacher's another story, however...<br /><br />This is one of those books where everything works out right for the good guys and not so good for the bad guys.  I'm enjoying the character of Reacher, as well as Child's writing style...  rapid fire action and lines.  If you're looking for deep significance or intricate plotlines, you may be disappointed.  But if you just want to kick back and take an action ride, this book will get you there...	2005-09-18

The latest installment in Syngress' Stealing series is Stealing The Network - How to Own an Identity by Timothy Mullen, Johnny Long, Raven Alder, Jay Beale, Riley Eller, Brian Hatch, Chris Hurley, Jeff Moss, Tom Parker, and Ryan Russell.  The reason there are so many authors is that each chapter is written by a different person with an emphasis on the type of security issues they know best.  The net effect ends up being an informative novel with hacking details woven in.<br /><br />Since this is written in novel form, listing the table of contents wouldn't shed much light on what you're getting in the book.  Suffice it to say that there is a lot of technical detail about particular hacks and social engineering attacks.  The different writers cover various areas such as encryption and ciphers, hacking personal wi-fi networks to gain identity info, using credit card offers to help build alternate identities, and forensic examination of devices like fax machines and printers to gain knowledge of prior activity.<br /><br />From a review perspective, I wasn't quite as engrossed in this book as I was with the prior installments.  For one, this tries to pick up where Own a Continent leaves off.  Many of the characters and incidents in this book got their beginning there.  If you could read the two back-to-back, you might find better continuity.  As it's been awhile since I read Continent, the story line wasn't as fresh to me as it could have been.  Also, the basic storyline is rather vague and hard to follow.  I kept thinking that the book was like a \\"certain type\\" of movie where the story line is only there to transition between the \\"action\\" scenes.  While I'm not expecting NYT Top 10 Fiction material, I was hoping for something a little more cohesive.  If the material contained in the book wasn't so important, I probably wouldn't rate this book as highly as I am.<br /><br />Even with having said that, it's still a book worth reading for those who are not up-to-speed on identity theft.

Car PC Hacks - Tips & Tools for Geeking Your Ride by Damien Stolarz.<br /><br />Contents:  Car Power Basics; Automotive Audio Entertainment; Automotive Video Entertainment; In-Car Computers; Car PC Interface Options; Wireless Connectivity and in-Car Internet; In-Car Applications; Index<br /><br />In this Hacks book, you get 75 different ways to \\"geek your ride\\".  This can range from simple modifications to the stereo system (#13 - Installing a New Head Unit) to installing a full-fledged PC in your car (#41 - Choose an in-Car PC Hardware Platform).  While many of the hacks don't have step by step instructions on how to make it all come together, there's enough information to point you in the right direction.  In reality, it'd be almost impossible to do detailed instructions, as each car will be different, and your options for mounting and installing hardware can often be limited only by your imagination.  Even if you're not all that handy with tools and such, this book will give you a really good idea of what can be done.  From there, you can figure out who to befriend in order to get the installation taken care of.<br /><br />I also appreciated the in-depth coverage of how a car's electrical system works.  I'm the type who just turns the key and figures everything starts up.  When you start adding in all sorts of new equipment, the demands on the battery change dramatically.  In addition, PC equipment doesn't view momentary power drops during start-up very kindly.  After reading this material, you'll understand the issues involved as well as how they can all be overcome.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a very good book if you're interested in tricking out your car with the latest in custom electronics.  The first time you sit in the back seat and start playing the latest XBox game mounted in the headrest, you'll be hooked...	2005-09-18

The plotline looked interesting and I had never read anything by Dun.  So of course, I accepted the offer.  And I'm glad I did, as this is another author who goes on my \\"must catch up\\" list...<br /><br />In The Black Silent, the main character Sam Wintripp is recuperating from a near-death torture experience incurred during some prior covert operation (I guess...  I'm assuming that's all covered in a prior novel).  While trying to take it easy in the San Juan Islands, he becomes involved in a search for a scientist (Ben Anderson) who goes missing.  Anderson is the mentor for a former love interest of Wintripp, and Sam doesn't take it very well when the local \\"cop\\" running the investigation starts threatening her.  In fact, the \\"cop\\" is behind the disappearance, and he's willing to kill whoever gets in his way.  And what's the goal?  The scientist's work on youth retention and methane extraction that will eliminate the world's energy crisis.  The island is pretty small, the cop has a number of resources at his disposal, and Sam isn't physically hitting on all eight cylinders.  What transpires is an interesting chase involving high stakes and life-or-death decisions...<br /><br />As I mentioned above, this is the first novel of Dun's that I've read.  I think I will end up really liking the Wintripp character once I catch up on his past.  He's one of those mysterious characters with a shady past but not without human flaws.  I probably would have liked the book a bit more if I had read this in sequence.  I also would have liked to see a little more about Anderson during the story.  He's central to the story, as everyone is fighting to find his research.  But he disappears for a large chunk of the book, and I kept wondering whether he was still alive or not...<br /><br />On the other hand, there's some interesting thoughts about how a longevity \\"drug\\" would affect the world.  How would recipients be determined?  How would the world's resources react to a growing population not controlled by death?  And what would people do to make sure they were getting the drug (or would keep getting it)?<br /><br />A good read that kept me turning the pages...ongevity \\"drug\\" would affect the world.

Robb) latest Eve Dallas sci-fi crime novel, Origin In Death.  I keep expecting that I'll see some downward turn in the quality of this series due to the longevity and rate in which they are published.  And with each new installment, I keep being happily disappointed.  Again, Nora writes an excellent story...<br /><br />Dallas is called into a murder case when she happens to be on site when a prominent plastic surgeon is murdered...  scalpel through the heart, and no solid leads or clues.  The surgeon appears to be a true selfless saint, but Dallas thinks the background is *too* clean to be real.  When the man's son (also a surgeon) is murdered in the same fashion, it becomes obvious that a person with an agenda is at work, and it might be related to some \\"less than legal\\" work that both were engaged in.  The wife of the son is looking like a potential suspect, but she's got an airtight alibi.  How can a person be in two places at one time?  With what the doctors were up to, it's possible...<br /><br />There have been some novels in the In Death series that have served to advance the characters and/or relationships between them.  This one really doesn't do anything along that line.  It's just a solid murder crime mystery, set in 2050, and delivered up with the normal hard-edged dialogue you come to expect from Robb/Roberts.  It amazes me that after 24 novels in this series, I'm still as excited for a new one as much as I was when I first discovered Eve Dallas.  I certainly hope that Nora Roberts continues to crank these out at the same high quality we've come to expect, as this is one of those \\"gotta read\\" series whenever a new one hits the stands...	2005-09-08

Home Networking - The Missing Manual by Scott Lowe...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Setting Up Your Network: Planning Your Home Network; Creating a Wired Network the Ethernet Way; Setting Up a Wireless Network; Setting Up a Powerline Network<br /><br />Part 2 - Using Your Network: Using the Network with Windows Computers; Using the Network with Macintosh Computers; Mixing Macintosh and Windows Computers; Fun and Games with Your Network; Using Your Network on the Road<br /><br />Appendix: The Macintosh Keychain; Multiple User Accounts in Mac OS 9<br /><br />Index<br /><br />My lack and fear of networking is well-known amongst my geek friends.  It's one of those things I don't get and pretty much don't dabble in, either.  I won't tell you how long I had a cat-5 cable snaking up my basement stairs and across the kitchen floor in order to do Internet Connection Sharing with the computer that had the internal DSL modem.  And I was *proud* to have figured that much out!  With this book, I would have purchased the wireless router *much* sooner, and I wouldn't have paid the cable guy $50 for screwing in the cable modem as the \\"install\\".  Lowe takes what can be a daunting subject and simplifies it enough that even non-geeks can follow along.  There are plenty of pictures, and the instructions are clear and concise.  And by including both PC and Mac networking, you should be able to use the information in this book regardless of your operating system preference...<br /><br />As a computer geek (just not one that does networking), I was highly impressed that he included electrical system networking.  This seems to be one of those technologies that's on the cusp of becoming mainstream, but just hasn't bridged that chasm yet.  While I don't think that'd be my first recommendation to someone unless absolutely necessary, it's nice to see it included as a viable option for the adventurous.  Well done...<br /><br />If you have more than one computer at home and you've been putting off networking them together due to lack of knowledge, delay no longer.

Trying to cover the full gamut of object-oriented design, analysis, UML, etc. in a single book anymore is a daunting task.  There's just so much out there now.  Trying to make it readable is even more difficult.  Go ahead and add in a textbook style format on top of that, and it's enough to normally scare me away.  Surprisingly, Mike O'Docherty overcomes all these obstacles and does a good job with Object-Oriented Analysis And Design - Understanding System Development with UML 2.0.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Setting the Scene: Object Concepts; Inheritance; Type Systems; Software Development Methodologies<br /><br />Part 2 - Understanding the Problem: Gathering Requirements; Analyzing the Problem<br /><br />Part 3 - Designing the Solution: Designing the System Architecture; Choosing Technologies; Designing the Subsystems; Reusable Design Patterns; Specifying the Interfaces of Classes; Continuous Testing<br /><br />Appendix: Ripple Summary; iCoot Case Study; Summary of UML Notation Used<br /><br />Bibliography; Index<br /><br />Any one of these particular areas could be expanded out into a full volume (and I have a few of them on my shelf).  I was a little surprised that O'Docherty was able to squeeze them all into a book that doesn't cause adverse back strain to carry around.  Even better, the coverage of the subjects is adequate to get the first time student, either in school or in an organization, up to speed on the subject matter.  By using a single case study throughout the entire book, he maintains a continuity in which skills and terminology learned in one chapter easily glide into the next one.  I didn't feel like I was getting whiplash trying to follow a large number of unrelated examples that didn't pull together anything I had learned in previous pages.  He also gives you enough knowledge on UML to be able to effectively use it on your job without becoming bogged down in the minute details that UML gurus argue over for years.  Practicality seems to be the keyword here.  While he does use Java to illustrate the few code examples that exist, the book largely steers clear of code and focuses on design that is language-independent.  What code *does* exist can easily be followed regardless of your knowledge of Java.<br /><br />Basically, this is a book I wouldn't have a hard time recommending to someone who didn't know object-oriented design and wanted to move into that area.  There's not much wasted effort, and the payback for the time and effort expended should be pretty high...d here.

All too often, the discussion about using open source software in an organization takes on an emotional or political tone.  And since most information about open source decisions tends to feed that emotion, it's nice to find a book that tries to look at the subject from a rational perspective.  This book does a very good job of that...  Open Source For The Enterprise by Dan Woods and Gautam Guliani.<br /><br />Contents:  The Nature of Open Source; Measuring the Maturity of Open Source; The Open Source Skill Set; Making the ROI Case; Designing an Open Source Strategy; Support Models for Open Source; Making Open Source Projects Easy to Adopt; A Comparison of Open Source Licenses; Open Source Under Attack; Open Source Empowerment; The Open Source Platform; End-User Computing and the Desktop; Open Source and Email; Groupware, Portals, and Collaboration; Web Publishing and Content Management; Application Development; Index<br /><br />As I stated above, open source technology books (covering the topic as a whole, not individual projects) tend to be \\"rah-rah\\" in nature, pitting the plucky open source alternatives against the big evil proprietary software companies.  While I may just happen to lean in that direction, it's not very helpful if you're trying to make a solid business case for adopting a corporate open source strategy.  You need to concentrate on risks, financial return on investment, support issues, and all the other things that apply to *any* software used in your organization.  Woods and Guliani do a very good job in aiming for, and hitting, that target.  While they believe in the promise of open source, they give the reader some solid tools to judge whether a particular open source alternative is worthy to explore.  For instance, some open source projects take off and soar, while others languish with no activity after a few months.  By checking release levels, discussion boards, documentation quality, etc., you can mitigate the risk of committing to a project that doesn't continue to grow.  Conversely, if you find a project that addresses a need but may not be overly active, they provide guidance on what type of skill base you'll need to have or acquire to take the development in house.<br /><br />Open Source For The Enterprise is one of those books that you should see in a number of organizations, helping management and techies come together to make rational business decisions that benefit the company and not someone's resume.

Even the slightest misstep on line (or anywhere else, for that matter) can open you up to privacy intrusions that you may not know about.  Dan Tynan does a really good job in outlining these areas in Computer Privacy Annoyances.  This is pretty much required reading for living in our heavily computerized society.<br /><br />Contents:  Privacy At Risk; Privacy At Home; Privacy On The Net; Privacy At Work; Privacy In Public; Privacy And Uncle Sam; Privacy In The Future; Index<br /><br />In this Annoyances title, Tynan looks at a wide range of activities and situations that involve a potential unwanted loss of privacy.  Using a question and answer format, he effectively shows how seemingly innocent activities (like booking a hotel room or ordering a kosher meal on a flight) can be logged and combined to build a profile of your activities that may not present a very flattering picture of who you are and what you do (and with whom).  While there's the obligatory chapters on spam, online registration sites, and the like, there are also excellent chapters that cover privacy at work (what your employers can and can not do) as well as health record concerns.  Things may not be as secure and private as you think they are...<br /><br />Realistically, there's already more information out there to be gleaned than you'd probably expect and be comfortable with.  But by reading and digesting the contents of this book, you can start to reduce your exposure going forward.  Even just the awareness of privacy concerns will start to cause you to question *why* a merchant might want certain information.  They may *want* your zip code or phone number, but that doesn't mean you *have* to give it to them.  Even if this book keeps you from making just one mistake that would lead to identity theft, then it's more than paid for itself.  A recommended read...	2005-09-05

Short, sweet, and to the point...  Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide by Ed Burnette.<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction; Workbench 101; Java Done Quick; Debugging; Unit Testing with JUnit; Tips and Tricks; Views; Short Takes; Help and Community; Commands; Index<br /><br />Given that this book is only 117 pages, I really wondered how useful it might be.  Maybe a list of things for Eclipse veterans that they could find quickly.  Since most O'Reilly pocket guides seem to assume some level of knowledge to begin with, I thought that the target audience for this might be somewhat limited.<br /><br />Wrong...<br /><br />I'm actually surprised that this book could be used by someone who has never seen Eclipse, and there's a pretty good chance that they could get up and running with it in short order.  That's not to say that a larger, more tutorial-style book wouldn't also be helpful, or that they will get everything they need in this pocket guide.  But there are plenty of techno-geeks out there who just want the basic facts presented in quick fashion to get them started, and then they'll take it from there.  And this book definitely delivers on that.  Granted, I use Eclipse and have read a number of other books on the topic, but I could have used this one my first time out.  You could almost think of it as 117 pages of bound documentation for Eclipse that prevents you from having to print out something you downloaded from the Eclipse website.  Better yet, it's *readable*!<br /><br />If you're going to be using Eclipse on a full-time basis in your job or for software development, definitely check into one of the larger books out there to get all the gritty details and minutiae about the software.  But if you've just skimmed the surface in the past or you need to get a quick intro to get up to speed, this is definitely a book that will be worth your while...	2005-09-04

A regular reader of my blog emailed me and recommended that I check out an author named Lee Child.  Since there are a number of books he's written with the main character Jack Reacher, I decided to start at the beginning...  Killing Floor.  I now officially hooked and will be working through *that* entire series...<br /><br />Reacher is an ex-military cop who has gotten his discharge from the military and is now simply drifting from place to place with no commitments for nearly the first time in his entire life.  He decides to hop off the Greyhound bus outside of Margrave, Georgia, nothing more than a dot on the map.  He's into music, and there's a singer from way back, Blind Blake, who hailed from Margrave.  But before he gets very far, he's arrested at gunpoint for the murder of someone at a factory owned by a major citizen of the town.  Although he is able to convince the local detective that he's not the person, the detective has to put him in holding in the local prison over the weekend until they can get it all sorted out.  While there with another person who just *might* have committed the crime, they are both targeted to die in a prison fight that increasingly looks like a setup.  Once out, Reacher starts working with the detective and a local female cop, Roscoe, to solve the crime and figure out why everything seems a little \\"off\\" in this small town.  It becomes personal when he finds out that the murdered person was his brother who he hasn't seen in a couple of years.  The deeper they get, the more people surrounding the case start to get offed.  Worse, there's an obvious conspiracy involving the major and nine other townspeople, and the trio investigating the crime can't trust that anyone is clean or dirty...<br /><br />The whole plot and style of writing pretty much hooked me from the start.  Reacher, although a loner, is very human and works well as a main character.  His love interest, Roscoe, adds a certain tension to the book as you're not sure whether things will work out or if some twist is going to take you off in a direction you don't expect.  Once they figure out what's really going on, the story becomes even more interesting as you see how it could all fit together...<br /><br />Very, *very* good first novel from Child, and I can't wait to work through the other Reacher novels.  Good thing I have a vacation coming up soon.  :)Roscoe, adds a certain tension to the book as you're not sure whether things will work out or if some twist is going to take you off in a direction you don't expect.

With the ever-increasing attention paid to the search engine space, it pays to know how best to design your web site and plan your marketing campaigns to optimize this resource.  A recent book I received fills that space nicely...  Search Engine Marking, Inc. - Driving Search Traffic to Your Company's Web Site by Mike Moran and Bill Hunt.<br /><br />Content:<br /><br />Part 1 - The Basics of Search Marketing: Why Search Marketing Is Important...  And Difficult; How Search Engines Work; How Search Marketing Works; How Searchers Work<br /><br />Part 2 - Develop Your Search Marketing Program: Identify Your Web Site's Goals; Measure Your Web Site's Success; Measure Your Search Marketing Success; Define Your Search Marketing Strategy; Sell Your Search Marketing Proposal<br /><br />Part 3 - Execute Your Search Marketing Program: Get Your Site Indexed; Choose Your Target Keywords; Optimize Your Content; Attract Links To Your Site; Optimize Your Paid Search Program; Make Search Marketing Operational; What's Next?<br /><br />Glossary; Index<br /><br />First off, this book is really well done.  Using a writing style that's more conversational and readable than I expected from the cover, they go into solid detail about everything related to search engines.  This includes how they work, what people are looking for when they search, and how best to understand the types of visitors you'll get in order to turn them into potential customers.  They also spend plenty of time telling you what to avoid in the way of spammy and sleazy tricks to get better rankings (which will probably also get you banned from the engines).  As a result, you can read the information with confidence that you're being useful and ethical information related to improving your visibility on the web.<br /><br />While most any size business could benefit from this information, I kept thinking of larger organizations during my reading.  Marketing Communication (MarCom) departments, at least those who understand the web, absolutely need to know this information and formalize their organizational approach to search engine optimization.  A single person business looking to advertise on the web, especially if this is their first foray into the cyberworld, might find themselves a bit overwhelmed by over 500 pages of information.  Conversely, a MarCom department would have the time and resources to commit to a focused and planned approach to their search engine results.  Both businesses would benefit, but I think the larger companies would benefit more...<br /><br />Regardless of your organizational size and structure, it's worth the read.  You'll come away with a much more complete understanding of how you need to position yourself to get noticed in the increasingly crowded world of search...olutely need to know this information and formalize their organizational approach to search engine optimization.

While that may still be the case, I now have a way to make my Word time more productive and less annoying...  Word Annoyances by Guy Hart-Davis.  This is a *really* good book for anyone who uses Word (although Microsoft may tend to disagree)...<br /><br />Contents:  Installation, Repair, and Configuration; Creating and Saving Documents; Text Entry and Editing; Formatting and Layout; Forms, Revising, Proofing, and Finalizing; Printing, Faxing, and Scanning; Tables, Columns, and Text Boxes; Automate Annoyances Away with Macros; OLE, Mail Merge, and Office Applications; Mac Word Annoyances; Index<br /><br />If you've never had the pleasure of reading an Annoyances book before, here's how it works.  The author gathers up a large number of questions and \\"annoyances\\" from regular users of the product.  Then in an irreverent question and answer format, he (or she) proceeds to show solutions and workarounds to allow the reader to bypass those irritations.  Since this book deals with Word, you'll learn all sorts of interesting stuff on how to \\"fix\\" auto-formatting, how to change your default template, and dozens of other gems that will quickly make this one of your favorite Office books (much to Microsoft's chagrin).  I'm sure they'd like you to believe that their software doesn't have any annoying features, and that everything is very helpful and well-implemented.  Not!  Even things that I didn't give a second thought to before now stand out as things I don't have to live with.<br /><br />Obviously, not every tip in this book will apply to your needs or situations.  You'll either never use a particular feature, or you've already figured out how to fix the behavior.  But there are far more instances where you'll say \\"so *that's* how you get rid of that!\\".

The other review book I received yesterday was XML Pocket Reference (3rd Edition) by Simon St. Laurent and Michael Fitzgerald.  Depending on what you're looking for, this may or may not the book for you...<br /><br />Contents: Introduction; XML Structures; Document Type Definitions; W3C XML Schema; RELAX NG; Schematron; XML Specifications; Index<br /><br />Admittedly, trying to cover \\"XML\\" in a single book is a daunting task.  XML is made up of so many standards and technologies (XPath, XForms, XML Schema, etc.) that you either have to specialize your coverage area or be ready to publish a *really* heavy book.  To their credit, the authors stripped out XSLT into it's own pocket guide.  That act keeps this particular book small enough to fit in your pocket and that's good.  But if you're wanting information on XSLT and think this might be your book, forget it.<br /><br />Next, the XML Structures and Document Type Definition chapters seemed to be a little confusing.  There was something introduced that I had never heard of before...  something called \\"Productions\\" followed by syntax that looked like regular expression language.  Never having seen that term before in my XML reading, I went back to the introduction to see what the authors wanted to convey there.  The only explanation was \\"As each structure is discussed, applicable productions from the XML 1.0 and 1.1 specs will be listed in the order in which they appear in the specs.\\"  So, I still really don't know what productions are, and I probably have to go to the specs to find that out.  The description of each section in an XML document, like CDATA or declarations, was nice though.<br /><br />The book starts to become really useful when you get into the XML Schema section.  There they go into each of the elements along with each attribute that can be used with the element.  This is the type of reference information I'd expect to see in a pocket guide.  Something I can turn to quickly as a refresher for what parameters or attributes I can use with an element, or to gain a quick understanding of an element I haven't seen before.  This same structure is followed for the RELAX NG and Schematron schema languages, so the book will be helpful if you live in those worlds also.<br /><br />Basically, I found the XML Pocket Guide to be a little \\"hit and miss\\".  If the title had been \\"XML Schema Pocket Guide\\", I'd have felt like the book was pretty on target.  Trying to call it the XML Pocket Guide seems to infer there's a lot more in here than there actually is, and a buyer might get a copy and be highly disappointed in what it doesn't cover.  If you're looking for schema info, you'll love the book.  If that's a secondary reason for you to get the book, you might be disappointed.hat parameters or attributes I can use with an element, or to gain a quick understanding of an element I haven't seen before.

This is the type of information you'll need as a professional who needs to get a job done without wasting time on fluff and verbose writing.  Each chapter covers one of the sins, and follows a standard format for the information.  The subsections in each chapter are: Overview of the Sin; Affected Languages; The Sin Explained; Related Sins; Spotting the Sin Pattern; Spotting the Sin During Code Review; Testing Techniques to Find the Sin; Example Sins; Redemption Steps; Extra Defensive Measures; Other Resources; Summary.  Since each chapter stands on its own, you can use this as a reference tool if you're having a particular issue to resolve, or you can read it cover to cover to get a good understanding of the security concerns you need to face when programming.<br /><br />Just about every significant programming platform and language is covered somewhere in here (Windows, Unix, Linux, C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Perl, etc.), so there's no real reason why nearly every developer won't take *something* away from their reading.  And if you're writing software that will be exposed to usage outside your company, there is *no* reason to not have this book on your shelf.  You'll get the core of what you should do very quickly, and you'll end up writing more secure software up front instead of issuing patch after patch after patch...f you're having a particular issue to resolve, or you can read it cover to cover to get a good understanding of the security concerns you need to face when programming. <br /> <br />Just about every significant programming platform and language is covered somewhere in here (Windows, Unix, Linux, C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Perl, etc.), so there's no real reason why nearly every developer won't take *something* away from their reading.

I was recently sent a review copy of the book Spam Wars by Danny Goodman.  This is an excellent read for anyone wanting to understand where spam comes from and how the whole \\"spamonomy\\" operates...<br /><br />Contents: Introduction; Email Predators, Guardians, and Victims; Grasping Spam (not SPAM); How We Got into This Mess; Behind the Curtain: How Email Works; It's the Spamonomy, Stupid!; How Spammers Get Your Email Address; Meet the Spammers and Scammers; The Spammer's View of the World; How Spam Differs from Junk Mail; The Antispammer's View of the World; Spammer Tricks Part 1: Headers; Spammer Tricks Part 2: Messages; Beware Geeks Bearing Gifts; Rule #3: Spammers Are Stupid; Technology as a Partial Solution; The Law as a Partial Solution; An Email Manifesto and To-do List; All about Email Message Headers; An Introduction to Span Sleuthing; Online Resources; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Unlike books that offer purely technical solutions to reduce the amount of spam you receive, Goodman takes a step back and lays the groundwork for how we found ourselves in the current environment.  Any reasonably intelligent person will be able to take this book and begin to understand just how much of a problem this is.  It's not just the 50 (or 500) emails you have to delete every day.  It's the billions that get sent out continuously by spammers and scammers who don't deliver on their offers.  And because there are people dumb enough to respond, it's a very lucrative business that has no regard for the victims...  those of us who don't want to increase certain body parts or meet girls who are hot for us.  Please!<br /><br />Goodman has a very irreverent style of writing in this particular work, and it's fun to read.  He has no qualms to call spammers \\"stupid\\" and then back it up with examples that are far too numerous.  I also appreciate that he doesn't attempt to offer some \\"silver bullet\\" that will magically take care of all your issues.  There isn't one, and he openly acknowledges that.  Technology can fix part of the problem, and laws can somewhat address another small segment.  But in his final chapter, the \\"manifesto\\", he offers a series of steps and actions that each of us can take to start reclaiming our rightful possession that the spammer has stolen from us...  our email address.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't understand what the fuss is, or to those who have reached the end of their rope with spam.

One of the recent IBM acquisitions leads me to believe that the XForms standard will begin to play a larger part in my area of software expertise.  To that end, I got a review copy of XForms Essentials by Micah Dubinko in order to try and get a basic understanding of the standard and technology.  The book does a pretty good job of that, but is probably more useful for someone who is all ready to dig in and use it.<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction to Web Forms; XForms Building Blocks; XPath in XForms; XML Schema in XForms; The XForms Model; The XForms User Interface; Actions and Events; Submit; Styling XForms; Form Accessibility, Design, and Troubleshooting; Extending XForms; Examining Microsoft InfoPath; The GNU Free Documentation License; Index<br /><br />Dubinko starts off by examining how HTML forms work, and then transitions into how XForms addresses some of the problems (heavy reliance on scripting, restriction to flat key/value data pairing, etc.).  Chapter 2 does a pretty high-level overview of an XForms document and what components do what in the layout.  From there, you start to get pretty deep into the different areas that make up the entire XForms family, like XPath and XML Schema.  At this point, having a solid footing in XML technology is probably required (or highly suggested), because the terminology gets technical and a fair amount of reference material starts to creep in.  If you're actually using XForms in your application development, then you'll be able to use those reference sections to understand and use things like datatypes and computed expressions.  I also really liked the appendix section on the comparison between XForms and Microsoft's competing InfoPath implementation.  It does a nice job highlighting the major differences in a really short number of pages.<br /><br />While this might not have been the best \\"first\\" XForms book for me to read, it definitely does a good job in covering the information for the right audience.  If someone were faced with a software application that used XForms and they needed to support it, I'd definitely suggest getting a copy of this book.  The technical nature will help as you get your hands dirty on a daily basis.  If you're simply looking for a high-level understanding of XForms, there's a fair amount here that will cause your eyes to glaze over...omeone were faced with a software application that used XForms and they needed to support it, I'd definitely suggest getting a copy of this book.

In most tech language tutorials and how-to articles, you end up getting sample programs and projects that are \\"formal\\" or work-related.  But sometimes you learn more about a language if you can work on fun stuff.  Steven Holzner moves into that territory in the book Java After Hours.  There's some stuff in here I'm going to mess around with...<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction; Making Fish Swim in the Multithreaded Aquarium; Slapshot! The Interactive Hockey Game; The Graphicizer Image-Editing and Conversion Tool; Creating Stunning Graphics with Painter; Chatting on the Internet with the Chat Room; Who's There? Logging Access to your Website with WebLogger; Running Any Program via Remote Control with the Robot; Creating a Custom Web Browser in Java: The Browser Project; Typing Across the Internet: The Intercom Project; Getting a Graphical Weather Forecast: The Forecaster Project; Index<br /><br />I'll admit that I have to give high marks to any book that mixes Java and my favorite sport...  hockey!  :)<br /><br />Seriously, Holzner does some interesting things that make this book stand out.  By using projects and examples that are more personal and \\"fun\\" in nature, it's much more likely that the reader will become absorbed in the material and pick up the particular concepts almost without trying.  He also uses projects that are graphical in nature instead of relying on cold, dry server-based routines that just print some words on the screen.  It's one thing to learn about multithreading by trying to create \\"processes\\" that can run concurrently.  It's a whole different learning experience when the threads are fish in an aquarium, and you can truly watch the threads run and interact.  This is something you don't see often in most books today.  And when you get done with each chapter, you actually have something visible you can look back at and enjoy.<br /><br />This isn't a book to get if you are looking to learn Java from the ground up.  There's no \\"from A to Z\\" progression through the language.  But if you've already learned Java and are looking to learn some new techniques and concepts, this is an excellent \\"next step\\" to take in your Java journey...Z\\" progression through the language.

No, this isn't a malfunctioning keyboard, nor have I decided to join the ranks of kiddie hackers by starting to use \\"elite\\" language.  It's the title of a new book by Sams...  l337 h4xor handbook by tapeworm.  For those of you not into \\"l337\\", that translates to \\"Elite Hacker Handbook\\".  Having gotten *that* piece of information out of the way, I can get on to the review.  And my review is that I really don't know what group this author is trying to target, and I think it fails regardless...<br /><br />Content:  fitting in; shortcuts; customize; browsing/e-mail; fundamentals; get the f@*! out of my chat room!; advanced automation; paranoia; networks; beyond windows; conclusion<br /><br />I wanted to like this book based on the title.  Sort of a gritty view of the hacker underworld, revealing \\"secrets\\" not commonly written of.  What we get instead is a book that can't decide what it wants to be.  People who are new to computers or confused by jargon (one of the targets from the back cover) won't see much useable info here.  If you're new to computers, the whole \\"elite\\" form of typing and word creation will be lost on you, and you'll wonder what the (#@# this person is trying to tell you.  If you already know enough to understand the type of style the author is trying to use, then you'll find most of the information far too basic.  Desktop overviews?  Running defragger?  This isn't news, folks...<br /><br />Parts of the book try to go into basic HTML coding and scripting languages.  Again, if you don't know this stuff, this book isn't going to appeal to you in the first place.  If the book appeals to you, you already know this stuff.  \\"Advanced Automation\\" gets into more scripting, but again, not at a level which is going to advance the knowledge base of someone who already understands it.  It seemed that with every chapter, the content was at odds with the style and tone of the book, thereby missing the target regardless of what side he chose...<br /><br />The whole \\"l337\\" format really started to annoy me big time after the first chapter.  I admit to not having much tolerance for that anyway.  There were some cute phrases and humorous lines in places, but not enough to make me want to recommend it to anyone.  I can't even recommend it as a parody of hacker culture, because I think the author is really trying to convey useful info.  I just don't think the audience that would find it useful would read the book, and those who would read the book won't find it useful.e whole \\"l337\\" format really started to annoy me big time after the first chapter.

The software trio that Microsoft would love to vaporize...  OpenOffice.org, Firefox, and Thunderbird.  High quality software, easy to use if you already know the Microsoft equivalents, and best of all...  FREE!  Greg Perry has written a book that will get you up to speed quite well on it all...  OpenOffice.org 2, Firefox, and Thunderbird for Windows All in One (Sams Teach Yourself).<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Writing Words with Writer: Start Here; Learning Writer's Basics; Making Your Words Look Good; Adding Lists, Tables, and Graphics; Using Writer's Advanced Features<br /><br />Part 2 - Crunching Numbers with Calc: Getting to Know Calc; Working with Calc Data; Formatting Spreadsheets with Calc; Creating Advanced Spreadsheets; Using Calc as a Simple Database<br /><br />Part 3 - Impressing Audiences with Impress: Learning About Impress; Adding Flair to Your Presentations; Making More Impressive Presentations<br /><br />Part 4 - Drawing On Your Inner Artist with Draw: Getting Ready to Draw; Improving Your Drawings; Putting on Finishing Touches with Draw<br /><br />Part 5 - Enhancing Your Work with OpenOffice.org's Other Features: Enhancing Your Work with More OpenOffice.org Features; Organizing Your Data with Base; Browsing the Internet with Firefox; Emailing with Thunderbird<br /><br />Index<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is very well done.  The style is such that each chapter has a number of items (all numbered and listed in the table of contents) that focus on a particular task, such as formatting a table or inserting graphics in a document.  These items are cross-referenced back to items you need to know/do before you start, as well as to items that will build on your new skills.  As a result, the book works well as both a tutorial and a reference guide that you can use once you master the basics.  The instructions are easy to follow, and pretty much 95% (or more) of what you'll need to do on a regular basis is covered.  If someone were looking to use OpenOffice.org as their primary productivity suite instead of Microsoft Office, this would be a good book to pick up as your introduction.<br /><br />My only nit about the book is the inclusion of the Firefox and Thunderbird chapters.  The way it's presented makes it look like Firefox and Thunderbird are part of OpenOffice.org.  They're not.  And if you're buying the book for some significant coverage on those two packages, you'll be really disappointed.  In the 600 pages of this book, you'll get around 50 pages to cover both.  It's almost as if the topics were included in order to ride some of the current Firefox popularity.  In my opinion (and it's simply that...  my opinion), I would have either left those chapters out entirely or expanded them significantly.  If you're wanting to know more about either Firefox or Thunderbird, you'd be much better off buying a separate book that *just* covers that.<br /><br />Even with the criticism, the book is well worth having.

One of the reasons I don't quite think of myself as a computer geek (although I am) is that I don't know some of the \\"geeky\\" languages like Perl.  I need to rectify that some day, and one of O'Reilly's books will help...  Learning Perl (4th Edition) by Randal L. Schwartz, Tom Phoenix, and brian d foy.  This is one of the classic Perl guides, and it's well worth owning.<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction; Scalar Data; Lists and Arrays; Subroutines; Input and Output; Hashes; In the World of Regular Expressions; Matching with Regular Expressions; Processing Text with Regular Expressions; More Control Structures; File Tests; Directory Operations; Strings and Sorting; Process Management; Perl Modules; Some Advanced Perl Techniques; Exercise Answers; Beyond the Llama; Index<br /><br />Randal Schwartz is *the* best-selling Perl author and writer, and it shows in this book.  He knows the subject inside and out, and knows how to communicate that knowledge to an audience.  In Learning Perl, he and his fellow authors set out to cover the material that you'll use 90% of the time in day-to-day situations.  Keeping that as the target, you'll get a lot of value out of working through this title.  Each chapter also has a number of exercises at the end that will help you apply and solidify what you just learned.  You can even cheat and check out the answers at the end, even though the authors beg you not to...  :)<br /><br />They do assume a background understanding of basic computing and programming concepts, so this wouldn't be the best title if you are looking to learn Perl as your first programming language.  Of course, I don't think many people approach Perl from that perspective anyway, so it shouldn't be a problem.  With that assumption in place, you end up getting into the meat of Perl quickly.  Couple that with a nice conversational approach to the writing, and you've got a book that will take you far.  Oh, and don't ignore the footnotes...  Some useful information (and great humor) is hidden down there...<br /><br />If you need to learn Perl and you want to get there quickly, Learning Perl is the way to go.

Kathy Reichs is definitely one of my favorite authors, and I enjoyed her latest...  Cross Bones.  Sort of a Jewish Da Vinci Code...<br /><br />Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist splitting time between Montreal and North Carolina is drawn into a *really* cold case.  As in a set of bones that looks to be around 2000 years old.  While working on a case involving the murder of a Jewish merchant, a picture of an old skeleton is given to her by an anonymous person who thinks it's the reason the merchant was killed.  Digging deeper (no pun intended), she actually ends up in possession of said skeleton (quite likely found at Masada) and there's a strong chance that the identity of the bones could really mess up some major theology for a number of groups.  Brennan has to stay alive, figure out if the bones belong to Jesus Christ, and try and solve the murder of the merchant, all at the same time.  A number of people would like to see the bones just \\"disappear\\", and if Brennan has to disappear along with them, so much the better...<br /><br />As you can tell, there's some strong parallels to Code in the story.  Jewish history would need to be rewritten if the bones belong to Christ, and the entire Christian faith would collapse if the resurrection is proven to be false.  There are some real \\"alternative view\\" scenarios thrown in, so if the story catches your attention you can actually delve into it further.  The ending left a bit to be desired, but overall it was an enjoyable read and a nice addition to the Tempe series.  A nice vacation read...	2005-08-26

It seems like Voice over Internet Protocol, aka VoIP, is starting to become much more mainstream.  Not only are businesses switching over, but now you can set up your home phone access to use VoIP (aka \\"broadband\\") technology.  Ted Wallingford has done a nice job in explaining the business side of the possibilities in the book Switching to VoIP - A Solutions Manual for Network Professionals.<br /><br />Contents:  Voice and Data - Two Separate Worlds?; Voice over Data - Many Conversations, One Network; Linux as a PBX; Circuit-Switched Telephony; Enterprise Telephone Applications; Replacing the Voice Circuit with VoIP; Replacing Call Signaling with VoIP; VoIP Readiness; Quality of Service; Security and Monitoring; Troubleshooting Tools; PSTN Trunks; Network Infrastructure for VoIP; Traditional Apps on the Converged Network; What Can Go Wrong?; VoIP Vendors and Services; Asterisk Reference; SIP Methods and Responses; AGI Commands; Asterisk Manager Socket API Syntax; Glossary; Index<br /><br />I think the biggest thing to keep in mind when approaching this book is the target audience.  While there are a few books out there on \\"internet telephones\\" that talk to the consumer, this isn't one of them.  The tag line of \\"for Network Professionals\\" is the key here.  While you don't have to be a network guru to read this book, some level of familiarity with network and telephony concepts would help.  Someone either working with the communication systems in a company or heading up a communications department would be a perfect match here.  You'd probably even do alright if you just have an interest in the subject, as Wellingford does a good job taking what can be complex material and making it understandable.  An admirable task in itself...<br /><br />What makes this book stand out from other books I'd expect to see is that it doesn't just dwell on jargon and theory.  There are a number of projects included in the book so you can get your hands dirty actually working with the technology.  Add to that the fact that the author uses an open source PBX system called Asterisk for the exercises.  So now you have no reason in terms of cost for not diving right in.<br /><br />Although I'm not necessarily the target audience for this book, I'd have no problem recommending it to someone looking for material that covers this subject.

But of course, that's an unlikely situation for an IT professional.  O'Reilly has released another title in the Cookbook series that I really like...  Windows XP Cookbook by Robbie Allen and Preston Gralla.  This is the type of book that may not be needed every day, but when you do need it, it's something that must happen NOW.<br /><br />Contents: Introduction; Operating System Installation and Maintenance; Managing Hardware and Devices; Installing, Uninstalling, and Working with Applications; Customizing the Interface; System Properties, Startup, and Shutdown; Disks, Drives, and Volumes; Files, Folders, and Shares; The Registry; Processes, Tasks, and Services; Digital Media; Network Configuration; The Internet; Wireless Networking; User, Group, and Computer Accounts; Event Logs and Log Files; Security and Auditing; Performance Tuning; Backup and Recovery; Crashes and Errors; Summary of Windows XP Versions and Service Packs; Index<br /><br />Windows XP Cookbook follows the traditional format for an O'Reilly Cookbook title.  There's the problem, followed by a solution and discussion of the problem.  There's also a \\"see also\\" paragraph that points you to more information related to the particular issue being discussed.  Allen and Gralla have done some nice things with this title that definitely enhance its usefulness to a wider range of readers.  First off, they realized that not everyone likes to perform a task the same way.  Some want to use the graphical user interface (GUI), some want to show off their command line skills (CLI), and some want to script the whole process so that they can run it automatically.  Whenever possible and wherever applicable, the authors provide all three methods for each recipe.  All the script examples use VBScript since we *are* dealing with Windows.  But in a great concession to the Perl junkies, there's a companion website that has all the VBScript examples done in Perl.  What more can you ask for?  You even get pointers to third-party software that fills a particular niche better than Windows XP does by itself.<br /><br />I was a little concerned that the book would spend most of its time catering to the sysadmin crowd, leaving us \\"power users\\" wishing for more.  Nope...  There's a very nice mix of admin and desktop recipes, enough that both groups can feel like they've gotten their money's worth even if they don't cross over between the two.  Just during my initial review, I finally found how to set the properties on a particular feature that I used in Windows 2000 but that eluded me in Windows XP.  That definitely gained my attention and trust in short order...<br /><br />Since I normally don't get to tweak a lot of stuff on my work computer in terms of the operating system (nor do I want to), this book will stay at home within arm's reach of my desktop machine.

As you probably know, I like books.  And there are a number of books I think should make an appearance on a person's bookshelf depending on their area of expertise.  But there are a small number of books I think are absolute musts to be read, digested, and applied.  I had the pleasure of reading one of those books this week...  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Growing Your Business with Google by Dave Taylor.  It is truly that good...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - The Business Case for Google: Increasing Your Business Visibility; The Benefits of Increasing Your Visibility with Google; What Is Google Anyway?; Learning About Google Search; Disassembling the Google Search Engine<br /><br />Part 2 - Building Your Google Plan: What's Your Core Business?; Living in an Online World; Your Business Website; Assessing Your Competitors; Keeping Track of Customers<br /><br />Part 3 - Improving Your Online Business Site: The Basics of Building a Good Business Site; Developing Online and Offline Content; Stretching Your Marketing Dollars; Secrets of the Online Marketing Masters<br /><br />Part 4 - Promoting and Growing Your Online Business: Content, Content, Content!; Becoming a More Popular Site; Becoming an Online Expert; Advertising Your Business with Google AdWords; Making Money with Google AdSense; The Advantages of Affiliate Programs; Avoiding Dumb Online Promotional Mistakes<br /><br />Part 5 - What's Next on Your To-Do List?: Growing and Expanding Your Content; The Future of Findability<br /><br />Appendixes: Websites Worth Exploring; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Short of writing a two or three page review, it's really hard to cover all the things I like about this book.  First off, Dave Taylor is a talented writer who is able to cut through hype and jargon and convey useful information in a compelling manner.  In Growing Your Business with Google, he takes the reader through how Google works, and how it can be leveraged by businesses and web site owners to drive traffic (and dollars) their way.  With the concepts and understanding conveyed here, you'll learn how best to structure your site to show up and stand out in search results.  Even better, Dave doesn't resort to cheap tricks and unethical methods to accomplish these goals.  The recommendations are all solid techniques that work well and won't get you in hot water with search sites.<br /><br />The chapters that concentrate on Google's AdWords and AdSense programs alone would justify the cost of the book.  You'll learn how to launch an effective advertising campaign by bidding on keyword searches through AdWords.  On the flip side, you'll also learn how to incorporate AdSense advertising into your site so as to make money on directing people to useful information.  There are no unreasonable promises that you can build a site specifically to generate AdSense revenue and retire early.  It's just solid information that helps you monetize portions of your site and add to your overall revenue stream.<br /><br />Finally, Dave Taylor practices what he preaches.  I consider him a \\"virtual colleague\\" based on chats and email exchanges I've had with him.  I also follow his blogs and see how he's put everything into place on his sites.  Rather than being an author who jumps on the hot topic du jour, he is truly an expert in this area, and he writes what he knows.  As a result, you can trust what he says, because it's actually worked.  I'll even testify to the fact that I've increased the AdSense revenue on my site by a factor of 4 based on his recommendations.  I'm nowhere near his traffic levels and income totals, but the information *does* work...<br /><br />If you're a large company, your marketing communications department should read this book.  If you're a small business or a website owner who wants more \\"findability\\" (and more dollars), you *absolutely* need to read this book.  You'll be \\"the complete idiot\\" if you don't...way.

100930:US	52517734	R3V69QEU1TSMWT	1590595009	990284833	1: The Best Software Writing I: Selected and Introduced by Joel Spolsky	Books	4	18	20	N	N	How software geeks should write...	I recently received a copy of The Best Software Writing I by Joel Spolsky.  As with his other book, it's an entertaining read with a number of enlightening insights into what I do for a living...<br /><br />Joel Spolsky has gathered a number of blog entries, essays, and speeches that showcase (in his opinion) the best writings by software professionals.  He feels (and I have to agree) that most programmers and developers will avoid writing at all cost, and as a result are not very good at it.  You end up with either indecipherable ramblings or dry monotone typing that is akin to enduring some form of medieval torture.  And I confess...  I probably have strayed into both those areas a few too many times for the sanity of my readers.  But by showcasing techno-geeks that can write coherently and with a touch of humor and entertainment, Spolsky hopes to raise the overall level of writing competency in the industry.  I don't know if he'll be successful, but it definitely can't hurt...<br /><br />Because the writings cover a wide range of topics, there's something for everyone.  Or conversely, not everything will appeal to every reader.  \\"Style Is Substance\\" by Ken Arnold is (for me) a great piece that advocates making programming style a built-in element of a language.  Think of the time you'll save by killing off all style wars up front.  The cartoon piece \\"Excel As A Database\\" will cause all developers to think Rory Blyth must work somewhere in their company with their users.  And \\"A Quick (And Hopefully Painless) Ride Through Ruby (With Cartoon Foxes)\\" will, although rather strange, give you more information about Ruby in a shorter period of time than you ever thought possible.  On the other hand, \\"A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy\\" by Clay Shirky was something I seemed to have to slog through.  You may well have just the opposite reaction on any or all of these.  It's one of the fun things about this compilation...  :)<br /><br />While you can obviously go out and find all this stuff on-line at the various sites, odds are you won't find what you don't know about.  Joel brings together a nice mixture of thoughts and concepts, all packaged within an expert writing style.  If you're a professional developer, you probably should pick up a copy and see how writing can be done well...find all this stuff on-line at the various sites, odds are you won't find what you don't know about.

104824:US	52517734	R3QNQ0UI5D000O	0764569597	978711017	The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders and Deceivers	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Entertaining/enlightening stories of the hacker mind...	It's always interesting to read about hackers and crackers from the perspective of someone who was completely immersed in that community.  That person would be Kevin Mitnick, and along with William L. Simon he wrote The Art of Intrusion.  Pretty entertaining and enlightening material...<br /><br />I'll forego the normal content list I do on tech book reviews, as it wouldn't be terribly helpful here.  Mitnick has compiled a series of true stories (or as true as he can verify given the activities being covered) related to different aspects of hacking, cracking, and physical/cyber intrusions.  After each story, there's a short Insight section, followed by Countermeasures and The Bottom Line.  Insight tries to recap the issues and mindset that exist behind the specific incident.  Countermeasures talks about how a business or individual can protect themselves from this type of hack.  And finally, The Bottom Line is a \\"call to action\\" to motivate the reader (and society as a whole) to take serious steps to change things.<br /><br />I think the most unnerving story was the social engineering tale of a professional hired by a casino to assess their physical and computer security.  Instead of waiting for the expected start date, he began the assessment early and pretty much was able to go anywhere he wanted (which was everywhere he wasn't supposed to be).  Rather than be grateful, the casino quietly paid him and asked him to leave, as the state of Nevada would not have looked kindly on that lack of security.  It was all too easy to see how someone who \\"looks\\" like they belong can go unchallenged...<br /><br />Being that the Insight/Countermeasures/The Bottom Line sections take only three or four pages out of each of the ten stories, I don't know how much \\"hard knowledge\\" you'll take away from this book.  It's not like there are myriad checklists and software packages recommended in order to secure your environment.  It's more likely you'll come away with a bit more understanding of how a hacker mind works and what you're up against.  From there, you can decide just how much you need to do to avoid becoming an incident in volume 2...erstanding of how a hacker mind works and what you're up against.

Looking for a single volume that touches on just about everything related to Red Hat Fedora?  Here you go...  Red Hat Fedora 4 Unleashed by Paul Hudson, Andrew Hudson, Bill Ball, and Hoyt Duff.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Installation and Configuration: Introducing Fedora; Preparing to Install Fedora; Installing Fedora; Post-Installation Configuration; First Steps with Fedora<br /><br />Part 2 - Fedora Desktop: The X Window System; Managing Software and System Resources; On the Internet - Surfing the Web, Writing Email, and Reading the News; Productivity Applications; Multimedia Applications; Printing with Fedora; Games<br /><br />Part 3 - System Administration: Managing Users; Automating Tasks; System Resources; Backing Up, Restoring, and Recovery; Network Connectivity; Internet Connectivity<br /><br />Part 4 - Fedora As a Server: Apache Web Server Management; Administering Database Services; File and Print; Remote File Serving with FTP; Handling Electronic Mail; Setting Up a Proxy Server; Remote System Access with SSH and Telnet; Managing DNS; LDAP; News Servers and Mailing Lists<br /><br />Part 5 - Programming Linux: Using Perl; Working with Python; Writing PHP Scripts; C/C++ Programming Tools for Fedora<br /><br />Part 6 - Fedora Housekeeping: Securing Your Machines; Performance Tuning; Command-line Masterclass; Advanced Yum; Managing the File System; Kernel and Module Management<br /><br />Part 7 - Appendix: Fedora and Linux Internet Resources; Index<br /><br />At over 1100 pages, this isn't the book you'd give to a typical Windows user to make the switch over to Linux...  :-)<br /><br />As you can see from the contents, Fedora Unleashed touches on nearly every area of Linux at some level.  Using this book alone, you could easily get a Linux server and/or a Linux desktop environment up and running on your computer.  Depending on your particular needs, you could then dive into server related topics like file sharing, LDAP, or running a web server.  If you're just wanting to break out of the Windows monopoly and run a desktop OS not controlled by Microsoft, you would spend more time in Part 2 where the desktop Linux environment is covered.  While you could definitely find more detailed books on specific areas of Linux, Unleashed allows you to get a working knowledge of a broad swath of the subject.<br /><br />The book also comes with a DVD containing the Fedora 4 distribution so you can easily start to dive right into your own Linux build.  This definitely beats having to find, download, and burn a number of CD .iso files before you can get started.  While the downloads are free, having all the media ready to use adds to the value of the book...<br /><br />Since I haven't yet upgraded to Red Hat Fedora 4, having this book around will put that task higher on my priority list...  Good volume for anyone wanting to learn and understand Linux...reak out of the Windows monopoly and run a desktop OS not controlled by Microsoft, you would spend more time in Part 2 where the desktop Linux environment is covered.

So much for the days of trusting everyone on-line to use software in the way that it was intended.  Now the stakes are much higher, and attacking systems can be a profitable activity for those so inclined.  To protect yourself, you need to understand the wide range of vulnerabilities.  Reading Hacking Exposed (5th Edition) by Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, and George Kurtz goes a long way towards getting you prepared.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Casing the Establishment: Footprinting; Scanning; Enumeration<br /><br />Part 2 - System Hacking: Hacking Windows; Hacking Unix; Remote Connectivity and VoIP Hacking<br /><br />Part 3 - Network Hacking: Network Drives; Wireless Hacking; Firewalls; Denial of Service Attacks<br /><br />Part 4 - Software Hacking: Hacking Code; Web Hacking; Hacking the Internet User<br /><br />Part 5 - Appendixes: Ports; Top 14 Security Vulnerabilities<br /><br />Hacking Exposed follows a consistent format in covering areas subject to misuse and attack.  They name the type of attack or information gathering technique and give it a risk rating based on popularity, simplicity, and impact.  Following an explanation of the particular area, they follow up with a countermeasure section to help the reader understand how this type of attack or exploit can be mitigated.  That format scores high on my practicality scale because you can immediately make changes to secure your environment.  It's not as if they just spell out the doom and gloom and leave you to fend for yourself.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book I like is the wide range of hacking covered.  Admittedly, a number of these areas (such as hacking Unix or Windows) could easily be made into a whole separate book (and in most cases, they *have* been).  But I really don't want to have to buy a dozen books to gain a broad overview of my potential exposure.  I want to cover everything at a reasonable level of detail to understand the overall subject.  Then if I have the need to get into more detail (like if I need to focus on firewalls), I at least have a framework on which to dive deeper into the subject matter.  Hacking Exposed gives me that \\"reasonable level\\", and it's greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Does this book cover every single hack or vulnerability out there?  No, and no book (or web site or anything else) ever could.  New attacks are discovered and exploited every day.  But this gives you a very good knowledge base on which to understand current and future problems.  It's a book I'd recommend highly to anyone who needs to understand security.

Traditionally I've always enjoyed John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series, but the last couple of installments didn't do much for me.  I'm not sure if it was burnout or what, but there was a declining level of interest.  I picked up his latest, Broken Prey, wondering if this was one of the last I'd read.  I'm happy to report that things appear to be back on track, and I really enjoyed this one...<br /><br />Davenport is called into a case involving a woman who is found next to the river, her body whipped to shreds and \\"posed\\" at the scene.  Unfortunately, this is just the start.  When a man and his son are found murdered at their home, and the bodies display many of the same characteristics of the first killing, they know they have a serial killer on the loose.  By following all the evidence and DNA, they pretty much know who is doing the killings.  That is, until hard cold facts prove otherwise.  Things take a much deeper turn at that point, in that they know they are being played by the killer, and everything they thought they knew is now up in the air...<br /><br />This was a definite page turner.  There are a number of potential suspects, and you could well make a case for any one of them being the killer.  And given the way the book is written, you might even think you have it figured out.  But Sandford weaves some great misdirection and 180 degree turns into the story, and pretty soon you're as confused as Davenport is.<br /><br />If you've missed the last couple of Prey novels, this is the one you need to pick up to get started again.  It's well worth the read...	2005-08-13

Since I live and breathe computer stuff, I'm pretty much up to speed on how aware someone needs to be when it comes to PC security.  But every once in awhile, I'm forced to look at a PC through the eyes of someone who really doesn't understand what's going on...  like my father...  But there's finally a book I could give a typical user to allow them to sort through the nasty world of personal PC security...  PC Pest Control by Preston Gralla.<br /><br />Content:<br /><br />Overall Protection: Your PC Is Not Your Own; Where You're Vulnerable; Pest Prevention and Monitoring; Killing Pests<br /><br />Fighting Specific Pests: Throw Internet Explorer Out the Window; Adware, Spyware, and Home Page Hijackers; Viruses, Trojans, and Bots; Email, Worms, and Instant Messaging; Spam, Spam, and Spam; Protecting Your Identity and Kids Online; Wireless and Home Networking Dangers<br /><br />Appendix: A Field Guide To Pests<br /><br />Gralla has written a book that approaches PC security at a level that can be understood by nearly anyone that uses a computer.  Terms such as \\"spyware\\" and \\"bots\\" will no longer be something that causes your Uncle Joe to scratch his head in total confusion.  There's a clear explanation of the different security risks, what they do, how to tell if you have that problem, how to fix the issue, and how to monitor and prevent the problem in the future.  There are also references to a number of additional software packages that can be downloaded (free and for purchase) to fill the security gaps that are inherent on Windows systems.  Spending $25 on this book will pay for itself immediately when you learn what anti-virus and anti-spyware software is and how you need to have it running on your system.  To me, it's second nature.  To Uncle Joe, it's a complete unknown.<br /><br />If the information wasn't so valuable, I'd probably ding the book on a minor nit that started to annoy me after awhile.  There's the tendency to repeat the same commentary on something over and over.  For instance, whenever the spyware software CoolWebSearch is mentioned, it's followed by \\"may well be the most reviled piece of spyware in existence\\".  Fine the first time, OK the second, after that it was distracting.  Same thing with the advice about upgrading to SP2 if you're running Windows XP.  I really don't need to see that as the recommended solution to nearly everything (even if they do try to make it humorous after awhile).<br /><br />If you're a hard-core geek and IT professional, you probably know most of this.  But if you have the unenviable task of being the de facto help desk for your extended family, you might want to buy this book as a Christmas present for your most problematic \\"customers\\".  It'll pay off for both of you...and over.  For instance, whenever the spyware software CoolWebSearch is mentioned, it's followed by \\"may well be the most reviled piece of spyware in existence\\".

I just got done reading the latest from an author I look forward to reading with each new release...  Harlan Coben's The Innocent.  And as usual, Coben delivers a great read...<br /><br />Matt Hunter has finally \\"paid his debt\\" to society.  He was convicted of killing a fellow student during a drunken brawl at a frat party.  It was a defense reaction, but the jury decided otherwise.  Now that he's out, he's trying hard to rebuild his life as a paralegal at his brother's law firm.  Even better, he's met a woman who he first met a long time ago during a brief visit to Las Vegas.  They've reconnected, gotten married, and she's pregnant.  But Hunter's fragile world comes crashing down when he gets a picture and video on his cell phone that appears to show his wife in a hotel room with another man while on a \\"business trip\\".  And the man in the picture is also tailing him.  Hunter has to figure out what his wife is up to, and who the guy is that's making his life a living hell.  Meanwhile, a local investigator for the county cops is asked to look into the death of a nun in a local convent.  It looks like natural causes, except that the nun has breast implants, and that doesn't mesh with her official background.  The more the investigator digs, the more things appear to be covered up at a very high federal level.  And when Hunter's wife becomes part of the mystery and Hunter's mystery tail is killed, Matt looks to be the fall guy for whoever is pulling the strings.<br /><br />As with most of Coben's novels, I devoured this book.  The writing is tight, the mystery is deep and twisting, and he reveals just enough detail every so often to keep you turning the pages.  This book was also unusual in that I didn't have a clue as to the story line when I started reading.  Normally, I have the jacket flaps to give me a general idea of the plot and direction.  But this library version of the book didn't have that, nor did I look to Amazon for a quick overview of the story.  So instead of having a framework for the characters, I had to let it all be revealed page by page.  It's sort of like watching a movie you've never heard of, and you don't know what you're getting when you sit down.  I'm not sure I'd take that risk with every novel I read, but it worked well here.<br /><br />While I still like Coben's Myron Bolitar character best, his other novels (like this one) are just as good.  A definite recommended novel...instead of having a framework for the characters, I had to let it all be revealed page by page.

Every time I think there's not much more someone could do with a Firefox book, I end up being wrong.  I've found a great new advanced Firefox book...  Hacking Firefox by Mel Reyes (published by Wiley).<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Basic Hacking: Hacking Firefox Boot Camp; Hacking Around Manually; Hacking Extensions; Hacking Themes and Icons<br /><br />Part 2 - Hacking Performance, Security, and Banner Ads: Performance Tweaks and Hacks; Hacking Security and Privacy; Hacking Banner Ads, Content, Images, and Cookies<br /><br />Part 3 - Hacking Menus, Toolbars, and the Status Bar: Hacking Menus; Hacking Toolbars and the Status Bar<br /><br />Part 4 - Hacking Navigation, Downloads, and Searching: Hacking Navigation and Tab Browsing; Download and Plugin Hacks; Search Hacks<br /><br />Part 5 - Installation, Automation, Tools, and Tricks: Hacking Installation and Deployment; Backing Up and Managing Your Profile/Settings; Hacking Tools for Web Programmers<br /><br />Part 6 - Creating Extensions and Themes: Understanding Mozilla Programming; Creating Extensions; Creating Themes<br /><br />Index<br /><br />One of the main strengths of Firefox over IE is its extensibility and ability to customize the browser experience.  Using the about:config URL in Firefox, you have an incredible amount of options listed out and open to alteration.  Hacking Firefox doesn't bother with teaching you how to use the browser.  The assumption is that you already know the basics.  This simple little thing helps the book keep a tight focus and makes sure the target audience gets full value.  The author strikes the perfect balance between uncovering the guts of Firefox and making the information accessible to the reader.  These aren't completely esoteric hacks that you'd never want to do.  For instance, I've been a bit frustrated over being restricted to a couple of downloads at a time when pulling down files.  I changed that registry setting in IE a long time ago, but I wasn't sure where it was in Firefox.  In the Performance hacks chapter, I found that setting as well as a number of other ones to tweak to get better download performance.  I can already notice the difference.  Very nice stuff...<br /><br />It's probably not the book you want to get if you're just wanting to know how to use Firefox.  It's *definitely* not the book to give to Uncle Joe to get him to move off IE so you don't have to remove viruses every other week.  But if you've already made the switch and you like what you see, this is a must-read book to take your Firefox browsing to the next level.

One of my local librarians suggested a book she thought I might like...  The Rule Of Four by Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason.  Unfortunately, this is one of those rare instances where we didn't agree.  The book didn't do a whole lot for me...<br /><br />The novel tracks the story of four Princeton students, two of which have a history involving the study of a book titled the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.  This is an actual book written in the late 1400's, and it's thought to have a number of puzzles and riddles contained in it that lead to a secret message from the unknown author.  The book's mystery ends up being an all-consuming passion to those who get involved, and in this case it involves double crosses and death.<br /><br />Now, I realize that's a pretty thin synopsis.  But in this case, it's about the most positive thing I can say about the book.  Comparisons are made to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, in that there's hidden meanings that once uncovered will change the perception and truth about historical events.  But at least with Brown's book, the supporting story surrounding the investigation was interesting.  This one just sits there.  Two of the four students are not even primary to the plot (in my opinion), and I really don't care about them.  The girlfriend angle with one of the two main characters doesn't add a lot to the primary plot, either.  I know that we're supposed to care about how he has to choose Katie or the book, and how that same consuming passion destroyed his father.  But once again, I just didn't find myself caring one way or the other.  The story was at it's best when they were figuring out how to decode the riddles and cyphers to get the next clue, but there was far too little of that to maintain my interest.<br /><br />I suppose if you're *really* into academia, literary analysis, or books that spend a lot of time examining motivation and cause, you might find this a stellar read.  For those of us looking for something to entertain, this book is probably best left on the shelf...ain, this book is probably best left on the shelf...	2005-08-06

In James Patterson's latest novel, 4th Of July, he brings back Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department for an adventure that could be her very last in more than one way.<br /><br />In the process of trying to find a killer operating in the seedy areas of San Francisco, her and her partner find and give chase to a car thought to belong to the main suspect.  After the car crashes, they find that it is driven by two young kids who look pretty banged up.  While trying to give aid and remove the kids, both kids draw weapons and shoot the two cops.  Boxer's able to return fire and kill one and paralyze the other.  Unfortunately, the father is a high-powered doctor in the city and launches a huge lawsuit against the city and Boxer for wrongful death and injury as she had a couple of drinks off-duty before getting involved in the chase.  While waiting for the case to be tried, she heads off to Half Moon Bay to stay out of the limelight.  Nice try...  A series of murders are taking place there, and they seem to tie to a cold case that Boxer has never been able to solve.  Against her better judgement, she ends up working the cases along with the local police chief as she's compelled to find the killer or killers.  But she's getting too close to the truth, and it's very possible that she might end up the next victim...  The trick is to see what ends her career first...  the court case or her demise?<br /><br />Patterson did an excellent job with this story.  Pacing, character development, hidden twists...  it's all there.  After the less-than-wonderful London Bridges, I wondered if he was losing his touch.  Honeymoon recovered much of the old Patterson flavor, and 4th Of July continues the strong rebound.  I'm almost over my fear of losing another favorite author, and I look forward to his next novel, whatever series it might be...	2005-08-06

Python is one of those programming languages I hear about a lot, but I've never taken the time to pick up a book and find out more about it.  To fix that, I got a copy of Beginning Python (published by Wrox) by Peter Norton, Alex Samuel, David Aitel, Eric Foster-Johnson, Leonard Richardson, Jason Diamond, Aleatha Parker, and Michael Roberts.  Not a bad title to use to get started...<br /><br />Contents: Introduction; Programming Basics and Strings; Numbers and Operators; Variables - Names for Values; Making Decisions; Functions; Classes and Objects; Organizing Programs; Files and Directories; Other Features of the Language; Building a Module; Text Processing; Testing; Writing a GUI with Python; Accessing Databases; Using Python for XML; Network Programming; Extension Programming with C; Writing Shareware and Commercial Programs; Numerical Programming; Python in the Enterprise; Web Applications and Web Services; Integrating Java with Python; Answers to Exercises; Online Resources; What's New in Python 2.4; Glossary; Index<br /><br />When I first started reading, I was a little disappointed at the target level.  Up through about the Functions chapter, it's information that any programmer should already know (loops, variables, etc.) and would be best used by someone who had never programmed before in their life.  While they do say that particular demographic is intended as a reader, I was hoping for more.  From Classes on, it's material that squarely hits where intermediate programmers live and breathe, and it's at that point that the book takes off (in my opinion).  Using the basic Python skills learned in the first section, you start to see how those concepts are applied in real programs that actually do stuff.  And given the wide array of subjects they hit (C integration, GUI development, XML, etc.), you should quickly learn how best to use this language in many of the common situations you'll run into on a day-to-day basis.  The writing style and format is consistent, as well as their use of examples throughout the book.  You don't find yourself switching gears every few pages for some new contrived example that just came out of left field.<br /><br />This is a book I'll be holding onto in order to free up time to get some hands-on experience with Python.

HarperCollins contacted me and asked if I'd like an advance reader's copy of a new novel by a new name...  The Double Eagle by James Twining.  Of course, I rarely turn down the chance for a good mystery read, and in this case I have a new author to follow.  Twining has an excellent future as a writer...<br /><br />Tom Kirk is an experienced theft who can break into nearly any location and make off with luxury items like jewelry and Faberge eggs.  But after a long career of successful heists, he decides he wants to go straight and take over his father's export business.  On the other side of the story, we have Jennifer Brown, an FBI agent who is trying to make up for a career incident that has derailed her progress in the Bureau.  When it's discovered that five extremely rare Double Eagle gold coins have been stolen from Fort Knox, she's put on the case to figure out when the theft occurred and who did it.  The consensus is that Kirk is the only person who could pull off something of that magnitude, and she's sent over to Europe to offer him a deal.  But he truly doesn't know anything about it, and his only way to wipe the slate clean of his past transgressions is to assist Brown in solving the case using his \\"unusual contacts\\".  Both Brown and Kirk have no reason to trust each other (or who they represent), but neither can succeed on their own.  Complicating the issue is a request from Kirk's fence to do one last job (that Kirk turned down) in order to keep them from getting killed by a murky underground figure.  And more and more, the job looks to be tied into the missing coins...<br /><br />It wasn't until after I was done with the book that I realized this is Twining's debut novel.  As such, I'm really impressed.  Most first novels have some rough edges that you figure a budding author will smooth out over time.  I really didn't see that here.  Both Kirk and Brown have enough character development to allow you to care about them, yet not enough that you have nowhere to go for future installments.  The last fifty or so pages completely twist the story in a number of ways, and you're compelled to keep reading to see exactly who is and isn't who they let on to be.  And if you're at all into coin collecting, the historical aspects of the Double Eagle minting and destruction will appeal to you.<br /><br />Bottom line...  Extremely good debut effort, and well worth picking up early so you can follow his career.  I'm definitely looking forward to it.nowhere to go for future installments.

Quite a few Firefox books have made their appearance on the market, and I have the chance to review yet another one...  Firefox Secrets by Cheah Chu Yeow.  Although not the first to market, it does a good job given the right audience...<br /><br />Contents: Introduction; Introducing Your New Favorite Web Browser; Essential Browsing Features; Revisiting Web Pages; Dressing Up Firefox; Personalizing Firefox; Tips, Tricks, and Hacks; Web Development Nirvana; Living On The Edge; Index<br /><br />Yeow does a nice job explaining why Firefox is a desired alternative to IE and why you should be using it.  In addition to explaining all the different features in the menu, he also goes into some of the more popular browser extensions you can download and install to customize your browser experience.  That's one of the huge advantages of Firefox over other browsers, and it's an area that can't be overlooked.  There's also a fairly high level coverage of how the browser can aid your web development efforts based on the built-in debugging tools and the high adherence to web standards.<br /><br />If you already have a Firefox book, this one isn't going to add much new information for you.  Also, if you're wanting to dive into all the esoteric settings with about:config, this also won't get you there.

The Lincoln Rhyme series by Jeffery Deaver is one of those ongoing stories that I look forward to with each new installment.  Jeffery Deaver's latest, The Twelfth Card, continues to deliver the goods...<br /><br />Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic criminologist with a vast array of insight and technology for solving crimes, is brought into a case involving the attempted murder of a 16 year old girl.  She was studying the history of an ancestor who was accused of a crime over 140 year ago.  For some reason, there are persons who don't want the information she's reading to be uncovered by anyone.  Rhyme and his partner, Amelia Sachs, work the crime scenes and try to figure out both who is trying to kill her and what secrets are buried in the letters from the former slave written after the civil war.<br /><br />This is one of those stories where you know who the primary killer is, but there are a couple other characters who might also be a threat to the girl.  As you get closer to the end of the story, many of the assumptions that you've taken as fact are challenged.  Pretty soon you're not quite sure who to trust and who is still trying to finish the contract.  The only thing I didn't much care for is that the 140 year old secrets are not revealed until the very end.  While it keeps you reading in order to find out the answers, it got a little frustrating after awhile, not knowing why all this was going on.  I'm not always very patient...  :-)<br /><br />Good story, good installment...  Looking forward to the next one.	2005-07-31

Are you looking for computer software to write letters, create spreadsheets, manipulate images, or surf the web, and you don't have hundreds (or more realistically thousands) of dollars to send off to a certain computer company in the Pacific Northwest?  There are very good alternatives out there, and best of all, it's FREE!

Firefox for web browsing has been all the rage, and GIMP is pretty well-known in the graphics area.  But maybe you didn't know (if you're not an IT geek already) that OpenOffice.org has a office productivity software suite that comes very close to all the functionality you'd get in Microsoft Office.  It even creates output files compatible with Office!  Why spend hundreds if it's not necessary?  Do you need diagramming software like Visio but can't afford a copy for home?  Check out Dia.  In the entertainment section, you can even avoid buying Microsoft's Flight Simulator and Flight Gear instead.  Worried about not having enough scenery for your flying adventures?  Does three DVDs worth of scenery make you feel better?  :-)  Tired of running three different instant messaging clients?  Run just one, Gaim, that interfaces with all three services.<br /><br />While you could write complete books to teach you how to run any one of these major software packages (OpenOffice.org, GIMP, Firefox), Free Software For Dummies gives you just enough information to allow you to become productive in short order.  If you want to wring every last ounce of functionality from the software, you'll have to explore on your own (or buy another book).  But it's nice that you're not left with \\"here's a package, here's where you download it, next!\\".  There's a nice balance between letting you know the software exists and giving you some education on how to use it.<br /><br />Going through this book, I was once again surprised to see how much of the free software competes with packages from Microsoft.  A book like this must make them a little uneasy should everyone figure out that there are alternatives.  While I know about many of these software alternatives (and use a number of them myself), this book motivated me to check out a few more.  Very good stuff, and very well written.  The book will pay for itself the first time you download a software system and save the cost of the \\"other\\" choice...  Recommended read.ce...  Recommended read.	2005-07-31

Most of it has been learn as you go, and do whatever works.  But a book like this forces me to take a step back and examine the \\"why\\" of site development with CSS.  Each of the authors are seasoned professionals at web site design, and have worked on some of the largest websites out there.  They are well qualified to take an aspect of design (like Blogger's \\"rounded box corner\\" look) and go into detail about how it's accomplished.  Along the way, you pick up insights as to how high-end designers think about their craft and how you can start using the same techniques.<br /><br />I find books like this extremely valuable as I'm more mechanical than artistic when it comes to programming.  I can do a lot when it comes to building functionality, but I'm extremely weak when it comes to designing aesthetically pleasing visual effects.  But I can copy real well.  :-)  Perusing through these pages give me a number of ideas I can implement right away, and I start to look like I know what I'm doing.<br /><br />Definitely a book that earns a spot on my shelf at work under close watch and guard against \\"borrowers\\"...	2005-07-31

I think I finally found a book I could give my dad if and when he ever decides to buy a digital camera...  Digital Photography Just The Steps For Dummies by Frederic H. Jones.  It's a very attractive work that doesn't stray from it's purpose.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Acquiring Digital Photos: Selecting a Camera and Accessories; Setting Up and Using the Camera; Snapping Digital Pictures; Viewing and Transferring Images; Digitizing Existing Pictures<br /><br />Part 2 - Editing and Enhancing Digital Photos: Manipulating Image Attributes; Fixing Common Image Problems; Repairing Digital Images; Adding Photo Editor Special Effects; Adding Photoshop Elements Effects; Using Layers<br /><br />Part 3 - Choosing and Using a Printer; Organizing and Sharing Photos<br /><br />Part 4 - Special Projects: Taking Close-Up Photos for eBay; Restoring Old Photos; Documenting Your Travels; Creative Mini-Projects; Index<br /><br />The author's intent is simple:  write a book for people who just want to do stuff with their camera and don't want to read 500 pages to figure it all out.  Jones writes this book as a series of \\"steps\\" attached to each \\"thing\\" that you would want to do.  Lengthen depth of field?  Five steps to follow.  Reduce battery usage?  Two steps.  Scan a photo using Windows scanner wizard?  Nine steps...  All very easy to follow and you'll get results in short order.<br /><br />For the software manipulation of your pictures, he uses Adobe Photoshop in most of the examples.  At first I thought that if you had some other package, you could just find the menu option that does the same thing.  But for the type of reader that would have this book, they probably just want to follow directions and not dive deeply (yet?) into their graphics software.  So if you don't have Adobe Photoshop, you may not get as much out of this book as you could.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this book...  It should appeal to a couple different types of photographers.  The person who is making the leap into digital photography can use half the book to figure out how best to take pictures.  The other person who has the camera but wants to start manipulating their pictures can use the other half to get some great digital images to show off to their friends.  And if the bug bites and you get totally wrapped up in this subject, you'll have a solid foundation on which to build...<br /><br />Nice book, extremely practical, and very easy to use...aking the leap into digital photography can use half the book to figure out how best to take pictures.

Like most readers, I have my favorite genres for recreational reading.  Murder mysteries, techno-thrillers, crime mysteries, amateur female detective/sleuth, South Florida adventure...  But every once in awhile, I like to read something that is *completely* outside my normal comfort zone.  Usually it's because someone contacts me and asks if I'd be interested in their book, and it's something I'd never find or seek out on my own.  The 2005 version of \\"out there\\" reading is Club Fascistland by Kevin Brink Nielsen.  While the lifestyle subject matter is not my thing, the writing is very creative and entertaining...<br /><br />Nielsen takes the Wizard of Oz story, complete with ruby red footwear, and adapts it to a time not too far in the future (or perhaps even now).  Tod is a down-home farmboy from Kansas (where else?) who isn't really sure of his sexual identity and wants to head off to New Zirconium City (yeah, it's New York in disguise).  His incredibly intelligent friend and pet, Otto the pig, is along for the ride.  On the way there, he picks up Fif, a tomboy savant who's been told she's a boy her entire life, and is just now finding out she's not.  Even though she has no education, she wants to become a doctor.  Then there's Sinjin, the half-human, half-cyborg mercenary who's body is giving out and he really wants a real heart to feel emotions before he dies.  Percy is a macho trucker drawn to homosexual urges but doesn't want to face that truth (and pummels his \\"love interests\\" out of guilt every time).  He just wants to come to grips with who he is.  Tod?  He just wants a home where everyone can be accepted for who they are.<br /><br />The evil witch is played by the mayor of New Zirc City, who wants to shut down all festivities and alternative deviant behavior.  She bans all pleasurable forms of recreation, and has a squad of goons to enforce the rules.  Her counterpart, Rex de Terre, is a billionaire businessman in the city and wants to have things his way instead (like to have people feel good about the city and spend money in his casino).  Tod starts catering to the underground sect, launches wild parties, and puts himself on a collision course with the mayor (Her Horror) to free the city and give people their lives back.  Throw in Madonna as the Fairy Godmother, and you've got a rather twisted ride...<br /><br />As you can probably tell, this is a book where everyone's lifestyle is acceptable and people should be free to live as they choose.  I'm not going to get into the morality of the message in the book, as I don't want this review to head down that road.  What I will comment on is the quality and creativeness of the writing.  Bottom line, Nielsen has talent.  He does an excellent job in painting pictures with his words, and the characters he creates in the book are outrageously bizarre and funny.  Since his story stays true to the original Oz fable, you pretty much know where the story is going, but you really don't have a clue as to how he's going to get there given the characters running around.

While it's not possible to guarantee compatibility in all cases, you can take solid steps to reduce the chances of painting yourself into a corner early on in the game.  From a language perspective, Hook focuses on the C/C++ language, so that's the area where you'll see the most advantage as a coder.  But the other chapters are applicable to just about any environment.  For instance, using a number of compilers set at a very strict message level helps weed out any coding practices that may work in one environment but not another.  In another case, you should carefully choose supporting software libraries (like graphic packages) based on potential portability.  A platform specific library might be easier to use, but it locks you into that environment.  Porting code can then become a complete rewrite instead of a matter of tweaking.  Very important stuff to know and take to heart...<br /><br />With the ongoing battle between Windows and open source environments, the ability to cater to both might be the difference between life and death in your business.

Want to say good-bye to your plain old telephone service with the high cost of taxes, add-on fees, and long-distance?  Check out James E. Gaskin's book Talk Is Cheap - Switching To Internet Telephones (O'Reilly).  I certainly learned quite a bit from this book...<br /><br />Contents: How Internet Telephone Calls Work; Your Internet Phone; Free Internet Phone Features That You're Paying For Now; Choosing Your Internet Phone Equipment; Vonage And Other Broadband Phone Carriers; Skype And Other Computer-centric Services; 911, Alarms, And Other Outgoing Calls; Tips, Tricks, And Techniques For Advanced Users; Go Wireless; Index<br /><br />As more and more people switch to broadband internet access, there's an emerging option for telephony services in the home.  Using your internet connection (DSL or cable), you can switch to internet telephony, also known as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and go all digital.  Gaskin does an excellent job in explaining exactly what this is, how it works, and the pros and cons of switching to a service like this.  He's a pretty strong advocate of VoIP, so you can pretty much figure out where his bias is going to lie.<br /><br />The book focuses on two major types of internet telephony: phone-centric and computer-centric.  In the phone-centric area (using your phone much like before, but only through an internet service) he uses Vonage as the primary example of what to expect.  On the computer-centric side (no telephone, just headphones and speakers attached to your computer), he uses the Skype package as the leader in that area.  In this growing technology area, it's impossible to write a book covering every option such that it won't be out of date before it's printed.  To Gaskin's credit, he does a good job in covering the current playing field, as well as giving enough detail to figure in new options as they emerge.<br /><br />Even though you can come away from a book like this thinking all is rosy, that's not quite the case.

With the recent spate of data privacy lapses, the subject of data within the organization is getting more visibility.  One book that addresses the overall role of data is Data Strategy by Sid Adelman, Larissa Moss, and Majid Abai.<br /><br />Content:  Introduction; Data Integration; Data Quality; Metadata; Data Modeling; Organizational Roles and Responsibilities; Performance; Security and Privacy of Data; DBMS Selection; Business Intelligence; Strategies for Managing Unstructured Data; Business Value of Data and ROI; ROI Calculation Process, Cost Template, and Intangible Benefits Template; Resources; Index<br /><br />The authors strike a nice balance between presenting solid information and keeping it readable.  It's easy to get so wrapped in the subject of \\"data\\" that you lose the ability to make the concepts practical and realistic for today's organization.  This book doesn't seem to fall prey to that tendency.  They also cover the whole gamut of how data needs to be handled in an organization.  A reader just starting out in IT would learn why integration is important, why data quality/consistency is paramount, and how to design a data model that can be used by multiple applications.  A person who holds the title of \\"data analyst\\" or equivalent will probably know most of this information, but it might be a good refresher in some areas (like on how to manage unstructured data).<br /><br />The only issue I have with books like this is that they ignore the element of time and demand for application development.  In every company I've worked at, there's always less time than required to do a \\"correct\\" job on the application design.  There's also far more demand for applications than there are resources.  If you're not careful, the demands of the data analysis group can paralyze an organization while they try to get everything \\"perfect\\".  Meanwhile, nothing gets built.  That's not to say that you can ignore all the information in this book.  It's just that sometimes there are trade-offs you need to make in order to get things done in the real world.<br /><br />Even with that caveat, this is still a book I'd recommend to someone asking why they have to be concerned with the enterprise view of their data...times there are trade-offs you need to make in order to get things done in the real world. <br /> <br />Even with that caveat, this is still a book I'd recommend to someone asking why they have to be concerned with the enterprise view of their data...	2005-07-24

I was recently contacted by Eric Prentis, the author of The Astute Investor, asking if I would be interested in reviewing his book.  Always open to new ideas, I gladly accepted.  Although the book could use some polish for copy editing, there's a lot of valuable information here.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />Part 1: Investing Principles and Strategies; Theory and Practice; Equity and Bond Fundamentals; Stock Market Technical Analysis; Trading Psychology; Intrinsic, Market, and Bargain Values; Interest Rate Principles; Interpreting The News; Being Contrarian; The Ten-Step Method For Investing Success<br /><br />Part 2: Retirement Planning; Discounted Capital Market Theory; Conclusion; Glossary; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />Unlike regular \\"mass market\\" investor books, The Astute Investor is not a quick read with a mindless, formulaic approach to buying stocks.  This book requires you to concentrate and pay attention to ideas and concepts.  Prentice goes into a fairly in-depth explanation of market indices, market theory, and technical analysis and charting.  In addition to explaining the overall concepts, he also goes into the hows and whys behind how those concepts drive what happens in the market today, and how you can avoid falling prey to fallacies that sound right but have underlying flaws.  The chapter on the ten-step method brings together all the previous chapters into an overall plan for picking a stock for investment purposes, and uses eBay as an example to work out the models.  Armed with this material, you'll end up with more hits than misses in your portfolio.<br /><br />The main downside to this book is the editing.  As a self-published book, there is less emphasis on stylistic consistency and readability concerns.  In addition to a few typos, the content seems to be somewhat choppy in places.  More than once, I wondered if each chapter was a stand-alone piece of work or whether it was all going to mesh into a cohesive whole later on.  While it does coalesce at the end, there's the chance that the reader might be somewhat lost at that point.  And that's really a shame, as the material is important and valuable...<br /><br />If all you want is a quick way to pick a popular stock to buy and sell, this book will likely not appeal to you.  But for the serious investor, this is information you can benefit from...While it does coalesce at the end, there's the chance that the reader might be somewhat lost at that point.

I wish I had this book available to me about three years sooner...  Spring Into Technical Writing for Engineers and Scientists by Barry J. Rosenberg.  I'd be much further ahead in my writing skills, that's for sure...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Section 1 - Planning to Write: The Quest; Audience; Documentation Plans<br /><br />Section 2 - Writing - General Principles: Words; Sentences; Paragraphs and Sections; Lists; Tables; Graphics; Professional Secrets<br /><br />Section 3 - Writing - Specific Kinds of Documents: Manuals; Web Sites; Proposals; Internal Planning Documents; Lab Reports; PowerPoint Presentations; E-Mail<br /><br />Section 4 - Editing and Producing Documents: Editing and the Documentation Process; Fonts and Typography; Punctuation; Glossary; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />The Spring Into series is designed to cover topics in one to three page chunks, short enough to quickly allow the busy professional to get what they need to know.  Rosenberg does an excellent job in this book of taking a subject that many people dread or outright hate and making it palatable and doable.  He doesn't target the professional writer or English teacher who needs to know about dangling particles and such.  This is just down to earth, practical advice.  I think that many people will get the most out of section 3 which goes into specific writing situations (reports, email, etc.).  Since that's where many people in the business world live, the example-driven nature of those chapters will pay back the time investment of the reader in short order.<br /><br />As someone who enjoys writing and has worked on it over the last couple of years, there was quite a bit that I already knew when I read the material.  The problem is that I had to pick it all up by experience.  This book would have saved me an immense amount of time in getting better (as well as saving my readers the pain of having to watch me grow).  Still, there's a lot here that I either didn't understand or have to be reminded of constantly.  Take active vs. passive voice...  I *still* can't get rid of that habit...  :-)<br /><br />If I were the manager of a group of techies who need to use the written word to communicate to users and clients, I'd spend the money to get them all a copy of this book.

I found another book that's excellent if you're into maps and software that creates them...  Mapping Hacks - Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography by Schuyler Erle, Rich Gibson, and Jo Walsh (O'Reilly).  You can have a lot of fun with this one...<br /><br />Contents:  Mapping Your Life; Mapping Your Neighborhood; Mapping Your World; Mapping (on) the Web; Mapping with Gadgets; Mapping on Your Desktop; Names and Places; Building the Geospatial Web; Mapping with Other People; Index<br /><br />What's nice about this book is that it's not all about installing some large mapping software package and then learning how to use it.  Mapping Hacks covers a wide array of mapping techniques, tricks, and hacks that can be used by anyone willing to sit down and try things out.  For instance, the first hack (#1 - Put a Map on It) shows you how to use the online mapping services and how to hack together a URL to add mapping to your website.  Ever wondered how those driving direction sites work?  Hack #2 - Route Planning Online - sheds light on that one.  They even go so far as to cater to the ultra-geek and explain how to build a car navigation system that \\"will consume all your time and money, but make you the envy of all your nerd friends\\".  Gotta love it...<br /><br />Like O'Reilly's other mapping book, this is printed in color, so you get a lot of information from the context of the figures and graphics.  Nicely done.  The book is also larger than a normal Hacks title.  There's the standard 100 entries, but there's around 525 pages to it.  You get a lot of detail on some of the more complex hacks, which in my opinion adds a lot of value to the book.<br /><br />A perfect book for those looking to get their feet wet on the subject, as well as for those who are more experienced but want to learn a few new tricks.  Very nicely done...	2005-07-23

J2EE development is often seen as highly complex, and setting up the J2EE server from various vendors is nearly as bad.  A good alternative to get running quickly is JBoss, a complete open source J2EE server which is designed to cut through all the complexity and vendor add-ons.  A quick guide to get it running and working with it is JBoss - A Developer's Notebook by Normal Richards and Sam Griffith, Jr.  (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Contents:  Installing and Running JBoss; Deploying an Application on JBoss; Creating a Complete Application; Connecting to a Real Database; Applying Security; Logging; Configuring Persistence; Managing and Monitoring JBoss; Rolling Out JBoss; Index<br /><br />The Developer's Notebook series is a quirky format using a gridlined page with scribbled font text in the margins.  You'll even find the occasional \\"water ring\\" on a page where a sweaty glass was set down.  They're also small and to the point.  It's not a step-by-step comprehensive tutorial, nor does it attempt to explain every last iota of information on the subject.  It's a series of subjects followed by paragraphs of \\"How Do I Do That?\\" and \\"What Just Happened?\\" write-ups.  This leads to a high degree of practicality and hands-on material.<br /><br />Richards and Griffith have created a book that will be immensely useful to people who have some J2EE background or have worked with other J2EE servers before.  By following the material, the reader can get the essentials necessary to start playing with JBoss in a matter of a couple of hours rather than days.  If this is your very first exposure to J2EE, you won't get a lot of handholding here.  There is the assumption of a certain level of background information.  And if you're going to be using JBoss as a production-level J2EE server for your organization (yes, you *can* do that!), you'll probably want an additional book that goes into much more depth.  But if you come in with proper expectations, it's a great resource.<br /><br />Nice format, good writing, and a lot of meat packed into a small volume.  Good job...r />Nice format, good writing, and a lot of meat packed into a small volume.  Good job...	2005-07-23

Robert Bruce Thompson & Barbara Fritchman Thompson have done a very nice job in their book Astronomy Hacks - Tips & Tools for Observing the Night Sky (O'Reilly).  If you are just starting out, the first part of the book should appeal most to you.  It gives you a solid grounding in the science of astronomy and how to find what you're looking for.  For those who have some previous experience, the second part covers the more detailed things, like how to hack your scope as well as accessories that add to your viewing success.<br /><br />Contents:  Getting Started; Observing Hacks; Scope Hacks; Accessory Hacks; Index<br /><br />I almost view this as a guide to astronomy rather than a hacks book.  If you were to buy a telescope for your child, this would be a good book to pick up as an accessory.  Hacks such as #1 - Don't Give Up, #2 - Join an Astronomy Club, and #6 - Be Prepared are perfect for getting off on the right foot.  If you know what to do early on, there's far less chance of disappointment.  Perhaps you won't end up selling the telescope a year down the road as \\"only used twice\\".<br /><br />Scope and accessory hacks are where the pros will start benefiting.  Obviously, you have to know what you're doing to benefit from hacks such as #38 - Tune Your Newtonian Reflector for Maximum Performance or #41 - Counterweight a Dobsonian Scope.  But that's the nice thing about this book.  It's not one that you read once and stash away, never to be opened again.  You'll use it over and over throughout your astronomy \\"career\\".<br /><br />Oh, and just so you're not disappointed...  There are only 65 hacks here instead of the usual 100.  Wouldn't want you to feel short-changed...  :-)<br /><br />Definitely a \\"must have\\" book if you're a star-gazer or if you have inklings to take up the hobby...	2005-07-23

His latest, Monster, isn't too bad...<br /><br />Reed and Beck Shelton are going off to the woods for a weekend of roughing it.  He's hoping this experience will give his wife Beck more self-confidence to overcome her shyness and stuttering problem.  When they arrive at the cabin, it's been completely ransacked and destroyed.  Thinking it might be bears, they camp out a short distance away, but whatever wrecked the cabin isn't gone.  Even worse, there's more than one.  The last thing Reed sees of Beck is her being carried off by some huge creature that looks like Bigfoot.  But try convincing searchers and locals of that.  The conventional wisdom is that a bear is what got Beck, but Reed and a few others are convinced that's not the case.  And as they try and hunt down the creature, there's a good chance that not all the people involved in the search are on the same team...<br /><br />Peretti is a Christian writer and novelist, and his books have an underlying spiritual theme.  For this one, it's evolution and some of the problems with mutation and adaptation.  It's not a heavy-handed sermon, so you *can* read the book just for the entertainment factor if you'd like.  The story line isn't too far \\"out there\\" if you can accept the initial premise of a family of apelike creatures adopting a human into their midst.  I enjoyed watching Beck come to grips with her situation and figure out the \\"family dynamics\\" of a species totally foreign to her.<br /><br />I definitely found it driving me towards the finish to find out how it all turned out.  Peretti will stay on my \\"should read\\" list with this book...	2005-07-23

The ability to generate maps from your data has long been something pretty much restricted to companies with deep pockets.  But Google seems to have sparked an interest in mapping software, and there are plenty of open source tools out there that will allow you to create your own Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  O'Reilly's come out with a book that will be a \\"must have\\" if this is an interest of yours... Web Mapping Illustrated by Tyler Mitchell.<br /><br />Contents: Introduction to Digital Mapping; Digital Mapping Tasks and Tools; Converting and Viewing Maps; Installing MapServer; Acquiring Map Data; Analyzing Map Data; Converting Map Data; Visualizing Mapping Data in a Desktop Program; Create and Edit Personal Map Data; Creating Static Maps; Publishing Interactive Maps on the Web; Accessing Maps Through Web Services; Managing a Spatial Database; Custom Programming with MapServer's MapScript; A Brief Introduction to Map Projections; MapServer Reference Guide for Vector Data Access; Index<br /><br />There are a number of things I like about this book.  For one, he shows how you can build systems that rival expensive GIS packages using ordinary open source software.  His main focus is on MapServer, along with any other software out there that fills any necessary gaps.  Using this book, you should be able to get MapServer up and running in your environment.  The next thing that's good is that you can start to gain the understanding of the terminology of mapping technology.  Above the normal techno-babble needed in order to work with any software system, mapping systems have their own jargon.  Web Mapping Illustrated helps to educate you on that jargon within the context of working with the software.  Finally, a departure from the normal O'Reilly \\"animal cover\\" books...  This one's in color!  Printing this in black and white would have ended up losing a lot of meaning and information in the examples.  Seeing a hi-res full-color map of the Okanagan Mountain Park fire of a few years back really grabs your attention and makes you realize just what level of power you have available to you...<br /><br />Even if you're using a commercial GIS in your job, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this book and expand your horizons a bit.

Learning to use Microsoft Project is one of those things I know I *should* know but don't.  Project 2003 Personal Trainer by CustomGuide has now become the latest \\"just in case\\" addition to my bookshelf at work...<br /><br />Content: The Fundamentals; Entering the Task List; Entering and Assigning Resources; Viewing the Project; Working with Tasks; Working with Resources; Working with Costs; Balancing the Project; Updating Project Progress; Checking Project Progress; Working with Reports; Working with Multiple Projects; Index<br /><br />As a software developer, I work on a number of projects.  But fortunately, the type of development I do is normally not such that it requires the overhead of having to use Project to plan it out.  And if it does, I've been lucky to have a project manager to handle all that.  I know at some point my luck will run out, however.  Project 2003 Personal Trainer is a practical, example-/exercise-driven approach to learning the basics of the software.  The philosophy behind CustomGuide is \\"I listen, I forget; I see, I recall; I do, I understand\\".  Therefore, the entire book is set up to have you actually *do* stuff with Project in order to understand how it works and to learn how to make it go where you want.  There's a CD included that is a Project 2003 simulator, so you can still learn the software even if you haven't plunked down a check to Microsoft for Project.  This is really nice, in that it gives you maximum flexibility on where you can set up your learning environment regardless of software licensing issues.  I can't think of too many better ways to get up to speed more quickly than with this material.<br /><br />Don't expect that this book will be a long-term reference volume, though.  If you are a full-time project manager who is going to live in Project, this book will get you moving quickly.  But if you want to learn the fine intricacies of a Gantt chart, you'll need to look elsewhere.  That's not to say that this book falls down in that area.  It's just not meant to be the end-all repository of all things Project.  Get this book, get your feet wet, develop some basic competency, and then decide if you need to go deeper.<br /><br />I'll be keeping this book on my work bookshelf and watching it closely to make sure it doesn't disappear...lls down in that area.

And since we're now in the 3rd week of the Tour de France, I figured it was about time to finish up Tour de France For Dummies by Phil Liggett, James Raia, and Sammarye Lewis.  And yes, I learned quite a bit.<br /><br />Content:<br /><br />Part 1 - A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other: Answering All Your Tour Questions; Understanding the Tour de France Race Routes; The Races within the Race<br /><br />Part 2 - How the Race Is Run and Won: It's All about the Team; More Tour Rules Than You Ever Wanted to Know; Understanding Race Strategies<br /><br />Part 3 - Loving the Ride - A Man and His Bike: Who Are These Guys and How Do They Do It?; Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider; Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch<br /><br />Part 4 - Watching the Race: Perfecting the Art of Spectating from Home; Going to the Tour - A Brief Guide<br /><br />Part 5 - The Part of Tens: Ten Greatest Riders in Tour History; The Ten Most Important Tours in History; Ten Unique Tour de France Statistics; Ten Dramatic Tour de France Moments; Ten Great Tour Climbs and Mountaintops; Ten Other Important Races; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Let's set expectations...  I ride a bike maybe a couple times a year, and strictly for recreation.  Like many other Americans, I became interested in the sport and the Tour through Lance Armstrong's story.  I'd like to think I'm moderately educated on how the Tour works, the different jerseys, a bit of the strategy, and so forth.  But when it comes to understanding how riders are picked, the logistics for running the team for three weeks, and how the team cars work, I'm lost.  This book really helped clear that up.  In a very understandable and readable format, Liggett, Raia, and Lewis take you from the very basics (like jersey colors) through tactics and history.  At worst, you'll come away knowing about the peleton and the maillot jaune.  But in all likelihood, you'll finish with a much greater and deeper appreciation for what these supreme athletes go through to just finish the Tour, much less compete to win.  It's rather awe-inspiring...<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the book is fairly minor, but it really started to get on my nerves after awhile.  The editing of the book is a bit uneven.  I don't know if it's due to trying to blend three authors into a single volume or if it was a rush job to get it out before the event.  For instance, if a new French word is introduced, like musette (feedbag), I don't need the word musette (feedbag) explained to me every time it occurs.  The first time I learn about the domestique going back to get musettes (feedbags) for everyone on the team, that's fine.  After that, I should probably know what musette (feedbag) means.  Let it go!  Same thing with the Discovery Team (formerly the US Postal Service Team).  I can make that translation myself after the first five times.  And if you say US Postal Service Team (now the Discovery Team), I'm guessing I could have figured that out.<br /><br />So, if you're still a bit confused about all the hoopla during three weeks in July, this book will definitely clear it up for you.  If you're an experienced rider, you may still pick up a few factoids you didn't know....  A good read.se supreme athletes go through to just finish the Tour, much less compete to win.

If you've had your eyes opened to the power of Knoppix as a Swiss Army knife of administration tools, Rankin's latest book will be the quick reminder guide of how best to use it...  Knoppix Pocket Reference.<br /><br />Contents:  Introduction; Cheat Codes; Special Knoppix Tools; Install Knoppix to the Hard Drive; Image or Erase a Drive; Linux Security Response; Linux System Repair; Windows System Repair; Remaster Knoppix; Experimental Features; Final Words; Acknowledgements; Index<br /><br />Pocket references are small (this one is less than 100 pages), so they are not good introductory guides to the subject at hand.  This one is no different.  If you're simply playing with Knoppix in order to see what desktop Linux is all about, you can easily pass on this book.  You'll get a bit more out of it if you're looking to run Knoppix a bit more regularly (by installing it on your hard drive or saving configurations between reboots).  Still, Knoppix Hacks would probably be a better title to better understand those techniques.  Where this book shines is when you decide to use Knoppix as a bootable OS to allow you to administer and repair systems that are no longer working correctly (both Linux *and* Windows).  Since you don't have to have a bootable sector on your hard drive to use it, you can get Knoppix up and running from a CD and then use it to repair the underlying hard drive.  If you have a virus or rootkit installed, a Knoppix boot will allow you to get a clean system up and running which can then check out the hard drive for repair.  Knoppix Pocket Reference will help remind you of the steps you need to take to accomplish some of these tasks.  You're only getting the core commands with very little fluff, so you can quickly hone in on the trouble spot.<br /><br />This is the book I'd recommend as a follow-up purchase to Knoppix Hacks.  If you decide to use Knoppix in the ways that the Hacks book reveals, Knoppix Pocket Guide will be the volume that you refer to until the commands are burned into your memory.until the commands are burned into your memory.	2005-07-19

S. Seawolf by Patrick Robinson.  Not terribly bad if you're into submarine warfare novels...<br /><br />China's doing some major saber-rattling with Taiwan, and the U. S. decides to send over their best sub to do a little research on a new sub the Chinese are getting ready to launch.  They are supposed to avoid detection at all costs, but unfortunately that doesn't happen.  They venture too close to a Chinese destroyer that has deployed a towed sonar array, and the wire gets wrapped in the propellers.  The sub and crew are captured and taken into custody, and the plan is to get as much info out of them before they are killed.  But since one of the officers is the son of the President, all stops need to be pulled out in order to mount a rescue and destroy the sub before the Chinese can fully study the technology.  In comes the Navy Seals, and a daring rescue is mounted.  Typical long odds, death-defying mission that, of course, succeeds...<br /><br />I didn't think it was a bad read for a summer afternoon.  If you're into these types of novels, you've read the plotline a thousand times before.  If you want to finely dissect the story and poke holes in it, then it can fall apart in a number of locations.  But if you just want to suspend reality for a short while, you can find it here.	2005-07-18

He routinely is hired by companies to do threat assessment on their systems and locations, and unfortunately he is often successful with far too little effort.  These assessments could be just a simulated attack to gain access to secured locations and systems that could then be compromised, clear up to security of nuclear facility information and terrorist attacks on fueling facilities at airports.  It's that last one that is scary, in that it was done in a post-9/11 environment, and went off without a hitch.  We're just not in the \\"security mindset\\" in most cases.<br /><br />But rather than just go on about how easy it is to hack and crack systems, he also offers plenty of advice on how best to build a security program that is effective (both from a cost and result perspective).  Each of the case studies ends with a summary that shows how something like this could happen, as well as what vulnerabilities were found and exploited.  That piece by itself would be worth the cost of the book.  But the final two chapters are where you'll benefit most.  Winkler covers a multitude of counter-measures (personnel, physical, operational, technical) that can be implemented in order to have a more secure environment.  The final chapter then explains how to implement a comprehensive program based on the value of your information and the amount of risk present.  Rather than just saying \\"do this, this, and this\\", you get a customized approach based on your own unique situation.  Really good stuff...<br /><br />As he states early on in the book, there's no way to be 100% safe and secure.  But you can do far more than \\"hope for the best\\".

Another book I took on vacation for relaxation was Rain Storm by Barry Eisler.  Now *this* was a fun read...<br /><br />John Rain is a paid assassin who does work for organizations like the CIA.  But he does have a moral code and principles by which he operates, so he's not into killing for killing's sake.  In this novel, Rain is hired to make a middle eastern arms dealer appear to die of \\"natural causes\\".  Everything is going relatively well with the assignment until he discovers that the woman with the dealer is also apparently an agent who is after something.  When they finally end up coming face-to-face during an abortive attempt to kill the dealer, he decides to pull back in order to figure out who she is, who she works for, and how important it might be for him to work with her in order to get close to the target.  But she's not terribly forthcoming with the entire story on her side, so Rain isn't quite sure who to believe and what to do.  Things get much more interesting when an assassination team shows up at his location with the express purpose of doing *him* in.  So now he has to determine if she is trying to get rid of him, or if there's another layer of organization that considers him a \\"loose end\\" that must be tied up.<br /><br />This was one of those novels where you know that no one is completely who they seem to be, and double- and triple-crosses could happen at any moment.  Rain is a likable character, and it's easy to start empathizing with him as he attempts to do his job and figure out who he can trust (and who he can't).  The only reason I can't give this a five-star rating is that there is a considerable plot thread that harkens back to an earlier installment of the series.  While it is possible to just read through it and go with the flow, you can't help but think there is an element of color or depth that you're just not getting.<br /><br />This book is really a good read, and I recommend it.  But if you have the opportunity, read the 1st and 2nd books in the series.  I think it will allow you to follow this story much more deeply than I did...e 1st and 2nd books in the series.

If you use eBay (as a buyer or seller), this is the \\"user's manual\\" or best practices guide that should be part of your signup...  eBay Hacks by David A. Karp.<br /><br />Contents: Diplomacy and Feedback; Searching; Bidding; Selling; Working with Photos; Completing Transactions; Running a Business on eBay; The eBay API; Index<br /><br />Most Hacks titles consist of 100 tips and tricks related to the subject matter being discussed.  In eBay Hacks, you get an extra 25 for your money.  What a deal!  :-)  Regardless of whether you're a complete newbie to eBay or you actually run an eBay storefront, you'll find things in here that will save you time and money on a regular basis.  Reading the chapter and hacks on feedback, I learned that there are ways to prevent negative feedback even after it's been given.  Since so much of who you are on eBay relates directly back to your feedback rating, this can be a critical factor in getting buyers to trust you (or others to sell to you).  The chapter on bidding went into the act of \\"sniping\\", or bidding at the last second, so that you can stand a much better chance of not being overbid at the last second.  I didn't realize there are third-party services that will do this for you automatically.  No wonder I've lost some things I really thought I had nailed.  Karp even goes into how best to compose photos that will draw people to your auction rather than send them away for something that looks more appealing.<br /><br />Obviously, you can use eBay without this book and information.  I'm sure you'll do fine.  But the first time you find an auction miscategorized (because you were looking for that condition) and you launch a bidding strategy that gets you the deal of a lifetime for next to nothing, you'll wonder why you waited so long.

In the midst of an emotional crisis that was preventing me from sleeping, I decided to pick up Dean Koontz's latest novel Velocity that I recently picked up from the library.  Less than 24 hours later, I was done with the book.  This is Koontz at his best...<br /><br />Billy Wiles is a bartender just living a normal life.  Everything changes when he goes to his car one night after work and finds a note.  The author of the note says he will kill one type of person if he takes the note to the police, or he'll kill another type of person if Wiles chooses to do nothing.  He's relatively convinced that this is some sort of joke, until the first murder occurs.  The notes keep coming, and Wiles has to either solve the mystery of who's doing the killings, or make unwilling choices as to who lives and who dies.  Complicating the entire quest is how the killer has made the killings appear to be something done by Wiles himself.  So he can't go to the police, and the killer seems to be one step ahead of him at all times.  The final showdown involves whether Wiles can preserve the life of his comatose fiancee and not die in the process...<br /><br />Koontz has evolved so much as a writer over the years.  His early works (often done under pen names) were heavy on the supernatural and bizarre.  While I liked the books, I wouldn't recommend his stuff unless I knew the reading habits of the person who was getting the opinion.  The edgy work has mellowed, and many of the novels in the last three or four years have been more mainstream and entertaining.  Even so, his stories sometimes seemed to be a vehicle for showing how creatively he could turn a phrase.  Velocity puts all that to rest.  The story-line is compelling and doesn't let up much.  While you start to think you know \\"who dun it\\", some whipsaw plot twists towards the end keep you entirely off balance.<br /><br />I could easily view this as the best Koontz novel I've read (and I've read them all).  Many of my favorite authors seem to lose their appeal and edge over time.  Koontz is doing just the opposite... getting better with age.te authors seem to lose their appeal and edge over time.

Google's AdSense program has allowed anyone to make money from their website.  Eric Giguere attempts to explain how this is done in the book Make Easy Money with Google : Using the AdSense Advertising Program.<br /><br />Content:  Making Money with Google; Understanding AdSense; Finding Something to Say; Getting Ready to Say It; Designing Your Site; Building Your Site; Becoming an AdSense Publisher; Publishing Ads on Your Site; Making Money from Your Site; Expanding Your Horizons; Index<br /><br />This is one of those books that I have a hard time figuring out how to rate.  On the positive side, Giguere does a good job showing what the AdSense program is, how it works, and how to get set up with it.  There is also quite a bit of material on how advertising works, as well as how companies can \\"bid\\" on keywords to make sure their ads show up more frequently when certain content is displayed.  The whole book is done as a conversation between the author and a couple of people who are asking him how to make money on the web.  If you have a website and want to learn about the AdSense program, this part of the book will appeal to you.<br /><br />The problem I have with the book is focus.  In my opinion, far too much of the book is spent on explaining web sites, domains, and how to go about creating a website.  The people I know who have started using AdSense to pick up a few dollars from their site *already have a site*!  I don't need an explanation about domains, choosing a site name, and instructions on how to build a page.  Been there, done that a *long, long* time ago.  The only way I could recommend this book in its entirety would be if someone was looking for a money-making opportunity, and didn't know squat about websites.  And if that's the case, focusing on building a website merely to support your AdSense efforts seems a very tall order...<br /><br />Nice styling, easy to read, and good information about the AdSense program.  Unfortunately, well over half the book was off-target in my opinion...  Caveat emptor...the book was off-target in my opinion...  Caveat emptor...	2005-07-11

One of the benefits to being an active reviewer is that you occasionally get sneak previews of books that are not yet published.  Prentice Hall sent me a draft manuscript copy of Peter van der Linden's Guide to Linux due to be published in August.  While good for all Linux distros, it will be especially valuable if you're focusing on Linspire.<br /><br />Contents: Hello Linux; Running the Linux Live CD; The KDE Desktop; Onto the Net; All About Email; Web Tools; Adding Software; More Applications; Filesystems and Optical Storage (CDs and DVDs); Sharing On Your Local Network; Keeping Your Data Private; Installation and Boot; Malicious Windows Software; Making Your Hardware Obey You - BIOS and Device Drivers; Sample Output from WiFi Network Commands; Commands for the Command Line; Disk Basics and Partitioning; Troubleshooting With Strance<br /><br />Since Peter has focused on Linspire, the target audience is going to be Window users who want to switch over to Linux without becoming a geek.  I think he hits that target dead on.  The style of the book is extremely readable.  There's plenty of content that Joe Average will be able to read and understand, and as a result will be able to start using the Linux desktop quite effectively.  Jane Power User will also benefit, as there is also material that gets into more difficult concepts like file sharing using packages such as Samba.  Even if Joe isn't ready for that on day one (Joe just wants to surf the 'net and read email), he'll be able to refer back to the book on numerous occasions to push his limits.<br /><br />When the book is published, there will be a bootable Linspire CD included that will allow you to try out Linspire without making any changes to your current hardware.  Bootable CDs like Knoppix bring up a Linux environment that runs completely from memory without making physical changes to your hard drive.  If you think that Linspire is a distro that you'd like to use, getting this book will be the logical first step in your evaluation process.  You'll learn if your system can run Linspire, and then you can experiment with the desktop GUI before making your final commitment.<br /><br />Very well done work, and I'm looking forward to the final version of the book.  This will be a nice addition to the world of Linux books, and it will be a highly recommended purchase if you're going with Linspire.process.

Last night I finished an interesting book on software project management...  The Software Development Edge by Joe Marasco.  It's a series of essays that cover the gamut of \\"herding cats\\"...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - General Management: Beginning at the Beginning; Computational Roots; Mountaineering; Managing<br /><br />Part 2 - Software Differences: The Most Important Thing; Modeling; Coding; Getting It Out the Door<br /><br />Part 3 - The Project-Management View: Trade-offs; Estimating; Scheduling; Rhythm<br /><br />Part 4 - Human Element: Politics; Negotiating; Signing Up; Compensation<br /><br />Part 5 - Thinking Laterally: History Lesson; Bad Analogies; The Refresh Problem; Not So Random Numbers<br /><br />Part 6 - Advanced Topics: Crisis; Growth; Culture; Putting It All Together; Acknowledgements; Index<br /><br />Unlike many project management books, this is not a \\"how to\\" or a methodology volume.  It's a series of essays from someone who's been in the trenches for far longer than many have been coding, and he's sharing his wisdom and insights with the reader.  So if you're hoping to get a new set of steps to follow, you'll be sadly disappointed.  You need to go into this book with an open mind, and look for a few nuggets of truth that will reinforce a point or open you up to a new way of thinking about an aspect of your job.  For me, I found the chapter on Crisis (equating troubled projects with a five day old dead fish) and the chapter on History Lessons (comparing software development to a 350 year old ship that sank) quite insightful.  Truth may not always be in the place you expect it...<br /><br />I can't say that every chapter held my interest.  In Growth, Marasco talks about how the growth of resources on a software project can be projected and managed (and how it gets out of control if you're not careful).  Supplemented by a whole lot of statistics and graphs, I quickly got lost and disinterested.  That's not to say that the material isn't correct or helpful, just that some of it is more readable than other parts...<br /><br />Definitely worth reading if you're responsible for project management in your current position.  It won't be a book you refer to every day on your job, but it will cause you to think about some aspects of your career in a different light...just that some of it is more readable than other parts... <br /> <br />Definitely worth reading if you're responsible for project management in your current position.

Since I've started my weight loss program, I decided to get around to reading a book my boss was reading at work...  From Chunk To Hunk - Diary Of A Fat Man by Fred Anderson.  While I can tell some people will hate this book, I absolutely loved it...<br /><br />Anderson was a *very* overweight 371 pound guy who found his \\"pain point\\" after watching a TV show about a leg amputation.  The amputee was in the emergency room with a very gross leg due to diabetes complications, and they ended up removing it.  Anderson saw that (he was diabetic also) and could tell that was not far away from his future unless he did something different.  He ditched the Little Debbie snack cake he was munching on, and set out on his quest to drop below 200 pounds.  Instead of finding some faddish diet or starving himself, he started eating nutritious food in portions that were \\"normal\\" for what a person should eat (not what *his* concept of normal was).  He also started moving around and becoming more active.  Between reduced calories and increased activities, he was able to change his whole mental image of who he was, how he related to food, and in the end dropped all the weight he was looking to lose.<br /><br />Other than the fact that I loved reading his writing style, I also appreciated the insight of weight loss from a guy's perspective.  There are no weight loss success books out there by women who will talk about the very real subject of \\"man boobs\\"...  what weight loss can do for your love life...  along with the hysterical episode of purchasing a girdle after his skin removal surgery...  Great stuff!<br /><br />Some people won't like this book as it's not a cookie cutter \\"program\\" that tells you what to eat, when to eat it, and guarantees success.  Most American weight loss programs treat symptoms and not the underlying condition and mindset that got you into the situation in the first place.  And once you're off the program, the weight comes back.  Anderson's approach is perhaps the only true way to have permanent weight loss with no drastic risks...  Move more, eat less, and understand your relationship with food...<br /><br />If you're a guy trying to lose weight, I'd highly recommend this book.  Even though you may be following a different plan (like I'm following Jenny Craig), the mental aspects of what happens are still the same...rhaps the only true way to have permanent weight loss with no drastic risks...

Since my last attempt to get a book to learn about AspectJ wasn't very productive, I decided to try again with Eclipse AspectJ: Aspect-Oriented Programming with AspectJ and the Eclipse AspectJ Development Tools by Adrian Colyer, Andy Clement, George Harley, and Matthew Webster.  *Much*, much better...<br /><br />Content:<br /><br />Part 1 - Introducing Eclipse, AspectJ, and AJDT: Getting Started; First Steps in AJDT; Extending The Application; More AJDT<br /><br />Part 2 - The AspectJ Language: An Overview Of AspectJ; Straight To The Point; Take My Advice; Inter-Type Declarations; Aspects; Using The AspectJ API<br /><br />Part 3 - Putting It All Together: Adopting AspectJ; Advanced AJDT; Aspect-Oriented Design; Command-Line AspectJ; AspectJ Language Quick Reference; Next Steps; AJDT Icons Reference; Index<br /><br />To give you an idea of how much better I liked this book...  I learned more in the preface than I knew after going through the other book I reviewed.  :-)<br /><br />There's a lot to like about how this book is done.  Part 2 - the coverage of the actual language - is more than adequate to give you the reference material you need in order to learn the language.  With each concept like pointcuts and advice, you get a tutorial of the feature, examples of how it actually works, as well as reference material for the methods and properties it uses.  There's probably enough here to get you quite far down the learning path.  But coupled with parts 1 & 3, it's more than enough to get you fully competent in the language.  Part 1 gives you plenty of knowledge and grounding in how to use Eclipse to start coding an AspectJ application.  They have a nice example of an insurance application that helps bring the theory into practice.  Part 3 was a nice touch, too.  Since AspectJ is designed to work *with* your object-oriented applications, this section helps you plan out how you can actually start applying the new skills in your environment.  Since aspect-oriented programming (AOP) hasn't yet achieved any critical mass, there's little chance you'll be able to apply it in an all-out fashion.  But using the material in part 3, you'll be able to plan out some pilots and situations where you can get your feet wet.  Very cool...<br /><br />Even as a way to get a high-level understanding of AOP, this book works very well.  To take the next step from high-level understanding to competency, you'll have everything you need right here.  I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone wanting to delve into this area...OP) hasn't yet achieved any critical mass, there's little chance you'll be able to apply it in an all-out fashion.

After hearing all the hype behind the movie Cinderella Man, I decided to get a non-Hollywood version of the story.  The book that fulfills that need is Jeremy Schaap's Cinderella Man - James J. Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History.  This is an incredible story of perseverance and determination...<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the story, it basically takes place during the years of the Great Depression.  Braddock grew up in an environment where fighting and sparring was second nature.  Once he figured out that boxing was something he could excel in, he started to fight for money.  Keep in mind that boxing back in the 20's and 30's was *the* sport of the people.  Crowds of 60 and 70 thousand to watch matches was not uncommon.  A champion in the sport was treated as the king of the world.  Braddock was well on his way to climbing that peak until he broke his powerful right hand.  It never got a chance to heal properly, and his sole weapon started to become ineffective.  After losing a number of fights against boxers he should have dominated, he decided he had had enough and quit.  Unfortunately, the depression robbed him of any savings he had earned during his career and he had no other skills to fall back on.  He finally ended up on the relief program and was working at whatever job he could find on a daily basis down on the docks.<br /><br />Contrast that with Max Baer.  Baer was a highly skilled boxer with looks and personality.  His career was somewhat rocky at first, but then he started a four year winning streak that made him one of the most well-known personalities in the world.  But for him, boxing was simply the means by which he could have fine food, wine, and all the women he wanted.  Even though his training was half-hearted at best, he was still able to dominate the heavyweight ranks.<br /><br />The stories start to converge in 1934.  Baer is the world champion, and Braddock is working on the docks.  But all that hard work has led to a leaner, more fit Braddock.  His right hand has healed, and his left, always a non-factor, is now as strong as his right.  He is signed to fight on two days notice against someone who needs a \\"name\\" fighter to go against but who won't beat him.  Braddock surprises everyone by dominating him.  After two more fights where he wins in impressive fashion, circumstances align to place him against Baer for the heavyweight championship of the world.  Baer sees this as nothing more than other victim of his boxing prowess, while Braddock sees this as the culmination of everything he's worked for his entire life.  As the bout gets closer, Baer starts to sense that perhaps he's underestimated Braddock.  In the ring, Braddock takes everything Baer can throw at him but is still able to box and dominate the champion.  At the end, he's declared the winner by unanimous decision and caps the most unlikely upset in boxing history.<br /><br />Schaap does a great job painting the story in relation to how society functioned back in the 20's and 30's.  It's hard to imagine today how much prestige boxing champions had, as the sport has lost a lot of its popularity.  But back then, Braddock's \\"Rocky\\"-like story captivated the nation and gave the common man, struggling to make ends meet, a symbol of hope.  If this were nothing more than a Hollywood story, it'd be a good one.  The fact that it is a factual recreation of real events makes it even more inspiring.

With Eclipse becoming extremely popular as an integrated development environment, there have been a number of books published to help you learn the tool.  I recently received a copy of Eclipse Distilled by David Carlson, and it's a pretty good addition to the collection...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting Started: A Java IDE and So Much More!; Hello Eclipse; Managing Your Projects; Customizing Your Workbench; Rapid Development; Java Project Configuration; Debugging Your Code<br /><br />Part 2 - Getting Agile: Characteristics of Agile Development; Updating the Eclipse IDE; Continuous Testing with JUnit; Refactoring Your Code; Continuous Integration with Ant; Team Ownership with CVS; Coding Standards; Index<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that covers a large number of the features of the Eclipse IDE, this book will be a good choice.  In addition to covering all the technical details for installation, options, and \\"how to\\" things like refactoring, the author also covers how Eclipse works with various other common programming tools like JUnit and CVS.  It's not a definitive guide on these other software packages, but you'll get a good grounding on how they integrate.<br /><br />What this book *isn't* is a tutorial guide to learning Eclipse.  There are a number of Eclipse books that will walk you through a number of examples of how the package works and how to write code with it.  This book really doesn't do that.  You'll find out a lot about all the different options, but it's not like a \\"step 1, step 2, step 3\\" presentation.  I really don't consider this a detriment to the book.  If I wanted a tutorial, I could find one.  But if I want a book that shows me all the mechanics and let's me figure out how to apply them to my needs, the \\"Distilled\\" approach works great.<br /><br />I like the book, but I can see how some people might not be enamored with the lack of sample code.  If you're going in with your eyes open, you should be fine...	2005-07-04

There's obviously no lack of books to help you learn Linux.  One of the latest entries into the arena is Spring Into Linux by Janet Valade.  If your goal is to get up and running quickly, this book will help...<br /><br />Contents:  Understanding Open Source Software; Choosing a Linux Distribution; Getting Ready to Install Linux; Installation; Interacting with Linux; Using Your Desktop; Using the Command Line; Linux Accounts; File Management; Applications and Programs; Word Processing; Spreadsheets; Graphics; Printing; The Internet; Multimedia; Email, Messaging, and News; Editing Text Files; Shell Scripts; Regular Expressions; Command Reference; Index<br /><br />As with most successful books, this one has a particular style that helps to maintain the focus on quickly getting up to speed.  Each chapter consists of \\"chunks\\", which are one to two pages of material covering a specific topic or skill.  Each chunk starts at the top of the page, so it's pretty easy to find what you're looking for.  Also, the chunk titles are also listed in the table of contents, so finding the topic for reference purposes is pretty easy.  Due to the space constraints for each topic, there is a higher ratio of text to pictures than you'll find in a lot of other books.  So if you want a lot of step-by-step pictures, you might not do too well here...<br /><br />The distribution coverage, while not exhaustively complete, does hit many of the major ones...  Fedora, Mandrake, and SuSE.  Again, this will not give you a complete reference to absolutely every option in your distribution of choice, but that's not the purpose of this book.  It's enough to get you up and running.  From there you can learn more of the details over time.  There's a good mix of command line to desktop GUI material here, so you should learn enough in the way of skills to allow you to switch back and forth when necessary.  And in addition to the OS material, Valade also covers some of the more significant desktop applications that are needed by nearly every computer user.  Applications such as OpenOffice and GIMP will allow you to be as productive on the Linux desktop as you are in a Windows environment.<br /><br />For the right audience, this is a book I'd definitely recommend.

Maran Illustrated Guitar.<br /><br />Content:  Guitar Basics; Getting Ready To Play; Reading Music; Playing Basic Chords; Playing Barre Chords And Power Chords; Playing Single Notes; Articulation Techniques; Playing Rock Guitar; Playing The Blues; Playing Folk And Country Music; Playing Classical Guitar; Buying A Guitar; Guitar Accessories; Guitar Care And Maintenance; Home Recording; Quick Reference; Index<br /><br />As with all other Maran Illustrated books, they've done an excellent job combining clear photos and instructive illustrations to guide you during the learning process.  They even use multiple exposure photos with \\"ghosting\\" to show fingering sequences so that you can tell what movement should be combined with finger positioning.  Very nicely done.  In addition to just showing you how to play, they also cover the history of guitars and the masters of the instrument.  It ends up giving you an appreciation for the instrument that you don't normally see in a \\"how to play\\" book.  I like how they go beyond mere mechanics to show you how to care for your instrument, from stringing to cleaning to transportation.  Basically, this covers the entire spectrum of the subject.<br /><br />I've often wanted to learn to play the guitar.  My wife plays and one of my sons play.  I can't say that I have a lot of time to learn it right now, but at least I now have the main tool I need to help me get there when I'm ready.  Excellent book, and highly recommended if you want to learn to play...	2005-07-03

Dale Brown's latest novel, Act of War, makes for a decent, entertaining read...<br /><br />After a nuclear backpack bomb blows up a major oil refinery in Texas, the United States goes on a major offensive against terrorism.  Part of the change includes the formation of a new force to battle terrorists using unconventional tactics and weaponry.  This includes a new exoskeleton cyborg machine that gives it's human wearer incredible strength and abilities.  The designer of the weapon wants to start running off to other areas and countries to track down the people who launched the nuclear attack.  But they are getting a lot of resistance to doing their job, and it seems to be coming from the highest levels of the White House.  The question is whether there's a mole advising the president, and if so, will this new force be able to gain enough approval to actually prevent a second attack...<br /><br />Contrary to some of the other feedback on Amazon, I enjoyed this book.  It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good.  It takes quite a bit of time to figure out who might be pulling the strings and setting the group up for failure, and everyone is a potential suspect.  The cyborg technology was interesting, and while improbable, does give one a chance to imagine \\"what if\\".  I think what was best about the book is that it shows how easy it would be to launch devastating attacks against America, and how difficult it would be from a logistical standpoint to prevent it.	2005-07-02

Eleven On Top by Janet Evanovich.  This may be one of my favorites of the series...<br /><br />Stephanie Plum has decided to quit the bounty hunting business.  Her life isn't going anywhere, and she's decided to get a steady job with a regular paycheck.  Of course, not having anyone shoot at her or blow up her car would be nice too.  But of course, nothing is normal or steady when it comes to Ms. Plum's life.  She gets fired on day one from the button factory.  She gets fired from the dry cleaning job after a couple of days (and when the matriarch of the owner's family dies when Plum's car blows up).  And her job in the fast food business ends after a day when the chicken restaurant she works at burns down after a couple of days.  So why all the pyrotechnics?  Someone's apparently out to settle an old score, and Stephanie's life seems to be in peril.  Threatening notes, exploding car bombs, exploding garages, burning restaurants, and she's not even in the business any more.  Add into the mix that she's now working for Ranger at the same time she's trying to nurse Morelli back to health from a broken leg...<br /><br />As I said above, this may be one of my favorites in the Stephanie Plum series.  I enjoyed the interaction between her and Lula as Lula tries to take over her old job (and still get Stephanie to help with all the apprehensions).  There's a bit more Ranger time as you learn more about his business, as well as wondering whether Stephanie will succumb to her urges to jump his bones.  And her gramma is as zany as ever.  Even though you think you know how the story is shaping up, there are still plenty of twists that accelerate at the end, making sure that I stayed up later than I wanted to find out how it all ended.<br /><br />A good, fun read, and another excellent installment in the series...	2005-06-29

I just finished a book that covers a way of doing business that should be obvious but isn't...  Score! A Better Way To Do Business by Thomas T. Stallkamp.<br /><br />Contents: Breaking the Mold; Adversarial Commerce and Why It's Wrong; Ending Adversarial Commerce; Where in the World Is Adversarial Commerce?; Information Is Power and Sharing Doesn't Come Naturally; The Collaborative Approach; The Extended Enterprise Concept; Collaboration Doesn't Mean \\"Soft\\"; Implementation Steps; The Conversion Experience; Breaking the Mold: Moving to Collaboration; Appendix; Index<br /><br />The subtitle of this book is \\"Moving From Conflict To Collaboration\\", and it pretty much sums up the gist of this book.  Stallkamp was the president of Chrysler during some of the most difficult times of the company.  The automotive industry was struggling with the depressed economy, and the general answer was to implement draconian measures to extract costs from their suppliers.  But rather than follow the same path as everyone else, Chrysler decided to implement a program called Score.  The program was designed to partner with suppliers and use their improvement suggestions as a way to extract costs out of the system.  And rather than keep all the profits themselves, the suppliers were able to share in those profits, thereby benefitting both parties.  While the initial reaction was one of distrust, Chrysler quickly proved they were serious and soon the savings were topping $1 billion.  Stallkamp takes the reader through the thought processes of the company during that time, how the program was implemented, and the type of corporate mindset necessary to make it all work.  He also talks about how the merger with Daimler caused the program to pretty much die out since it was so contrary to the German way of doing business.<br /><br />This isn't a \\"do this, fill out this form, and you're set\\" book.  It deals more with concepts and ideas that you can apply to your own organization.  There does seem to be a bit of repetitiveness in the material, but when you're done you have a pretty good idea as to why collaboration beats conflict.  While not an easy path due to resistance from years of doing it \\"the other way\\", it's a way well worth traveling...es seem to be a bit of repetitiveness in the material, but when you're done you have a pretty good idea as to why collaboration beats conflict.

Digital cameras and powerful software tools have made panoramic photography much easier than it's been in the past.  If you want to see real state-of-the-art panoramic work, you'll like Assembling Panoramic Photos - A Designer's Notebook published by O'Reilly.<br /><br />Contents: Studio 01 - Waterfalls of Ice - Bertrand Bodin; Studio 02 - At the Restaurant - Arnaud Frich; Studio 03 - Frenzy at Almanarre Beach - Albert Lemoine; Studio 04 - The Workshop - Christophe Noel; Studio 05 - Urban Sphere - Sacha Popovic; Studio 06 - On the Boulevards - Peet Simard; Studio 07 - The Phare des Baleines Lighthouse - Laurent Thion; Studio 08 - Venice - The Orseolo Basin - Gilles Vidal<br /><br />This book was translated from French by William Rodarmor, and all of the photographers hail from France.  The general format of the book takes a particular panoramic photo from the person who created the picture, and then goes into detail about how it was done.  This goes everywhere from the thoughts behind the composition, the equipment used to take the raw material, the software used to retouch and stitch the different pictures, and how certain difficulties had to be overcome.  There are a number of different types of panoramas, going from traditional wide-angle content to a circular composition wrapped around a point on a sidewalk.  This book will serve as both a source of inspiration and a catalog of techniques.<br /><br />You'll get the most out of this book if you are intermediate to advanced in both digital photography and Photoshop.  A number of stitching programs are used in the images, so you'll learn why some people prefer one over the other.  If you're just Joe Schmoe with a digital camera and a stitching program, you'll probably be a little lost here.  These photographers are professionals, and the results they produce are professional.  They understand the tools of their trade very well, and it's that knowledge that allows them to get these types of results.  So don't feel bad if the book is a little beyond you when you first start reading.  But if you're willing to work at it and try out some of the techniques shown here, you'll soon be showing off some interesting results.feel bad if the book is a little beyond you when you first start reading.

A favorite fictional character of mine is Stone Barrington, the main character in Stewart Woods' latest Barrington novel, Two Dollar Bill.  I enjoyed this one quite a bit...<br /><br />Barrington is caught off guard when the legal firm he works with presents him with a new client who specifically requested his services.  The client's name is Billy Bob Barnstormer, and he's a flamboyant character who seems to be flush with money (and doesn't have a specific reason to need legal representation).  He ends up at Barrington's house as an overnight guest, and ends up leaving a dead prostitute in Stone's guest room.  After a number of inquiries from various parties and a little research, Stone finds out that Billy Bob is just one of a number of aliases, and he's wanted by the local authorities, the FBI, *and* the CIA.  And every one of those agencies wants Barrington to work with them to get their hands on Billy Bob first.  Barrington has his own problems, because Billy Bob wants him dead for some reason.  And the *real* Billy Bob is an ex-CIA agent who is trained to kill...<br /><br />I really enjoyed this read.  Nothing real heavy or complex...  just an interesting story with some twists along the way.  It took quite awhile to find out the \\"why\\" of how come Billy Bob had it in for Barrington, but it made sense once you got there.  Seeing the cons unfold along the way were also entertaining.  If you're a Stuart Woods/Stone Barrington fan, this makes a nice installment in the series...	2005-06-26

Out by Natsuo Kirino.  I picked up a copy at the library and finished it last night...  A very dark story that redefines \\"desperate housewives\\"...<br /><br />The story revolves around four Japanese women who work the night shift at a packaged food plant.  It's a nasty job, but it pays better than day shift work and affords them a part-time schedule.  But all of these women are living lives of quiet desperation.  One is in a marriage where the son doesn't talk to them and the husband has moved into a separate room.  Another fancies herself a fashion plate but is overweight and deeply in debt to the loan sharks.  The third is widowed with two daughters and an invalid mother-in-law that makes her life miserable (and has to have her diaper changed multiple times a day).  And finally there's the wife with kids, a husband who beats her, and has spent all their savings at the gaming tables (besides chasing around other women).  He gets roughed up at the club and sent home.  She snaps and strangles him with a belt.  She enlists the help of her friends to dispose of the body by cutting it up into small parts and trashing it around the city.  But the police find some of the bags in the park trash and are able to identify the body.  They are trying to figure out if the wife did it or if the owner of the casino was responsible for the death.  After all, the casino owner does have a nasty murder on his record.  The tale is tightly woven between the women, the casino owner, and other various players who have figured out the truth and are playing it for their advantage.  The question is whether any of them will survive the changes that have occurred now that they are highly involved in the murder...<br /><br />\\"Dark\\" doesn't quite begin to cover this story.  Not only do you have the dismemberment of the murdered husband, but they are coerced into other \\"jobs\\" because they need the cash.  Greed between the friends leads to blackmail, and pretty soon it's hard for each to figure out who can be trusted to keep their mouth shut and not spill the beans to the police (or others).  The overwhelming helplessness of each life also is vividly portrayed in the writings.  While not condoning the events that happen, you understand how they play out.  I'd have given this a top rating if not for the ending.  While I don't have a problem with what happens in the end, the emotion and mental \\"conclusion\\" were entirely lost on me.  I really didn't get what the writer was having the woman feel...<br /><br />A good read with cultural elements that will probably be unfamiliar and fascinating to you...

Books	5	5	6	N	N	Great for getting your financial life in order...	Getting into financial difficulties is far too easy in today's society, and getting out is a struggle.  Shannon Plate has written a book that will greatly aid you in the process of getting your financial house in order...  Degunking Your Personal Finances (Paraglyph Press).<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Why Are My Finances All Gunked Up?; Where Do I Start Degunking My Finances?; Organizing Your Financial Life; Creating a Clear Picture of Your Financial Situation; Degunking Your Credit and Debit Cards; Degunking Your Consumer Debt; Degunking Your Home and Mortgage; Degunking Your Housing and Living Expenses; Degunking Your Savings and Investments; Degunking Your Credit Report; Fine-Tuning Your Budget; Degunking Other Expenses; Degunking Your Taxes, Benefits, and Insurance; Finding Hidden Money; Putting Your Computer and Other Technology to Work; Improving Your Credit Security; Backup and Emergency Planning; Index<br /><br />All the Degunking titles are set up to have you follow a 12 step program that, if followed, will greatly improve the area being \\"degunked\\".  In this case, it's your financial affairs.  Plate starts out with the very basic first step...  set up an area where you can organize all your financial papers.  If they're scattered all over the place, the internal resistance and effort is multiplied.  Then figure out where you really are with your finances, and start on cleaning up your credit and debit cards.  Each additional step builds on that base and works up through the final step.  Many of the later steps are ones that you can implement at any time (like implementing a financial security program, backing up financial records, etc.), but it all follows in a logical order.  The author also doesn't offer any quick fixes to your problems.  It's work to get out from under the pile, but if you structure your approach to doing so, it may not be quite as bad as you thought.  And it's definitely not as bad as continuing to go down the same path and finding yourself unable to get credit due to bankruptcies or such...<br /><br />Degunking Your Personal Finances is a well-written book that's personable and enjoyable to read.  The author's personality shines through, and it's easy to follow her steps and suggestions to start cleaning up your life.  And even if you think you have everything under control, you'll probably find some things in there that you can implement that will make your good situation even better.

Over the last week or so, I've been reading C. J. Date's book Database In Depth - Relational Theory for Practitioners (O'Reilly).  While it's a well-done title, it's the type of book I have a hard time reading...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Introduction; Relations Versus Types; Tuples And Relations; Relation Variables; Relational Algebra; Integrity Constraints; Database Design Theory; What Is The Relational Model?; A Little Bit Of Logic; Suggestions For Further Reading; Index<br /><br />C. J. Date, along with E. F. Codd (the acknowledged \\"father\\" of relational database theory), are probably the two most influential individuals in this field.  Much of what we know and practice in today's RDBMS packages all goes back to the work these two have done.  Rather than write a textbook style discussion of the finer points of database theory, Date has used this book to update some of his thinking and to consolidate a number of his talks and writings of late.  For serious students of relational database concepts, I'd consider this the latest \\"must read\\" to keep up with current thinking by one of the masters.<br /><br />Having said that, I had a hard time slogging through the material.  I tend to gravitate to technical reading material that is practical and understandable.  Debates over finer points of arcane minutia will cause me to zone out quickly.  Unfortunately, I felt that way through a lot of this book.  There is a lot of solid technical material here, and it's definitely geared towards serious readers.  Date doesn't have a lot of kind words to say about how database vendors have implemented the relational model, nor does he feel SQL is a good thing.  I, on the other hand, figure the packages are what they are, and you had better learn to use them to create the systems needed by your customers.  That's probably why I'm a developer and not a system architect.  Reading a number of pages on why Date and Codd disagree on whether nulls are valid or allowed doesn't do much for me.  They're there, you need to understand them, and then you need to move on.  Another hard part for me was the heavy emphasis on mathematical proofs and such.  Since I don't have that type of background, I'm quickly lost...<br /><br />Even though I wasn't completely enamored with the book, I still think it is a good title.  For the right reader, this will be material that they will benefit from.

The jury convicts him after certain evidence is destroyed, and he's sent to prison to live out his life.  He's a tough prisoner and does all he can to stay in solitary confinement, thereby avoiding some of the more unpleasant aspects of prison life.  But he finally is befriended by another old prisoner who helps him adjust his view of life.  He also offers to share a vast fortune with White once they make good on an escape.  With all the money he could ever need, want, or spend, White can start a new life and forget all the bad things that have happened to him.  But what he really wants to do is follow up on a principle he learned in prison...  exact revenge.  He's willing to spend whatever it takes to reward those who helped him before prison and to make life a living nightmare for those who put him there.<br /><br />From a story-telling point, I liked this story a lot.  Watching White set up intricate plans to lead his enemies into total destruction was fascinating.  It's also interesting to watch him struggle with who he is and what he might become if he gives in completely to his hate and burning need for revenge.  There is a bit of suspended belief that needs to take place to get here, however.  You have to believe that the old guy in prison really did accumulate a vast fortune.  You also have to believe that White was able to convert the treasure to cash resources without drawing undue attention to himself.  But once money is no problem, there's not too many logistical problems that can't be solved in the story line.<br /><br />Definitely a good, entertaining read.  Not the most likely plotline, but it's easy enough to play along for the ride...cal problems that can't be solved in the story line. <br /> <br />Definitely a good, entertaining read.

I'm really getting addicted to these Maran Illustrated titles.  I received a copy of Maran Illustrated Weight Training, and this is one of those fitness books that speaks to the \\"normal\\" person...<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Section 1 - Weight Training Basics: Weight Training Basics<br /><br />Section 2 - Work Your Upper Body: Work Your Chest; Work Your Shoulders; Work Your Back; Work Your Triceps; Work Your Biceps and Wrists; Work Your Abdominals<br /><br />Section 3 - Work Your Lower Body: Work Your Legs; Work Your Buttocks; Work Your Calves<br /><br />Section 4 - Using An Exercise Ball And Tubing; Using an Exercise Ball; Using Exercise Tubing<br /><br />Section 5 - Design A Weight Routine: Design a Weight Routine<br /><br />Section 6 - Stretching: Stretching<br /><br />Section 7 - Cardiovascular Training And Nutrition: Cardiovascular Training; Nutrition; Index<br /><br />Although my current fitness and weight level wouldn't necessarily show it, I've spent a lot of time in the gym doing weight training.  I even considered competitive bodybuilding for awhile, and I was familiar with that entire scene and lifestyle.  So while I'm fine with a weight training book by a current Mr. Olympia, the person trying to get started for the first time can easily be intimidated by that.  Hyper-muscular individuals enhanced by various \\"substances\\" aren't realistic for 99% of the population, and it sets some pretty false expectations.  Fortunately, there are alternatives, and this book is one of them.<br /><br />The Maran Illustrated approach to a book involves a graphically appealing format with an abundance of photos to illustrate points.  No endless pages of \\"text only\\" here.  Each exercise that's illustrated follows pretty much the same format.  A photo of the starting/ending position, a photo of the middle position, a picture of the muscles targeted by the exercise, and most importantly, a photo of what you *don't* do when performing the exercise.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to bite my tongue when watching others in the gym, knowing that their particular motion on a given exercise makes it either useless or dangerous.  This emphasis on what to do and what *not* to do isn't normally covered in other books.  In fact, I don't think I've seen any other book show that level of responsibility.  I'd commend it for that alone.<br /><br />But we're not done yet.  The material in the first section is stuff that I'd like to get all gym attendees to memorize.  They cover the basics on equipment, how to choose a gym, why weight training is good for you, etc.  But they also devote some time to etiquette.  Etiquette!  That's another hot button for me.  I don't want to listen to you scream while you crank out that last rep.  I don't want to use the bench that's still covered in your sweat.  And I *really* don't want to wait to work in while you're reading the paper between sets.  If I could staple this section to the forehead of a few individuals, I'd be a happy man.<br /><br />Do I like this book?  Yeah, I like it a lot.  The models illustrating the exercises are normal-looking, fit individuals.  The information is technically sound, and effort is made to make sure you're doing things right.  They even cover fitness balls and exercise tubing, which I normally dismiss in my mind as gimmicks.  But I had to rethink those attitudes after covering that area.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This would be the first book I'd recommend in nearly all cases if someone was getting ready to take up weight training.

I was recently contacted by Lawrence McAuliffe, the author of the novel Purple Sun, and asked if I'd like a review copy of his book.  Never one to turn down a good read, I accepted.  After finishing the book, I can truly say this was a very well done effort...<br /><br />Lance Corporal Billy Kern, a soldier in Vietnam, commits an act of aggression during a mission that he can't come to grips with.  In his effort to blot it all out, he nearly kills himself in a drunken stupor.  Found by an old mama-san, he ends up getting cleaned up by Master Technical Sergeant Isaiah and given some advice on what he should do with himself in order to get his mind back together.  Kern is pretty messed up as he has three purple hearts, should have died from his last chest wound, and is convinced he has to find an old monk he met in the hills during the fateful mission.  An attempt to steal a jeep and continue his journey leads to military court, where Sgt. Ross testifies that he feels Kern can carry out the rest of his tour.  And as Kern still feels he has a mission in life to find the monk, this is just what he wants.  He disappears during an intense firefight and is never found.  A military journalist, Patric Gallo, feels that Kern's return to service was a massive injustice, while Ross feels that Kern's return was the right thing to do, both by law and for Kern's sake.  Ross writes him off as dead, while Gallo feels he could still be alive.  Decades pass with rumors of a strange Doa-Nai, or wandering monk, who inhabits the hills of Vietnam, caring for the dead.  Circumstances and a need for closure drive both Ross and Gallo to a remote monastery, the Purple Sun, to learn the truth of what happened 28 years earlier...<br /><br />As I've stated on more than one occasion in book reviews, I don't do \\"subtle\\" very well.  Pondering the deeper meaning of an author in a book is something I just don't do well.  So I'm not even going to try to come up with some profound insight based on this novel.  Still, even with my somewhat shallow reading skills, I was moved by this book.  It was easy to understand how Kern was able to become detached from reality given the trauma he suffered.  Watching Ross deal with the conflict between justice, law, and spirituality was something that I could identify with.  Gallo's tenacity to find the truth, never giving in and letting the story die...  It all made for a story that drew me in and kept me turning pages to see how it would all turn out.<br /><br />McAuliffe's background as a Vietnam chaplain permeates the writing, and you can tell he knows the story of which he writes.  For those who desire a deep read with much to chew on, this book will deliver.  And even if you're just looking for a good story to kill a few hours, you'll get that and quite a bit more...this novel.

Being a tinnitus sufferer to a small degree, I picked up a copy of Tinnitus Treatment And Relief by Jack A. Vernon at the library the other day.  This is one of those books you could either think is absolutely great or something that you shouldn't read unless you have a medical degree.<br /><br />On the good side, this book doesn't attempt to push a single treatment option or tout some specialized treatment routine of the author.  It's a series of chapters written by doctors and researchers that cover a range of techniques that have been studied and found to have varying levels of effectiveness.  Since little is known about tinnitus and there are no fool-proof or totally effective treatments, it may well be that what works for one person only serves to exaggerate the problem for someone else.  Also, tinnitus is highly subjective in the level of discomfort to the patient.  As measurement of the extent of the problem can be difficult, placebo treatments often offer some level of relief just because the patient expects it to help.  If you're a sufferer looking to find out about a range of treatment options, this book will help.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book is that the content varies greatly in its readability.  Some of the chapters are written with the patient in mind, and it's easy to understand what the doctor is trying to convey.  Other chapters are nothing more than research papers targeted at other researchers, complete with technical statistical analysis and research jargon.  Although each chapter ends with a \\"question and answer\\" section from a patient perspective, far too much of the writing will be heavy going for the average reader.<br /><br />I think the best I can do is give this an average rating with the caveat that your results may vary.  Depending what you're looking for, this may be an important read to deal with your condition or it may offer even more frustration of a condition you don't understand...	2005-06-13

If you're responsible for Linux servers and you need to keep things running at peak efficiency, you *need* to get this book...  Performance Tuning For Linux Servers, edited by Sandra K. Johnson, Ph. D., Gerrit Huizenga, and Badari Pulavarty.  It's an excellent blend of theory and practicality.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Linux Overview: Linux Installation Issues; Kernel Overview; Overview Of Server Architectures<br /><br />Part 2 - Performance Analysis Tools: System Performance Monitoring; System Trace Tools; Benchmarks As An Aid To Understanding Workload Performance<br /><br />Part 3 - System Tuning: System Performance Principles And Strategy - A Benchmarking Methodology Case Study; Scheduler Tuning; The Linux Virtual Memory-Performance Implications; I/O Subsystems-Performance Implications; File System Tuning; Network Tuning; Interprocess Communications; Code Tuning<br /><br />Part 4 - Performance Characterization Of Linux Server Applications: Web Servers; File And Print Servers; Database Servers; Application Servers<br /><br />Part 5 - Tuning Case Studies: Case Study - Tuning The I/O Schedulers In Linux 2.6; Case Study - File System Tuning; Case Study - Network Performance On Linux; Case Study - Commercial Workload Tuning; Tuning Kernel Parameters; Index<br /><br />This is one of those rare books that ranks high on many criteria...  It's got a lot of theory, the \\"why\\" of different features as they relate to performance.  It's also packed full of practical material.  They tell you how to measure key components in the system and what parameters you can change to affect those areas.  When you get done, you've covered every conceivable area that exists in the Linux environment.  I particularly liked the blending of measuring/monitoring along with the instructions on how to change performance.  The chapter on system performance monitoring tools can be used immediately to see how your system runs.  Once you become comfortable using those tools, you can use them to run before and after comparisons of tuning efforts.  There's no guesswork involved.  Measure, tweak, and remeasure.  Repeat as necessary.  Same with the benchmarking tools.  They will allow you to know without a doubt whether the changes you made work or not.<br /><br />I'm also impressed with the readability of the book on a couple of different fronts.  For one, books like this can be dry as dirt, especially in the areas dealing with theory and architecture.  But surprisingly, it really wasn't hard to follow, nor was I getting bored.  The other reason the readability is surprising is that the chapters are done by 21 different contributors.  When you get different chapters being done by different techies (with varying levels of communication skills), you normally get a very uneven book.  Not so here...  The editors should be commended for taking material that I'm sure was all over the board and weaving it into a cohesive and coherent volume.<br /><br />Bottom line...

I'm a strong believer in \\"R&D\\"...  \\"Rob & Duplicate\\".  Rather than reinvent the wheel, I'd prefer find code that works and use/modify it to fit my purposes.  Chris F. A. Johnson has a book that fits that mindset perfectly...  Shell Scripting Recipes - A Problem-Solution Approach (Apress).<br /><br />Chapter List: The POSIX Shell and Command-Line Utilities; Playing With Files - Viewing, Manipulating, And Editing Text Files; String Briefs; What's In A Word?; Scripting By Numbers; Loose Names Sink Scripts - Bringing Sanity To Filenames; Treading A Righteous PATH; The Dating Game; Good Housekeeping - Monitoring And Tidying Up File Systems; POP Goes The E-Mail; PostScript - More Than An Afterthought; Screenplay - The screen-funcs Library; Backing Up The Drive; Aging, Archiving, And Deleting Files; Covering All Your Databases; Home On The Web; Taking Care Of Business; Random Acts Of Scripting; A Smorgasbord Of Scripts; Script Development Management; Internet Scripting Resources; Index<br /><br />Johnson has written a book that is perfect for the person who has studied the basics and now wants to start applying their knowledge.  The book is one page after another of scripts written to solve specific issues and scenarios that can be solved using scripting techniques.  Each problem has the format of description, \\"How It Works\\", \\"Usage\\", \\"The Script\\", and any \\"Notes\\" that might apply to this situation.  The vast majority of problems are covered in two or less pages, so the scripts and examples are very tight and concise.  The scripts were tested by the author using bash, pdksh, KornShell 93, and ash.  If this is the type and flavor of shell scripting you use, they you'll be able to use the scripts without too many fears of finding problems.  If the author knows another technique to make the script applicable to more types of shell environments, those will be noted in the Notes for the particular problem.<br /><br />I really liked the focused nature of the material and writing.  This is the type of book that will either solve a specific problem you have or will give you ideas on automating/simplifying something that you've lived with for far too long.  And with repeated perusals, you may find gems you overlooked the first time that now address a current need.

I ran across an interesting title on web programming the other day...  DHTML Utopia: Modern Web Design Using JavaScript & DOM by Stuart Langridge (Sitepoint).  If you already understand JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, along with the concept of the document object model (DOM), this book might give you some pretty good ideas...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; DHTML Technologies; The Document Object Model; Handling DOM Events; Detecting Browser Features; Animation; Forms and Validation; Advanced Concepts and Menus; Remote Scripting; Communicating With The Server; Dom Alternatives - XPath; Index<br /><br />The main intent of this book is to show the reader how DHTML can be used to add a degree of dynamic interaction not often seen in average web pages and applications.  Because the book is not overly large (slightly over 300 pages), there is an assumption that you're already familiar with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  These technologies make up a large part of what's known as DHTML.  The other piece is the document object model.  Using JavaScript to manipulate the page structure when events occur, you can make the page do things like add fields, expand and collapse parts of the form, highlight rows and columns of tables, etc.  Langridge does what I would consider a review of basic DOM concepts before launching into many, many examples of DHTML you can steal for your pages.<br /><br />This is one of those books where you \\"learn by doing\\".  Under no circumstances would I consider this a book I'd use as a reference manual.  If you have problems with a script or you don't understand certain language functions, you're basically on your own.  The ideas and techniques are relatively easy to follow, and you can easily add the code by typing (or downloading from the website).  So if you're comfortable with learning by diving right in, you'll probably have better luck with this book than those who might be trying to gain a comprehensive understanding of every part of DHTML.

I was recently sent a copy of the book Maran Illustrated Piano from the maranGraphics Development Group.  It's another subject treatment using the \\"maran illustrated\\" technique, and again it's an excellent work...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Piano Basics; The Basics of Reading Music; Basic Hand Positions; Playing Scales; Playing Chords; Beyond the Basics of Reading Music; Tips to Improve Your Playing; Special Playing Techniques; Improvising and Playing with Others; Styles of Music; Buying and Caring for Your Piano; Quick Reference; Index<br /><br />The Maran books use a graphic-intensive format with liberal use of color and heavy-stock paper.  With Frank Horvat as the technical consultant, they take the reader through an informative history of the piano, famous composers, and the structure of the piano (along with the various styles and related instruments).  From there, they get into how to read music as well as the basic hand positioning for playing.  The material on reading music is well done for anyone who needs to acquire that skill, even if they aren't interested in the piano.  The book then starts to show how to play scales, chords, and progressively more difficult pieces.  It would be very easy to use this book to do your own self-learning program, and it'd be a great way to figure out if you want to take the next step and find a piano teacher to help you progress.<br /><br />The illustrations and photography of hand placement jump off the pages with the high-quality printing and paper.  The pictures of Horvat sitting at the piano look a little stilted, but there's only so much \\"action\\" you can add to those settings.  The only photo series I didn't much care for in the book have to do with the piano pedals.  The pedal photos have someone's black shoe, white sock, and bare leg in the frame.  That's just wrong...  :-)<br /><br />Shoes and socks aside, this is an excellent choice if you are looking to learn how to play the piano on your own.

Seth Godin always has an interesting perspective of marketing in today's society.  His latest book seeks to add to that perspective with a purposely inflammatory title...  All Marketers Are Liars - The Power of Telling Authentic Stories in a Low-Trust World.<br /><br />Chapter List: Highlights; Got Marketing?; Step 1 - Their Worldview And Frames Got There Before You Did; Step 2 - People Notice Only The New And Then Make A Guess; Step 3 - First Impressions Start The Story; Step 4 - Great Marketers Tell Stories We Believe; Examples - Stories Framed Around Worldviews; Important Aside - Fibs And Frauds; Step 5 - Marketers With Authenticity Thrive; Competing In The Lying World; Remarkable? The Cow Has Not Left The Building; Bonus Part 1 - Master Storytellers And Those Who Are Still Trying; Bonus Part 2 - Advanced Riffs; Good Stuff To Read; So, What To Do Now?; Acknowledgments; Index; What's Your Story?<br /><br />This is one of those books where you think it's going to say one thing, and it ends up telling a different tale than you expected.  The general premise was easy to grasp, but I kept having to slow down to make sure I was really understanding the finer distinctions involved.  Probably the best way to summarize the material is to quote from the Advanced Riffs chapter:<br /><br />\\"Remember, the marketer tells a story.  The consumer believes it and it becomes a lie.  And that lie can spread from person to person.  Then and only then is the marketer going to succeed and will sales grow.\\"<br /><br />Advertising that involves stating facts and comparing your product to the rest of the market is an effort that is potentially doomed to failure (or worse, doomed to be forgotten).  You as a marketer have to tell a story about your product.  One of the examples involved Puma tennis shoes which are marketed as a luxury \\"want\\" that will make you look cool, special, and so forth.  Bottom line, it's an assembly of material used to make a shoe that costs very little when assembled in an off-shore plant.  If all the consumer wants is a reliable pair of shoes, s/he can do much better with different brands that are far cheaper.  But the consumer buys into the story that Puma is telling, and that story then becomes the \\"lie\\" that the consumer tells themselves to explain their attachment with the item.  They then start to tell that lie to others, which can form an ideavirus that sweeps through society very quickly.  Think of iPods...  MP3 players have been around for quite awhile.  The story of the iPod has become the lie that millions have told themselves and others.  If Apple had simply tried to sell it as a portable music player with gigabytes of storage, there would have been little to differentiate it from others.  Then it would have been a race to add more memory.  But you can't compete with the \\"cool\\" factor of the iPod.  A very successful lie...<br /><br />Godin does a good job writing a book that is compelling to read.  Although I think I unknowingly understood why the iPod (and other Purple Cows) were successful, I don't think I quite categorized their success as a lie that they successfully spread.  This is definitely causing me to rethink what I'm being told by media...  Good job!when assembled in an off-shore plant.

This is my type of book on project management...  readable without a rigid methodology!  The Art of Project Management by Scott Berkun (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Plans: The Truth About Schedules; How To Figure Out What To Do; Writing The Good Vision; Where Ideas Come From; What To Do With Ideas Once You Have Them<br /><br />Part 2 - Skills: Writing Good Specifications; How To Make Good Decisions; Communication And Relationships; How Not To Annoy People - Process, Email, And Meetings; What To Do When Things Go Wrong<br /><br />Part 3 - Management: Why Leadership Is Based On Trust; How To Make Things Happen; Middle-game Strategy; End-game Strategy; Power And Politics<br /><br />Notes; Annotated Bibliography; Acknowledgements; Photo Credits; Index<br /><br />Most books on project management, while useful, can be painful to read.  A structure and methodology is laid out, each step is spelled out in exact detail, and every exception to the rule is covered somehow.  If your only job is to manage projects, perhaps you can do all the paperwork required.  Berkun's written a different style of book.  Rather than introduce yet another methodology, he focuses more on the skills and techniques that a project manager should have.  He talks about how to schedule projects, not \\"this is the way you should do it\\".  He touches on soft skills such as communications between team members and with management.  Bottom line, it's the things you need to think about in the role of project management instead of what steps you need to follow.  What's nice about this book is that you could apply it to your job even if you're required to adhere to a specific process-driven methodology like RUP.  Since it deals with mindsets and skills you'll need in any case, you'll come away better prepared to do your job.<br /><br />This is one of the more practical books on project management that I've had the chance to cover.

Back in my preteen years, I first read Pastor Richard Wurmbrand's book Tortured For Christ.  It had a big influence on how I viewed religious freedom in Soviet bloc countries.  Wurmbrand wrote this book after his release from Romanian prisons in 1964, and he did so to share the story of how the underground churches in Communist countries have to operate in order to spread the Word and their faith.  Rather than continue to minister to his countrymen, he was urged to leave and spread the news about the persecution.  Wurmbrand probably did more to bring this situation to light than any other single person.<br /><br />With the demise of the Soviet Union, the situation has improved somewhat.  But by no means has religious freedom bloomed.  There are more freedoms in the former Communist countries, but the surge in Islamic countries means that Christian persecution has just migrated to new locations.  Much of what you read here is still valid around the world.  The situation's the same, just the names have changed.<br /><br />If you're wondering about the cost of being a Christian in many locations around the world, this book will help you to understand what that cost is.	2005-06-05

I don't think morality in business is a new phenomenon, but it's gotten much more focus in the post-Enron business environment.  I had a chance to read and review the book Moral Intelligence by Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel, Ph. D.  This is an excellent book for more than just people in business...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Moral Intelligence: Good Business; Born to Be Moral; Your Moral Compass; Staying True to Your Moral Compass<br /><br />Part 2 - Developing Moral Skills: Integrity; Responsibility; Compassion and Forgiveness; Emotions<br /><br />Part 3 - Moral Leadership: The Moral Leader; Leading Large Organizations; Moral Intelligence for the Entrepreneur; Becoming a Global Moral Leader; Strengthening Your Moral Skills; Moral Competency Inventory (MCI); Scoring the MCI; Interpreting Your MCI Scores; Index<br /><br />The main points that were driven home to me in this book are the concepts of moral intelligence and moral competence.  Moral intelligence is the ability to know the \\"right thing to do\\", whereas moral competence is the ability to actually \\"do the right thing\\" when the time comes and the situation demands it.  Unless there's some sort of physical or emotional damage to a person, everyone has a moral compass.  In the business world, none of the people being convicted of criminal activity can say that the activities that they did were right.  The intelligence of what is right and wrong was there (if ever so faint).  It's the ability to act on that intelligence consistently that was lacking, and it's the reason many of them know where they'll be spending the next 5 to 10 years.  The authors set forth the concepts in a clear fashion, and there are exercises throughout the first part of the book that will help you figure out exactly what your moral values are.  Once you understand what you value, it's much easier to determine what the right thing to do might be in ambiguous or emotionally charged situations.<br /><br />While the book is generally written for business leaders, parts 1 and 2 apply to anyone.  The daily situations where you need to act in a morally consistent fashion are present regardless of what part of the business you occupy.  Part 3 gets more into specific applications that apply to business leaders, and it's there that today's business leader will learn how best to apply the concepts learned earlier.<br /><br />Excellent material that if considered and applied will change the way you run your business and your life.  You'll definitely come away a happier and more fulfilled individual as you live a life that's in alignment with your values.ritten for business leaders, parts 1 and 2 apply to anyone.

Another Amazon reviewer recommended a book that turned out to be a great read...  The Preservationist by David Maine.  This book has everything I can't do as a writer, and I love it.<br /><br />Maine takes the biblical story of Noah's Ark and weaves a narrative tale around it.  Using a combination of first and third person voice, the story is fleshed out through the eyes of \\"Noe\\", his wife, and his three sons (along with their wives).  The core story follows the biblical account, but plenty of room is left for the author to add personality to each player.  You see the fear and doubt that Noah encounters as he follows his directives from God, knowing he has to act but not knowing how to accomplish the huge task set before him.  His sons are all distinctive individuals who don't always play well with each other.  Each wife is distinctly different from the rest, but their uniqueness addresses the ability to bring in animals that no one has ever seen or imagined.  Best of all, Maine does a great job in painting a picture of what it would be like to be trapped on a boat with a huge number of animals and little to do to break the monotony of each passing day.  What is largely a sanitary account in the Bible becomes a struggle that every reader can identify with.<br /><br />The reason I liked this book so much is that I don't do very well in painting color into a story.  If I wrote War And Peace, it'd probably be done in 75 pages.  Not that I write tight prose.  I just don't describe events and emotions very well.  Maine has forever altered the way I'll view Noah, and for me that's a good thing.  Very well done...	2005-06-05

Action-packed legal thriller, life and death situations, etc.  But then after a few books, the writing seemed to get somewhat uneven and I didn't quite know what I'd get each time I started a new one.  John Grisham's latest, The Broker, ended up being one of his better ones of late.  I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Joel Backman, aka The Broker, was a high-powered player in the Washington scene until he took the fall for a espionage and conspiracy charge involving spy satellites and software that the U. S. didn't know existed.  Six years into a 20 year sentence, he's offered a full pardon and whisked off to Italy to start a new life off the beaten path.  But all is not as it appears.  In reality, the CIA has set up the pardons so that they can notify four other governments who are involved in the satellite situation.  Based on who goes after Backman and kills him, they'll be able to tell who the satellites belong to.  The story revolves around Backman's adjustment to learning the language and culture of the country, and then his attempts to stay alive and escape those who want him dead.<br /><br />As mentioned in the open, I found this to be one of his better efforts.  The story was interesting, and there was enough mystery involved so as to keep you guessing as to exactly what was going to happen next.  It was also fascinating to see how someone can go from a life of power and money clear down to prison and then work on acquiring street smarts in order to just stay alive.  I felt the ending left quite a bit up in the air and somewhat unresolved, but not so much that it soured the entire story for me.  Basically, it was an entertaining read that contained some enjoyable hours of escape.	2005-06-01

To a large extent, I've been able to avoid much SQL work in my regular day-to-day programming.  But with the release of Notes/Domino 7.0, it will be easier to integrate Notes data into a DB2 backend.  That makes SQL expertise much more important.  To help, I got a copy of SQL Visual Quickstart Guide (2nd Edition) by Chris Fehily.  Pretty good book...<br /><br />Chapter List:  DBMS Specifics; The Relational Model; SQL Basics; Retrieving Data From A Table; Operators And Functions; Summarizing and Grouping Data; Joins; Subqueries; Set Operations; Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Rows; Creating, Altering, and Dropping Tables; Indexes; Views; Transactions; Creating The Sample Database; SQL Keywords; Index<br /><br />Visual Quickstart books tend to be short on dry, meaningless dronings and heavy on practical \\"here's how you do ...\\" material.  This one is no exception.  Fehily has written a book that can be easily jump back and forth between tutorial and reference guide.  You'll initially want to use the book to learn the specific skill, like how to create different types of joins between tables.  You'll end up going back to the material on numerous occasions to either refresh your knowledge or look up a keyword.  And because of the practical nature of the material, you won't spend a ton of time wading through stuff that doesn't directly relate to your job.<br /><br />Another thing that's very useful in this book is that it's vendor-inclusive.  In the DBMS Specifics chapter, Fehily talks about how the material relates to Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.  This chapter doesn't tell you how to install those software packages, but it does tell you how to enter and run SQL scripts on each platform.  Throughout the book, he also points out when a particular vendor either deviates from the standard, adds a nonstandard feature, or implements a feature in a fashion different than the others.  So while you might be able to find specific SQL books for a specific platform, this will be a great addition for the person who has to interact with a number of relational database vendors on a regular basis.pecific SQL books for a specific platform, this will be a great addition for the person who has to interact with a number of relational database vendors on a regular basis.	2005-05-31

After reading The Coming Plague, I found myself fascinated by the people who do disease research.  Beating Back The Devil by Maryn McKenna continues in that vein, and is a good read...<br /><br />McKenna covers the history and activities of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), which is a branch of the CDC.  These people, who are considered a branch of the military, sign up for a stint which involves intensive training, personal risk, and the knowledge that they may be sent anywhere in the world with a single phone call and no notice.  It's the people in this group that were on the front lines of discovering and fighting Ebola, AIDS, and hantavirus.  The author generally follows a specific group of EIS personnel through their adventures (but not exclusively), so you get to know and understand the personal costs of this type of work.  It's truly amazing that we have people in this country that are willing to risk everything to keep us safe from things we can not see and may not be able to protect ourselves from.  Since many of the disease episodes are relatively recent, it's easy to relate to what's going on in the story, and McKenna does a good job in bringing it all to life.  This is probably one of the advantages of this book over The Coming Plague.  Beating helps cover that ten year gap since Plague was published.<br /><br />If the subject of disease detection and control is of interest to you, Beating Back The Devil is a must-read...	2005-05-30

Late last week, a surprise package from Amazon ended up on my doorstep.  Maran Illustrated Windows XP by Ruth Maran.  It's my first look at a Maran Illustrated book, and I must say I'm impressed...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Windows Basics; View Files; Working With Files; More Working With Files; Customize Windows; Work With Songs And Videos; Create Movies; Share Your Computer; Optimize Computer Performance; Work On A Network; Browse The Web; Exchange E-mail; Exchange Instant Messages; Index<br /><br />As far as content goes, this is a Windows XP beginner's book.  It covers all the basics on how to find files, move windows, launch programs, etc.  If that was all this book brought to the table, it'd be just another title amongst others.  But when you open it up, it quickly becomes clear that this is a cut above most entry-level books.  Maran uses copious quantities of illustrations to show the reader exactly how to accomplish each task.  And it's just not the \\"here's a screen shot\\" type of graphic.  Each chapter is made up of a number of \\"how to\\" and/or tips on how to do stuff.  The leading illustration is more general in nature, such as a computer exposed to show multiple safe deposit boxes, used to show how you can share your computer and keep things private at the same time.  The step-by-step illustrations used to show you how to do something are screen prints, but the specific parts of the screen are circled, red-lined, and numbered, all pointing back to each instructional step.  It'd be nearly impossible to get stuck on a point while using this book.  Add in the heavier paper quality and the rich palette of colors that are used, and this book is almost as enjoyable to look at as it is to work with.<br /><br />The author, Ruth Maran, is part of Maran Graphics, a family-owned and -run business that produces the Maran Illustrated line of books.  While a book on Windows XP might not be something I'd need due to my prior experience with technology, using their titles on learning to play the piano or guitar would now be a choice I'd look for if I were wanting to learn either of those skills.  This is a book I'd feel totally comfortable recommending to a PC newbie just getting started on Windows XP.

Through some source which I've now forgotten, someone recommended the book Code Names - Deciphering U.S. Military Plans, Programs, and Operations in the 9/11 World by William M. Arkin.  As a reference book, it's OK.  As a reading book, forget it...<br /><br />Arkin is a journalist and analyst who has spent a great deal of time dissecting and interpreting U. S. military and government operations and structure.  As a result, he's far more knowledgeable than most on what the military is up to.  His stated purpose in writing this book is to give the reader a chance to see and understand the incredibly large number of alliances and operations that make up U. S. military might in today's world.  The book is broken up into four sections after the initial introduction of why the information matters.  The first section lists the cast of characters...  the listing of all the military and government groupings that come into play here.  The next section examines the military relationship between the U. S. and every country in the world.  You can easily look up any country alphabetically and see what type of aid or operations we might be carrying on there.  The third section, and the biggest by far, covers every single code word or code phrase that the author has uncovered in his research over the years (and we're talking thousands).  Most of these you'll never have heard of, and reading the description of each operation gives you some insight as to what matters.  The final section serves as a glossary of all the military acronyms that you might ever run across.<br /><br />From an analysis standpoint, you'd be hard-pressed to find all this information in a single location anywhere.  It just doesn't exist.  This is probably required reading for every foreign analyst studying U. S. military actions.  From the viewpoint of a book that is interesting to read, it suffers quite a bit.  Granted, it probably wasn't written with the view towards reading it straight through.  Still, the mind starts to go numb after awhile.  I also have to question the \\"wisdom\\" of making all this information available in one place.  Yeah, I know the argument is that in a democracy we should be able to have access to this information.  In reality, this just makes it easier for foreign interests to gain intelligence without working for it.  I'll also admit a certain bias to the fact that Arkin is heavily involved in Greenpeace activities.  Since there's some philosophical differences there for me, I'm probably less inclined to give the guy a break...<br /><br />I'll give the book an \\"average\\" review and let you draw your own conclusion.  If you need reference material, you'll like this book and rate it higher.  If you want reading material with discussion and analysis, you won't find much of it here.  And your political leanings will definitely flavor your attitude towards the book...he mind starts to go numb after awhile.

Since I've already read and reviewed a couple of books on the Firefox browser, I didn't expect much new material in the latest title to hit the shelves...  Don't Click On The Blue E! - Switching To Firefox by Scott Granneman (O'Reilly).  But to my pleasant surprise, this actually was better than I initially thought...<br /><br />Chapter List:  The Problem With The Blue E; Installing And Configuring Firefox; Firefox Features; Killer Firefox Add-ons; Advanced Firefox; Other Web Browsers; Firefox Options; Index<br /><br />First off, it doesn't look like a typical O'Reilly book.  It's a multicolored cover with a full color wolf on the front (there just *has* to be an animal on the front!).  It also doesn't spend a lot of time in the purely technical arena, either.  The tone is much lighter than what you'd normally see in an O'Reilly title.  The author is unabashedly a Firefox fan (and an Internet Explorer basher), so you'll get plenty of opinion interspersed with the facts and details of Firefox.  If you're looking for an unbiased comparison, look elsewhere.  Granneman doesn't have much nice to say about IE.  But it does make for a fun read.<br /><br />As for content, there's the typical coverage on features, security, flexibility, and all the \\"selling points\\" you've heard about Firefox.  But there's also some material that wasn't in every other book.  In the first chapter, he covers the history of browser development from the beginning up until now.  You've probably heard and read all of this before, but having the story all in one place gives you an appreciation for where we've been and how far we've come.  I also liked his coverage of Firefox extensions.  Every author has his own favorite ones that make the browsing experience special.  Reading about how others use Firefox is always useful in that it gives me ideas on how I can alter my browsing experience.  Finally, Granneman does an *excellent* job of referencing all his information at the end of each chapter.  You'll find an abundance of links to additional sites and white papers that will add to your understanding.  Those references are almost worth the price of the book by themselves...<br /><br />Even if you've already picked up a Firefox book, you might want to consider getting this one also.

There's always room for a decent Linux book that is focused on getting desktop users to switch over from Linux (especially if the risk is nonexistent).  This book fits the bill...  Test Driving Linux - From Windows To Linux In 60 Seconds by David Brickner.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Getting Started; Surf The Web; File Management; Music And Videos; Play Games; Email, Organizers, and Instant Messaging; Edit Digital Image; Customize Your Desktop; A Free Office Suite; Manage Your Finances; The Command Line; Great Programs That Aren't On The CD; Pre-Switching Information; Solutions To Common Problems; Index<br /><br />Brickner has taken the Mandrake distribution and created a Knoppix-like CD distribution called the Move Live CD.  This CD contains a KDE-style desktop Linux environment that can be booted from the CD without touching anything on the hard drive.  It means you can test drive a Linux desktop environment without having to reformat your hard drive or destroy anything you're currently working on.  Great news for the curious who want to understand what all the talk is about.  The author also stays focused on *just* the Linux desktop environment.  It'd be easy to try and write up information on Linux servers, command line stuff, shell scripts, etc.  But that would dilute the focus.  He stays on task and makes sure the book will appeal to the person who doesn't want to become an OS guru, but just wants to get work done using the type of tools they are already familiar with in the Window environment.<br /><br />I liked the selection of software that was covered.  OpenOffice to replace Office, GIMP to replace any other image package like Paintshop Pro, and GnuCash to replace packages like Money and Quicken.  And best of all, they're all free.  He also spends a fair amount of time on Konqueror, which serves as a file explorer as well as a web browser.  There's no reason you can't use other software like Firefox for web browsing, but he had to draw the line somewhere in order to fit everything onto a single CD.  And remember...  when you turn off the computer, the OS disappears.  This is only to give you the flavor of what Linux is like on the desktop, so that you can make some more intelligent choices if and when you decide to switch.<br /><br />Very non-intimidating style of writing, and I'd feel comfortable recommending it to nearly anyone wanting to check out Linux...

If you're doing business internationally, IT security might be more of a nightmare than you know.  This book does an excellent job of helping you through the mine fields...  Mapping Security - The Corporate Security Sourcebook For Today's Global Economy by Tom Patterson.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Charting A Course: Why You Picked Up This Book; Establishing Your Coordinates; Building The Base; Enabling Business And Enhancing Process; Developing Radar; Constant Vigilance<br /><br />Part 2 - Reality, Illusion, And The Souk: Europe; The Middle East And Africa; The Americas; Asia Pacific; Outsourcing And Your Map<br /><br />Part 3 - Whose Law Do I Break?: Mapping Solutions; Mapping Law; Mapping Technology; Mapping Culture; Mapping Your Future; Local Security Resources By Country; Index<br /><br />Patterson takes an approach to global technology security that I've never seen before.  He talks about how differing countries, laws, and cultures can all conspire against you when it comes to maintaining (legally!) security for a global organization.  Conceptually you probably know that not all laws are the same as the ones in the United States, but you may not know or understand just how different they are.  For example, if you have a server in France running an HR or a payroll system and you back up the data to a server outside of the country, guess what?  You're in violation of French data security laws.  It's that easy...<br /><br />Part 2 of the book was very interesting.  He takes some of more significant countries in terms of global and cross-border commerce and scores them with an index value that takes a number of security issues into consideration.  You'll learn that every country, no matter how cheap or technologically adept they are, have significant hindrances that could make or break your business if you're not prepared to deal with them.  Language is a major issue, as well as nationality.  Even though you may be opening up shop in a country that speaks English, you can usually count on the fact that sending an American over to tell them how to run the security is a bad idea.  You need to be able to partner with a local firm or find someone from the country to handle the day-to-day issues in order to make sure all is running well.  Patterson covers this and a lot more in the book, and it's actually interesting reading, too.  He keeps the conversation with the reader moving along at a decent pace, along with interspersing little sidebars on cross-cultural issues that you may never have considered.<br /><br />IT security professionals who work for global organizations or who have outsourced operations will do well to pick up a copy of this book to make sure they are abiding by all the laws that could affect them.

Over the last year or so, I've heard more and more talk about something called aspect-oriented programming, or AOP for short.  Wanting to at least be aware of major trends, I was happy when I received a copy of Aspect-Oriented Software Development by Robert E. Filman, Tzilla Elrad, Siobhan Clarke, and Mehmet Aksit.  Unfortunately, I'm not the right audience for this particular book, and I really still don't know much about the subject.<br /><br />The book is an outgrowth of a special issue of a software engineering publication back in 2001.  The subject was AOP, and it drew a heavy response of submitted papers and ideas.  Rather than only letting a few of them see the light of day, the authors decided to contact the top researchers in the field and ask them to do a write-up of their special area of AOP interest.  As a result, you now have this book which is a compilation of around 30 of these papers and articles.  The target of the book is for advanced software engineers who want to catch a glimpse of what is going on in the AOP field.  Guess that rules me out...<br /><br />As with any compilation of articles and papers from different sources, you'll get hits and misses based on communication and writing skills.  If you're the type of software engineer that eagerly awaits Dr. Dobb's Journal each month, you'll probably really like this book.  It appears that by reading all the way through, you'll get a broad range of information that may make you want to investigate AOP further.  If you're like me and you are more focused on working directly with end users to build systems and you have a bent towards practicality over theory, don't start out your AOP experience here.  It seems like AOP could be just as hard to wrap your mind around as object-oriented programming was the first time you heard of it.  If I'm ever to start to understand this subject, I think I'll need an AOP for Dummies title...<br /><br />If you're an uber-geek who wants to know more about AOP, or if you're an AOP person already who wants to know more, knock yourself out on this book.

Those who are reading this review on my blog must be wondering if I've ditched my Notes/Domino roots and migrated to the dark side.  The answer is no.  I just wanted to know a bit more about InfoPath.  To do that, I got a copy of Beginning InfoPath 2003 by F. Scott Barker.  If I were inclined to start working with the product, this would offer a good start.<br /><br />Chapter List: InfoPath - The Journey Begins; Getting Started Designing with InfoPath; Understanding Data; Creating an InfoPath Form from an Existing Data Source; Utilizing XML and Web Service Data Sources; Working with Controls in General; Looking at Some Useful Controls and Techniques; Working with Sections; Managing Views; Publishing InfoPath Forms; Working with Code in Your InfoPath Form; Getting Started Using Scripts; Working with .NET Managed Code; Real-World Tasks and Coding Examples; Creating and Working with Web Services; Implementing Security; Working with InfoPath and Windows SharePoint Services; Manufacturing Plant Case Study; Answers to Exercises; Index<br /><br />As I said in the opening statement, I'd feel very comfortable using this as an initial text to start learning InfoPath if that were my next learning chore.  Barker does a nice job explaining the overall concepts behind the product, and then gets into the actual building of applications based on InfoPath.  There's a good mix of examples using various data sources, like Access, SQL Server, and web services.  As a beginning text, this focuses more on the basic form design and how you can build useful forms using wizards and the basic controls.  There isn't the focus on doing a lot of scripting in your application, which is OK as this is labeled a \\"beginning\\" book.  In fact, there's a follow-on Wrox title labelled Professional InfoPath 2003.  If that book covers scripting and more of the internals, then I'd consider the coverage in this book to be perfect for the division between the two titles.<br /><br />It's really tough to not want to get off on a tangent of comparing this technology to the Notes/Domino platform.  But this *is* a book review, not a technology review.  As a result, I'll restrain myself and stop here.  :-)  This is a well-done book, and worth getting if you're going down the Microsoft path of \\"collaboration\\" based on their definition of the day...<br /><br />OK...  that last one just slipped out.  :-)ot want to get off on a tangent of comparing this technology to the Notes/Domino platform.

If you're having trouble translating all the book knowledge of use cases into practical application, check out Use Cases Patterns and Blueprints by Gunnar Overgaard and Karin Palmkvist.  A very nice work...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Introduction: Use-Case Patterns and Blueprints; Using Patterns and Blueprints in Use-Case Model Development<br /><br />Part 2 - Use Cases: Use-Case Modeling - An Introduction; Use Cases; Modeling the System Environment; Structuring a Use-Case Model; Include - Reusing Existing Use Cases; Extend - Expanding Existing Use Cases; Include vs. Extend; More on Extend and Extension Points; Use-Case Generalization - Classification and Inheritance; Actor Generalization - Overlapping Roles; Describing Use Cases; Documenting a Use-Case Model; Mapping Use Cases onto Classes<br /><br />Part 3 - Use-Case Patterns: Business Rules; Commonality; Component Hierarchy; Concrete Extension or Inclusion; CRUD; Large Use Case; Layered System; Multiple Actors; Optional Service; Orthogonal Views; Use-Case Sequence<br /><br />Part 4 - Use-Case Blueprints: Access Control; Future Task; Legacy System; Login and Logout; Message Transfer; Passive External Medium; Report Generalization; Stream Input; Translator<br /><br />Part 5 - Common Mistakes: Alternative Flow as Extension; Business Use Case; Communicating Use Cases; Functional Decomposition; Micro Use Cases; Mix of Abstraction Levels; Multiple Business Values; Security Levels with Actors<br /><br />Glossary; References; Index<br /><br />The feature I often find most useful in programming books is the liberal use of code samples that can be \\"appropriated\\" for your own use.  But that feature seems to disappear quite often when you get into design work.  You have to learn the methodology first, and then you're on your own for trying to figure out how it applies to your system.  No samples, no code to steal, it's just slog away and hope you get it right.  This book allows you to break out of that pattern (no pun intended) when it comes to writing up use cases.  Overgaard and Palmkvist have taken their multiple years of experience with use cases and distilled down a number of repeating \\"patterns\\" that are seen over and over in many business systems.  They then name the pattern, explain the type of situation that calls for it, shows the way it would be written up, and then they apply it to a few example uses.  If you're the type of programmer or designer who likes to \\"look at the answers\\" to figure out how something is done, this book provides quite a few \\"answers\\" for you to study and learn from.<br /><br />While the book is touted as being for all levels, I don't know that I'd recommend this as a learning guide for use cases.  They do cover the basics, but it just didn't strike me as a good tutorial.  Having said that, this should be the *second* book you buy in order to take your ability to work with use cases to a higher level.n it comes to writing up use cases.

This is the type of book that should be available to every programming professional in any programming language...  Effective C++ Third Edition by Scott Meyers (Addison-Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter List: Accustoming Yourself to C++; Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment Operators; Resource Management; Designs and Declarations; Implementations; Inheritance and Object-Oriented Design; Templates and Generic Programming; Customizing new and delete; Miscellany; Beyond Effective C++; Item Mappings Between Second and Third Edition; Index<br /><br />Before we go too much further here, let's have some full disclosure here...  I'm not a C++ programmer.  This leads to a logical question...  What am I doing reviewing a book on C++, then?  Well, I've been in IT for over 25 years and I am a professional software developer.  I also read a boatload of tech books each year, too.  As a result, I can usually tell if a book is going to be worth the money and if it will deliver on the promises it makes.  This one does.<br /><br />If you look at all the Amazon reviews for the second edition of this book, you'll see that everyone agrees it is excellent material.  I'll assume the technical information in this edition is just as good.  Beyond that, there's a lot to like about the style here.  Meyers doesn't attempt to \\"teach\\" the language.  He assumes you know the fundamentals.  His items are focused on how to better understand a particular feature or concept so that you'll be more effective as a developer (hence the title).  The writing style is very readable, so it's easy to pick up the concepts between that and the code examples.  Something that I found really unique and useful is pretty minor but it works so well.  Relevant code and the \\"Things To Remember\\" recap at the end of each item are in red text.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it makes a world of difference in having your eyes drawn to that which is most important.  Considering most programming books are black and white, a dash of red really stands out.<br /><br />If you're a C++ developer with some experience under your belt, this really is the next book you need to take your development to the next level.  The people who maintain your code after you and the people who use your programs will thank you.hite, a dash of red really stands out. <br /> <br />If you're a C++ developer with some experience under your belt, this really is the next book you need to take your development to the next level.

If for whatever reason you've made the decision to implement Microsoft's Small Business Server (SBS) 2003 package, a good place to start might be Jonathan Hassell's Using Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003 (Apress).<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; Installing SBS 2003; Initial Configuration; Exploring Windows Server 2003; Exploring Outlook 2003 and Exchange Server 2003; Windows SharePoint Services Techniques; Exploring SBS Standard Security; Using Remote Access Features; The Shared Fax Service; Monitoring SBS Server Health and Performance; The Indexing Service; Index<br /><br />To be honest up front, I'm not a huge Microsoft fan.  In fact, as a IBM/Lotus professional, you might even say I'm a bit antagonistic towards them.  But realistically, there are a number of reasons why small businesses might want to implement SBS 2003.  Hassell's book would be a good starting point for a power user who wants to become the default system admin, or for an experienced admin who wants to get started with SBS 2003.  He does a pretty good job of explaining the setup of most of the moving parts, and it's done well enough to ensure a reasonably good likelihood that you'll be up and running when you're done.  Now *because* there are so many moving parts (like SharePoint, Exchange, etc.), this is not the book you'd turn to if you have to get into some major troubleshooting.  You can only do so much in 250 or so pages, and Hassell doesn't try to go overboard.  As a result, the book maintains a good focus on what it sets out to do.  But if something does go wrong, you'll be doing on-line research or be visiting Amazon to get the 1000 page book that covers nothing but Exchange, SharePoint, etc.<br /><br />To the right audience, this book serves its purpose well.  It won't be the only book on your shelf (nor should it be), but when you get done with it, you'll know what it is you don't know...	2005-05-21

In today's often cutthroat business practices, it's important to remember the lessons we all learned when we were young.  To help, read this short book...  Winners Never Cheat - Everyday Values We Learned As Children (But May Have Forgotten) by Jon M. Huntsman.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Lessons From The Sandbox; Check Your Moral Compass; Play By The Rules; Setting The Example; Keep Your Word; Pick Advisors Wisely; Get Mad, Not Even; Graciousness Is Next To Godliness; Your Name Is On The Door; The Obligation To Give Back; The Bottom Line<br /><br />Jon Huntsman is the chairman and founder of Huntsman Corporation, which was the largest privately held chemical company in the world prior to going public in 2005.  Jon built the business from a small operation in 1970 to what it is today...  a multi-billion dollar firm.  But instead of using business practices all too common these days (think Enron or Worldcom), he built the organization based on solid moral principles that everyone knows are intrinsically right.  A handshake and promise is something to be kept.  You should surround yourself with people who have and live the same ethics and value that you have.  Giving back to the community and those less fortunate isn't a nice thing to do... it's a moral obligation.  It'd be all too easy to write this off as simplistic platitudes that are easier said than done.  But Huntsman has proven they do work, and there are numerous examples in the book that offer proof.<br /><br />This isn't a 400 page book that requires days of patient determination to get through.  It's a small-sized practical book that's only 185 pages, and each chapter and concept shouldn't take more than 10 to 15 minutes to read.  But once read, and if contemplated and applied, they will change your life in more ways than you can count.  A highly recommended read...	2005-05-20

Based on the recommendation of a fellow blogger, I picked up a copy of Alone by Lisa Gardner.  Wow...  *this* is a crime thriller!<br /><br />Bobby Dodge, a Massachusetts State Trooper who is part of a SWAT-like team as a sniper, is called out on a domestic dispute involving a man welding a pistol against his wife and child.  Dodge ends up firing and killing him based on his judgement that the guy was about to shoot the wife.  He quickly finds out that the man was the son of a very prominent judge who hates his daughter-in-law, wants custody of the child, and is charging Dodge with murder.  The dead guy's wife has her own issues, relating back to a kidnapping when she was young.  She was buried alive for 28 days and abused at the hands of a pedophile before she was found by hunters.  This has left her emotionally damaged and unable to adequately care for her child who is continually ill.  While the whole shooting appears to be a typical hostage situation, the facts dictate that there might be more than meets the eye.  The wife might be an innocent victim or a cruel manipulator that set Dodge up to fire.  And Dodge is falling apart trying to figure out the truth...<br /><br />This is by far one of the best crime thrillers I've read in a long time.  This is one of those stories where an incident happens, the facts have a number of interpretations, and you're left twisting back and forth trying to figure out who's innocent and who's guilty...  who's telling the truth and who's lying.  Throw in a number of wicked plot twists, and you don't know *what* to think until the final few pages.  This is one of those \\"couldn't put it down\\" type books because I really didn't have a clue as to how it was all going to be resolved in the end.<br /><br />This is a \\"must read\\" if you're into the crime genre.  This is also yet another author that I haven't read in the past, and now I'm *really* jazzed to go get her other books.  If they're anything like this one, I have some prime recreational reading ahead of me...ime recreational reading ahead of me...	2005-05-19

Trying to understand design patterns based on most texts can be as painful as poking yourself in the eye.  The book Design Patterns Explained - A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design (2nd Edition) by Alan Shalloway and James R.

It goes into great detail, but it can be very abstract and hard to put into practical terms for beginners.  Design Patterns Explained departs from the largely theoretical information and tries to get as concrete and as practical as possible.  The authors pick a number of useful patterns and concentrate on those few entries as opposed to trying to cover everything.  They put forth a few case studies and use those to explain the pattern being discussed.  This tends to make it much easier to understand why the pattern works well for the problem at hand, and how it translates into Java code.  Also, it's written in first-person format with plenty of personal insights and opinions.  This also helps to make the text much more readable than most.<br /><br />In addition to just covering the patterns and how they are coded, the authors also talk about the mindset needed to think and design in patterns.  This is an aspect of design patterns that I normally don't see covered well (if at all) in most other books.  If you combine the focus on thinking in patterns along with the practical information on the most common ones, you get a book that delivers quite a bit more value than most in this niche.<br /><br />While any serious design pattern student will want to get the Gang of Four book, this volume would be a much better way to get started...erything.

The kind folks over at HarperCollins sent me an advance reader copy of Lisa Scottoline's newest novel Devil's Corner.  This is another author that I haven't read before, but will probably end up doing catch-up reading on her titles...<br /><br />Vicki Allegretti is an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and she's due to interview a confidential informant on a case related to an illegal gun sale.  But things go horribly wrong when she arrives at the meeting house only to find two guys who have broken into the house and murdered the informant.  During the confrontation, her partner is killed and she almost joins him in death before the killers decide to flee.  In the process of interviewing leads on the killing, she assaults a prisoner and is suspended from her job.  But instead of just taking the safe road, she decides to conduct her own investigation so that the case doesn't get dropped.  To get into the parts of the city where the crime occurred, she has to team up with the person she assaulted, and thus starts an unlikely personality pairing that will either pay off or get them both killed...<br /><br />Scottoline was formerly a trial lawyer and apparently now watches court cases for entertainment (and potential story ideas).  Her in-depth knowledge of the legal system and how things actually work shows through in this novel, as I got the feeling that she has been here before.  Watching Allegretti try and balance her work and personal life is interesting, as her romantic interest may or may not be all he's cracked up to be.  And I really liked the interplay between her and Reheema, the girl she assaulted.  Matching up an urban black street-smart girl with a suburban Harvard grad leads to rather sticky situations that neither can relate to but that both have to work through.<br /><br />Solid writing, good pacing, a story with some meat, and a few plot twists to boot...  Can't ask for much more in a recreational crime thriller read.	2005-05-17

UML isn't intuitive nor is it \\"easy\\" to read.  Learning to use it can be intimidating.  UML For Mere Mortals by Robert A. Maksimchuk and Eric J. Naiburg is a very nice way to get your feet wet on the subject...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction to the UML; Business Models; Requirements Modeling; Architectural Modeling; Application Modeling; Database Modeling; Testing; Is That All There Is?; How Do I Get Started Using The UML?; Where Can I Learn More?; Glossary; Answers To Review Questions; UML Diagrams and Elements; Index<br /><br />I've read a few books on UML, and it's pretty easy to get bogged down in all the rules and minutiae.  UML is one of those things that can have the experts arguing about fine distinctions that you'll never experience in your working career.  In this book, you can forget all that.  The authors don't try to teach you absolutely everything there is to know.  The goal is to focus on practical usage and cover those things that you'll most likely run up against in real life.  And in my opinion, they nail that goal.  Most of the subtopics within each chapter have a topic heading that is a question.  The questions are ones that you'd encounter as an actual student of UML (like how do I model my business using the UML?), and that tends to make sure the subject matter stays practical and useful.  There are also a number of very good sidebars that cover lessons learned, real world experience, things to watch out for, and \\"deep dive\\" items that cover things in a bit more depth.  There are even review questions you can use to see how much you've retained.  All in all, a good format and packaging of the material.<br /><br />This is the first \\"Mere Mortals\\" title I've read, and I don't think it will be my last.  I see this as being a book that you'd use to get up to speed quickly on a subject.  It could also be used to learn what you don't know.  If I knew nothing about UML, this book, read straight through, would give me the context for everything else I need to learn.  Books like that are really valuable, and this one would be a great addition to your UML bookshelf if you need to go in that direction...gh, would give me the context for everything else I need to learn.

Shell scripting is one of those things I keep telling myself I need to learn but never quite get around to it.  The Wrox book Beginning Shell Scripting by Eric Foster-Johnson, John C. Welsh, and Micah Anderson might be the book I end up using to get me there.<br /><br />Chapter List: Introducing Shells; Introducing Shell Scripts; Controlling How Scripts Run; Interacting With The Environment; Scripting With Files; Processing Text with sed; Processing Text with awk; Creating Command Pipelines; Controlling Processes; Shell Scripting Functions; Debugging Shell Scripts; Graphing Data With MRTG; Scripting For Administrators; Scripting For The Desktop; Answers To Exercises; Useful Commands; Index<br /><br />This book has something for just about every beginning user.  As a \\"Beginning\\" Wrox book, it's meant to take you from no knowledge to basic competency.  Normally when you think of shell scripts, you think Unix.  But this book goes beyond that.  The authors include just about every OS in their coverage.  Unix and Linux users are obviously taken care of, as I'd expect.  But they also address Mac OS X users so that they can start to delve under the covers of their operating system.  They even include Windows users by having them download the Cygwin software.  Overall, the focus is on the Bourne shell, but special features of the others (like C, bash, and Korn) are also addressed as they come up.  Overall, you get coverage on just about everything you could want as a beginner.<br /><br />With the combination of \\"Try It Out\\" and \\"How It Works\\" examples in the book, beginners should quickly be able to do something with their new knowledge.  To me, that's always the sign of a good beginning level book on a subject...  get the reader doing something productive quickly.  Beginning Shell Scripting meets that criteria.	2005-05-16

When things go wrong with your PC and/or on-line existence, you need quick help in figuring out how to fix it (or how you should have stayed out of it in the first place).  Surviving PC Disasters, Mishaps, and Blunders by Jesse M.

Within each chapter, there are subtopics that will teach you about certain things (like how data theft occurs, how to prevent and detect data theft, etc.).  The rest of the chapter is made up of \\"how do I\\" questions that address topics within the chapter.  Throw in quite a few \\"horror story\\" sidebars based on real life experiences from the authors, and you have a pretty readable and practical book.<br /><br />It was tempting to originally think of this book as a troubleshooting guide...  a resource you would turn to when you had to fix something.  But really, it's more of a \\"be prepared\\" guide.  Reading this material *before* you need it will save you a heap of head- and heartaches.  This isn't the book that contains a bunch of technical step-by-step instructions on how to get into hardcore repair of your wireless router.  It may help you, but it's best to use the material to stay out of trouble in the first place.  And the digital lifestyle hazards chapter is *definitely* better to use as preventative medicine.  It's easier to reset a PDA than shut down a stalker...<br /><br />Good material for those who are not uber-geeks who live in cyber-space.

It's a book I could definitely recommend...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; An Agile Overview; Setting Up; Getting Started; Java Basics; Strings and Packages; Class Methods and Fields; Interfaces and Polymorphism; Inheritance; Legacy Elements; Exceptions and Logging; Maps and Equality; Mathematics; I/O; Reflection and Other Advanced Topics; Multithreading; Generics; Assertions and Annotations; Swing, Part 1; Swing, Part 2; Java Miscellany; An Agile Java Glossary; Java Operator Precedence Rules; Getting Started with IDEA; Agile Java References; Index<br /><br />The basics of the book are pretty good.  You have fifteen \\"lessons\\" that cover the material in the book, as well as three bonus lessons on Swing and other miscellaneous subjects.  I really like the way he takes a single example (a student information system) and uses that throughout the entire lesson material.  It gives good continuity and you don't have to readjust your focus for each lesson.  The exercises at the end of each lesson follow a different example all the way through (a chess program), so you have a couple of different ways to learn, but it remains consistent throughout.  He also doesn't try and cover absolutely everything in the Java universe.  He picks the important stuff you need to know and realizes that you'll have to get the rest of the stuff on your own.  This means that the book is approachable and doesn't become another 1500 page doorstop.<br /><br />The uniqueness in the book comes in with the \\"Agile\\" part of the title.  Agile methodologies, like extreme programming (XP), are lightweight in nature and don't require that every last detail be spec'd out before starting the coding.  There's a large emphasis placed on testing with tools like JUnit in order to prove that changes in the code don't break anything.  With the test framework in place, you can also focus on refactoring your code without fear of introducing unknown errors.  Langr shows early on how JUnit tests need to be integrated into your code, and that follows through the entire book.  As a result of that and of using a single example, there are plenty of opportunities to refactor your code and then to use the JUnit test to make sure everything still works.  This slant on Java coding is something you rarely see integrated into the process of learning Java, and it's probably long overdue.<br /><br />Even without the focus on unit testing and refactoring, it'd be a decent tutorial book.  With that focus, this book becomes a recommended tool to use to learn Java.  Good job...g.

Phishing is the scourge of the internet right now.  Rachael Lininger and Russell Dean Vines have done a pretty good job in helping individuals and companies understand the problem with their book Phishing - Cutting The Identity Theft Line (Wiley).<br /><br />Chapter List: Phishing for Phun and Profit; Bait and Switch: Phishing Emails; False Fronts: Phishing Websites; Are You Owned: Understanding Phishing Spyware; Gloom and Doom: You Can't Stop Phishing Completely; Helping Your Organization Avoid Phishing; Fighting Back: How Your Organization Can Respond To Attack; Avoiding the Hook: Consumer Education; Help! I'm a Phish! Consumer Response; Glossary of Phishing-Related Terms; Useful Websites; Identity Theft Affidavit; Index<br /><br />It used to be I'd see one or two \\"requests\\" a week to update my personal information for places like eBay or Citibank.  Now it's closer to two or three a day.  I'm well aware that these phishing attempts are scams meant to commit identity theft, but apparently we internet-savvy people are in the minority.  Lininger and Vines have written a very readable and understandable guide to phishing that can easily be given to nearly anyone to help them protect themselves.  The uninitiated will quickly grasp the idea that they shouldn't be responding to emails like these, and as a result they'll be much safer.  People who are internet-savvy will learn the tricks that are used by the phishers to make links appear to be something other than what they truly are.  Even organizations can benefit from the chapters on what they should do if they find that their servers have been co-opted to run a phishing scam.<br /><br />Very practical material with the benefit of being a book that's fun to read.  This is information that needs to be in the hands of all internet users these days...	2005-05-14

Even though I tend to work on rapid application development projects, there are many occasions where formal software estimation and tracking methodology is either required or is a very good idea.  Richard D. Stutzke's book Estimating Software-Intensive Systems (Addison-Wesley) will give you all you need to know about the subject...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - The Essentials: Introduction; Planning A Warehouse Inventory System; A Basic Estimating Process - The Linear Method; Measurement and Estimation; Estimating Techniques; Estimating Annual Maintenance Costs<br /><br />Part 2 - The Details: Preparing to Estimate (Precursors of Estimation); Estimating Software Size - The Basics; Estimating Software Size - The Details; Production Processes (Project Life Cycles); Bottom-Up Estimating and Scheduling; Top-Down Estimating and Allocation; Parametric Models; Estimating Risk Reserves; Calculating Cost and Price - The Basics<br /><br />Part 3 - Closing the Feedback Loop: Collecting Data - Basics; Tracking Status; Updating Estimates; Consolidating and Applying Your Knowledge<br /><br />Part 4 - Handling Large Projects: Crafting a WBS; Earned Value Measurement; Collecting Data - Details; Calculating Costs and Bid Price<br /><br />Part 5 - Estimating Products and Processes: Determining Product Performance; Determining Product Quality; Measuring and Estimating Process Performance; Ranking and Selecting Items<br /><br />Appendix A - Roles and Responsibilities for Estimation; Appendix B - Measurement Theory and Statistics; Appendix C - Measures of Estimation Accuracy; Appendix D - Summation Formulas for Series; Appendix E - Excel for Estimators; Acronyms; Glossary; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />The author, as you can tell from the table of contents, pretty much covers the entire realm of how to estimate time and cost for software systems.  Each chapter comes equipped with diagrams and forms that would assist you in applying the concepts.  Also, you get a recommended reading area at the end of most chapters that can point you to additional writings if you need to dive deeper (although this stuff is pretty deep already).  What's nice is that the author has a wealth of experience both in teaching and doing, so he interjects real-life examples along the way which bring some reality to what can be a rather dry subject.<br /><br />I'll admit I'm not likely the best or intended target for this type of book.  While I've been developing software systems for a long time, it's more at the departmental level using RAD environments.  In many cases, I'd spend more time following a fraction of these estimating processes than I'd do actually building the system!  Conversely, multi-million dollar projects and/or government projects *do* need this level of detail and tracking.  Joe Coder in his cubicle cranking code will find applicability in some areas when it comes to understanding how to estimate their areas of the software.  The best benefit will be for the official project managers or lead engineers who are responsible for defining the system, coming up with time and cost estimates for the overall effort, and then managing the project to meet those projections.  Just about every process and technique that will be required for estimating is probably covered or touched on in some way here.<br /><br />Given those parameters, I'd say it's a pretty good book for the intended audience.  At 900+ pages, you won't finish it in a weekend, but you'll probably learn and grow with it, referring back to certain sections often as you move forward.d of most chapters that can point you to additional writings if you need to dive deeper (although this stuff is pretty deep already).

Based on the recommendation of a few fellow Amazon reviewers, I decided to pick up a copy of Company Man by Joseph Finder for some recreational reading.  I'll be going back out to pick up some of his earlier works...  This was a good read.<br /><br />Nick Conover is the CEO of a small town company that's a big name in the office furniture industry.  He was well liked before having to lay off 5000 people based on pressure from the owners.  Now he's \\"Nick The Slasher\\" and everyone in town pretty much hates him.  To complicate issues, his wife was killed in an auto accident, and he's left to raise his two kids who are having drastically different reactions to her death.  The troubles in Nick's life start when someone continually breaks into his gated community home and spraypaints graffiti on the walls.  It escalates when someone kills the family pet.  The cops aren't doing much to help due to Nick's standing in the town.  It all comes to a head when he has to defend his property and family with a gun against the person who is a likely suspect in all the other break-ins.  But the shooting isn't one that can be legally justified, and he makes the mistake of working with his corporate security director to cover it up.  Tension mounts as the cops start connecting threads that lead back to him, and his budding romance with the daughter of the victim is making things complicated.  His company is also crumbling as it looks like he's being left out of the loop to sell the company to a Chinese firm.  Who are the good guys, who are the bad guys, and who can be trusted?<br /><br />As I said in the opening, this was a good read.  Even though Nick is a sympathetic character who hated the layoffs, you understand why the town hates him.  The detectives working the case are a mismatched pair as opposite as they can be, but perseverance and justice prevail in order to dig out the truth of the matter.  There are also some pretty nice twists thrown in along the way, and I personally found it hard to figure out how exactly the story was going to turn out.  Pacing was good, and it was refreshing to not see a religious main character portrayed as a fanatic or deranged psycho.<br /><br />I'll be putting Finder on my list of \\"must read\\" authors based on this book, and now I have to fill up my library hold list with his earlier writings.  I love finding a good new author...  :-)ly found it hard to figure out how exactly the story was going to turn out.

If you've already picked up the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and want to see what is *really* possible, check out The Zen of CSS Design by Dave Shea and Molly E. Holzschlag (New Riders).  This is a unique book...<br /><br />Chapter List:  View Source; Design; Layout; Imagery; Typography; Special Effects; Reconstruction; Closing Thoughts; Index<br /><br />This book covers the topic of CSS in an unusual fashion.  Dave Shea came up with the idea for a web site called csszengarden.com.  The basic premise is to have a standard HTML file, complete with class and id tags that can not be changed.  The goal is to then use a CSS style sheet to apply unique styles and graphics to the page, resulting in some stunning visual displays of web design.  But the basic thing to remember is that the page content doesn't change, just the CSS design file that's applied to it.<br /><br />Shea and Holzschlag take some of the more unique designs that have been submitted and use them to explain various CSS concepts and techniques that can be used to push your design efforts beyond the ordinary.  The techniques are very well documented, as well as giving explanations on what will and will not work in the major browsers due to differences in CSS rendering.  Since so much of the design is driven by choices in graphics and typeface, you'll also be exposed to quite a bit in the way of design concepts, how to choose and render text, different graphic formats, and so on.  While none of the information would be considered a complete reference work on any given subject, you do have enough information to apply the technique and continue on from there if necessary.<br /><br />In addition to being a book to teach technique, it also does a wonderful job in providing inspiration.  If you're looking for ideas to create a site that stands out, a leisurely perusal of the pages (or of the website) will offer up endless ways to reach that goal.  \\"You can do that?\\" will be a phrase that escapes from your lips on a number of occasions.<br /><br />Beautiful, instructional, and inspirational...  This should probably be the second or third CSS book you buy once you buy a tutorial and/or a reference guide.

I got an opportunity to review another RSS/Atom title called Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom by Ben Hammersley (O'Reilly).  This is a pretty focused title targeted for developers.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; Using Feeds; Feeds Without Programming; RSS 2.0; RSS 1.0; RSS 1.0 Modules; The Atom Syndication Format; Parsing and Using Feeds; Feeds in the Wild; Unconventional Feeds; Developing New Modules; The XML You Need for RSS; Useful Sites and Software; Index<br /><br />The author spends just a little time talking about the whys of RSS/Atom feeds and then dives into the guts of each of the specifications.  For the developer looking to learn how to develop a syndicated feed, this focus will probably be highly appreciated.  Another interesting part of the book is explanations of the politics behind the three main standards (RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, and Atom).  Unlike most naming standards, RSS 2.0 isn't an update of RSS 1.0, and Atom is a third beast that must be accounted for.  When you read the history of how each one came into being, it makes a bit more sense as to how we got into this position.  Doesn't make it any easier to accommodate things, but at least you can understand it.<br /><br />From a programming perspective, most of the code is done in Perl with a smattering of Ruby and PHP mixed in.  I personally would have liked to see a bit more attention paid to Java, but I guess you can't have everything.  You can at least use the programs to get ideas on potential solutions even if you don't use/know Perl.<br /><br />Overall, a good treatment of an important technology in today's internet environment, and a book that will be useful as you start to add syndication into your applications.	2005-05-08

As an IT professional and software developer, I'm all for standards and processes.  PSP - A Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers by Watts S. Humphrey (Addison-Wesley) outlines a personal methodology for improving your development efforts.  But it's definitely not applicable to all environments...<br /><br />Chapter List:  The Personal Process Strategy; The Baseline Personal Process; Measuring Software Size; Planning; Software Estimating; The PROBE Estimating Method; Software Planning; Software Quality; Design and Code Reviews; Software Design; The PSP Design Templates; Design Verification; Process Extensions; Using The Personal Software Process; Index<br /><br />From an overall perspective, I think the concepts in here are good and the book is well-written.  Watts has devised a methodology that a developer can apply on their own to improve their coding, estimating, and defect resolution skills.  This is done by extensive measurement and recording of statistic and time taken to accomplish certain tasks.  These numbers are transferred to forms that can then be statistically analyzed to see the trends and make corrections in your techniques based on personal problem areas.  The advantage that this methodology offers is that you don't have to get buy-in from an entire department in order to implement it.  Conversely, PSP can be extended to apply to a team development environment in order to improve everyone's ability to work and develop code as a group.<br /><br />Where I start to have issues is that it doesn't translate well to all environments.  It's best applied to situations where you're developing programs with actual lines of code (like Java or C++) that allow you to do things like count lines of code, program sizes, or function points.  It doesn't address rapid application development (RAD) environments like Lotus Notes/Domino very well, as \\"lines of code\\" is often next to nothing.  Graphical design techniques that code underlying \\"plumbing\\" will make your numbers seem very small.  Counting and tracking defects could be useful, but once again you'll often have to ignore stats related to defects per program size.  You'll also need to be pretty comfortable with statistics to work with this methodology, as Watts gets into some pretty large formulas to generate the \\"score\\" of some of the tracking measures.<br /><br />This is one of those books where if I were coding 15000 line Java programs, I might be really excited.  Developing in a RAD environment makes me see a lot of this as unnecessary tracking for tracking's sake.  But if you're a \\"true software engineer\\" in the most traditional sense, you'll probably find things in here that you'll want to try out.make your numbers seem very small.

The rise of blogging has caused RSS technology to become extremely important in today's computing environment.  To more fully understand this subject, I took a look at Beginning RSS and Atom Programming by Danny Ayers and Andrew Wyatt (Wrox/Wiley).<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Understanding the Issues and Taking Control: Managing the Flow of Information - A Crucial Skill; Where Did Information Feeds Start?; The Content Provider Viewpoint; The Content Recipient Viewpoint; Storing, Retrieving, and Exporting Information<br /><br />Part 2 - The Technologies: Essentials of XML; Atom 0.3; RSS 0.91 and RSS 0.92; RSS 1.0; RSS 1.0 Modules; RDF - The Resource Description Framework; RSS 2.0 - Really Simple Syndication; Looking Forward to Atom 1.0; What Is Atom?<br /><br />Part 3 - The Tools: Feed Production Using Blogging Tools; Aggregators and Similar Tools; Long-Term Storage of Information; Online Tools; Language-Specific Developer Tools;<br /><br />Part 4 - The Tasks: Systematic Overview; Modeling Feed Data; Storing Feed Data; Consuming Feeds; Parsing Feeds; Producing Feeds; Queries and Transformations; The Blogging Client; Building Your Own Planet; Building a Desktop Aggregator; Social Syndication; Additional Content; Loose Ends, Loosely Coupled; What Lies Ahead In Information Management<br /><br />Appendix A - Answers To Exercises; Appendix B - Useful Online Resources; Appendix C - Glossary; Index<br /><br />This book was actually a whole lot more than I expected...  As a blogger, I want to be sure the RSS feed I produce is valid and readable by newsreader clients.  I just expect my newsreader to take care of things for me.  But instead of just covering *how* to produce an RSS feed, the authors cover the entire spectrum of RSS technology.  You get the history of RSS/RDF/Atom as well as some discussion of why they came into being.  So for someone who isn't familiar with RSS at all, they'll quickly pick up all the necessary background to understand why this whole thing is critical.  Then after covering the formatting of the different RSS standards, they move into consumption issues.  While you may not be interested in building your own aggregator, understanding how your feeds will be used leads to a much better solution up front.  Add in plenty of code examples, file snippets, and exercises to extend your knowledge, and you have a pretty complete coverage of the topic.<br /><br />If you're only interested in details on building a feed, this book might not be quite as focused as you'd like.  But if you're just getting into RSS from a programming perspective, this would be a good choice to give you an overall understanding.cal.

After reading Patterson's last lackluster novel (London Bridges), I was hesitant to take on Honeymoon by James Patterson and Howard Roughan.  I was pleasantly surprised and Patterson made a nice recovery.<br /><br />Nora Sinclair is a beautiful interior decorator who harbors a deadly secret.  She kills her lovers for their money (and you find that out right up front).  After her latest \\"tragedy\\", her activities come to the attention of an investigator who has to try and figure out if 1) she is killing the men and 2) how he can prove it.  Using a variety of disguises and covers, he's digging into her life, but she's getting suspicious that perhaps everything isn't as it seems.  Things get even more tense when the investigation crosses a line and the two develop a physical chemistry that definitely complicates life.  The question quickly becomes whether the investigator will uncover the truth before he becomes the next victim.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this was a much better novel than Patterson's last effort.  While there's a little convolution with a subplot that comes into play later in the novel, the holes are not so big as to be able to drive a truck through them.  The action starts off in the first couple of pages and doesn't let down at any point in the story.  It was one of those books I just kept turning the pages on in order to find out what the next twist would be.  Pretty good stuff, and I'm cautiously optimistic that London Bridges was an aberration and not the beginning of a trend.	2005-05-08

With a number of the books I review, there's there assumption that the reader knows and uses Ant to build the projects and run the program.  Since I don't know Ant, I got a copy of Ant - The Definitive Guide (2nd Edition) by Steve Holzner (O'Reilly).  This should fill my knowledge gap nicely...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Getting Started; Using Properties and Types; Building Java Code; Deploying Builds; Testing Builds with JUnit; Getting Source Code from CVS Repositories; Executing External Programs; Developing for the Web; XML and XDoclet; Optional Tasks; Integrating Ant with Eclipse; Extending Ant; Index<br /><br />Most of the Definite Guide books are light on hand-holding and heavy on covering all the aspects of the subject being discussed.  This guide also dives right in, but there's enough coverage of the basics to allow a newbie such as myself to actually understand the basic structure of an Ant file and get started.  That basic information is quickly built on, and in little time you're able to do most of the tasks you'll ever encounter for an Ant build.  I was always a little intimidated when I'd see Ant examples in other books, but now I have the tools I need to understand and use it.<br /><br />I was also a little surprised (and highly pleased) to see how well Ant integrates with Eclipse.  Rather than just sitting down in front of Notepad, you can take advantage of all the niceties of the Eclipse IDE in order to get an accurate and syntactically correct Ant file in short order.  Being able to run the Ant file from within Eclipse is also pretty cool.<br /><br />This is another one of those books that will be under close watch at my desk to make sure it doesn't get \\"borrowed\\".  This book will end up becoming a best friend in short order...	2005-05-08

I received an advance copy of an interesting book a week or two ago...  Why Great Leaders Don't Take Yes For An Answer: Managing For Conflict And Consensus by Michael A. Roberto (Wharton School Publishing).  It's an insightful book on how to effectively promote a culture of open decision-making.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Leading The Decision Process: The Leadership Challenge; Deciding How To Decide<br /><br />Part 2 - Managing Conflict: An Absence Of Candor; Stimulating The Clash Of Ideas; Keeping Conflict Constructive<br /><br />Part 3 - Building Consensus: The Dynamics Of Indecision; Fair And Legitimate Process; Reaching Closure<br /><br />Part 4 - A New Breed Of Take-Charge Leader: Leading With Restraint<br /><br />Endnotes; Index<br /><br />In our results-oriented and media-driven society, nearly all decisions made by an organization (be it corporate or government) are analyzed by whether they worked or not.  This leads to the focus on trying to choose the \\"right outcome\\".  Roberto takes a different tack, and focuses more on how to form the right environment to allow good decisions to be made.  Using examples such as the Bay Of Pigs invasion, the Cuban missile crisis, and the Columbia space shuttle accident, he analyzes how the environment surrounding the decisions led to outcomes that varied greatly in their effectiveness.  Roberto advocates a consensus style of decision making, where all issues are openly discussed and debated without politics and position flavoring who can advance what ideas.  Easier said than done, however.  Through either forceful personality or complete abdication of responsibility, too many important decisions are hamstrung by lack of input due to fear or intimidation.  Using the techniques in this book, a leader can learn how to effectively structure the group to get the type of free-flowing information exchange that ensures all information is available prior to a choice being made.<br /><br />The author also realizes and accurately points out that there are different types of leadership techniques that have to be employed at different times with various groups.  There are times where s/he might have to remove themselves from the initial discussions to make sure their personality doesn't overpower the flavor of the debate.  Other times it might be necessary to be very active to be sure that all the groups who have the important information are heard regardless of their position or rank.  It's a fine line to walk, but one in which the resulting decisions will be of a much higher quality and outcome.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you're a CEO or a supervisor, the techniques and framework discussed here will help you to be a more effective leader in these times of ever-changing environments.  Definitely a recommended read.points out that there are different types of leadership techniques that have to be employed at different times with various groups.

I've heard the term PivotTables in Excel, but I don't have a clue as to what they do and how they work.  I figured that meant it was time to review a book on that subject.  I got a copy of A Complete Guide To PivotTables - A Visual Approach by Paul Cornell (Apress).  I'm now sold on the value of them...<br /><br />Chapter List: What Are PivotTables?; Creating PivotTables; Working With PivotTable Components; Using PivotTables In The Real World; Working With PivotCharts; Analyzing Multidimensional Data With PivotTables; Programming PivotTables; Appendix; Index<br /><br />This book is very focused on one thing...  PivotTables (duh!).  Don't expect to get a tutorial in Excel, and a basic level of familiarity with Excel is assumed.  From there, the author talks about how data can be analyzed in Excel, how those analysis methods can break down under large amounts of data, and how PivotTables are designed to address those deficiencies.  With an abundance of screen shots and examples, Cornell takes you through the processes of building PivotTables using the wizards, manipulating the parameters to get just what you're looking for, creating charts from that same data, and finally some basics on how to manipulate PivotTables using VBA.<br /><br />For me, the book was ideal.  I'm not into heavy data analysis techniques, and I knew nothing about the topic.  After going through the material, I'm actually to a point where I could use this feature of Excel now.  If people are looking for in-depth data analysis topics or every little tip and trick out there on PivotTables, they might be disappointed.  I'd have liked to see a bit more on the programming aspect, as I can use that to interface my data in Lotus Notes into PivotTables in Excel.  I can probably do it now with what was in the book, but more is always better.<br /><br />Given the right audience, this is a good choice of material on the subject.  I certainly learned a lot...	2005-05-07

D. Robb in the \\"In Death\\" series.  The latest is Survivor In Death, and as usual I enjoyed it a lot.  Not quite her best, and a slightly different structure, but still good...<br /><br />Dallas gets tagged on a scene where a family has been murdered at night in a military-style operation.  Everyone's throat is cut except for the daughter, who happened to be down in the kitchen getting a soda and was overlooked.  She's able to call 911 and crawls through the blood of the parents to hide in the shower of the master bathroom.  When Dallas finds her there, it brings back all the pain and suffering of her own abusive childhood, and she has to figure out how to deal with that.  The child is taken into Dallas and Rourke's home for protective custody until they can find the killers.  But few clues are left, and people related to the case are getting killed as the murders try and finish their job.  Dallas has to figure out who did the killings, why the family was killed, keep the girl safe, and not have a total emotional breakdown in the process.<br /><br />This story seems to deal with more human emotion than most in the series.  The child's situation and how Dallas responds to her is a central theme in the book.  Summerset, the butler, also plays a much bigger role here than in most of the books.  The strange part is how little time is spent viewing the actions of the killers.  Often the story lines play out on both sides (cop vs. killer) and merge together at the end.  In Survivor, it's almost as if the killers are simply decoration for the emotional conflict playing out in the Rourke household.  Not necessarily bad, but not quite the same fast-paced action as I'm used to seeing.<br /><br />Definitely a good read, and I still rate this as one of my all-time favorite series.  This one's just a bit different, however...	2005-05-07

Web services has grown beyond just the basics, and there are a number of new standards emerging.  To keep up from an architectural standpoint, a good choice might be Web Services Platform Architecture by Sanjiva Weerawarana, Francisco Curbera, Frank Leymann, Tony Storey, and Donald F. Ferguson (Prentice Hall PTR).<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Introduction: Service-Oriented Architectures; Background; Web Services: A Realization of SOA<br /><br />Part 2 - Messaging Framework: SOAP; Web Services Addressing<br /><br />Part 3 - Describing Metadata: Web Services Description Language (WSDL); Web Services Policy<br /><br />Part 4 - Discovering Metadata: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI); Web Services Metadata Exchange<br /><br />Part 5 - Reliable Interaction: Reliable Messaging; Transactions<br /><br />Part 6 - Security: Security; Advanced Security<br /><br />Part 7 - Service Composition: Modeling Business Processes: BPEL<br /><br />Part 8 - Case Studies: Car Parts Supply Chain; Ordering Service Packs<br /><br />Part 9 - Conclusion: Futures; Conclusion; References; Index<br /><br />It used to be you only needed to know a few basic things about web services, like WSDL, SOAP, and maybe UDDI.  But now there's a whole new slew of standards and acronyms for web services, usually starting with WS- (WS-Policy, WS-Addressing, and so forth).  The first step you need to take is to figure out what the new standards are and how they fit into the overall picture.  The authors do a good job of this in the book.  They present an architectural diagram that shows the whole SOA stack of where each piece fits.  Then they have each \\"part\\" of the book cover the current and new web services standards that fit in that area.  For instance, when you read the section on discovering metadata, you'll get the explanation of both UDDI (the common current standard) as well as coverage on WS-MetadataExchange, which is where things are going.  That combination of current and future standards makes for a strong understanding of the technology as well as the opportunity to compare and contrast quite easily.<br /><br />This isn't a book I'd recommend to someone who wants an in-depth understanding of any single standard that's covered.  The information is just detailed enough to give a system architect the skills they need to design an application using the technologies, but not enough to answer all the \\"how do you glue this to that\\" questions a coder would ask.  But I'd still recommend it to the coder and the architect so that they'd learn what it is they don't know, and learn how to frame all the details in their further studies.<br /><br />Good material, and one of the more current and up-to-date titles out there...ng understanding of the technology as well as the opportunity to compare and contrast quite easily. <br /> <br />This isn't a book I'd recommend to someone who wants an in-depth understanding of any single standard that's covered.

I'll take any and all help I can get when it comes to doing graphical design for a website.  I got the book Before and After Graphics For Business by John McWade (Peachpit Press), and it's a wealth of ideas and concepts.<br /><br />Chapter List: Newsletters; Stationery; Logos & Identity; Sales & Forms; Charts, Reports, Calendars, & Maps; Index<br /><br />Like all good (or at least what I consider \\"good\\") books on graphic design, this is a lavishly illustrated volume that does a great job on taking \\"before\\" examples of business literature and giving them a make-over to enhance their image and design.  McWade does an excellent job in explaining the use of fonts, colors, and spacing in creating designs that convey a consistent theme and image for the company.  Along the way, you pick up a working understanding of typesetting vocabulary, like kerning and leading.  By the time you get done, you might actually understand what that \\"art-y guy\\" in the next cubicle is talking about...<br /><br />The other thing I appreciate about this book is the large number of examples.  While you wouldn't necessarily want to \\"borrow\\" exact images and logos that he's created, you can easily follow how he's built them and the techniques you can follow to come up with your own ideas.  I actually came away from this book thinking I could possibly come up with a redesigned logo for my blog site.  I don't know that I *will*, but I think I could now.<br /><br />This is one of those books I'll take into work and make sure no one walks off with it...	2005-05-05

You want to be truly frightened about your health?  Read The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases In A World Out Of Balance by Laurie Garrett.  A friend loaned me his copy of this book after I had read a book about the flu epidemic in the early 1900's.  This book, written in 1994, covers a number of diseases from all over the world, as well as the stories of the individuals who constantly risk their lives to combat the deadly viruses.<br /><br />Although the book is over 700 pages and the information is over a decade old, it's still a compelling read.  The stories of the CDC doctors who fought bureaucracy and ignorance are inspiring.  To go into countries and cultures where the per capita health care expense is $2 and try to conduct research is mind-boggling.  In many of the stories, every common health care practice we take for granted is nonexistent.  Syringes are reused without sterilization 100's of times each day as it's the only needle they have.  Highly contagious cases are placed in the same room as common injuries, and soon everyone is infected and dying.  And logistically, there's no way to prevent any of this.  Garrett tells of whole countries where the majority of the inhabitants are infected with diseases like AIDS, and the numbers go nowhere but up.  She does an excellent job of telling the stories of how diseases like Ebola, Marberg, and the hanta virus outbreak started, were researched, and how they are currently fought.  Even more frightening is learning how quickly these viruses develop resistance to the common drugs used to treat them, sometimes in as little as one generation of the outbreak.  And as the treatment choices become fewer and more expensive, the outlook becomes more grim for both third-world countries and our own system.<br /><br />The passage of time hasn't made the picture any brighter, and many of the views put forth in the book are still well on their way to fulfillment.  After reading this book, it's easy to understand how such diseases like SARS and avian bird influenza strike fear into the medical establishment.  It's a wonder we're not all dead already.such diseases like SARS and avian bird influenza strike fear into the medical establishment.  It's a wonder we're not all dead already.	2005-05-04

I recently got a review copy of a book that proves a website doesn't have to be big to be effective...  Small Websites, Great Results by Doug Addison (Paraglyph).  Good information for *all* sites, not just small ones...<br /><br />Chapter List: Building Small: A New Approach for Successful Websites; What Makes A Great Small Site?; Creating a Focus for Your Site; Use the Right Design and Navigation Format; Tips and Techniques for Content and Functionality That Users Love; Small Site Approach to Web Marketing; Strategies for Turning Visitors into Customers; Getting What You Need from Your Web Designer; Keeping Your Small Site Up-to-Date; What to Do When You've Outgrown a Small Site; Small Sites for Professional Services; Small Sites for Trade Services; Small Sites for Specialty Products; Small Sites for Artists, Writers, and Performers; Small Sites for Restaurants; Index<br /><br />There really is no barrier to entry for the Web any more.  For virtually nothing (and in many cases it *is* nothing), you can have a web site to advertise your company, service, or product.  But just because you *can* create a site doesn't mean you should be doing it yourself.  There's an art and a science to it, and just doing what you think looks good may be worse than doing nothing at all.  Addison makes the case that not every website has to have hundreds of pages and use every bleeding edge technology known to web developers.  The goal is to remember your audience and serve them with your site, not yourself.  And in most cases, that means keeping the site small, clean, and focused.<br /><br />While much of the author's focus is towards small entities keeping the website under control, the overall advice pertains to all websites.  Using gratuitous features like flash splash pages turns off potential customers and everyday employees alike.  Having to decipher navigation icons is an irritant to any web user.  Making sure all your visual cues are consistent is just good common sense for all sites.  As a result, this isn't just a book that you should get if you're a freelance designer.  It's one that will come in handy in your job at Megacorp as you try and design functional pages that are useful and elegant without being obnoxious.<br /><br />Good common sense, and plenty of material that's applicable to all sites.

There's an element of my personality that is fascinated by espionage and covert operations.  Based on that, I looked forward to reading Chatter - Dispatches From The Secret World Of Global Eavesdropping by Patrick Radden Keefe.  While it had its moments, I guess I was expecting something more and/or different...<br /><br />Chapter List: Radomes in the Desert, Radomes on the Moor: The Invisible Architecture of Echelon; The Leak Was Me: Listening to Diplomats; Footprints of Freedom: A Constellation of Bases; Black Phone/Gray Phone: The Hazards of Secrecy; Goliath Protests: Making Sense of Signals; Rogue Elephant on a Rampage: Privacy on the Line; Voices in the Dark: Muckrakers, Whistleblowers; Toothless Talking Shop: The European Parliament Investigates; The Jihad Phone: Listening to Terrorists; Code; Acknowledgements; Notes; Bibliography; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Keefe takes on the subject of signal intelligence, also known as \\"sigint\\", as practiced by the major powers today (mainly the US in conjunction with England and a short list of other countries).  And when you talk about US sigint, you end up talking about the National Security Agency (\\"NSA\\").  The first part of the book looked really promising.  There were discussions on how the NSA came into being, how certain countries cooperate in this area, and how the program called \\"Echelon\\" casts a world-wide net for eavesdropping on nearly all forms of electronic conversation.  At this stage, I was hoping the author would go into more detail on the different forms of \\"spy vs. spy\\", such as how one side tries to protect their communication and the other side tries to break the code.  Unfortunately, we headed into ethics of spying, the pros and cons of the Patriot Act, and how citizens in other countries protest the presence of US listening stations.  He also gets into sigint versus humint, or \\"human intelligence\\", and how the reliance on electronic forms of surveillance don't always provide the context for what's being heard.  All good stuff, but it seems to drag along at that point, and it's not nearly as compelling as the first part of the book.<br /><br />To the author's credit, he doesn't try to solve all the problems inherent in this subject.  His parting line is that he still doesn't know where the line is between security and privacy, and that this book is just the beginning of a conversation.  While I agree the line is murky and even undefinable at times, I don't know that I'll hang around to carry on the conversation with him.  Depending on why you picked up the book, you may really like the material.  I just found it a little slow and not quite what I was expecting.s being heard.

If you have a need to thoroughly understand computer file systems for whatever reason, you need this book...  File System Forensic Analysis by Brian Carrier.  It just doesn't get any more detailed than this.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Foundations: Digital Investigation Foundations; Computer Foundations; Hard Disk Data Acquisition<br /><br />Part 2 - Volume Analysis: Volume Analysis; PC-based Partitions; Server-based Partitions; Multiple Disk Volumes<br /><br />Part 3 - File System Analysis: File System Analysis; FAT Concepts and Analysis; FAT Data Structures; NTFS Concepts; NTFS Analysis; NTFS Data Structures; Ext2 and Ext3 Concepts and Analysis; Ext2 and Ext3 Data Structures; UFS1 and UFS2 Concepts and Analysis; UFS1 and UFS2 Data Structures; The Sleuth Kit and Autopsy; Index<br /><br />The working concept of the book is that the reader needs to understand file systems in order to do forensic analysis.  For instance, they need to recover content that's been deleted or hidden on the drive.  And while it's true that this information will definitely address that need, it's really a detailed reference work for anyone who has a need to deeply understand the disk structure of a computer.  Developers working on disk utility software come to mind right away.<br /><br />I was surprised that file systems such as FAT and NTFS really don't have published specifications that can be easily found.  Carrier often talks about how few of the detailed parts of the system are documented, so this book is one of the few places you'll find all the information gathered in a single location.  On top of that, there are copious diagrams and file dumps that help to take the information from theory to reality.  Another part of the material talks about how forensic software tools are used to analyze the disk information.  Carrier does primarily talk about forensic software that he helped develop, but it's not (in my opinion) a detriment to the book.  I didn't get the impression I was reading a 550 page advertisement (which I've seen on occasion).<br /><br />Very detailed and complete, and this is the first title you should look at if you need to understand disk structures.reading a 550 page advertisement (which I've seen on occasion). <br /> <br />Very detailed and complete, and this is the first title you should look at if you need to understand disk structures.	2005-04-30

I think this catches me up on all the prior Madeline Bean novels by Jerrilyn Farmer...  Killer Wedding, the 3rd in the series.  Once again, a fun read but rather hard to follow towards the end...<br /><br />In this installment, Bean's new event business is on hold due to a lawsuit over a non-competing clause from the company that bought their old enterprise.  While she's marking time waiting for that to clear, a legendary wedding planner in the city decides that she wants Bean to buy her out and take over.  Only problem is, Bean doesn't want to do that.  She gets roped into \\"helping out\\" on one wedding for the planner, and as usual a dead body shows up at the exclusive wedding...  that of the wedding planner.  To top it off, the groom has completely disappeared and no one knows where he's at.  There's a number of people who could easily be suspects, as the planner wasn't well liked.  Bean decides to help figure out who dun it, just so she can close this chapter of her life and make sure she doesn't end up with the planning business (or get killed over it).<br /><br />Like the rest of her books, Farmer writes a great story.  I really enjoy the characters and dialogue, as well as the pacing of the action.  This one was a little more difficult to follow towards the end, as there were some character interactions that weren't obvious at the start and didn't seem to fit together very well at the end.  Still well worth reading, however...  a great deal of fun.	2005-04-29

Cyber Spying - Tracking Your Family's (Sometimes) Secret Online Lives by Ted Fair, Michael Nordfelt,  and Sandra Ring (Syngress) is one of those books that evokes some strong emotional reactions to the content...<br /><br />Chapter List: Why Spy?; Spying Basics; Technology Overview: Computer Basics; Network Basics; Taking Control; Spying On The PC; Spying On Web Browsing; Spying On E-mail; Spying On Chat And Instant Messages; Advanced Techniques; Counterspy: Are You Being Watched?; Index<br /><br />The authors cover a subject that may be controversial to some...  how to spy on people's computer activities.  Depending on when and how this is practiced, it could be construed as illegal or as a responsible parental activity.  They start out explaining why spying might be necessary as well as the legal and ethical implications.  There is also discussion about how overt and covert spying can be effectively utilized to get the results you're after.  After that, there is coverage of the basics of computer technology for those who don't know much more than how to turn on the computer and read email.  The rest of the book gets into techniques, software, and case studies of surveillance to explain how it all fits together.<br /><br />From a technical perspective, the book is very interesting.  If you need to find out more about the activities of your kids, this book will most definitely help you get there.  But as with all information, it would be very easy to use this same information to spy on other people (like at work).  The information on computer basics also seems to be somewhat unnecessary, but I need to remember that I'm probably not the target audience for some of this information.  And even if you've been working with computer technology for some time, I'm sure you'll pick up some tips on how you can find out what's going on with your computer (or figure out how to cover your tracks more effectively).	2005-04-24

Just when you thought you had a decent handle on how to protect yourself on-line, out comes a book that exposes a whole new series of exploits you probably haven't thought about...

While most security books deal with active attacks designed to either take over your system or crash it, Silence is more concerned with how you may be inadvertently giving up more information than you think.  This may happen based on detailed analysis of the timing patterns on data sent over the network.  By careful analysis, it's possible to deduce a significant percentage of the data, leaving the rest of the data vulnerable to statistical analysis and attack.  Visual representation of IP sequence numbers can also give strong indications as to what type of system may be sending the packets.  It could even be something as \\"innocent\\" as hi-tech monitoring of the blinking lights on the front of your modem.  These types of attacks are not \\"script-kiddy\\" exploits, in that there is a lot of theory and analysis involved in interpreting the results.  But the fact remains that someone you can't see may be getting more information about you than you think.<br /><br />Zalewski goes into a lot of detail about the architectural underpinnings of a system in order to set the stage for the type of monitoring that can happen.  If you're just looking for \\"how do I do a timing attack?\\", you'll probably go away very frustrated.  But if you're the type of reader who asks \\"how does the design of a system facilitate that type of information leakage?\\", you'll definitely treasure this volume.  The type of information that Zalewski covers here isn't readily available in any other single volume.  Therefore, it fills a gap in the security library that most people don't even realize exists.<br /><br />A good read that will open your eyes to problems you weren't even aware of...ral underpinnings of a system in order to set the stage for the type of monitoring that can happen.

No matter how necessary the PC is to your very existence, there are times you want to pitch the beast out the window.  It's either irritating hardware glitches or software designed by monkeys.  The second edition of PC Annoyances by Steve Bass can help you mend your love/hate relationship with silicon.  It's good stuff...<br /><br />Chapter List: Email Annoyances; Windows Annoyances; Internet Annoyances; Microsoft Office Annoyances; Windows Explorer Annoyances; Music, Video, and CD Annoyances; Hardware Annoyances; Index<br /><br />If you haven't seen an Annoyances book before, it's a series of questions or statements (like SP2 Blocks Skype or Back Up Your Autocorrections) with an annoyance and a fix listed for each one.  Under each of the Annoyances chapters, you'll have subsections like Word/Excel/Powerpoint/Outlook/Outlook Express annoyances under the Microsoft Office annoyances area.  Depending on just how annoying the software or hardware is, you may have five to 20 ways to reduce your frustration level.  So, if you don't think the current tip applies to you, keep reading as the next one probably will.  Some of these you'll know already, many you'll never have heard of, and others will prompt the \\"you mean I can change that?\\" moment (or at least it did for me!).  Because Steve's writing style is irreverent and conversational, you almost feel as if you're sitting ringside with him and someone else as they solve the computing hassles we all deal with daily.<br /><br />If that was it, it'd be plenty valuable.  But there's more.  There are a number of sidebar tips that don't necessarily fit into the question/answer format, but are just as important.  For instance, he devotes a large sidebar to the best way to capture screen prints to show brain-dead tech support people that the screen really *does* show what you said.  You may already know how to do that, but it's always worth seeing if there's a better way.  He also offers a multitude of URLs you can visit to download free or cheap utilities to do things that you just can't do any other way.  Want to fill out forms automatically?

Stephen White has the next installment out in his Alan Gregory psychiatric thriller series...  Missing Persons.  While I like the story, it's probably not my favorite...<br /><br />Gregory is trying to wind down for the Christmas holidays and plans on accompanying a fellow psychologist down to Vegas for a conference.  But when they check in on the mental health worker who is going to cover their cases, they find her dead in a rather suspicious fashion.  Add on to that a disappearance of a teenager on Christmas eve, reminiscent of the Jon Benet Ramsey case.  And to make it even more confusing, the mother of the missing teen is psychotic and attends weddings uninvited.  The question is, are all these things related?  And is one of Gregory's patients the key as to how all these things tie together?  It appears that the teen had a single session with the dead counselor.  Is the teen dead for the same reason as the counselor?  And when Gregory's partner goes to Vegas to track down the mother, she goes missing and nobody knows why or where she is.<br /><br />There is a lot of mystery in this story, and I definitely wanted to get to the end to find out how it all wrapped up.  But as I stated in the opening, this wasn't my favorite novel in the series.  For whatever reason, Alan wants nothing to do with the missing teen story, but keeps getting drawn back into it.  The Boulder cops are all convinced the teen is a runaway, but nobody seems to care about evidence to the contrary.  Alan's partner disappearing is suspenseful, but I'm still not quite sure why it all happened.  And towards the end, the interrelated threads just sort of morphed together and lost their individual uniqueness, and all was less than it appeared.<br /><br />I'll still give the book above-average rankings for writing, but the story could have been tighter or less convoluted...	2005-04-21

There are some book series that I really look forward to reading based on their style and content.  One is the Degunking series, and the latest installment is Degunking Your PC by Joli Ballew and Jeff Duntemann.  Much common sense that is rarely practiced...<br /><br />Chapter List: Why Is My PC All Gunked Up?; Degunking Your PC; Physically Cleaning Your PC And Peripherals; Degunking And Configuring Your PC Work Area; Degunking Your Main PC Components; Degunking Your Peripherals; Untangling Your USB And FireWire Connections; Setting Up A Basic Network For Sharing Dial-Up Internet Connections; Moving To DSL Or Cable Internet; Creating Gunk-Free Wired Networks; Going Wireless While Staying Gunk-Less; Degunking Your Backup Strategy; Enhancing PC And Media Performance; Index<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that if you've been around computers for any length of time, you probably know you should be doing a lot of the stuff in this book.  PCs grow internal killer dust bunnies if not cleaned out occasionally (our kitchen PC grows new kittens).  An attempt to unplug a device ends up becoming an exercise in tracing the Gordian knot of cables, with slicing through it not being a viable option.  And, um, I really thought the plug for my Pocket PC cradle was *that* one, not the one that powered off my PC.  If you follow the plans put forth in this book, you'll avoid much (if not all) of these issues.  Ballew and Duntemann give you easy-to-follow tips on setting up a program to not only get your system cleaned up (hardware and software), but to keep it that way.  They even help you justify getting rid of that ink-jet printer that hasn't worked in two years but you just haven't bothered to reclaim that desk space because you've ceased to notice it...<br /><br />In some ways, this book seems to go a bit beyond straight degunking.  When they talk about network degunking, you'll also get a fair amount of information on just what networking is, how it works, and what you need to know to make it all work.  Long-time techies will already know much of that info, but this may be just what the newbie needs to move away from 56K dial-up to 5mb broadband.  The style of writing is conversational and non-intimidating, so I think that people from just about all levels of background and experience should get something out of it.<br /><br />For me, this is a highly recommended book.

If you're a Linux administrator who is constantly looking for that practical example or write-up on how to do a specific task, Peter Harrison's Linux Quick Fix Notebook (Prentice Hall) is probably what you're looking for...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - The Linux File Server Project: Why Host Your Own Site?; Introduction To Networking; Linux Networking; Simple Network Troubleshooting; Troubleshooting Linux With syslog; Installing RPM Software; The Linux Boot Process; Configuring The DHCP Server; Linux Users And sudo; Windows, Linux, And Samba; Sharing Resources With Samba; Samba Security And Troubleshooting; Linux Wireless Networking<br /><br />Part 2 - The Linux Web Site Project: Linux Firewalls Using iptables; Linux FTP Server Setup; Telnet, TFTP, And xinetd; Secure Remote Logins And File Copying; Configuring DNS; Dynamic DNS; The Apache Web Server; Configuring Linux Mail Servers; Monitoring Server Performance; Advanced MRTG For Linux; The NTP Server<br /><br />Part 3 - Advanced Topics: Network-Based Linux Installation; Linux Software RAID; Expanding Disk Capacity; Managing Disk Usage With Quotas; Remote Disk Access With NFS; Centralized Logins Using NIS; Centralized Logins Using LDAP And RADIUS; Controlling Web Access With Squid; Modifying The Linux Kernel To Improve Performance; Basic MySQL Configuration; Configuring Linux VPNs<br /><br />Appendices: Miscellaneous Linux Topics; Codes, Scripts, And Configurations; Fedora Version Differences; syslog Configuration And Cisco Devices; Index<br /><br />Harrison does a great job in hitting the target audience.  He is writing to \\"proficient beginners, students, and IT professionals\\" who understand the theory but need a little nudge on the command formatting.  As a result, there's less emphasis on explaining a lot of \\"why\\" material so that he can devote more time and space to the \\"how to\\" material.  I must say he definitely nails that mark.  He also spends a lot of time on troubleshooting issues (Samba, network connectivity, etc) because that's where the average reader is going to be floundering if they don't know the answer.  By having a concise volume that covers the major areas of concern, you should be able to either quickly fix the problem or rule out a number of potential issues.  Practicality rules in this book...<br /><br />He also avoids the \\"which version of Linux are you on\\" issue by concentrating on the command line interface.  The material you'll learn here is applicable to all versions of Linux, because he doesn't work with any graphical interfaces which may or may not have an equivalent in all Linux distributions.  So while there might be easier ways to do some of the tasks listed here, you won't be locked out from any of them due to picking the \\"wrong\\" distribution.<br /><br />A very good practical book for Linux admins, and one that should get lots of wear and tear...ty, etc) because that's where the average reader is going to be floundering if they don't know the answer.

Continuing with my Madeline Bean theme of late, I read Jerrilyn Farmer's second book Immaculate Reception.  This was an excellent follow-up to her first installment with Madeline Bean...<br /><br />Now that Mad Bean Events has recovered from the poisoning episode of book #1 and have all the money they'd ever need, there's more of a focus on creating events instead of just catering.  And they've hit the big time with their first event...  they've been asked to do breakfast for 2000 people and the Pope.  While there's no problem setting up the event, there are some major issues surrounding it.  Brother Xavier, who is doing preparation for the event, was at one time engaged to Madeline before leaving her for his religion.  While doing some planning, they find part of a letter in an old cookbook that points to a murder confession involving the Catholic church.  The deeper they dig, the more the story points to a major cover-up of an event that happened during World War 2.  And when a fellow Brother of Xavier is murdered and Mad is threatened, the breakfast event might just be their last.<br /><br />As usual, Farmer does a great job with her writing.  You find out more about Madeline's background, as well as why her relationships are what they are.  20/20 hindsight (reading this book after some of the later ones), you also get the stage set for some of the material that shows up later.  Wes is still somewhat of a mystery, but you get a bit more clarification of his personality here.  And I'm impressed how Farmer was able to weave a bit of historical fiction into the storyline.<br /><br />Great job, and another great read...	2005-04-17

I've heard of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, but I really haven't paid much attention to it.  I figured that RFID For Dummies by Patrick J. Sweeney II (Wiley) would be a good way to get up to speed.  This is definitely a great \\"first read\\" on the subject.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br />Part 1 - Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here's The Rest Of The Story: Taking The Mystery Out Of RFID; Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King Of The Hill; Making Basic Decisions About Your RFID System<br />Part 2 - Ride The Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics Of RFID: What Makes Up An RFID Network; Understanding How Technology Becomes A Working System; Seeing Different RFID Systems At Work<br />Part 3 - Fitting An RFID Application Into Your World: Seeing The Invisible - The Site Assessment; Testing One, Two, Three - Developing Your Own Lab; Tag, You're It - Test For Best Tag Design And Placement; Hooked On Phonics - Reader Testing, Selection, And Installation; Middle Where? - It's Not Just About The Readers<br />Part 4 - Raising The Beams For Your Network: From Pilot To Admiral - Deploying RFID Successfully; Getting Set To Administer And Maintain Your System; Ping-Pong, The Tags Are Gone - How To Monitor Your RFID System<br />Part 5 - How To Speak Bean Counter: Making The Business Case; Fitting RFID Into Strategic Plans; What To Look For When Considering Outsourcing<br />Part 6 - The Part Of Tens: Ten (Or So) Equipment Vendors; Ten Web Sites For Information On RFID; Ten Tips From The Experts; Ten (Or So) RFID Standards And Protocols<br />Appendix: Glossary of Electrical, Magnetic, And Other Scientific Terms; Index<br /><br />I've always maintained that Dummies titles can be a great \\"first read\\" on a subject if you don't even know what you don't know.  Even though the material may not go into great depth, at least you'll have the mental framework in which to place future learning.  RFID For Dummies does that and a lot more.  The author is a CEO of an RFID company, so he definitely knows the technology from the business end.  He also knows it extremely well from the technical and scientific end.  Not only will this book give you the basics on what RFID is and how it works, but it will also go into fine detail about how best to run an RFID project.  This isn't just a lot of fluffy, humorous theory in around 400 pages.  Sweeney has the battle scars from these projects, and you could conceivably use this book as an overall guide to start moving your company into RFID technology without fearing that you've bet your business on a Dummies title.<br /><br />Although I don't plan on being involved in any RFID projects to the best of my knowledge, I now have a much better understanding of the technology and its limitations.  I can also discern the difference between reality and the hype that you often hear decrying the fact that RFID tags will track our every step.

Occasionally I decide to concentrate on an author's earlier works if I've just recently discovered their material.  This time it's Jerrilyn Farmer and her first Madeline Bean culinary mystery, Sympathy For The Devil.  It seems she started out strong and has kept getting better...<br /><br />Madeline Bean and her crew have been hired to put on a Halloween party for one of Hollywood's biggest (and most disliked) producers.  Things are going quite well until, unfortunately, the host dies of strychnine poisoning.  Even worse, Bean's main partner, Wesley Westcott, is the prime suspect.  Although he did have motive and looks like he also had a way to do it, Bean is convinced he didn't and has to sort through some complex family entanglements to figure out who would benefit most from the producer's death.  Of course, this whole affair isn't doing wonders for her catering business, because who wants to hire a caterer who poisons their hosts?<br /><br />Farmer does a great job in and of itself in this novel, and it lays a good groundwork for where things are going in the future.  You're introduced to the cop who becomes a love interest in later stories, you learn how the Mad Bean Events company was formed, and you start to understand the working relationship between Mad, Wes, and Holly, their assistant.  Had I read this book first in the series, I would definitely have continued reading.  Now I'm just having fun filling in the character gaps.  Good stuff...	2005-04-16

I recently received a review copy of Joseph Rubin's book Financial Statements.xls - A Step-By-Step Guide To Creating Financial Statements Using Microsoft Excel.  While it's has good material, it's probably best for a specific niche audience...<br /><br />Chapter List: Introducing Financial Statements.xls Worksheets; Adjusting the Trial Balance; Updating the Trial Balances Data Worksheet; Balance Sheet; Income Statement; Cash Flow; Notes; Customizing the Financial Statements.xls Workbook and Presenting Information; Protecting Financial Data; Printing and Mailing Financial Statement Reports; Balance Sheet Five-Year Comparison Reports; Income Statement Five-Year and Quarterly Comparison Reports; Analyzing Financial Statements Using PivotTable and PivotChart Reports; Analyzing Financial Statements and Calculating the Ratio Analysis; Analyzing Profit Centers; Index<br /><br />I've read other books by Mr. Rubin on Excel, and his style is pretty spartan.  It's a \\"do this, do this, and do this\\" without a lot of background or explanation as to what's going on behind the scenes.  This book is probably even more so in that style.  There's a CD that contains much of the material presented in the book, so you have a starting point.  He then takes you through the steps necessary to modify and add to the spreadsheets to produce your own financial statements.  You won't get a lot of handholding, so if you don't understand something, you may have to keep banging your head against the wall to figure it out.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the opening, this book doesn't appear to be for everyone.  After going through the material, I'd feel comfortable giving it to an intermediate to advanced Excel power user who understands accounting.  S/he'll have to be comfortable with financial terms and concepts, as well as entering VBA macro code for some of the features.  Your typical computer geek might understand the Excel stuff but would be totally lost on the accounting.  An accountant who is not comfortable with Excel will be lost and frustrated in short order.  If you're the right mix of skills and this is a subject that is near and dear to your heart however, you may have found a book that will be of value to you...ho is not comfortable with Excel will be lost and frustrated in short order.

One of the latest Hacks titles from O'Reilly takes on the Linux desktop - Linux Desktop Hacks by Nicholas Petreley and Jono Bacon.  It's good stuff, but not quite what I thought it would be...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Booting Linux; Console; Login Managers; Related to X; KDE Desktop; GNOME Desktop Hacks; Terminal Empowerment; Desktop Programs; Administration and Automation; Kernel; Hardware; Index<br /><br />Like all Hacks titles, this book is made up of 100 tips and tricks that you can do and that are related to the subject matter of the book...  in this case, the Linux desktop.  I was expecting to pick up a lot of hints and tips like #55 - Reduce OpenOffice.org Startup Time, #72 - Start Desktop Applications Automatically, and #80 - Protect Yourself From Windows Applications.  Those are some cool things, and they relate directly to what I usually think of when I envision the Linux desktop.  But you'll also find things like #81 - Build a Custom Firewall Computer, #88 - Compile a Kernel, and #2 - Kill and Resurrect the Master Boot Record.  Once again, all very good and interesting stuff, but it seems to stray somewhat from the \\"Linux desktop\\" premise (or at least what I was expecting it to be).  There are also plenty of instances where you need to be up to speed with scripting skills so you can change config files or compile and install software.  I realize that the Linux desktop isn't all automated installers and such, but there seemed to be a lot of times where you always ended up back at the command line console.<br /><br />Perhaps not being a Linux or Unix geek yet, I'm inclined to think of \\"desktop\\" as graphical user interface when it actually can be a number of things.<br /><br />So...  I like the book, and if you're into running Linux as your main operating system at the desktop level, you'll get a lot out of this book.  Just be forewarned that it may not contain exactly what you expected...	2005-04-14

I received an email from the authors of this book (\\"Seed\\" & \\"German Seed\\") asking if I would be interested in reviewing it:  Seed's Sketchy Relationship Theories - A Guide To The Perils Of Dating (How Not To Become A Bar Regular).  This is definitely one of the most unusual, funny, raw, thought-provoking books I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Seed (aka Lindsay Wincherauk) expounds on his views of the male/female relationship dynamic, and he pulls absolutely no punches in letting you know how he feels and what you should be doing in order to give yourself the best chance of finding true love and happiness when it comes to discovering that special someone.  That's the broad brush to what the book is about.  *How* he says it all is what makes this unique...<br /><br />If you wanted to give this a serious review critique, you'd have a field day.  It's a self-published effort, so forget about proper grammar, editing, and sometimes even spell-checking.  And if you're offended by the use of the word \\"f**k\\", you'll only have to get over it 290 times.  Seriously.  It's stream-of -consciousness writing with plenty of rabbit trails, asides, stand-up comedy, and politically incorrect observations.<br /><br />And I really liked it.<br /><br />The same traits that would drive your high school English teacher to drink make this book very \\"real\\".  Seed has gone through more in a couple of years than most of us encounter in a lifetime.  But rather than wallow in his own misery, he learned from the experiences and came out pretty much the better for it.  He's not perfect, and he doesn't always successfully practice what he preaches.  But there's no problem admitting that.  He minces no words when it comes to labelling people, and I will guarantee there will be a number of people offended by those labels.  But in reality, those people do exist, and things would probably run a lot smoother if we stopped telling ourselves otherwise.  If you're trying to understand how relationships work in today's world, this will give you a view and input I promise you won't hear from Dr. Phil or anyone else.<br /><br />Because there is so much \\"writing as conversation\\" going on here, some parts work much better than others.  You may find Seed going from first to third person and back again in the same paragraph.  You'll get a number of totally unveiled pleadings to check out their website and buy stuff.  Some might find it all a bit much.  I personally found myself turning each page just to see where he'd head to next.  I don't need the relationship advice, as I've been married for over 20 years.

Since I've been blogging ([...]) for quite awhile, this is almost like reading a book to see if you're doing anything wrong.  Still, Susannah Gardner does a good job with Buzz Marketing with Blogs For Dummies (Wiley).<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting Started with Business Blogs: Checking Out Business Blogs; Discovering the Buzz about Buzz Marketing; Building a Business Blog<br /><br />Part 2 - Setting Up a Business Blog: Picking a Blog Solution; Setting Up a Hosted Blog; Taking Control with Independent Blog Software<br /><br />Part 3 - Minding Blog Etiquette and Culture: Understanding Your Audience; Joining the Blogosphere; Avoiding Business No-Nos<br /><br />Part 4 - Positioning Your Blog: Finding a Voice; Promoting Your Blog; Staying on the Right Side of the Law<br /><br />Part 5 - Making the Most of Your Blog: Adding Value to a Blog; Making Money with a Blog; Going Beyond Blogs<br /><br />Part 6 - The Part of Tens: Ten Dry-Spell-Breaking Ideas; Ten Traits of a Good Blogger; Ten Blogs You Should Know<br /><br />Part 7 - Appendixes: Glossary; Using the Book Blog; Hosted and Independent Blog Solutions; How URLs Work; Case Studies; Index<br /><br />Based on the title of this book, you'd probably assume that this is geared more for the business use of blogs.  And in a significant sense, it is.  But that's not to say that the serious personal blogger won't learn a number of things here.  Gardner does a good job of taking the reader from \\"what is a blog\\" through the reasons they can be very important, and finally ends with the things you need to know to keep your blog fresh and inviting.  You'd probably figure out many of these rules on your own, but the blogging world can be unforgiving.  Make a mistake involving deception, and you may never get your audience back.  Have your blog be nothing more than press releases, and no one will show up.<br /><br />She also does a good job of bridging the theory and the practical.  In addition to all the knowledge you need to understand blogging, she also takes you through some potential blogging software choices and shows how you'd use them to set up a blog.  Granted, it's not a comprehensive instruction manual on how to install and configure any one blogging package, but the reader will get an idea of what it takes.<br /><br />I also mentioned it's a good book for the serious personal blogger.  I use my blog to share information with various audiences, but it's also a personal marketing tool.  Therefore, many of the same \\"rules of the road\\" that she covers apply to me.  I'm concerned about finding my voice and style, how to attract readers, and knowing whether or not my audience is getting value from my writings.  While I've learned much of what she writes about on my own, I'd have come much further much faster if I had this book a couple years ago.<br /><br />Good stuff, and highly practical.

I think that many businesses and bosses could be so much further ahead if they read The Enthusiastic Employee by David Sirota, Louis A. Mischkind, and Michael Irwin Meltzer (Wharton School Publishing).<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Worker Motivation, Morale, and Performance: What Workers Want - The Big Picture; Employee Enthusiasm and Business Success<br /><br />Part 2 - Enthusiastic Workforces, Motivated by Fair Treatment: Job Security; Compensation; Respect<br /><br />Part 3 - Enthusiastic Workforces, Motivated by Achievement: Organization Purpose and Principles; Job Enablement; Job Challenge; Feedback, Recognition, and Reward<br /><br />Part 4 - Enthusiastic Workforces, Motivated by Camaraderie: Teamwork<br /><br />Part 5 - Bringing It All Together: The Total Organization Culture - and How to Change It: The Partnership Organization; Translating Partnership Theory into Partnership Practice<br /><br />Part 6 - Appendices: Survey Administration and Population Composition; Reliability and Validity of the Data; Job Satisfaction: Demographic, Occupational, and Regional Breaks; Comparisons with Other Norms; The Readiness Questionnaire; Endnotes; Index<br /><br />The authors have done a number of surveys of employees to get a idea of how 1) employees feel about their current jobs, and 2) what they'd like to see from their companies and management.  These findings are presented to the reader (which *should* be in management) to help them understand how their staff really thinks and works.  The conclusion is that companies can profit handsomely by understanding what their employees want and making sure they get it.  And it's not always just money.  It can be a sense of teamwork, a vested interest in making sure the company is successful, or even just the challenge of being given a difficult job along with the authority to do what's necessary to pull it off.  While not every employee is the same or is motivated by the same ideals or benefits, a company that follows the findings in this book and implement changes will find turnover plunging and job satisfaction going up to unknown levels.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading if you run a company or have staff that report to you...this book and implement changes will find turnover plunging and job satisfaction going up to unknown levels. <br /> <br />Definitely worth reading if you run a company or have staff that report to you...	2005-04-12

Regular expressions are very powerful, but extremely cryptic to read and/or understand.  Nathan A Good's book Regular Expression Recipes - A Problem-Solution Approach (Apress) does a good job in showing you practical applications of regular expressions in multiple languages.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Words and Text; URLs and Paths; CSV and Tab-Delimited Files; Formatting and Validating; HTML and XML; Coding and Using Commands; Index<br /><br />Good basically takes a number of sample problems, like finding similar words or validating U.S. dates, and then shows how the task can be done in various languages using regular expressions.  Most of the solutions have two or more language examples:  Perl, PHP, Python, Vim, GNU grep, or sed.  In addition to showing you the statement that will do the task, he also gives a brief explanation on how the statement works and why it does what it does.  This definitely wouldn't be the book you'd get in order to learn about regular expressions, but it'd be the perfect bridge between learning and doing.  As you can tell by the list of languages, you probably won't find this as helpful if you're more interested in Java or JavaScript regular expression processing.  But even then, you'll at least get the general idea of how a regular expression could be written to do a certain task, and it may spark your imagination on what it would take to apply that technique to your language of choice.<br /><br />Nice practical book, and one that would be useful for anyone who lives in the regex world...	2005-04-11

[2nd edition review]<br /><br />If you need this book, you're probably crying or swearing.  But Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies By Dan Gookin (Wiley) will help you solve the problem while putting a smile back on your face.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - What the @#$%&*!?: It's Not Your Fault! Well, It Might Be Your Fault; Stuff to Try First; Telling a Hardware Problem from a Software Problem; The \\"R\\" Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery); Your Last Resort: Tech Support<br /><br />Part 2 - Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks: This Just Bugs Me!; Gosh! This Is Embarrassing!; Startup Problems; Finding Lost Files and Things; Sounds Like Trouble; The Mystery of System Resources (and Memory Leaks); The Slow PC; Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor Dilemmas; Printer Problems; Dealing with Disk Disaster; Correcting Graphic Disgrace; Internet Connection Mayhem; Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer; E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express; General Windows Disruptions (Or, Is This PC Possessed?); Windows Can Be Your Friend; Shutdown Constipation<br /><br />Part 3 - Preventive Maintenance: Maintaining Your Disk Drives; Useful Tools and Weapons; The Benefits of Backup<br /><br />Part 4 - The Part of Tens: The Ten Rules of Tech Support; Ten Dumb Error Messages; Ten Things You Should Never or Always Do<br /><br />Appendix: Windows Startup Program Guide<br /><br />Index<br /><br />Even though I've been in Information Technology for over two decades, I generally don't do well at PC or Windows troubleshooting.  I design business software, and I basically want my hardware and operating system to just work.  While I've gotten better at troubleshooting, I'm still interested in any help I can find.  Gookin does an excellent job in targeting the specific areas that are most likely to go haywire on your home or work PC, and he then gives you some of the more common approaches to resolving those problems.  In addition, he also helps you to take ongoing steps to make sure your PC stays functional and clutter-free for as long as possible.  Following the information in this book, there's a relatively good chance you'll be able to extricate yourself from a number of blunders or problems before you start teaching your children new words that shouldn't be repeated in public.<br /><br />Long-term hardware techies or software/OS geeks will probably know most if not all of this information already.  But this is the type of book I could conceivably give my dad in order to help him fix some of his own computer problems when I'm not around.

You just *knew* that being an ex-Enron employee, I'd have to read and review this one...  Conspiracy Of Fools by Kurt Eichenwald.  I liked the book, but I'm somewhat conflicted by it...<br /><br />Eichenwald goes clear back to the early days of Ken Lay and Houston Natural Gas, the merger with InterNorth, and the resulting rise and fall of the combined company, Enron.  As a journalist for the New York Times, he covered parts of this story as it happened, and now goes into nearly 750 pages of research to try and tell exactly what happened, what decisions caused irreversible damage, and what was going on in the minds of the major players.  If you haven't read any of the other Enron books that have been written, this one will give you most of the story.  If you *have* read other Enron sagas, then much of this will be a rehash of information you've already heard.<br /><br />Did I like the book?  Yeah.  He goes into a lot of detail about how certain deals were arranged, and you get a real flavor for the internal rot that was taking over the company.  As someone who was there from 1998 until September of 2001 in the Portland Broadband unit, I was quite easily able to remember the events and emotions surrounding the culture and personalities.  From that perspective, I give this book very high marks.<br /><br />Where I have problems is that books like this have 20/20 hindsight.  Events that look so momentous as they are written about probably did not have the drama or significance attached to them at that time.  He also has to decide how to paint the different characters, and that may or may not be accurate.  Fastow and his closest associates clearly carry 90% of the blame in this book, and he's portrayed as an immature, manipulative person who let his greed destroy a company.  Of that, I have little doubt.  Lay is portrayed as a detached leader who didn't know what was going on or didn't step up in time to prevent it.  It will be interesting to see how his legal trial paints his involvement.  My biggest surprise was how he presents Skilling.  Eichenwald gives him far more room for innocence than I feel he deserves.  It's almost as if Skilling discovered this fraud at the same time everyone else did, but mentally cracked under the strain and couldn't do anything about it.  Again, the story that comes out of the trial will be interesting.<br /><br />So, if you're interested in corporate scandals, Conspiracy is a must-read.  It may or may not shed new light on the events, but it will force you to rethink some of the involvement by the major players.paints his involvement.

One of the authors I look forward to reading when new stuff comes out is Phillip Margolin.  His latest, Lost Lake, is a pretty good read...<br /><br />Ami Vergano, an independent lawyer, meets up with a drifter carpenter, Dan Morelli, and it looks like there could be the start of a relationship.  But Morelli goes overboard at a Little League game during a fight where he's defending himself, and nearly kills another parent and a cop.  During the investigation, they find that he has no record of a past, and he claims to be hiding out from a high-powered group government group who he used to work for doing killings.  In the process, Vanessa Kohler, an old lover and daughter of a person who supposedly runs this group, discovers Morelli and tries to help hide him from being found and killed.  The trick is to stay alive and try to get someone to believe their conspiracy story...<br /><br />First off, I like Margolin's stories as they are all set in Portland Oregon (where I live).  It's always fun to read a story that you can mentally watch play out because you've been to the places being described.  He also writes a pretty good crime thriller.  I don't think this is necessarily his best work.  There is a lot of psychological suspense due to the alleged conspiracy and you not knowing if it's true or not.  But with most novels dealing with conspiracies, there are a lot of mental stretches where you have to decide whether someone was framed or whether they did something that they don't admit.  Add in the mental instability issues of a character, and it's pretty easy to leave rather large holes in the plot that don't have to be filled.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading, but probably not the best one to judge his work by if you've never read him...	2005-04-09

If you're at all interested in physics and quantum mechanics but you get easily confused by a lot of it, take a look at the book The Fabric Of The Cosmos by Brian Greene.  An excellent attempt to explain hard subjects in down-to-earth terms.<br /><br />He tackles such topics as Newtonian physics, how Einstein's theories refined Newton's work, and how quantum physics completely changes the way we think about really tiny things.  Although there's a mix of provable facts and conceptual ideas, Greene does a very good job in helping the non-scientist follow the general flow of logic.  Hey, any writer who can use the Simpsons to prove the concept of the relativity of time has to be on top of his game.  :-)<br /><br />I will admit to getting lost the further I read.  The basics of physics and quantum mechanics seemed to make sense.  The concepts of time got to be a bit more difficult.  I really started to lose it at string theory, but recovered a bit at the end when he started talking about the physics of time travel.  But even not understanding everything completely, it succeeded in opening my eyes to concepts and possibilities I had never quite imagined.<br /><br />Well done book, and it should appeal to anyone with these interests...	2005-04-07

Many typical power users tend to use Excel as a psuedo-database because Access is perceived to be much more difficult.  O'Reilly's new book Access 2003 Personal Trainer by CustomGuide helps address that complexity.<br /><br />Chapter List:  The Fundamentals; Creating and Working with a Database; Finding, Filtering, and Formatting Data; Working with Tables and Fields; Creating Relational Databases; Working with Queries; Working with Forms; Working with Reports; Formatting Forms and Reports; Working with Macros; Advanced Topics; Index<br /><br />The Personal Trainer series uses a comic book-style \\"superhero\\" motif as the overall theme.  But even though the cover doesn't look all that serious, the content is very well done.  Once you're into the chapters, the only hint at the theme is a cartoon face attached to a dialog bubble for the Quick Reference material.  So if you're thinking the book isn't serious or doesn't have solid writing, give it a second glance.  Each chapter is a series of lessons with objectives and a number of tasks.  At the end, you get a lesson summary, a quiz to test your comprehension, and some homework to stretch your newly-obtained skills.  And best of all, there's a CD in the book that has Access simulation software so you can do the training without necessarily having the full Access 2003 package installed wherever you're at.  Definitely a big plus...<br /><br />I personally thought the writer(s) did a great job of managing the balance between theory and practical knowledge.  It's easy when you're an IT professional to get bogged down in all the relational database terms and concepts, whether something's in 2nd or 3rd normal form, and so forth.  This book isn't going to make you ready to design the FBI's latest crime database (or maybe it will, since the professionals didn't do such a hot job either), but it will give you enough knowledge to catalog your wine cellar or track the books you've read.  On top of that, you'll be able to build forms for data entry and generate reports to figure out what you've got or what you've done.  Basically, this book can take you from information to knowledge.<br /><br />This is a pretty good title, and one I'd definitely recommend for someone who wants to get some exposure to relational database systems...forms for data entry and generate reports to figure out what you've got or what you've done.

Here's a classic that just keeps on keep up with the state of the language...  Java In A Nutshell (5th Edition) by David Flanagan (O'Reilly).  But it's definitely getting pretty large...<br /><br />Rather than list the chapters like I usually do, I'll forego that this time in that I'll probably overrun the Amazon word limit.  Suffice it to say that if it's a core part of the Java language as of version 5.0, it's probably in here...<br /><br />The good stuff...  Flanagan has once again done an outstanding job in providing a succinct reference manual that covers the latest version of the Java language.  He's added a new chapter to cover Java 5.0 features such as generic types, enumerated types, and annotations.  There is also coverage of some new features in chapter 2, such as autoboxing and the new for/in statement.  This coverage method (most of the new stuff in one area) means that readers who are upgrading their copy can easily flag the new material they need to read.  And rather than keep a lot of older material floating around, he's also eliminated some language features that are either deprecated or are not widely used.  Granted, if *you* are one of the few using it, that's not good, but you have to draw a line somewhere.  Other than that, it's the same solid, no-fluff coverage of the Java language in the first 400 pages that you've come to expect in this Nutshell volume.  The reminder of the 1200+ pages covers Java API documentation, which is useful if you're looking for a particular method or property you're not familiar with.<br /><br />The bad part is probably the page count...  Although the print is small and the information is packed tightly, 1200 pages still makes for a pretty thick book.  Some will make the argument that you can get the last 800 pages (the API documentation) on-line, which is true.  I tend to prefer having pages I can flip through without having to do a lot of hyperlinking.  Plus you can jot down notes or flag certain parts you reference quite often.  I'm almost of the opinion that perhaps it's now time to split the book into Java In A Nutshell - volumes 1 and 2.  Put the API info in a second volume and make it easier to work with...<br /><br />I still think this is a \\"must have\\" book for any Java programmer...  It just may be time to take a hard look at the packaging for the 6th edition.st of the opinion that perhaps it's now time to split the book into Java In A Nutshell - volumes 1 and 2.

O'Reilly has a nice book that fills the niche of Windows admins looking on how to apply Linux to their environment.  The book is Linux In A Windows World by Roderick W. Smith.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Linux's Place in a Windows Network: Linux's Features; Linux Deployment Strategies<br /><br />Part 2 - Sharing Files and Printers: Basic Samba Configuration; File and Printer Shares; Managing a NetBIOS Network with Samba; Linux as an SMB/CIFS Client<br /><br />Part 3 - Centralized Authentication Tools: Using NT Domains for Linux Authentication; Using LDAP; Kerberos Configuration and Use<br /><br />Part 4 - Remote Login Tools: Remote Text-Mode Administration and Use; Running GUI Programs Remotely; Linux Thin Client Configurations<br /><br />Part 5 - Additional Server Programs: Configuring Mail Servers; Network Backups; Managing a Network with Linux<br /><br />Part 6 - Appendixes: Configuring PAM; Linux on the Desktop<br /><br />The thing that I like most about this book is that the author picks a target audience and purposes, and then successfully fights the temptation to try and tell too much.  He's writing for a Windows administrator with a basic understanding of Linux administration.  The book is designed to help that person figure out how best to integrate Linux into that network environment *without* being an end-all guide to every people of software mentioned.  He's very open about the fact that if you want to do more than the basics, you'll probably need to get specific books to explore that area.  And that's OK.  If he wanted to write a 1500 page book, he could have expanded the target.  But what he covers in less than 500 pages is excellent.<br /><br />If I were a Windows admin who wanted to figure out how to blend in Linux for certain task, this would be one of two books that I'd want.  This one would show me what I could do, and the other book would have the in-depth details of how to do it.  If you fit the target of this book, you'll do well to check this book out.t.	2005-04-05

If you've been thinking about switching to Firefox and/or Thunderbird for web browser and email, this book can help you make that switch successfully...  Firefox & Thunderbird Garage by Chris Hofmann, Marcia Knous, and John Hedtke.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Firefox - Getting Started; Protecting Your Security and Privacy; Ridding Yourself of the Annoyances of the Web; Searching the Web; BLOG - Websites to Waste Your Time With; Bookmarks and History; Harnessing the Power of Tabbed Browsing; Customizing Firefox with Third-Party Extensions and Themes; BLOG - Managing Your Blog with Extensions; Other Interesting Features; BLOG - Literary Blogs Through the Ages<br /><br />Thunderbird - Getting Started with Mozilla Thunderbird; Setting Up Your Mail, RSS, and Newsgroup Accounts Using Mozilla Thunderbird; Protecting Your Privacy and Blocking Spam; BLOG - Phishing; Organizing Your Email Topics; BLOG - My Email Tirade of the Day; Customizing the Look and Feel of Mozilla Thunderbird;<br /><br />Appendices - Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts for Firefox; Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts for Thunderbird; Menu Commands for Firebox; Menu Commands for Thunderbird; Hacking Configuration Files; Security, Certificates, and Validation; Glossary<br /><br />There are many things to like about this book.  For one, the Garage series is an irreverent style of writing that conveys a lot of information in an entertaining, conversational fashion.  In addition to the regular text (that is well illustrated), there are useful sidebars like Tool Kits and Fridges that go slightly off-topic but add some really nice tricks to your computing repertoire.  The material on Firefox and Thunderbird is extremely practical without getting bogged down in geeky details that are of little use to the normal user.  You could probably figure out a lot of this information on your own if you plugged away long enough, but by taking a little time to read this book, you'll become much more proficient with little effort.<br /><br />I personally liked the sections on themes and extensions.  The extension concept is one of the most powerful features of Firefox, and knowing that you can add functionality to your browser with a simple download will change the way you surf the web.  The authors cover a wide array of extensions, so you should find at least one or two immediate \\"must have\\" additions that you'll want to investigate.  Granted, the world of extensions and add-on software is constantly changing, so what you see in the book will change over time.  But still, it will at worst give you an impression of what's available out there.<br /><br />An excellent book for the new Firefox or Thunderbird user, and one that will give you enough new material to keep you learning for quite awhile.

Believe it or not, with all the reading I do I have never read any of Heinlein's stuff.  Someone recommended Stranger In A Strange Land to me, and I'm impressed with the guy's writing...<br /><br />The basic plotline is that a manned trip to Mars occurs but the ship loses contact once it gets to the surface.  The thought is that everyone was killed.  But a later mission reveals that there was a survivor, and it was a child that's been raised as a Martian.  He's brought back to Earth, and has to understand and learn everything there is about being human, as well as learning how to control his Martian mindset.<br /><br />I won't go into all the \\"deep significant meanings\\" in this book, as I don't do subtlety very well.  Besides, many others have done a far better job of that than I could ever hope to.  The thing that impressed me is that reading the book 45 years after it was written doesn't affect the story at all.  I expected that the science part of this sci-fi novel would be rather hokey, but it all aged very well.  With very few exceptions, the technology doesn't have that \\"futuristic\\" feel that you often saw in writings from that era.<br /><br />Good read, and I'm definitely interested in reading more of his work...	2005-04-03

If you're a Linux admin/guru who loves the command line, you'll probably really like Linux Cookbook by Carla Schroder (O'Reilly)...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Finding Documentation; Installing and Managing Software on RPM-Based Systems; Installing and Managing Software on Debian-Based Systems; Installing Programs from Source Code; Discovering Hardware from Outside the Box; Editing Text Files with JOE and Vim; Starting and Stopping Linux; Managing Users and Groups; Managing Files and Partitions; Patching, Customizing, and Upgrading Kernels; CD and DVD Recording; Managing the Bootloader and Multi-Booting; System Rescue and Recovery with Knoppix; Printing and CUPS; Configuring Video and Managing X Windows; Backup and Recovery; Remote Access; Version Control; Keeping Time with NTP; Building a Postfix Mail Server; Managing Spam and Malware; Running an Apache Web Server; File and Printer Sharing, and Domain Authentication with Samba; Managing Name Resolution; Finding Linux Documentation; On-line References; Microsoft File Types; Init Script for CVSD; Index<br /><br />The standard \\"Cookbook\\" format has a problem (such as \\"Installing YUM\\"), a solution, a discussion of the problem and solution, as well as additional reference material (either other cookbook items or external sources).  The focus is less on theory and more on practicality.  The author wants to help you learn to do something without necessarily understanding every little nuance or subtle effect.  Because one of the primary target audiences is Linux administrators, there's a strong emphasis on command line techniques.  For instance, there's a \\"recipe\\" for password-protecting LILO.  All the things you do involve entering command line statements at prompts.<br /><br />This wouldn't be the type of book you'd buy if you're looking for things you can do from the KDE or GNOME desktop environment.  You'd walk away with very little, if any, value.  But if you're an administrator who wants to tap into the full power of the command line server interface, this will be an interesting book for you...er of the command line server interface, this will be an interesting book for you...	2005-04-02

Do you have a 9 to 12 year old that wants to understand how to build their own web page?  A good choice to get them started would be Look Mom!  I Built My Own Web Site! by Zohar Amihud.  It's pretty age-appropriate to that level...<br /><br />Chapter List:  How To Begin Building A Personal Web Site; Writing Your First Web Page; Playing With Text; Add A Link; Add An Image; Playing With Color; Using A Table; Using A Table For Page Layout; Creating A Menu And Finish Building Your Web Site; What Next?; Stages Of Building Your Own Web Site; Making Your Site Live!; Choosing A Web Hosting Server For Your Web Pages; Promote Your Web Site; Index<br /><br />First off, true confessions...  My kids are past the 9 - 12 age frame.  The youngest (who happens to be the more computer-savvy of the two) is pushing 17.  But it wasn't that long ago that he wanted to start building his own home page on the web, and I had to look hard to find a book that was easy enough for him to read and learn from, while still covering all the necessary information.  Amihud does a good job striking that balance for his target audience.  The chapters up to the point of making the site live are well-detailed with plenty of pictures and age-appropriate instruction and language.  I'd guess that most pre-teens would be able to take this book and follow along with little difficulty.  I was also impressed that the teaching was for properly formatted and strict HTML...  He uses META tags, target parameters in the Anchor tags, and even uses the proper XHTML format for the BR tag.  Nicely done...<br /><br />The book gets a little iffy when you get to the parts about choosing a web hosting server.  There is a lot of talk about hosting options, domain names, service and support levels, etc.  Basically, it starts to get a little more difficult to follow the flow of information, and the style moves from more of a \\"follow this step\\" to \\"here's the information you'll need to know\\".  Much more abstract, and it will probably confuse a number of readers.  I would have liked to have seen two or three examples of hosting services listed, as well as instructions on how to upload your site to them.  I think that would have bridged the gap between theory and practical for the younger readers.<br /><br />Overall, a nice book to give your kid if he's looking to establish an on-line site...

His latest, Too Far, is no exception...<br /><br />A \\"retired\\" sportswriter, Ben Mitchell,  is trying to figure out what he wants to do after quitting his job over someone killing himself over a story.  While he's killing time in the small town he came from, a high school reporter, Sam Perry, introduces himself and asks for advice on how to proceed on a story where he has information no one else has.  The manager of the small town high school basketball team has turned up dead from a beating.  It looks to be related somehow to a hazing incident during a team camp.  When another player on the team and friend of Perry also shows \\"injuries\\" that might be part of the hazing, things start heating up.  Mitchell starts coaching Perry on how to handle the story, but soon it evolves into an effort to keep Perry, his mom, and himself from getting severely beaten or even killed.  Since the team is arguably the best high school team in the country, no one wants to rock the boat or expose anything that might be wrong.  Mitchell and Perry have to decide how important it is to tell the story and uncover the truth, no matter how unsavory it might be...<br /><br />This is not a novel for the squeamish.  Lupica deals with the issue of hazing, or team initiation events that go far beyond playful pranks.  In this case, sexual abuse is the problem, and the kids who were abused have to live with what happened as well as knowing that everyone else knows what happened.  Add the pressure and threats to keep it quiet, and you start to understand the anguish involved on the part of the kids.  You also come to understand the pressures involved by a reporter when they have to choose between the easy path of ignoring a story (sometimes for their own safety) or the harder route of exposing the truth regardless of the personal cost.  Lupica does a great job in telling a well-written story with real issues faced in today's society.<br /><br />If you're not easily offended by difficult subjects, this is an excellent read...re not easily offended by difficult subjects, this is an excellent read...	2005-03-29

The latest Madeline Bean novel arrived this week, and I've already finished it...  The Flaming Luau of Death by Jerrilyn Farmer.  Another outstanding installment in the amateur sleuth series...<br /><br />Madeline Bean, a professional caterer, decides to throw a major party for her assistant who is getting married.  So she books a party of eight over to Hawaii to put on a \\"killer\\" bachlorette weekend.  But things start going downhill before they even leave.  The assistant, Holly Nichols, tells Bean that she apparently is already married due to a prom night Las Vegas quickie that was never annulled.  Furthermore, the husband disappeared to college almost immediately and hasn't been seen since.  Now Holly is getting threatening emails from someone wanting to know where he is, and isn't content to take \\"I don't know\\" for an answer.  Once over on the island, the threats don't go away, a dead body shows up on the beach of their private luau, and Bean is mistaken for Holly, placing her in a life-threatening situation.  Add in a couple of major plot twists, shake well, and see what you get...<br /><br />Farmer is not as popular or well-known as someone like Evanovich or Grafton, but in my opinion she should be.  She does a great job with the female amateur sleuth genre, and Madeline Bean is a very likable and believable character.  The plotlines and pacing are perfect, and you're never quite sure what the next twist is going to be.  Add in her own \\"on-again, off-again\\" love interest, and Bean is an actual personality who continues to grow and evolve with each new novel.<br /><br />If you haven't tried out any of the books in the series, you're in for a treat.  Go back, start at the beginning, and enjoy.  I promise you you'll still be interested when you get to this one.  And if you're an on-going fan of Mad, you won't be disappointed.  Farmer's still at the top of her game here.	2005-03-26

This isn't so much of a \\"reading\\" book review as it is a review of a book that is laugh-out-loud funny...  Bad Cat by James Edgar.<br /><br />This is a small book (in size, not necessarily in pages) that show pictures (244 of them) of cats in humorous or outrageous poses.  Edgar adds captions to them that take the book from \\"that's funny\\" to \\"you've GOT to see this!\\".  These are not your typical cute cat pictures you'd see in some calendar or coffee table book.  No, these are photos like...<br /><br />A guilty-looking cat next to a naked Barbie doll with the caption \\"She was naked when I came in.\\"<br /><br />A disgusted cat stretched out on the piano keyboard - \\"I told you -- nobody wants to hear Billy Joel.\\"<br /><br />The cat laying next to what looks like a dead squirrel - \\"I think the play date's over...\\"<br /><br />Yes, I have a warped sense of humor...<br /><br />This is one of those books that will take you about 15 minutes to read, but you'll probably laugh more in that 15 minutes than you have all day.  If you easily offended by semi-off-color humor or if you're a cat lover who can't take a joke, then you'll probably alternate between \\"that's funny\\" and \\"that's cruel\\".  But if you don't fall into either of those two categories, this is time well spent to have a little fun...	2005-03-26

It's usually a time of anticipation when I get a new Clive Cussler novel.  Even more so since it's been awhile since I had a good recreational read.  I recently got Clive and Dirk Cussler's latest work, Black Wind from the library.  And for the first time in quite awhile, I've actually had fun reading again.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt (the father) hands over the reins of the story line to his son (Dirk Pitt \\"Jr?\\") and his daughter Summer.  Dirk and Summer are called on to investigate a biological weapons find that dates back to the end of World War II and the Japanese military.  The plan was to launch a biochemical attack against the United States from submarine-launched planes, but the subs are sunk before the attack can occur.  But unbeknownst to the Pitts, they aren't the only group looking to recover the chemicals.  A terrorist group with a definite agenda wants to complete the attack against the United States in order to help bring about their ultimate goals.  And as with all Dirk Pitt novels (like father, like son), there are a number of life and death situations with miracle escapes and unexpected plot twists.<br /><br />Now, I'll be the first to admit that I'm probably biased towards giving this book a high rating.  I've read far too much technical nonfiction material this year, and the few fiction titles I've had ended up being duds.  Cussler, working with his son on this book, delivers another very good Dirk Pitt novel while introducing two new characters into leading positions (the son and daughter).  While the interplay between the father and his good friend Giordino was sorely missed (but they both make an appearance here), I think Cussler's given himself some new material to play with.  In reality, the difference between father and son are almost nonexistent.  It's hard to remember that it's a different Dirk in the story.  But really, it didn't make any difference to me.  I enjoyed the read and I look forward to the next Cussler collaboration.	2005-03-24

I've read and enjoyed the entire Left Behind series, and I was somewhat surprised the other day to find there was a new title out...  It's The Rising - Antichrist Is Born by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.  This is a prequel to the first Left Behind title.  While it's an OK read, I don't think it did much for the series...<br /><br />Basically, the story goes back to the series of events that led to Nicolae Carpathia's birth as well as Rayford Steele's upbringing.  You find out about the supernatural/demonic influence on Carpathia's birth and education and the struggle of his mother (the \\"vessel\\") to come to grips with all the bizarre stuff going on.  Rayford's story is about his desire to be a pilot, his lackluster Christian upbringing, and his relationship and eventual marriage to Irene.<br /><br />If this book had been part and parcel of the first volume, I'd have really liked it.  The story and writing really isn't all that bad.  But I just don't think that the insight into Steele and Carpathia was worth it after reading through the entire series.  It didn't (in my opinion) shed any new light on the characters (especially in the case of Steele), and to write this book after the entire series is done seems to make little sense.<br /><br />If you can pick it up at the library and you're a fan of the Left Behind series, it's probably worth reading if you have the time.  But don't go out of your way to do so...	2005-03-22

Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you've heard about the Firefox browser and how powerful it is.  But how do you learn to harness all that power and make it work for you?  Get a copy of Firefox Hacks by Nigel McFarlane (O'Reilly).  It's the technical manual that doesn't come with the download...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Firefox Basics; Security; Installation; Web Surfing Enhancements; Power Tools for Web Developers; Power XML for Web Pages; Hack the Chrome Ugly; Hack the Chrome Cleanly; Work More Closely with Firefox; Index<br /><br />The Hacks series from O'Reilly takes the particular subject matter (in this case, Firefox) and explores 100 tips, tricks, and \\"hacks\\" that allow you to do cool things with the software.  Firefox Hacks follows the same format, but it seems to transcend the semi-randomness of other Hacks books and moves towards a solid reference manual for power users, web developers, and techno-geeks.  And that's a *good* thing...<br /><br />Because Firefox is open-source, there's a focus on making sure that the user can tweak and change things to suit their needs.  McFarlane does a very good job explaining the general structure of Firefox and how it configures itself.  Knowing these basics, the typical power user can do an incredible amount of customization with the about:config URL command.  That part of the book could be worth the price alone.  But we're not done.  Under Web Surfing Enhancements, the author starts going into a number of the extensions that can be downloaded and added to Firefox to add to the base functionality of the browser.  Want to completely change the way the tabbed browsing works?  #34 - Modify Tabbed Browsing.  Do you live to search the web?  #36 - Get More Search Tools.  Just want to waste time?  #43 - Waste Time with Toys and Games...<br /><br />The parts I found very useful were the chapters on Power Tools and Power XML.  These chapters will help you utilize the built-in tools and extensions that can make your web coding incredibly easy.  There are validators as well as debuggers that far surpass anything available in the \\"other browser choice\\" used by so many.  And given the closer adherence to standards, you'll end up with pages that are far cleaner than you can otherwise produce.<br /><br />If you've made the move to Firefox and want to start learning how to get the most out of it, get this book.

I wish I had read the book The Only Guide To A Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need by Larry E. Swedroe about six years ago...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Why Individual Investors Play the Loser's Game; Active Portfolio Management Is a Loser's Game; Efficient Markets I - Information and Cost; Efficient Markets II - Risk; The Five-Factor Model; Volatility, Return, and Risk; Six Steps to a Diversified Portfolio - Using Modern Portfolio Theory; How to Build a Model Portfolio; Index Funds, Passive Asset Class Funds, and ETFs; The Care and Maintenance of the Portfolio; Implementing the Winning Strategy; Summary; Appendices; Notes; Glossary; Recommended Reading; Acknowledgments; Index<br /><br />The main thrust of this book is how to use a passive approach to investing to consistently get market or above-market rates of return.  Swedroe makes an extremely strong case for the use of index funds as the primary investment tool.  He does this by comparing the average performance of actively managed funds, and shows statistically that in nearly all cases, it's impossible to consistently beat the market.  If you look at selected years, it's possible to \\"beat\\" the market, but over the long run the passive approach will always win.  And when you figure in the tax advantages and the administration costs of a churned fund, the gap between active and passive fund management is even greater.<br /><br />If you are an investor, it's worth reading...  Even if you don't agree, it will give you some food for thought.	2005-03-20

While it's pretty easy to understand the basic concept of web services, it's a bit harder to put it into the full Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework.  Eric Newcomer and Greg Lomow do a good job of sorting things out in the book Understanding SOA with Web Services (Addison-Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter List: Introduction to SOA with Web Services; Overview of Service-Oriented Architecture; SOA and Web Services; SOA and Web Services for Integration; SOA and Multi-Channel Access; SOA and Business Process Management; Metadata Management; Web Services Security; Advanced Messaging; Transaction Processing; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />Now, what this book *isn't* is a detailed reference manual on web services and how they work.  There are plenty of other reference sources for that.  This book is more along the lines of a very good architectural treatment of web services, something that would be appropriate for a technology architect in an organization.  The material shows not only what web services are, but how to build an environment of applications that are based on calling those services to get things done.  If you follow their advice closely, you'll find that application development can start to resemble a Lego-type structure.  You build applications by stringing together existing business processes that are encapsulated as web services.  They also cover many of the up and coming web services standards that are slowly winding their way through committee, such as WS-Trust, WS-Federation, and a multitude of other similarly named standards.  By the time you get done, you should have a pretty thorough understanding of the strong and weak points of web services, and how best to implement them in your environment.<br /><br />If web services are important to your organization (and they probably should be), this is a good book to read...	2005-03-17

For anyone interested in how computer viruses work from a technical perspective, as well as how anti-virus programs defend against them, you have to get a copy of The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense by Peter Szor.  There is no book out there that approaches it.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Strategies of the Attacker: Introduction to the Games of Nature; The Fascination of Malicious Code Analysis; Malicious Code Environments; Classification of Infection Strategies; Classification of In-Memory Strategies; Basic Self-Protection Strategies; Advanced Code Evolution Techniques and Computer Virus Generator Kits; Classification According to Payload; Strategies of Computer Worms; Exploits, Vulnerabilities, and Buffer Overflow Attacks<br /><br />Part 2 - Strategies of the Defender: Antivirus Defense Techniques; Memory Scanning and Disinfection; Worm-Blocking Techniques and Host-Based Intrusion Prevention; Network-Level Defense Strategies; Malicious Code Analysis Techniques; Conclusion; Index<br /><br />Szor is a chief researcher with Symantec, and he's been involved in the field of virus research for over 15 years.  This is what he lives and breathes.  In this book, you'll get a history lesson of how viruses have evolved from their early days as DOS programs up through the latest attacks plaguing us today.  But instead of just a narrative of how viruses work, he goes in depth with technical details involving interrupts and intercepts, how viruses hide in files, and so much more.  Once you have the entire picture of how virus code works, he switches to the topic of defense.  You quickly realize that the people who write code to fight viruses are quite incredible.  There are so many obstacles they are up against, it's amazing that they can do such a great job at the task.<br /><br />When you're done with this book, you'll have all the tools you need in order to start fighting the virus battle yourself.  Even if you're not interested in the technical details, you'll still come away with a much greater appreciation of what it takes to fight the ongoing war to keep your computer up and running without infection.

Since Covey's prior book (The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People) was such an impactful book, I decided it was necessary to read The 8th Habit - From Effectiveness to Greatness.  While it does have valuable information to convey, it's much harder to get there.<br /><br />The overriding theme of the 8th habit is to find our voice and inspire others to find theirs.  This has to do with leadership, modeling, pathfinding, empowering, and all those other concepts that you know are important but that seem to get lost in the day to day living of life.  The thing that worked so well for 7 Habits is that each concept (or chapter) was easy to understand, it was easy to place it in context with the other habits, and you could easily decide what you needed to do to implement the concept.  The 8th Habit is much more complex, and it's a system/philosophy/set of habits all to itself.  While it's easy to grasp and comprehend the idea behind being a trim-tab spirit in your organization, it's a bit more difficult trying to see the practical application of Circle Of Knowledge/Ignorance by the time you get to the end.<br /><br />I'd only recommend this book to people who are serious about leading and assisting others, and only for those who are willing to take the book in small chunks, trying hard to learn it as you go.  If you try and read the book through in a session or two, you'll come away with a few good tips, but nothing close to what Covey intended you to take away.  It's not a bad book...  it's just not nearly as intuitive as 7 Habits was...	2005-03-11

[Review of the 4th Edition]<br /><br />I really need to learn C++ some day, and I received a review copy of C++ Primer (4th Edition) by Stanley B. Lippman, Josee Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo.  If you're comfortable with lots of text, plenty of detail, and a more academic style of learning, this appears to be a good choice...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Preface; Getting Started<br /><br />Part 1 - The Basics: Variables and Basic Types; Library Types; Arrays and Pointers; Expressions; Statements; Functions; The IO Library<br /><br />Part 2 - Containers and Algorithms: Sequential Containers; Associative Containers; Generic Algorithms;<br /><br />Part 3 - Classes and Data Abstractions: Classes; Copy Control; Overloaded Operations and Conversions<br /><br />Part 4 - Object-Oriented and Generic Programming: Object-Oriented Programming; Templates and Generic Programming<br /><br />Part 5 - Advanced Topics: Tools for Large Programs; Specialized Tools and Techniques; The Library; Index<br /><br />As you can probably tell, this book covers quite an array (no pun intended) of topics related to learning C++.  And knowing that it's now in its 4th edition, it has a track record that is solid enough to allocate resources for both the publisher and authors to keep it updated and fresh.  In the tech book world, two editions of a book is commendable.  Four is not often seen, so you can trust that the others who have gone before you have fared well.<br /><br />Each chapter is sprinkled with exercises to drive home the material being covered, as well as a summary and glossary of new terms at the end of each chapter.  In many ways, it reminds me of a textbook approach to learning a new language or technology.  I can imagine the teacher lecturing from chapter 4 and then assigning exercises 2, 4, and 5.  Unlike books that assume little programming background, this volume doesn't try and step you through setting up an IDE or anything.  It covers C++...  you need to get the IDE set up on your own.  Don't assume much in the way of handholding.<br /><br />To me, this would be a good \\"geek-level\\" book if you wanted to learn the language.  No fluff, no laughs, just learning.  Probably best for someone who already has a background with technology.  If you're more in the camp of C++ being your first language to learn (you're braver than I am!), this might be too much and too hardcore.<br /><br />Of course, your mileage may vary...on your own.

Regardless of how old you are and how long you've worked, you can always learn new tools to make you more effective in life.  A book that can add to your learning is It's Your Move - Dealing Yourself the Best Cards in Life and Work by Cyndi Maxey and Jill Bremer (Prentice Hall).<br /><br />The general design of the book and plan is a series of 52 techniques, or \\"cards\\", that you can play in your life in order to improve your effectiveness in life.  The techniques are grouped into a number of sets:  preparation, attitude, visibility, style, presentation, listening, learning, balance, and flexibility.  At the end of each chapter, you are instructed to \\"draw\\" one of the cards and start to apply it to your life.  By not being able to pick and choose what you want to do, you are forced to examine possibilities that you may shy away from if given your choice.<br /><br />If  you've read books of this genre before, you'll recognize a number of the techniques...  take risks, set goals, etc.  But regardless of how many you've heard before, all it takes is one new idea to propel you forward.  Maxey and Bremer have an easy style of writing that makes it simple to understand and incorporate the idea into your life.  They also use actual personal stories to help the reader relate to the technique.  All good stuff...<br /><br />Worth reading if you're looking to make a change in your life...	2005-03-06

Once you've made the decision to give Linux a try, you face a tough second decision...  which distribution do I use?  To help you out, you should get a copy of Dee-Ann LeBlanc's Linux For Dummies (6th Edition).  There's some good information in there to help you choose...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting Your Feet Wet: Getting Acquainted With Linux; Prepping Your Computer for Linux; Installing Fedora Core; Installing Other Linux Distributions; Booting and Stopping Linux; Checking Out Those Desktops; Configuring Linux<br /><br />Part 2 - Internet Now!: Connecting to the Internet; Using the Internet<br /><br />Part 3 - Getting Up to Speed with Linux: Manipulating Files and Directories; Checking Out the Linux Filesystem; Adding Software to Linux; A Secure Linux Box Is a Happy Linux Box; Working without the GUI; Gettin' Gooey with the GUIs<br /><br />Part 4 - Getting Things Done: Putting the X in Text; Word-Processing and More with OpenOffice.org; Multimedia Wow!; Windows-Only Media Formats and Programs<br /><br />Part 5 - The Part of Tens: Ten Troubleshooting Tips; Ten Cool Uses for Knoppix<br /><br />Part 6 - Appendixes: Common Linux Commands; About the DVD-ROM<br /><br />There are obviously a large number of books you can buy that deal with Linux.  But before you get too far down the road, you need to figure out which distribution is right for you.  The main thing I really like about Dee-Ann's book is that she relates the basics of Linux back to the top six distributions:  Fedora Core, SuSE, Knoppix, Linspire, Xandros, and Mandrake.  So if you're learning about how the Linux file system works and can be navigated, you'll see that done in all six Linux flavors.  Want to know how to install Linux?  Once again, you see instructions and tips on all six.  Most Linux books pick a single distribution and focus exclusively on that.  While that's not bad at all, it may mean that you choose a type of Linux that may not be the best choice given your situation.  This book can help you understand the fundamentals before making that commitment.  There's even a DVD included that contains the install files for Fedora Core 3, Knoppix 3.6, Linspire 4.5, Mandrake 10.1, SuSE 9.2, and Xandros 2.5.  You don't even have to go searching for the latest ISO downloads!  You've got it all right here.<br /><br />Like all Dummies titles, this is written in a very conversational, non-threatening way.  It's a perfect \\"first step\\" for anyone wanting to join the Linux movement but isn't quite sure where to start.  Once you've gone through the book, picked a distribution, and installed it, you'll be ready to push on and start learning even more about Linux.

Before anyone asks, I'm not taking lessons on anything nor was there a reason I needed to read this book.  I just heard it was quite funny and well-written, so I decided to check it out...  He's Just Not That Into You by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo.  It didn't disappoint...<br /><br />Behrendt and Tuccillo were both involved in the writing duties for Sex In The City.  During one of the chat sessions in the writers room, the women were trying to figure out if a guy was sending signals to one of the girls as to whether he still liked her.  Greg just came out and told them...  \\"He's just not that into you!\\"  It was a real revelation to all of them, and it led to the writing of this book.  It's a series of letters and lessons that should help a woman understand when a guy isn't into them and the relationship any more, but can't bring himself to tell her that in so many words.  The book is probably more harsh than women want to hear (we're scum, OK?), but if they pay attention they can minimize their pain and move on to better opportunities.  The male/female perspective and interplay between the two authors is fantastic, and even if you aren't in this particular situation, the writing is funny.  I laughed a lot while reading it, but I also understood that Greg pretty well has the male species nailed down.  If we're into you, you'll know if.  If you have to guess and wonder, we're probably not (or we don't deserve you in the first place).  Of course, there are nice guys who get stuck with nasty women also, and that's not explored here.  But I'm guessing that the scenarios in the book happen more frequently than the opposite ones.<br /><br />If you're in a \\"is he interested in me\\" quandary, read the book.  If you're not but you want an entertaining read, still read the book.  Either way it will be beneficial.	2005-02-27

Even though it's a bit beyond where I am right now with Linux, I was impressed with Susan Douglas and Korry Douglas's book Linux Timesaving Techniques For Dummies (Wiley).  There are a lot of gems found in these pages...<br /><br />Chapter List: Making The Desktop Work for You; Getting the Most from Your File System; Good Housekeeping with Linux; Tweaking the Kernal on Your Linux System; Securing Your Workspace; Networking Like a Professional; Monitoring Your System; Serving Up the Internet and More; Backing Up Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry; Programming Tricks; The Scary (Or Fun!) Stuff; Index<br /><br />In many ways, this reminds me of a Hacks-style book.  There are 62 techniques outlined here that you can use to make sure your system is running at peak efficiency or to save you time during normal administration chores.  It's targeted for Fedora Core 2, SuSe, and Mandrake, so if you're running one of those distributions, you should be able to benefit from the information.  So what are some of the techniques?  #44 helps you get a MySQL server up and running quickly.  #24 helps you learn how to customize your Linux kernel if you're really into that sort of thing.  #22, Spring Cleaning Essentials, is also very beneficial both from an efficiency standpoint (fewer active processes) and a security standpoint (fewer potential paths into your system).  All the tips are like this...  very practical, and well documented.<br /><br />And if you've had the impression that Dummies titles are majorly dumbed down, this volume will squelch that opinion.  There's nothing in this book that pertains to \\"dummies\\".  I consider this a good read for someone who has a few months of active Linux experience under their belt, and they want to start exploring a few topics that start to wander from just the basic commands.  I'll be keeping this one with the rest of my Linux titles, and hopefully about six months from now I'll realize the full benefit from it.	2005-02-26

I've been doing a high volume of tech book reading lately, so getting a chance to escape into a novel by a favorite author was welcome.  That book was London Bridges, James Patterson's latest Alex Cross detective novel.  Unfortunately, this was the biggest disappointment I've had of late for an author I expect so much more from...<br /><br />Cross is apparently on vacation when two adversaries from prior novels, The Wolf and The Weasel, join forces to hold the world hostage with acts of terror.  They start out by dropping fuel bombs on small cities, virtually annihilating them (in order to show their power).  They then demand a very large sum of money and the release of some political prisoners or they will target four large international cities with supposedly hellish results.  There's a plant somewhere in the team trying to track them down, so the masterminds are always one step ahead of the good guys.  Cross has a personal stake in this, as he wants revenge for past acts committed by the two.  And so the race is on to see if Wolf and Weasel will be found before the world's major cities are destroyed.<br /><br />If you want to preserve the ending but still care about my opinion, stop reading at this paragraph with the simple statement...  This was a very poor piece of work by someone with much more talent than displayed here, and I'm not sure I'd even cut him a break if it was his first novel.<br /><br />Now into some details as to why the book was so bad...  The first part of the book was typical Cross stuff, paced well with a good plot line.  But then about halfway through, it all starts to unravel.  Cross meets Weasel on a dark street in the middle of the night, with Weasel intending to shoot him.  There's a fight, Cross has his arm sliced, but ends up killing the guy.  That's it!  No discussion about the injury, no investigation, nothing!  A major opponent is killed off, and there's nothing more in the story.  The book starts off with major destruction of cities, and then he switches to blowing up bridges when making his demands.  This is an escalation?  At the final deadline, it's said there are briefcase nukes in the four major cities.  Money is paid, and a conventional explosion occurs in Paris anyway.  Not apocalyptic by any means, and the story abruptly switches to Cross trying to find Wolf.  No more about the nukes, the threats, anything.  Huh?  Cross is \\"on vacation\\" when all this starts to happen, but midway through the book, he sounds as if he's on this case against his will and that they had no right to call him back on duty and that he might just walk out and leave.  I don't think so.  I must have been sleeping when the whole symbolism behind the bridges was revealed, because I missed it.  And the tie between Wolf and the government inside source didn't really drive any of the story that I could tell.<br /><br />I'm probably being more harsh than normal, but I know Patterson can do better.  Unfortunately I kept wondering if this was his period of decline, a la Patricia Cornwell in the Kay Scarpetta series (which I won't read any more).  I'll definitely read the next one, because I don't want to believe that Cross has run his course and that Patterson has lost his touch.  But if the next one is anything like this one, I'll be looking for another author to take his place.f cities, and then he switches to blowing up bridges when making his demands.

Allen Holub's Holub On Patterns (Apress) takes a slightly different approach that seems to work well.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Preliminaries: OO and Design Patterns 101; Programming with Interfaces, and a Few Creational Patterns; The Game of Life; Implementing Embedded SQL; A Design-Pattern Quick Reference; Index<br /><br />Don't let the short chapter list fool you.  The book runs 414 pages, and it's packed with material.<br /><br />Rather than take the traditional approach of listing patterns and then making up a variety of examples to illustrate each one, Holub reverses the process.  He takes two project implementations (Life and an embedded SQL interpreter), builds them out, and shows how patterns permeate each project.  Using that approach, you are able to see a real-world implementation, complete with warts and trade-offs.  You are also able to see how the lines between patterns can be somewhat blurry at times.  At the end, you have a nice recap of each pattern related back to the part of the project that implemented it.  From a readability standpoint, the book also shines.  The conversational nature of his writing means that you aren't feeling as if you're poking yourself in the eye repeatedly.  It's actually enjoyable...<br /><br />Couple this book with the traditional Gang Of Four book, and you cover the range from traditional theory to hands-on implementation.  Good stuff here...	2005-02-25

Another book to add to your spam prevention arsenal...  Slamming Spam - A Guide For System Administrators by Robert Haskins and Dale Nielsen (Addison-Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; Procmail; SpamAssassin; Native MTA Anti-Spam Features; SMTP AUTH and STARTTLS; Distributed Checksum Filtering; Introduction to Bayesian Filtering; Bayesian Filtering; Email Client Filtering; Microsoft Exchange; Lotus Domino and Lotus Notes; Sender Verification; Sender Policy Framework; Reporting Spam; Default SpamAssassin Ruleset; SpamAssassin Command Line Interface Reference; SpamAssassin Configuration File; DSPAM; References; Index<br /><br />I'll say right up front that this book gets bonus points for covering Notes/Domino, as most books ignore the fact that it is the leading corporate messaging system.  :-)  The book doesn't focus much on theoretical discussions of spam, what it is, and why it's bad.  It just digs into hands-on scenarios using various spam-prevention options on different system platforms.  They cover platforms such as Sendmail, Postfix, qmail, Microsoft Exchange, and Notes/Domino, so somewhere in that list you should find your mail system.  Being the book is more practical in nature, it should probably be coupled with another title that's more general in nature so that you gain a complete understanding of the subject coupled with how spammers work.  But for someone who's already covered those basics and is now ready for implementation, this is a good addition to the bookshelf.	2005-02-24

[Review of 3rd edition]<br /><br />I last reviewed this book in early 2005 when it was still in the second edition.  But with the release of Jeffrey E. F. Friedl's Mastering Regular Expressions (3rd Edition), I thought it best to give it another look.  It's still great, it's still the definitive guide to the subject, and now it gives PHP'ers more to work with...<br /><br />Contents: Introduction to Regular Expressions; Extended Introductory Examples; Overview of Regular Expression Features and Flavors; The Mechanics of Expression Processing; Practical Regex Techniques; Crafting an Efficient Expression; Perl; Java; .NET; PHP; Index<br /><br />As with the last edition, you'll find nearly everything you need to know about regular expressions here.  Since the general rules of regular expressions haven't changed much, it's not as if you're trying to learn regex version 12.5.  The main difference in this edition is that Friedl gave PHP a whole lot more coverage in this update.  PHP has become more mainstream over the last year or so, and if that's your area of interest you'll find more examples and guidelines now.  Java 1.5 and 1.6 have also emerged since the last writing, so there's a bit more clarification as to how regex coding has changed (not much).<br /><br />My initial recommendation hasn't changed one bit...  If you do anything with regular expressions in your programming, get this book, put your name in it, and don't let others borrow it...	2005-02-24

Being that I specialize in IBM software as part of my IT job, I figured that reviewing On Demand Computing - Technologies and Strategies by Craig Fellenstein (IBM Press) was a good choice.  After finishing my read, I'm somewhat torn on how to rate it...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - On Demand Business: Introduction to IBM On Demand Business; The On Demand Operating Environment<br /><br />Part 2 - Autonomic and Grid Computing: Autonomic Computing Strategy Perspectives; Grid Computing; The Future of Grid Computing; Grid Computing Strategy Perspectives<br /><br />Part 3 - Service Providers and Customer Profiles: The On Demand Business Service Provider Ecosystem; Industry Matters and Customer Profiles; Conclusions<br /><br />Appendix A - IBM On Demand Developers Conference; Glossary; Reference Materials; Acknowledgments; Index<br /><br />First, the positives...  IBM has committed to building autonomic systems; systems that monitor, adapt, and heal themselves.  Outside of this book, I don't think there are any other sources that cover the subject as much as this one does.  The material on grid computing is very well done.  Not only is there the technical foundation for how it works, but there's a fair amount of detail as to how it is implemented.  People charged with investigating and building these types of systems would be able to gain a great deal of understanding.  The material on case studies is rather interesting too.  There are a number of short pieces on companies who have changed their business processes by building/buying IBM systems that are classified as \\"on demand\\".<br /><br />Now the flip side...  I had a real tough time wading through parts of this book.  It could be that I tend to be more practical and hands-on.  The material on autonomic computing seemed to be a lot of very high-level concepts repeated over and over.  I kept thinking \\"didn't I just read that a couple of pages ago?\\"  Either the details weren't there, or I was glazed over and missed them.  I felt as if I was hearing concepts with no solid factual examples of how \\"on demand\\" is implemented.  Even the case studies at the end could, in some cases, be seen as business process reengineering and not necessarily anything radically different than other businesses that have undergone major IT initiatives.  It just so happens that they used IBM systems, hardware, and resources, and I felt as if some of the cases were labelled \\"on demand\\" on that basis alone.<br /><br />I'll give this the benefit of the doubt and assume that some of the problems might have been me.  If you want to know more about On Demand or grid computing, this is definitely the book to read.  I'll just warn you that some parts seem to be more idea-based than reality-based...m.

While I don't think that you'd find one shop running WAS on both platforms (although I could be wrong), I still found the comparison between both systems interesting.  There is definitely a different mindset between the two, and the comparisons will help you understand the side you don't work with.  I was impressed with the level of detail included also.  If you were sitting down with the WAS CDs and this book, you'd stand a very good chance of getting the system up and running, as well as having some troubleshooting material to help you out over the hard parts.  The only down side of this book is that WAS 6 has already been released, so it could be that the book is living on borrowed time.  New shops will probably go straight to 6, while shops already running WAS on 5 may be stable, in which case this book becomes more of a reference manual than an aid to installation.<br /><br />People running WAS on distributed platforms have a number of books and IBM redbooks to choose from.  The options for z/OS platforms seem to be much more limited in terms of documentation and material, so I think this book would be far more valuable to those people than to the distributed networking side.

The different chapters (with the exception of Part 3) are all designed to teach you the basics of Linux apart from any flavor.  This allows you to learn core skills that can transfer between whatever distribution you might be using at any given time.  Part 3 gives a short coverage of each major distribution available on the market.  If you're wondering about the pros and cons of each, this section of the book will help you decide where you want to start your specific distribution-specific learning.<br /><br />Like all Bible titles, this is pretty big (800+ pages).  While there's a lot of useful information, I don't know that I'd recommend this to be your *only* Linux book.  200+ pages deal with the distribution information, which leaves considerably less room for core Linux information.  The other chapters cover the gamut of Linux software (server, desktop, productivity, internet, games, etc.), so there's not a lot in in-depth coverage on any one particular area.  I'd probably position this as a very good entry level book to teach the reader about Linux and help them decide what distribution to pick.

I had heard a lot of good things about the book The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time by Mark Haddon.  After waiting for some time for it to come in at the library, I finally got the chance to read it.  It's definitely different and will make you adjust your reality...<br /><br />Christopher Boone is an autistic child who lives with his father in a small town in England.  When the neighbor's dog is found killed, Boone decides that he should do some investigating to figure out who might have done the killing.  But during his investigation, he finds out some facts about his mother and her relationship with his father that force him to re-evaluate what he feels and how he relates to the most familiar people in his life.<br /><br />This book is unique in many ways.  The story is written in first person form by the main character, Christopher Boone.  Since he's autistic and unable to understand human emotions, you are forced to see normal human transactions from a point of view that is outside of your normal experience.  Add in obsessive/compulsive behavior, and you start to understand how hard it would be to live with someone in this situation.  Reviews from people who have close experiences with that condition say that the writing is very realistic for what they experience on a daily basis.  It's also easy to see how raising an autistic child could put a major strain on a marriage.  I wouldn't want to have to manage that...<br /><br />Very good book...  Funny, sad, thought-provoking...

But I'll be buying a new desktop unit pretty soon, and at least part of the box will be running XP.  I'll need a good reference book, and so I decided to review Windows XP Bible (2nd Edition) by Alan Simpson.  While I know a lot of what's in there, there is some value for me.<br /><br />Section List:  Getting Started; Customizing Windows XP; Managing Files and Folders; Printing and Faxing; Securing Your System; Power Using the Internet; Using and Creating Digital Media; Installing and Removing Programs; Installing, Using, and Troubleshooting Hardware; Performance and Maintenance Issues; Home and Small-Business Networking; Appendixes; Index<br /><br />Normally I'd list each of the chapters, but there's 64 of them.  It'd take too long, and Amazon probably would reject the review for being over the word limit...  :-)<br /><br />The author calls this an intermediate/advanced book, as he assumes some basic computing skills before you get into the book.  I'm thinking that a fair amount of the material is still beginner level stuff if you've worked with Windows at all in your life.  That's not to say you can't learn some new tricks along the way, but explanations of files and folders is pretty basic.  Having said that, the book doesn't stay at that level.  The chapters on networking, digital media, and firewalls will get some attention from me when I get my new machine.  Likewise, I'll also be closely reading the parts on system restore, performance tuning, and driver/device management.  There are features in XP in those areas that I'm not up to speed on...<br /><br />Simpson covers a lot of ground in this book.  There's something in here for nearly everyone but the long-time XP user or the hard-core Microsoft techie.  This is one of those books that will used for a lot of first-line research.  The answer will probably often be found in these pages.  If not, you can always resort to Google.  :-)  Good stuff, and worth owning.wer will probably often be found in these pages.

Normally when a new edition of a tech book comes out, I don't feel a compelling need to rush right out and get it.  But this one is different...  Google Hacks (3rd Edition) by Rael Dornfest, Paul Bausch and Tara Calishain.  Seems like I learn something new with each new installment...<br /><br />Contents: Web; Advanced Web; News and Blogs; Extending Google; Google Maps; Gmail; Webmastering; Programming Google; Track News About Google; Index<br /><br />There are 100 tips, tricks, and hacks contained within these pages, and all of them are related to making the most of what Google has to offer.  Since Google changes seemingly by the hour, the likelihood is very good that there are new features and toys that you didn't know existed.  And that's why I like the Google Hacks book so much...  it opens my eyes to new possibilities.  For instance, my favorite hack is #51 - Google On The Go.  It talks about how Google can be used via cell phone, both with WAP *and* SMS.  I knew about using Google Maps via SMS, and it's worked well on the few occasions I've tried it.  What I *didn't* know is that you can also get SMS responses for business listings, phone lookups, Froogle prices, definitions, calculations, zip codes, sports scores, currency conversions, and even facts and figures.  I typed in \\"population of ireland\\" and sent it off to 46645 \\"googl\\".  In less than five seconds, I had the answer and the source (4,015,676 for the record).  If you're somewhere without a laptop or wifi, this could be really cool!<br /><br />There are a significant number of hacks that involve programming and scripting, mostly in Perl.  If you're not a developer or code monkey, this might be a bit intimidating.  But it also might be just what you need to dive into learning a new language tool.  They also cover the Google web API in many of the hacks, and this has me thinking of a few projects I might want to try in the Notes/Domino platform.  And any book that has me thinking of solutions while I'm reading is always a good sign.<br /><br />Even if you have the 1st or 2nd edition, don't wonder if you should go out and get #3.  Yes, you should...  Lots of new stuff to play with here...ile I'm reading is always a good sign. <br /> <br />Even if you have the 1st or 2nd edition, don't wonder if you should go out and get #3.

I recently finished the book Introduction to Computer Security by Matt Bishop (Addison-Wesley).  I hope to be fair on this review, but I'm probably going to be a little harsh...<br /><br />Chapter list:  Preface; An Overview of Computer Security; Access Control Matrix; Foundational Results; Security Policies; Confidentiality Policies; Integrity Policies; Hybrid Policies; Basic Cryptography; Key Management; Cipher Techniques; Authentication; Design Principles; Representing Identity; Access Control Mechanisms; Information Flow; Confinement Problem; Introduction to Assurance; Evaluating Systems; Malicious Logic; Vulnerability Analysis; Auditing; Intrusion Detection; Network Security; System Security; User Security; Program Security; Lattices; The Extended Euclidean Algorithm; Virtual Machines; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />OK, for the good stuff.  This is probably one of the most complete academic treatments of computer security that I've ever seen.  According to the preface, this is a \\"condensed\\" and updated version of the author's earlier work, Computer Security: Art and Science.  His three goals, which are probably met, are to show the importance of theory to practice/practice to theory, to emphasize that computer security and cryptography are different, and to demonstrate that computer security is a science *and* an art.  He also considers this book to omit much of the mathematical formalism.  And that's where I start to have problems.  In my opinion, he missed his target entirely.<br /><br />Following the statement about omitting the mathematical formalism, we have this statement:  \\"It is suited for computer security professionals, students, and prospective readers who have a less formal mathematical background, or who are not interested in the mathematical formalisms and would only be distracted by them, or for courses with a more practical than theoretical focus.\\"  Honestly, I don't know of many computer professionals holding down full-time jobs who would see this as a practical book.  There is still a lot of mathematical \\"formalism\\" for a practical book, and I didn't finish reading this book thinking that there were a number of things I'll do different now in my job.  If I were taking a college level course on computer security theory and structure, it'd probably work.  But to give this to your coworker who is studying for a security certification as well as monitoring logs on a system would make him wonder if he did something to offend him...<br /><br />If you need theory and coursework-style material, this book will give it to you.

It seems like the Hacks series just keeps getting better and better.  This time I had a chance to review the book Word Hacks by Andrew Savikas (O'Reilly).  As usual, there are a number of items here that I'll be able to use right away...<br /><br />Chapter list:  Word Under the Hood; The Word Workspace; Formatting, Printing, and Table Hacks; Editing Power Tools; Templates and Outlines; Housekeeping; Macro Hacks; Forms and Fields; Advanced Word Hacks; Word 2003 XML Hacks; Index<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the Hacks format...  It consists of 100 tips, tricks, or unique ways of doing things with the subject at hand (like Word, Excel, etc.).  The hacks are normally not things that you would find intuitively obvious, or even things that you thought were just flat-out impossible to do.  In Word Hacks, the author (along with a number of contributors) takes you on a trip into the inner world of Word and uncovers a multitude of tricks you've probably never seen...<br /><br />Wonder how to get IE to launch Word documents in Word?  That's hack # 8.  Need dummy text to fill out content in a document but you don't want to just type random characters?  Check out #14.  How about using Word as a Windows backup utility?  Yes, you can do that, and hack #81 shows you how.<br /><br />The thing I like most about this book is the profusion of VBA code to be found.  For non-programmers, this might be a hindrance in that a lot of the hacks involve using the VBA code they supply.  I can think of a number of potential readers who would be totally lost there.  But for developers who use COM to manipulate Word from other software packages, this is a treasure trove of ideas.  An excellent \\"R&D\\" resource...  \\"Rob & Duplicate\\"!  :-)<br /><br />If you're an average user of Word or a power user who doesn't want to play with code, you'll get some value here.  If you're a techno-geek who wants to program everything, this is your book.  Highly recommended...	2005-02-14

Since Domino 7 will start to incorporate web services more readily into application development, I figured it was time to start getting a little more versed on the subject.  To that end, I got a copy of Real World Web Services by Will Iverson (O'Reilly).  Coupled with a detailed tutorial/reference manual, this is a really good selection.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Web Service Evolution; Foundations of Web Services; Development Platform; Project 1: Competitive Analysis; Project 2: Auctions and Shipping; Project 3: Billing and Faxing; Project 4: Syndicated Search; Project 5: News Aggregator; Project 6: Audio CD Catalog; Project 7: Hot News Sheet; Project 8: Automatic Daily Discussions; Future Web Service Directions; Index<br /><br />While the book is smallish (206 pages), there's a lot of value packed in it.  Iverson takes you from the beginning of simple HTTP request and responses, through data scrapping, into RPC technology, and then finally into web services.  The overview really helps you to understand how we got to where we are.  He explains how to set up a simple test development environment as well as what you'll need, and then it's directly into the example projects.  Here's where the book shines.  These projects connect to live data sources such as Amazon, Google, FedEx, and eBay, so you're not dealing with simple examples that don't translate to the real world.  Each of the projects are applications that you could easily see yourself using on a daily basis, either exactly as written or with some moderate tweaking.  And since you're learning the mechanics of connecting with that service, it's easy to extrapolate the information into the areas that might interest you more.<br /><br />If you have no background in SOAP or WSDL, I'd recommend you get a foundational book that has a good tutorial and reference material.  You won't get it from this book, nor should you expect to.  It's not his intended purpose for the book.  But this is the book that will help you go from theoretical to practical, and that's worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />Very good book if you're looking to take the next step in your web services development...you go from theoretical to practical, and that's worth its weight in gold. <br /> <br />Very good book if you're looking to take the next step in your web services development...	2005-02-14

After reading his debut Bug Man novel Shoofly Pie, I knew I had to get ahold of Tim Downs' second (and latest) installment of the Bug Man series - Chop Shop.  Once again, Downs pulls off a definite winner, with even more texture than the first.<br /><br />Dr. Nick Polchak is once again censured from the university for \\"dissecting\\" a sleeping student in his class.  No matter to him, as it just gives him time to work on his forensic entomology studies... in other words, the effect of bugs on dead bodies.  He gets sidetracked when he's approached by Dr. Riley McKay, a budding pathologist in the fellowship study program of a local coroner office.  She wants Polchak to offer some opinions on some anomalies she's seeing in the cases of the head pathologist, and she's willing to pay him out of her own pocket to answer the questions.  This all leads to the door of a cutting-edge pharmaceutical company looking to manufacture custom genetically tailored medicines.  The concept is great, but there appears to be a side business going on involving the black market sale of organ transplants.  Polchak and McKay have uncovered a lot of the truth, but they really don't know who to trust to stop it all, or even if they'll survive long enough to get to that point.<br /><br />Downs' first Polchak novel was very good, but it was really just a vanilla murder mystery.  You knew there were some incidents in Polchak's life that had caused him to treat other humans with a fair amount of disdain, but none of that was really revealed.  Chop Shop starts to cover some of that ground, as well as introducing some real medical ethics that have varying degrees of right and wrong.  You meet Polchak's mother and learn a bit about his childhood that caused his withdrawal.  You also see him struggle to come to terms with the affection he feels for McKay and how that can (or should) play out in his life.  Polchak now is more than just a quirky intelligent scientist.  He's a person with feelings and a history.  This bodes well for future installments of the series.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say is this...  How much longer do I have to wait for #3???history.  This bodes well for future installments of the series. <br /> <br />The only bad thing I have to say is this...

If you're highly interested in hacking together wi-fi networks and such, you'll probably enjoy Wireless Hacking Projects for Wi-Fi Enthusiasts by Lee Barken and the SoCalFreeNet.org Wireless Users Group.  I personally had hoped for something a little different, however...<br /><br />Chapter list:  A Brief Overview of the Wireless World; SoCalFreeNet.org: Building Large Scale Community Wireless Networks; Securing Our Wireless Community; Wireless Access Points; Wireless Client Access Devices; Wireless Operating Systems; Monitoring Your Network; Low-Cost Commercial Options; Mesh Networking; Antennas; Building Outdoor Enclosures and Antenna Masts; Solar-Powered Access Points and Repeaters; Wireless 802.11 Hacks; Index<br /><br />OK, to be fair, there's a lot of technical information in this book.  SoCalFreeNet.org is a group committed to building community access wireless networks in order to offer free wireless coverage for everyone in the range of the network.  They go into great detail on the hardware to use, how to configure it, the reason for setting up an access portal, building a firewall for the network, and so on.  If this is your interest or if you're interested in starting this type of a network in your area, I don't think there's another book out there that would help as much.<br /><br />Having said that, I'd probably be a little less harsh if the book had been titled How To Build A Community Wireless Network Based On The SoCalFreeNet.org Model.  Someone who is looking to play around with wi-fi in their own house, build cantennas, or possibly control devices over the wireless network will have to dig hard in the book to find what they are looking for.  The information is there, but it seems to be secondary to the primary purpose (or what I perceive it to be), which is to spread wireless access to the masses.<br /><br />So, depending on what you're looking for, this may or may not be a good match for you.

I recently had the chance to read and review the book Internet Annoyances by Preston Gralla (O'Reilly).  All I can say is that I'm really getting hooked on this Annoyances series.  Internet Annoyances is no exception...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Chapter 1 - Email and Spam Annoyances:  General Email Annoyances; Spam; Outlook 2003 and Outlook Express; Gmail; Eudora 6<br /><br />Chapter 2 - Making The Connection Annoyances: General Connection Annoyances; Broadband: Cable and DSL Connections; Routers and Home Networks<br /><br />Chapter 3 - Wireless Annoyances: Home Wireless Networks and Routers; Cell Phones and the Net; WiFi Security; HotSpots<br /><br />Chapter 4 - Web Hosting, Design, and Blog Annoyances: Domain and Hosting Hassles; Design and Maintenance Help; Blogging<br /><br />Chapter 5 - Browser Annoyances:  Pop-Ups, Ads, and Flash; Favorites and Bookmarks; Working the Interface; Speedups and Shortcuts; Cookies<br /><br />Chapter 6 - AOL Annoyances: General AOL Annoyances; Email<br /><br />Chapter 7 - IM Annoyances: General Instant Messaging Annoyances; AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Windows Messenger; Yahoo!

Each chapter/subsection consists of a number of annoyances in the form of \\"questions\\" from readers or contributors.  Imagine a weekly newspaper Q&A column and you get the idea.  Gralla then answers the question in a straight-forward, understandable way that often includes a liberal dose of humor.  What's even better is that he often includes links to websites that offer some unique service or twist on the subject (like using Teoma as a search engine for tech subjects) or a lead to a piece of software that will dramatically change the way you do something (like the Asterisk Key utility to show you the passwords behind the asterisks in a password field).  And sometimes its just letting you know that Amazon.com *does* have a 1-800 number for customer service where you can speak to a real person (1-800-201-7575).<br /><br />You won't necessarily learn something from every tip included in the book.  You may even skip entire chapters (don't ask me questions about the AOL chapter, OK?).  But that's OK and to be expected.  Odds are that you'll pick up at least 10 - 20 tips or tricks that will make the whole book worth every penny you spend on it.

Based on the recommendation of another Amazon reviewer, I picked up a copy of Shoofly Pie - A Bug Man Novel by Tim Downs at the library.  And I think I've found another \\"must read\\" author...<br /><br />Dr. Nick Polchak is a forensic entomologist... basically a guy who studies the effects of insects on dead bodies.  Real appealing stuff.  And due to some prior hardships in his life (that aren't covered in this, the first installment of what should be a series), he's pretty much done with dealing with people and prefers to stick with his bugs.  After getting caught \\"helping\\" the police one too many times, his college exiles him to a remote area of North Carolina to do some research.  While there, a person turns up dead in a field and is ruled to be a suicide.  A long-time friend of the dead guy isn't convinced, and she hires Polchak to uncover the truth at whatever the cost may be.  Using his skills, he determines that the body had to have been moved to where it was found, and the bugs present in the wounds indicate that the death occurred somewhere else.  Now all he has to do is narrow down who is the murder while not getting himself killed in the process...<br /><br />There are quite a few things to like about this book.  Polchak is a hard-nosed \\"bug man\\" who has no problems saying or doing anything to find out what he needs to know.  He's also detached himself from a number of human emotions so that he can observe reality instead of what others think must be there.  The writing and dialogue is interesting, and the story moves at a comfortable pace.  The other unusual thing about this book is that it's put out by a Christian book publisher.  While most Christian fiction tends to weave in a strong moralistic message, there's really none of that here.  The language is clean, and its the type of book that would get a PG-13 rating in a theatre if this were made into a movie.  It's a refreshing change from novels that feel the need to use every four letter word in the book just to appear \\"real\\".<br /><br />Downs has done an outstanding job in this his first Bug Man novel.

I just finished Jimmy Buffett's meandering latest work, A Salty Piece of Land.  I liked it, but I can see how others might be somewhat bored by it all.<br /><br />The main character, Tully Mars, is on an adventure trying to escape from an unfortunate incident in his past (along with bounty hunters and trumped up charges).  For a cowboy, he has a strange affinity for the sea, and soon he and his horse end up on a slow boat to a Caribbean island.  He starts off working as a fishing guide for a new retreat there, but soon ends up on board a masted sailing ship commanded by a 100+ year old lady.  Her life goal is to restore a certain lighthouse to its former glory, and to do so she needs to track down a rare type of lens for the lighting mechanism.  This becomes Tully's goal too, and the two set out to meet people, share experiences, and track down the elusive lens.  Along the way, Tully has to watch out for the bounty hunters as well as figure out where his life is really going.<br /><br />The book is 462 pages, and I was being descriptive when I called it meandering.  The plot line is extremely loose, and there's not any sense of build-up or pacing.  It's one of those stories that could have been told in 200 pages (or less), but then it wouldn't have the flavor that it has.  I think you have to be in a laid-back mood to read it, and just enjoy the characters and the twists of life for what they are.  If you're looking for a tight, well-crafted story, this isn't it.  Conversely, if you're looking to escape into the oceans, islands, and the off-beat characters found there, this could be what you're looking for.  There's definitely plenty of Buffett to be found in the book, and I have no doubt that many of the scenes and incidents could be based on things that really happened to him.<br /><br />So, go in with an open mind and the right attitude, and just let things flow.  It's probably the best way to enjoy this one...	2005-02-06

I've read a few books on design patterns, and it's always been a lesson in patience and endurance.  They generally aren't fun to read and are a struggle to learn from.  Knowing the power of the Head First approach to technology books, I looked forward to reading Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Freeman (with Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates).  As usual, an outstanding job on a usually hard subject.<br /><br />Chapter list: Welcome to Design Patterns; Keeping your Objects in the Know; Decorating Objects; Baking with OO Goodness; One of a Kind Objects; Encapsulating Invocation; Being Adaptive; Encapsulating Algorithms; Well-Managed Collections; The State of Things; Controlling Object Access; Patterns of Patterns; Patterns in the Real World; Leftover Patterns; Index<br /><br />If you've never seen a Head First book (where have you been???), you're in for a treat.  Sierra and Bates have created a concept styled around active learning.  With a combination of pictures, crazy dialog and examples, text all over the place, and ducks (yes, the kind that go quack), Eric and Elisabeth Freeman approach design patterns in a way you've never seen (but that remain true to the Gang Of Four classic).  Each of the main chapters take a specific pattern, set up a fictional scenario, and explore how that pattern can be applied to the problem at hand.  Along the way, you learn the standard pattern usage, when and when not to use it, along with coding examples that show it being done.  The graphics and sketches cement the concepts in a way that straight code or endless paragraphs of text just can't accomplish.  When you get done, you understand the pattern almost without having made an effort to do so.  That's the unique value of the Head First concept...  All the senses are engaged (most with humor), and as a result the mind doesn't have a chance to wander off and think about what's for dinner...<br /><br />As I continue to work on learning this stuff, HFDP will be close at hand.  And I'll be able to refute the common adage \\"old dogs can't learn new tricks\\".  With Head First Design Patterns, not only can they learn new tricks, they can actually apply them!

There are obviously a multitude of ways an attacker can take your site down.  One way is via a denial of service attack.  There's a new book out that covers just that attack in great detail:  Internet Denial Of Service - Attack and Defense Mechanisms by Jelena Mirkovic, Sven Dietrich, David Dittrich, and Peter Reiher (Prentice Hall).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introduction; Understanding Denial of Service; History of DoS and DDos; How Attacks Are Waged; An Overview of DDoS Defenses; Detailed Defense Approaches; Survey of Research Defense Approaches; Legal Issues; Conclusions; Glossary; Survey of Commercial Defense Approaches; DDoS data; References; Index<br /><br />Going into this book, I can say I knew about the basics of a Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.  What I didn't understand is how sophisticated they've become.  The book covers (in deep detail) how bot or zombie networks are developed and utilized to launch these types of attacks.  I didn't realize that it's relatively easy to acquire a bot network of over 100000 clients who can flood a site with packets.  And it's not even necessary to use them all at once.  Attacks can start with a fraction of the clients, and then escalate as the victim attempts to filter packets or add bandwidth.  It's a scary thing.  The authors also cover the various issues involved in the defense of these types of attacks.  Filtering might work, but it can be difficult to find the correct filtering parameters that don't also drop legitimate traffic.  And due to the distributed nature of the attack, it can be nearly impossible to find the culprit, and worse, to prevent it from happening again.<br /><br />Walking away from this book, you don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling about the current situation.  Regardless of what steps you take, there is no current sure-fire method for defending these attacks.  But by reading Internet Denial of Service, you'll be far more prepared to understand what's going on and what realistic options do exist.  Better yet, it also gives you the steps you need to take to prepare your site for this type of incursion beforehand.  If you've mapped out your plan ahead of time, you can definitely minimize (to some extent) the damage that can occur.<br /><br />This is a good read for any security professional tasked with security and availability of an organizational website.

Since Linux in the business world is becoming a growing trend, I decided to review Moving To The Linux Business Desktop by Marcel Gagne (Addison-Wesley).  It's an interesting book that was a little different than what I expected...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting To Know Linux:  Introduction; Overview of Deployment Options; Installation; Getting Your Hands Dirty; Customizing the Desktop; Using Konqueror for File Management<br /><br />Part 2 - Administration and Deployment:  Installing New Applications; Devices and Services; Network and Internet Connections; Becoming One with the Shell; Web-based Administration; Users and Groups; Backup and Restore; Printers and Printing; Electronic Mail; LDAP; Web Services; Samba; Linux File Sharing (NFS); Thin Clients: The Server; Thin Clients: The Clients; Remote Control; Security<br /><br />Part 3 - The Linux Business Desktop:  Email Clients; Getting Organized; Surfing the Net; Word Processing (It Was a Dark and Stormy Night...); Spreadsheets: Tables You Can Count On; Presentation Graphics: For Those Who Need No Introduction!; Office Graphics and Art (Just Call Me Leonardo); Instant Messaging; Video Conferencing<br /><br />Appendixes: The GNU General Public License; Automation and Scripting; Index; About the CD-ROM<br /><br />When I first saw the book, I was thinking more along the lines of a typical user in a business environment.  What do you use for a desktop environment?  What do you use to replace Office?  How do I surf the web?  You know, all those important questions.  And Gagne does cover those areas in various chapters.  What I wasn't ready for was the coverage of the more administrative functions...  How do you manage the network?  How can you read Windows file systems?  How do you, in effect, run the entire network infrastructure with Linux as opposed to Windows or Novell?  And for me, that's where this book's value lies.  The author defines \\"Linux Business Desktop\\" in very broad terms (more so than I did), and takes it beyond the typical discussion of how to replace Windows on a PC.  As a result, a systems admin (or very savvy power user) can take this book and start to understand how a Linux infrastructure operates and is maintained.  And given Gagne's conversational style of writing, it's not a chore to wade through the book.  It's actually an enjoyable read, and it makes the learning aspect of Linux quite easy to accomplish.  If someone were to decide to set up a network and desktop environment entirely based on Linux, you'd probably want some additional titles that go into more depth on specific things like Samba or network/internet security.  But for a starter title to give you a good foundation, this book will do it.<br /><br />Very good choice for understanding the possibilities of running the whole show on Linux.

Today I finished a novel by a author who I think has a very good chance of becoming well-known in the crime thriller genre.  His name is Whitfield Grant and his book is Railroaded!  It's a commendable effort for a writer early in his career.<br /><br />The story revolves around a black football player, Tony Williams, who is a world-class athlete, extremely well-educated, and is devoted to his wife and family.  During a party at the Pro-Bowl, he spurns the advances of a woman who is coming on very strong.  Unfortunately, he is drunk at the time, stumbles off to his room, has to be helped there (by guess who), and wakes up with the woman naked next to him.  He bails, calls his wife, explains what happened (nothing in reality), and all seems to be forgiven and OK.  But then mystery letters start showing up talking about the night in Hawaii, and Tony is at a loss to stop the stalking.  He finally finds out the woman is the daughter of the owner of the team he plays for.  After a vicious crack-back block in a preseason game that severely injures him, he tries to head home courtesy of the owner and his limo.  But the daughter decides to make an appearance, jumps Tony in the car, and there's a struggle as Tony tries to get out of the vehicle. It all ends up with the woman beating Tony on the sidewalk, leaving, staging a rape with a former lover (complete with a beating for effect), and accuses Tony.  Although it looks like a easy case to try, there's a mysterious and unknown group that wants Tony completely out of the picture for reasons not revealed.  The end of the book then covers the courtroom drama, and the race to uncover the truth about what really happened and who is really pulling the strings.<br /><br />You could almost consider this Grant's first novel (he has one other one that's not yet available on Amazon).  So for purposes of discussion, let's call just it his first.  And for a first novel, it's quite well done.  He explores a lot of difficult subjects in today's society...  race, interracial relationships, prejudice, and the role of the black man in society.  He also paces the book in an interesting fashion.  The book is 322 pages, and he gets to the staged rape by page 40.  I was really curious as to what he was going to do for the remaining 280 pages, and whether the book was going to drag at that point.  In reality, the courtroom drama is where I got sucked in and started stealing minutes here and there to see what happened next.  The interplay between Williams and his two best friends is fun to see, and it's nice to see positive role models displayed without all the dirt and sleaze that seems to be so common in writing these days.<br /><br />Is the book perfect?  There are a few things that didn't sit quite right with me.  Tony and his two friends seem to be too perfect.  Having Tony and Adrian run world-record times in the 100 and the 220 while still in high school (and Tony had never run track before) was a bit of a stretch.  His two friends also seemed to anticipate bad situations all too often during the trial.  They were often more on top of things than the lawyers defending him.  And finally, the book is written with a sequel in mind, so you *still* don't really know all the reasons why Tony was targeted.  Still, the story line and Grant's style make up for that, especially given this is his initial crime novel.  I would expect that with a bit more experience, most of what I see as \\"flaws\\" will start to flatten out.<br /><br />Bottom line...  an excellent start for someone who could end up ranking up with the earlier Grisham works.  I look forward to his future books.n today's society...  race, interracial relationships, prejudice, and the role of the black man in society.  He also paces the book in an interesting fashion.

OK...  this was a fun read...  The Best of Verity Stob by Verity Stob (Apress).<br /><br />Fine, Tom...  so what's a Verity Stob?<br /><br />Eh, it's a fair question...  One I asked myself when I received the book.  Verity Stob is a long-time columnist for tech publications such as EXE, Dr. Dobb's Journal, and The Register.  She's British, so her take on things is definitely outside the normal American experience.  This book is a collection of various columns from 1998 through 2004, with a bit of unpublished stuff thrown in for good measure.  In addition, she's commented on each item with the aid of 20/20 hindsight.  The book is divided into four parts:  Life Before GUIs (1988-1994), The Rasp Of The Modem (1995-19100), After The Apocalypse (2000-2004), and Previously Unpublished.<br /><br />To be honest, I was only vaguely familiar with her name before getting the book.  I never read EXE, I've never been a DDJ fan, and The Register only pops up on my radar screen when Google News Alerts gives me something from there.  Reading the intro, I quickly became a Stob fan.  Her writing is witty and satirical, and it's almost as if she's having a conversation with the reader.  That combination usually hooks me immediately.  Now couple all that with a walk down memory lane, since I've been involved with computers since the very early '80s.  \\"STOB versus the Software Engineers\\" reminded me of far too many code reviews.  \\"Not Fairies' Footfalls\\" will be familiar to all programmers at some time in their career.  And \\"You May Start\\" will resonate with anyone who's taken a certification exam...<br /><br />Not being a Brit, I'll admit to some of the humor being a bit beyond me.  But there's more than enough here to amuse and entertain any developer who's gone through the corporate wars.  Or, if you're not a techie but just like creative and unique writing styles, give The Best a try.  Definitely worth the time to sit back and laugh at where we've all been...	2005-02-04

No company these days can afford to ignore the topic of information security, be it computers or just customer information.  The book The Executive Guide To Information Security: Threats, Challenges, and Solutions by Mark Egan with Tim Mather (Addison-Wesley) does a good job at getting CxO-level staff to consider the issues.<br /><br />Chapter list:  The Information Security Challenge; Information Security Overview; Developing Your Information Security Program; People; Processes; Technology; Information Security Roadmap; View Into The Future; Summary; Security Framework Evaluation; Information Security Web Sites; Operational Security Standards; Sample Security Job Descriptions; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Because the book is targeted at the executive level, you won't find a lot of technical nuts and bolts showing up.  People at that level don't deal with security at that level.  What *is* present are in-depth discussions of security topics such as email, spam, the internet, people, and internal processes.  All the information presented tends to tie back into lists or charts that allow the reader to formulate a program for addressing security in that particular area.  There are also a number of evaluations to establish baseline measurements of where you are in a specific area, such as the proficiency of your Information Security staff or security processes.  Using a book like this, a director level person could start to formulate a solid security infrastructure for the company that will produce targeted results.<br /><br />One of the things I also like about this book is its practicality.  Because everything ties back into \\"what do you need to do\\", there isn't much filler material hanging around.  They are also pragmatic.  Rather than declare that the sky is falling unless you obtain a perfect score, they understand that every organization is in a different spot.  You just evaluate where you are right now, note the deficiencies, determine where you need to be, and then make plans to get there.<br /><br />Definitely good reading for all managers and above at any organization.

Security professionals who find themselves trying to piece together an attack will find a lot of value in the book Forensic Discovery by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema (Addison-Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter Breakout:<br />Part 1 - Basic Concepts: The Spirit of Forensic Discovery; Time Machines<br />Part 2 - Exploring System Abstractions: File System Basics; File System Analysis; Systems and Subversion; Malware Analysis Basics<br />Part 3 - Beyond the Abstractions: The Persistence of Deleted File Information; Beyond Processes<br />Appendix:  The Coroner's Toolkit and Related Software; Data Gathering and the Order of Volatility<br />References; Index<br /><br />As attacks become more and more common in today's computing environment, it's important to know how to preserve evidence in such a way that 1) you can trace what happened and 2) the information is admissible as evidence in case of prosecution.  Farmer and Venema do a good job in showing a system administrator what steps need to be taken to safely analyze an attack.  The book is targeted towards readers with a solid understanding of Windows and Unix file systems, networking, and processes.  Readers without that background knowledge will get some of the conceptual information but will bog down on the details.  And there are plenty of details...  For instance, the authors show how information can persist in memory and on disk far longer than might be expected.  In some cases, we could be talking months or years.  Using tools that they recommend, you can analyze this \\"empty space\\" and find important clues as to what may or may not have happened.  It also underscores the importance of freezing a computer's state as soon as possible after an incident so that this empty space doesn't get overwritten and lost for analysis.<br /><br />Definitely a worthwhile addition to the bookshelf of security analysts who live this stuff on a daily basis...	2005-02-01

My recreational reading while at a software conference last week was the newest Tim Dorsey novel titled Torpedo Juice.  Like all that come before them, the book is hard to explain, but so much fun to read...<br /><br />Serge Storms, the main character in many of Dorsey's other works, is now convinced he needs to settle down and get married.  He just needs a wife, and what better way to find one than to start doing reconnaissance at local venues (complete with binoculars and tails).  He passes up an obvious choice for a librarian who seems to be completely and totally closed off socially.  But one thing leads to another, and they *do* get married, and Serge now learns that communication between husband and wife is a difficult thing.  Meanwhile, the other plotlines of the book are swirling around at tornado pace.  Anna is trying to escape a band of killers who murdered almost everyone she knows, and she's next.  The bartender at the No Name isn't quite what he seems to be.  The mystery drug kingpin who lives on No Name Key may not be either.  Will Coleman get laid, and will the lucky lady ever be the same?  Who's trying to kill Serge?  And what are all the Key West deer doing roaming around the book?<br /><br />There's no good way to describe a Dorsey novel.  I tend to think of him as Carl Hiaasen on speed.  Storms is a wacky killer who longs for the Florida that's rapidly disappearing, and he's doing everything he can to preserve it.  You'll see every stereotype of Florida natives during the story, and if you're from there you might even see yourself.  If you're looking for a measured, well-paced story with logical progressions, keep moving...  there's nothing to see here.  But if you want slapstick comedy with twists coming out of *deep* left field, this book will be perfect.	2005-01-30

O'Reilly has a series of Annoyances books on the market, and I recently had a chance to review the PC Hardware Annoyances book by Stephen J. Bigelow.  It's a really good book with an enormous number of tips and tricks to fix misbehaving computer components.<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Desktop Annoyances: Setup Annoyances; Keyboard Annoyances; Mouse Annoyances; Startup Annoyances; BIOS/CMOS Annoyances; Memory Annoyances; Processor Annoyances; Card and Port Annoyances; Maintenance Annoyances<br /><br />Laptop/PDA Annoyances: Setup/Startup Annoyances; Battery Annoyances; LCD Annoyances; PC Card Annoyances; PDA Annoyances; Maintenance Annoyances<br /><br />Graphic Annoyances: Configuration Annoyances; Driver Annoyances; Upgrade Annoyances; Desktop Annoyances; Monitor Annoyances; 3D Annoyances; Video Capture/Playback Annoyances; Player Software Annoyances<br /><br />Sound Annoyances: Configuration Annoyances; Setup Annoyances; Speaker Annoyances; CD Audio Annoyances; Music Player Annoyances<br /><br />Hard Drive Annoyances: Configuration Annoyances; Performance Annoyances; Maintenance Annoyances; Backup and Restore Annoyances<br /><br />CD/DVD Drive Annoyances: Configuration Annoyances; Performance Annoyances; Playback Annoyances; Recording Annoyances; Rewriting Annoyances; Burning Software Annoyances; DVD Player Annoyances<br /><br />Network Annoyances: Configuration Annoyances; Modem Annoyances; Cable Annoyances; DSL Annoyances; Wireless Networking Annoyances; General Networking Annoyances; Printer and File Sharing Annoyances; Firewall Annoyances<br /><br />Printer and Scanner Annoyances: Setup Annoyances; Performance Annoyances; Maintenance Annoyances; Color Printer Annoyances; Paper Annoyances; Scanner Annoyances<br /><br />Index<br /><br />As you can see, Bigelow covers a lot of ground in the book.  I almost view this as a combination between a Hacks book and a compilation of questions asked by readers.  And in fact, the compilation angle is pretty accurate.  O'Reilly solicits annoyances from a number of sources, and these submissions make up a large part of what the author writes about.  The questions can range anywhere from pretty basic (\\"my cursor skips all over the screen, and the mouse doesn't seem to be controlling it very well\\") to pretty advanced (\\"I get an HPF9XDR0 error whenever I try to print to my HP printer\\"), and Bigelow covers all of them with complete and often humorous information.  In between the annoyance/fix entries, you will find a number of warnings, tips, and tools that will make your interactions with your hardware much more error-free.<br /><br />The \\"bad\\" thing about a book like this is that *your* particular annoyance may not be covered.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do about that.  But the breath of questions covered should give you some insights that can be applied to your problem if it isn't answered directly.

What does one do when they are on a red-eye flight for six hours and can't sleep?  They read!  The target of my insomnia for this trip was Empires Of Light - Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World by Jill Jonnes.  If this is a part of history you haven't ever been exposed to, it's a fascinating read...<br /><br />Jonnes goes back to the mid-to-late 1800's and covers the story of how Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse transformed society with the power of electricity.  Back then, the predominate form of lighting was the gaslight...  dirty, smoky, and not very efficient.  Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse all had ideas about electricity and how it might be packaged in a form that could illuminate the night and run motors.  Edison was a proponent of Direct Current, or DC, power, while Westinghouse was pushing the Alternating Current, or AC, power type.  Since we obviously now have an AC power grid worldwide, you can tell who won the war over the long term.  But in the beginning, things were far from settled.  DC is a much safer power source, but it can not travel very far.  As a result, power stations had to be built all over a city to provide the necessary electricity to that area.  On the other hand, AC can travel great distances and is much more efficient, but it can be much more dangerous and deadly.  It was this safety issue that led to some of the more \\"memorable\\" events of the time, like Edison pushing AC power for an electric chair to kill someone, so that AC would be associated in the public mind as dangerous.  While Edison and Westinghouse were fighting things out on the lighting side, Tesla was a complete eccentric who wanted to invent the first AC powered motor (when it was thought that it couldn't be done).<br /><br />Being in the tech industry, what kept standing out to me was how those times were nearly identical to the dot.com era.  There are new technologies that are changing the way that people live.  Standards are nonexistent, and everyone is fighting to become the king of the new economy.  A quote that seemed so appropriate:  \\"For many years the Edison Company contented itself with flooding the country with circulars trying to ridicule the Westinghouse system.  One morning it suddenly awoke to find it had a competitor.  Now it says that if the contract is given to Westinghouse an injunction will head him off.\\"  Remind you of any software companies today?<br /><br />While the overall writing style may not be as riveting as a techno-thriller, it's good enough to carry the reader back to a time where technology was *truly* changing people's lives.  This is a must-read for people who think we are in \\"unprecedented times\\", when in reality we are just replaying the past.andards are nonexistent, and everyone is fighting to become the king of the new economy.

His latest, Life Expectancy, continues his current trend away from the bizarre supernatural and into personal \\"horror\\" storytelling.<br /><br />Jimmy Tock enters the world on a stormy night amid chaos in the hospital.  His grandfather is dying in one room, and his mother is giving birth to him in another.  The grandfather experiences a final moment of lucidity, and proclaims five days of horror for Jimmy during his life, complete with specific dates.  Meanwhile, a husband (who is a clown) goes on a killing spree in the hospital when his wife dies in childbirth.  The clown and Jimmy Tock are forever linked together at that point, and their lives intersect throughout the five days of horror over the next 30 years.  When it becomes obvious that the days in question are real and that the predictions will come true, Tock has to figure out how to survive them and keep everyone else in his life safe from harm.<br /><br />When I first started reading Koontz, his material was supernatural horror from *way* out in left field.  In fact, unless I knew someone's reading tastes well, I wouldn't recommend him as it was that strange and disturbing.  Now he's become more \\"mainstream\\" in his storytelling, and the supernatural is much more toned down.  The stories are often done in first person, like this one, so you get a real look into the mind of the main character.  This story seems to take a lot of time setting up and telling about the first day of horror, and the other days tend to go by much faster.  Conversely, you start getting the plot twists at that point, so it balances out.  Koontz also has a way of turning a word or phrase that I really like.  The main character is a baker, so much of the conversation is \\"spiced\\" with comparisons to certain types of pastry.  The banter between him and his love interest is also very well done, and I enjoyed playing out those scenes in my head.<br /><br />For fans of the earlier style of Koontz writing, you'll probably be disappointed.  But those who like the \\"kinder, gentler\\" Koontz should find plenty in here to like.rlier style of Koontz writing, you'll probably be disappointed.

As a software developer, I'm well aware of the offshoring/H1-B controversy.  When I was offered a chance to review the self-published book Dude, Did I Steal Your Job? Debugging Indian Computer Programmers by N. Sivakumar, I welcomed the opportunity.  An interesting read from the \\"other side\\"...<br /><br />The author is an Indian software engineer living in the US, and he presents his own observations and views on America's issues in the IT industry.  Aside from the stories about cultural adjustment, there's real solid material here.  He does an excellent job in differentiating between offshoring and the H1-B visa program.  And while there definitely are abuses in the H1-B program, an open-minded reader will see that there are some tangible benefits to the economy in general and the industry specifically.  I didn't realize that many of the major technology companies were started by immigrants who came to America to pursue a dream.  Not that I thought that Americans had to have started them...  I just hadn't given it much thought.  Towards the end of the book, he talks about offshoring and understands that as it is currently practiced, its usually devastating to workers.  He's also not in favor of it in its current form.  He recommends some changes to the process that would help ease the transition of affected workers, and the concepts are worth consideration.<br /><br />Getting back to the stories...  He shares a number of cultural observations and stories of what its like to be an Indian programmer in America.  Many will cause you to laugh, and far too many will cause you to wonder how we could be so rude.  He doesn't pull punches, so it's not as if he's painting Indians as poor abused minorities.  He points out the faults and oddities on both sides.  There are a lot of generalizations, as there would have to be when you're discussing a cultural group as a whole.  But I think that the typical American IT worker could learn a lot (and gain some empathy) by reading the book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a smoothly written, highly edited piece of literature, you may be disappointed.  He went the self-publishing route to tell his story, and as a result you'll see some rough edges.  But the writing is real, the views are balanced, and it's a worthy read for anyone who is trying to come to grips with the changes in the IT landscape.  You may not agree with parts of the book, but you'll be forced to put a face on the issues as opposed to dealing with \\"them\\".g the book. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a smoothly written, highly edited piece of literature, you may be disappointed.

An important part of programming that's become popular in recent years is the move towards test-driven programming.  The O'Reilly book Unit Test Frameworks from Paul Hamill can help you understand how it works and why it's important.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Unit Test Frameworks: An Overview; Getting Started: Tutorial; The xUnit Family of Unit Test Frameworks; Writing Unit Tests; Unit Testing GUI Applications; JUnit; CppUnit; NUnit; PyUnit; XMLUnit; Resources; Simple C++ Unit Test Framework; JUnit Class Reference; CppUnit Class Reference; Glossary; Index<br /><br />I've done a little work with JUnit in a prior project, and I must say the concept of test-driven programming was extremely powerful.  By building up a collection of unit tests, you can make changes to a program with complete confidence that your modifications did not break existing functionality.  This particular book can help you take the necessary steps towards understanding how to write the unit tests, and how to use the xUnit types of frameworks to assist your development regardless of language.  I'll find it useful as I start to get back into more complex Java development, plus I want to explore the use of the xUnit packages that test web applications from a user interface perspective.<br /><br />The book is supposed to be a language-independent overview of xUnit, and it basically is.  Still, a majority of the book deals with how xUnit works in Java, so that's most likely where you'll see the most value.  The other variants like NUnit and PyUnit get only a few pages, and it's a pretty high-level overview.  The book probably could have been larger (it's only 198 pages) in order to cover the other xUnit packages in more detail.<br /><br />Still, it's a very useful book, and one that you'll derive value from as you implement test-driven programming into your development plans.	2005-01-18

Syngress has created what I would call a new technical niche for publishing.  For lack of a better term, I'll call it the \\"instructional cyber-novel\\".  Their latest volume is Hacking A Terror Network - The Silent Threat Of Covert Channels by Russ Rogers.  And like the other books of this type, I really liked it...<br /><br />The core storyline revolves around an Arab student whose brother was killed many years ago when a misplaced mortar round (by western forces) blew up the cafe he was in.  The father vows revenge, and raises the student with one overriding mission...  strike back at the US.  Using hidden internet communication vehicles such as stenography, the network is formed and a terror plot is launched.  But before the first phase can be carried out, the student finally comes to grips with the fact that this hatred isn't what their religion is all about, and attempts to help the government figure out what's going to happen before disaster strikes.  I've made the plot line pretty vague, as I don't want to give away any twists or endings...<br /><br />In this instructional book, the plot line supports the technology behind covert communications.  A great deal of time is spent on the subject of stenography, which is hiding messages within pictures and .  But beyond that, they also cover how to send the data across communication protocols and use headers to hide the data.  What it comes down to is that there are nearly endless places to communicate covertly over the 'net, and trying to uncover them is nearly impossible.  The author shows plenty of software packages that facilitate this type of communication, as well as packages that help discover files that have stenography characteristics.<br /><br />They story line isn't Tom Clancy blockbuster material, but it's not meant to be.  This type of novel serves to both entertain and show how technology could be used to attack a country.  I personally really like the genre and look forward to each new book that Syngress puts out in this area.  If you're at all interested in this area of computing, you'll probably like this book.Syngress puts out in this area.

Books	3	21	22	N	N	OK for a one-time read and introduction to desktop Linux	If you have never been exposed to Linux and you'd like to see what it's all about, you might want to check out Point & Click Linux! by Robin Miller.  It's a high-level intro to Linux using a bootable Linux CD.<br /><br />Chapter List:  What You Can Do with Linux; Running the SimplyMepis CD; Working with Linux: KDE and KWrite; Installing MEPIS Linux on Your Hard Drive; KPPP - Easy Modem Dialer Application; Mozilla: Your Key to the Internet; Setting Up and Using Mozilla E-mail; Mozilla Web Browser; Making Web Pages with Mozilla; Introduction to OpenOffice.org: Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Slide Presentations, Graphics, and More; OpenOffice.org Writer; OpenOffice.org Presenter; OpenOffice.org Draw; OpenOffice.org Calc: Spreadsheets; OpenOffice.org, Microsoft Office, and StarOffice; CheckBook Tracker - Simple Bookkeeping with Linux; Kopete - IM, IRC, and General Chat; gFTP - An Easy, Powerful FTP Program; K3B - Easy CD Burning Program; The Gimp - Full-featured Graphics Application; Digikam - Importing and Organizing Digital Photos; Games! - Amusements Included with the SimplyMepis CD; Other SimplyMEPIS Applications; Downloading and Installing Software; Cooperating with Windows; Customizing Linux; Dipping a Toe Into the Command-line Waters; Joining the Linux Community; Guide to Other Popular Linux Distributions; Books that Can Help You Become More Proficient with Linux; About MEPIS and the SimplyMEPIS CD; Index<br /><br />As you can see, this book attempts to cover an enormous amount of ground in 255 pages.  And that's probably why I have a problem with how to rate this book...<br /><br />On the positive side, if you've never had any exposure to Linux and you're wondering why it's getting so much attention, this book will help.  Since it focuses on the desktop environment and the common productivity applications you'd use within Windows, the average user who wants to know what they can *do* with Linux.  There are lots of screen prints, and you have all the software included in the CD that's included with the book.  On the flip side, it's *very* high-level and superficial because it covers so much.  Once you've read through the book and tried out the CD, you may not ever open the book again.

Another one of my goals this year is to get familiar with Linux and shell scripting.  I have some \\"how to\\" books, but I also picked up Dave Taylor's Wicked Cool Shell Scripts - 101 Scripts For Linux, Mac OS X, and UNIX Systems (No Starch Press).  Taylor's done a great job with this book.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; The Missing Code Library; Improving on User Commands; Creating Utilities; Tweaking Unix; System Administration: Managing Users; System Administration: System Maintenance; Web and Internet Users; Webmaster Hacks; Web and Internet Administration; Internet Server Administration; Mac OS X Scripts; Shell Script Fun and Games; Afterword; Index<br /><br />Taylor didn't write this book as a tutorial on script writing.  Rather, he wanted to provide a \\"cookbook\\" of scripts that people could learn from and use immediately.  He also wanted something more interesting than the scripts normally found in the how to books on the market.  I'd agree that he's accomplished his purpose.  Each script starts with a listing of the code and an explanation of how it works.  He shows you how to run the script and what the results of running the script should be.  Finally, there's a \\"hacking the script\\" paragraph that explains how you might want to modify the script to do something different.  This entire package of paragraphs in each script serves as a sort of \\"mini-lesson\\" on some aspect of script writing.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I'm not quite ready for this book right now.  When I pick up some fundamentals, I'll be heading into the Web and Internet Users section.  There's code there on using Lynx and shell scripts to strip out information from websites.  I have a project in mind I've wanted to do for some time, and I think I finally found the tools that will allow me to do it.<br /><br />As a side note:  LinuxWorld Magazine voted this book the Best Shell Script Programming Book of 2004.  So I'm not the only one who thinks it's pretty good...<br /><br />A well-written book packed with a ton of practical information.

O'Reilly has a series of books by CustomGuide called the Personal Trainer series.  I had the chance to review the Windows XP Personal Trainer volume, and given the right audience, it's pretty good...<br /><br />Chapter List:  The Fundamentals; Working with a Window; Working with a Windows Program; Working with Files and Folders; Customizing the Taskbar and Desktop; Customizing Windows; The Free Programs; Working with Pictures and Multimedia; Optimizing and Maintaining Your Computer; Exploring the Internet; Passwords, Logons, and User Accounts; Networking with Windows XP; Setting Up a Network; Index<br /><br />The Personal Trainer series uses a comic book superhero motif in the design.  In some of the other titles, the theme plays out a little more strongly.  Once you get past the cover on this book, you probably won't even notice it.  Each chapter has a series of lessons that cover material related to the topic.  Each lesson is well illustrated and broken down into a step-by-step process.  To wrap up the lesson, there's a \\"quick reference\\" sidebar that recaps the particular command that was just covered.  The entire chapter wraps up with a summary, a quiz (yes, there are answers provided!), and some \\"homework\\" to stretch your understanding a bit.  Very readable and non-intimidating...<br /><br />Now, I mentioned the \\"right audience\\" to open the review.  This isn't the type of book that you'd give to an IT professional or long-time computer user.  The material starts with some fundamental Windows basics, and builds from there.  If you've been using computers for years, you'll know this stuff anyway.  But think about your parents who just got a computer for the first time.  Think about your kid who just got his first computer.  This is the type of book that a computer neophyte could open up and not be scared off within five minutes.  And even if they've conquered the basics already, the material on multimedia and setting up a home network may be information they've never ventured into.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entry level book on Windows XP for someone who needs to learn the fundamentals, I'd suggest taking a look at this one.

Something I've wanted to do for the last couple of years is learn the Perl programming language.  With that in mind, I decided to review James Lee's book Beginning Perl, 2nd Edition by Apress.  Now I can't wait to get started.<br /><br />Chapter List:  First Steps in Perl; Scalars; Control Flow Constructs; Lists and Arrays; Hashes; Subroutines/Functions; Regular Expressions; Files and Data; String Processing; Interfacing to the Operating System; References; Object-Oriented Perl; Modules; Introduction to CGI; Perl and DBI; Exercise Solutions; Index<br /><br />In my job, Perl isn't one of those things that I absolutely need.  I don't have to administer a website that is driven by Perl scripts or anything.  I simply want to learn the basics so that I can use Perl if I need to manipulate files to generate test data or things like that.  This book delivers well for that need.  Each chapter explains the basic language feature or construct with plenty of examples and explanations.  The chapter ends with a summary and additional exercises you can do to practice the skills covered in the chapter.  In all likelihood, I'll be most interested in the chapters through the string processing one.  That will give me most of the tools I'll need to manipulate the files I'll encounter.  But if I get really addicted to Perl, there's additional material here that will keep the book in the \\"highly useful\\" category.<br /><br />As I move into 2005 and start to work on my technical goals, this book will be close at hand.	2005-01-16

Janet Evanovich has launched a new set of characters in what could be a decent series in Metro Girl.  Although it's not perfect, it could grow into a decent run...<br /><br />Alex \\"Barney\\" Barnaby gets a strange call from her brother, \\"Wild\\" Bill Barnaby, that leads her to believe he's in significant danger.  She heads down to Miami and the Keys to track him down and find out if he needs rescuing.  She quickly hooks up with a NASCAR driver, Sam Hooker, aka \\"The NASCAR Guy\\", because he knows Bill and Bill has taken off with his boat.  As they start trying to track down Bill's movements and location, they quickly find that they are not the only ones looking for Bill.  Some unsavory types also want to find Bill, and they probably want to kill him rather than just talk.  At the end, she needs to figure out who are good guys and bad guys...<br /><br />The problem that Evanovich faces here is her own success.  The Stephanie Plum series is well established and is loved by the readers.  The character development is deep, and the story lines have matured since the initial episode.  By trying to launch a new series, people expect the same experience as the latest Plum novel, and that's not very realistic.  Is this a perfect novel?  No.  There's obviously a lot we don't know about Barney, and the sexual tension between her and Hooker has to start somewhere.  Could this be a good series over time?  I believe so.  I think the characters are funny and interesting, and with some development time over two or three books, it could start to come close to the success of the Plum series.<br /><br />I think it's worth reading, and it's an entertaining diversion.  If you don't keep trying to compare it to her other works, then you'll enjoy it.  If you attempt to make it an extension of the Plum series, you'll have a problem.	2005-01-15

His latest, State Of Fear, may be one of my favorites...<br /><br />Peter Evans is a lawyer who represents a rich philanthropist, George Morton.  Morton is a strong supporter of environmental causes, and he's backing an environmental activist group who is filing suit against the US government for global warming effects that threaten to completely flood the ocean island of Vanutu.  Like most people, Evans believes most of the published facts about the problems associated with the warming, and he's a firm supporter of the cause.  Things start getting strange when Morton begins to back off his support of the group, disappears for days or weeks, and is starting to act in a secretive manner.  The activist group starts pushing hard to keep the funding, but Evans is starting to get clear signs that the lawsuit is failing.  When Morton appears to die in a car accident, Evans is swept up in a effort to track down a terrorist plot that involves manipulation of environmental event.  He has to reexamine his long-held beliefs about the environment and how facts might have been twisted to sway public opinion.<br /><br />There are a couple things I really like about this book.  First off, it's a pretty good story.  The race between the terrorists and the authorities is compelling, and I enjoyed the characters and pacing.  The other thing that is commendable is Crichton's willingness to go against common wisdom and popular thinking.  For the longest time we, the public, have been fed a steady dose about global warming and how all these \\"facts prove\\" that we're harming the environment.  Crichton weaves a story with ample documentation about how the facts prove otherwise, and how our best attempts to \\"manage\\" the environment have led to even worse results.<br /><br />If I rated this book on just the story line, it'd probably get a four.  But I'm going to give it a five because he took a lot of risks.  This is a very good read.	2005-01-15

If you're at all concerned about system security, you really need to get a copy of Google Hacking For Penetration Testers by Johnny Long (Syngress).  The world is more insecure than I thought...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction; Google Searching Basics; Advanced Operators; Google Hacking Basics; Preassessment; Network Mapping; Locating Exploits and Finding Targets; Ten Simple Security Searches That Work; Tracking Down Web Servers, Login Portals, and Network Hardware; Usernames, Passwords, and Secret Stuff, Oh My!; Document Grinding and Database Digging; Protecting Yourself from Google Hackers; Automating Google Searches; Professional Security Testing; An Introduction to Web Application Security; Google Hacking Database; Index<br /><br />Long walks a fine line in this book, and I think he does it pretty well.  His goal is to show the reader how Google can be used to discover a vast array of information that most companies would not willingly divulge.  He refrains from showing exact search criteria for finding things like social security number and credit card lists.  Additionally, his screen prints of results appropriately blur exact URL information so that he's not giving up personal information.  But he does give you enough information that you can understand how certain searches could be used to find files that you may not have realized were indexed.<br /><br />If you have never used Google for anything more than simple searches from the main page, you'll get a lot of benefit from the first few chapters.  He details the Google search keywords and how they can be mixed and matched to dramatically narrow your search focus.  Even the simple act of learning how to filter for file types can be immensely valuable.  The book kicks into high gear following those first chapters.  Long works through various security assessment situations and shows how Google can map your environment far better than you imagined.  Simple things like searching for \\"Powered By\\" messages or log files with certain strings can tell an attacker what software is running and at what version.  This then allows a more refined attack based on known exploits.  But instead of leaving the book at that point, he offers some strategies for limiting the amount of information Google can access, as well as ways to remove data that has already gotten out there.<br /><br />Google Hacking could well be one of the most important security books you buy this year.  Even if you're not in charge of security for a company or organization, you should explore some of the techniques to search for your own personal information.  Just because *you* didn't expose it doesn't mean that someone else didn't.  Highly recommended read...than you imagined.

Another one of the newer books out on Eclipse is Eclipse For Dummies by Barry Burd (Wiley).  I like the book for what it is, but there are some caveats that may affect your experience...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - The Eclipse Landscape: Reader, Meet Eclipse, Eclipse, Meet The Reader; Installing Eclipse; Using the Eclipse Workbench; Changing Your Perspective; Some Useful Perspectives and Views<br /><br />Part 2 - Using the Eclipse Environment: Using the Java Editor; Getting Eclipse to Write Your Code; Straight from the Source's Mouse; More Eclipse \\"Sourcery\\"; Refactoring: A Burd's Eye View; Refactor This!; Looking for Things in All the Right Places<br /><br />Part 3 - Doing More With Eclipse: Working with Projects; Running Code; Getting Help; Squashing Bugs<br /><br />Part 4 - The Part of Tens: The Frequently Asked Questions (And Their Answers); Ten Great Plug-ins for Eclipse<br /><br />Index<br /><br />First off, what I liked...  I'm unapologetic in my liking of Dummies titles.  They mesh well with my learning style (light and humorous), and I think they do a great job in giving one a good understanding of a particular subject.  If you had never read anything about Eclipse, this book would be a good way to expose you to the functionality of the software.  I also like how Burd covers the features of the software, like refactoring and such.  Once again, when you get done with the book, you should understand how the software can help you when you're coding your programs.  Finally, it's been published since Eclipse 3 was released, so it's dealing with the latest and greatest.<br /><br />So what are the caveats?  The book deals mostly with the Eclipse as an IDE, but not so much with actual coding with it.  There are other books out there that largely cover the same material as this book does, but they have more of an emphasis on actual coding examples.  Having the practical coding examples can help cement some of the learning you'll need going forward.<br /><br />It's not that this book is bad or that it's done a bad job.  It's just that depending on what you're looking for, this may or may not be your best choice...'s not that this book is bad or that it's done a bad job.

There are definitely an abundance of books on Eclipse to choose from.  One of the latest additions to the field, Professional Eclipse 3 for Java Developers by Berthold Daum (Wrox) is a nice new choice...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction to Eclipse; Effective Programming with Eclipse; The Art of (Visual) Composition; Organizing Your Code; Project One: Duke Speaks; Project Development; Advanced Topics of Project Development; The SWT Library; JFace; Project Two: Jukebox; Developing Plug-ins for the Eclipse Platform; Developing Your Own Eclipse-Based Products; Project Three: A Spell Checker as an Eclipse Plug-in; The Rich Client Platform; Project Four: The Hex Game as a Rich Client Application; Conclusions and Outlook; Useful Plug-ins for Eclipse; Migrating Projects to a New Eclipse Version; Important Downloads; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />There are a number of things I liked about this book.  For one, it deals with the latest Eclipse release (version 3).  Although it's not a major problem to mentally translate text between 2.1 and 3.0, it's still easier to learn if both the book and the student are on the same page.  Next, Daum concentrates a lot on practicality.  The four projects included in the book cover four of the major types of development you'd face as a Java developer.  By using the projects during your learning, you should have a good grasp of Eclipse when you're finished.  Finally, I appreciate the coverage of the Rich Client Platform.  My personal opinion is that this feature of Eclipse is going to be a very big deal, and this book is one of the few that covers it in any detail.<br /><br />So, if anyone were to ask me for a recommendation on a book for Eclipse, this book would be among the top of the list.  It's good stuff.	2005-01-09

When I got back from vacation, one of the books waiting for me to review was Home Hacking Projects for Geeks by Tony Northrup and Eric Faulkner (O'Reilly).  After finishing the book, I think I need to invest in some X10 devices...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Automate A Light; Automate Your Porch Light; Remotely Monitor A Pet; Make Your House Talk; Remotely Control Your Computer; Control Your Home Theater; Build A Windows-Based Home Theater PC; Build A Linux-Based Home Theater PC; Create Time-Shifted FM Radio; Access Your Entire Media Collection Over The Internet; Keyless Entry Welcome Home; Watch Your House Across The Network; Build A Security System; Index<br /><br />Normally these types of books involve lots of soldiering and circuitry, and as a result tend to be beyond my level of expertise.  I do software, not hardware as a rule.  But the authors of Home Hacking Projects have written a book of clever things you can do with home automation, largely using the X10 protocol.  X10 is a communications protocol like TCP/IP, only it runs over power lines and is generally used to control devices plugged into outlets.  Each device has an address and can take action based on the information it sends and receives.  They start with very basic stuff such as automating a light to turn on based on a motion sensor.  From there, you get into some automation involving X10 and Perl scripts to allow X10 to be driven from your computer.  But don't worry if you don't know Perl.  The source code is included, and you can probably figure out the areas you need to tweak.  The complexity builds from there, and by the end you could happily be drilling holes in walls and such.

(This review is for the second edition)<br /><br />If you're involved in trying to port software to a Unix/Linux application platform, you should get a copy of the 2nd edition of Linux Application Development by Michael K. Johnson and Erik W. Troan (Addison Wesley).  This will become a key part of your learning.<br /><br />Chapter Breakout:<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting Started - History Of Linux Development; Licenses And Copyright; Online System Documentation<br /><br />Part 2 - Development Tools And Environment - Development Tools; gcc Options And Extensions; The GNU C Library; Memory Debugging Tools; Creating And Using Libraries; Linux System Environment<br /><br />Part 3 - System Programming - The Process Model; Simple File Handling; Signal Processing; Advanced File Handling; Directory Operations; Job Control; Terminals And Pseudo Terminals; Networking With Sockets; Time; Random Numbers; Programming Virtual Consoles; The Linux Console; Writing Secure Programs<br /><br />Part 4 - Development Libraries - String Matching; Terminal Handling With S-Lang; A Hashed Database Library; Parsing Command-Line Options; Dynamic Loading At Run Time; User Identification And Authentication<br /><br />Appendix A - Header Files; Appendix B - ladsh Source Code; Glossary; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />With the recent rapid uptake of Linux-based servers and desktops, more and more companies are looking at porting their software from Windows platforms over to Linux.  The trouble with porting in that instance is that the underlying operating system dependancies are all different, and unless you understand how to work with the OS, you're lost.  Linux Application Development does an excellent job in first introducing the common tools that are used for application development on Linux.  The assumption is that you'll be programming in C, but within that framework the authors explain each tool and how it can aid in developing your system (such as memory-checking tools that come with the GNU C library).  Once the subject of application development environments is finished, they move on to the actual OS and how it should interface with the application.  The book presents a lot of code for examples, as well as explaining exactly why things work as they do.  By the time you've gotten to the end of the material, you should have a more-than-adequate understanding of how to build applications for Linux/Unix.<br /><br />Excellent material for the application developer who needs to build on the Linux platform...e subject of application development environments is finished, they move on to the actual OS and how it should interface with the application.

It's nearly impossible to memorize all the minutiae of regular expressions, especially over multiple language implementations.  Tony Stubblebine's book Regular Expression Pocket Reference by O'Reilly is a nice way to help you out without digging through endless pages.<br /><br />Chapter List:  About This Book; Introduction To Regexes And Pattern Matching; Perl 5.8; Java (java.util.regex); .NET And C#; Python; PCRE Lib; PHP; vi Editor; JavaScript; Shell Tools; Index<br /><br />Like most pocket references, this book is small (93 pages), but there's a lot of information packed into a small space.  Each implementation chapter covers the metacharacters and metasequences that are supported in the language's implementation of regular expressions.  This is followed by the language functions, examples of regular expressions, and a list of additional resources the reader can use to learn more about regular expressions in that language.  If you don't know anything about the subject, this book (in my opinion) isn't going to help you out much.  It assumes that you already understand the material and you're looking for a reference guide to find quick answers.  And that's fine.  This book has a definite purpose and target audience, and I think it does a very nice job of hitting the mark.<br /><br />For me, this would be a perfect companion book to Mastering Regular Expressions (also by O'Reilly).  Mastering is considered one of the definitive volumes on the subject, and having this pocket guide on hand to jog your memory on lesser-used points would be perfect.	2005-01-08

Every one in awhile I find a book that far exceeds my expectations and becomes a personal favorite.  When I was stocking up for reading material to take on vacation, one of the books I picked up was Falling Flesh Just Ahead And Other Signs On The Road Towards Midlife by Lee Potts.  It was sitting there with a number of other paperbacks, the title looked funny, and some of the chapters looked amusing upon a quick glance.  Little did I know how much I'd like this book...<br /><br />You know you're into a good one when you start laughing out loud during the introduction.  When the wife asks \\"what's so funny?\\" by page 2, it's a sure-fire hit.  Lee Potts, a woman examining her move into \\"middle age\\", wrote this back in 1998.  She's probably best compared to someone like Dave Barry without being so outlandish.  Her writing style is laugh-out-loud funny, and everyone (male OR female) will be able to either relate or understand her observations.  Reading her thoughts about her doctor palpitating her breasts during an exam (\\"This is the true definition of getting old, having to pay a man to feel my breasts\\") or reliving her attempt to shape up (gaining a gap between her thighs, only to find out her butt had sagged and now showed through) had me wishing the book would go on for 300 pages instead of the mere 165 it has.  Unfortunately I can't see that she's written anything else.  Too bad, as I'd be lining up to read it.<br /><br />This may be the first book that both my wife and I have read and enjoyed equally.  It's probably the funniest book I've read in the past year or so.	2005-01-07

While on vacation, I packed his novel Icon.  An enjoyable read...<br /><br />Set in 1999, Russia is falling apart.  Elections are coming, and a dynamic personality (Igor Komarov) seems to have the hearts and minds of the people.  But things are not as they seem.  A document titled The Black Manifesto falls into the hands of an American embassy worker, and no one is quite sure what to do about it.  Written by Komarov, it outlines a return to tolitarian rule, elimination of Jews and other minorities, and an active role in the government by the Russian mafia.  A former CIA agent named Jason Monk is \\"asked\\" to once again go undercover to work behind the scenes to destabilize the election campaign of Komarov so that he isn't able to use the denunciations of external governments to his advantage.  Monk also has to avoid being caught and killed as a spy due to his prior activities in the country.<br /><br />There are a number of things that make this an intriguing novel.  The breakdown of the Soviet machine is factual, and presents a realistic backdrop to the storyline.  Forsyth also works in the CIA mole Aldrich Ames and the damage he did to destroy the entire American intelligence infrastructure in Russia.  It doesn't take a lot of effort to see this as a recounting of actual events.  The only problem I had was that nearly everything that Monk does works perfectly and seems to be a real stretch after awhile.  Still, it's a very good novel and I'll probably end up reading his other works.	2005-01-02

During my vacation, I picked up a novel by Brendan DuBois called Resurrection Day.  An interesting bit of alternative history that could have been better than it was...<br /><br />The book is set in 1972, 10 years after a thermonuclear exchange that wiped out Russia and left America dependent on the aid of others.  This all happened because of the Cuban missile crisis.  The US invaded Cuba, Cuba used tactical nukes, and the US treated that as an attack by Russia.  Most of the government was killed in the attack, and plenty of areas are still off-limits (like New York City).  Carl Landry is a reporter for the Boston Globe, and he's been contacted by someone who has documentation that shows what *really* happened during that time.  But before Landry can get the papers, the source is mysteriously killed.  Landry then becomes the focus of a number of groups who want to know what the source had, and they all think that Landry either has the inside track or possesses the papers.  When he discovers a thriving underground culture of people living in New York (who the government says don't exist), he has to figure out who to trust in order to prevent an impending invasion of the US by foreign powers.<br /><br />The book has an interesting premise, and on that point it's not a bad read.  It's also a long paperback (580+ pages), and I think that's where it breaks down.  I think this book could have been done very well in about 350 pages.  As it is, there seems to be a lot of ground that's covered repeatedly without advancing the story as quickly as it could be.<br /><br />If you're into alternative history, you'll probably like the book.  If you're looking for some escapism or an entertaining novel, you might find this one a little slow for your tastes.	2005-01-02

The last \\"vacation novel\\" I took along with me was Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down.  If you want to see the reality of war, this will deliver the goods.<br /><br />Bowden is a writer who decided to research out the story of America's involvement in Somalia, specifically the actions in Mogadishu in 1993.  The mission started out as a UN-led humanitarian effort to feed the population after years of war and the total breakdown of any sort of government.  It turned into a US action to remove a Somali warlord named Mohamed Aidid.  The whole campaign came to a head when the US ran an operation to raid a house known to house some top officials in Aidid's clan.  Due to mistakes and miscalculations, it ended with two Black Hawk helicopters being shot down, scores of dead and injured Rangers and Delta Force operators, the capture of a soldier, and images of dead US soldiers being paraded through the streets of Mogadishu.  The US commitment to the Somalia mission was questionable before the episode, and it totally evaporated after it.  Bowden takes great pains to tell the story of the soldiers who took part in the operation, and to voice their feelings and emotions of what they went through.<br /><br />As a documentary of an ugly time in US military history, Bowden has done his job well.  His research has sorted out fact from fiction, and he does a good job in telling the story without injecting personal bias until the epilogue and afterwords.  The reception from various military sources after the book was published was very positive, and speaks well to his efforts.  The book does seem to be a bit repetitive at times, as much of the action involves trying to fight their way out of tight confined quarters (or trying to navigate to a downed copter to support the downed crew).  Still, what happened is what happened, and Bowden relates it well.	2005-01-02

One of my favorite crime thriller authors is Jeffery Deaver, and I just recently had the chance to finish his book Speaking In Tongues.  Great stuff...<br /><br />Aaron Matthews, a former psychologist with a knack for talking people into things, is out to destroy the life of Tate Collier.  Collier is a trial lawyer who prosecuted Matthew's son for a killing when he was a teen.  A short time after the teen went into prison, he was brutally murdered.  Matthews wants to take the life of Collier's teenage daughter in revenge.  He does this by kidnapping the daughter after a counseling session and makes it look like a runaway.  She's taken to an old abandoned mental hospital where Matthews plans on murdering her.  Collier suspects that his daughter's disappearance is not what it seems, but everyone who can provide answers is either dying or being framed for other crimes.  The story is a race to see if Collier can figure out who is doing all this, and to find his daughter before harm comes to her.<br /><br />This is an excellent story with numerous plot twists and tight story-telling.  The interaction between Collier, his ex-wife, and the daughter (who has numerous issues) provides all the necessary color to allow the characters to struggle with both family feelings and the on-going crime investigation.  Definitely not a book that is easy to put down.	2004-12-27

Jeffery Deaver has an excellent series of novels involving the quadrapelegic criminalist Lincoln Rhyme and his protege, Amelia Sachs.  In the book The Coffin Dancer, Deaver once again delivers a fast-paced story.<br /><br />Rhyme is called in to help investigate a crime that has the marks of a former case he studied.  A contract killer known as the Coffin Dancer has been hired to eliminate three employees of an air charter company after they are marked to testify in a grand jury investigation of another shady underworld character.  The first kill is made using a bomb attached to one of the charter planes.  The evidence of that explosion is brought to Rhyme, which then starts the cat and mouse game between him and the killer.  The case is personal to Rhyme due to the nature of their original confrontation.  The story races to a conclusion as Rhyme tries to stop the killer, keep the witnesses alive, and not get Sachs killed in the process.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite Lincoln Rhyme novel so far.  The story is constantly moving, and it's like reading a chess match waged between two masters at their craft.  Even when you think you know how the story will play out, something happens to twist the story once again.  This is really one of those stories that doesn't finish until the final page.  You also gain some additional understanding behind the relationship between Sachs and Rhyme, so the character advancement means that future installments will be able to go even deeper than before.<br /><br />A definite \\"must-read\\" if you like Deaver's work.  Just make sure you can either stay up late or you don't have to work the next day...	2004-12-27

In today's business environment, it's nearly impossible to have a guaranteed job or position at a company.  Joanne Cini's book Kingmaker - Be The One Your Company Wants To Keep...

Your future is linked and interwoven to theirs, and you need to know how to manage your career to take advantage of that fact.  Cini relates wisdom and lessons learned in her 24 years in the television industry to help the reader through those landmines.<br /><br />In the first part of the book, there seems to be a lot of relating of bad incidents and how she came to leave her job.  I'll admit to being less than thrilled with the content, and started to wonder if this was going to be just a book of whining about how unfair corporate America can be.  But Part 2 is where the book came together for me.  She gets very practical about steps and attitudes that need to be present for an individual to excel in their jobs.  And if you can make yourself one of these people, then you'll be considered one of those people who companies won't let go of, and you'll do it without selling out.

I recently was contacted by Valerie Kirschenbaum, asking if I would be interested in receiving a review copy of her book Goodbye Gutenberg.  Being both an avid reader and a freelance writer, I was interested in the premise of her book.  In short, this is an outstanding book in design and concept, with only a few minor nits in the writing.<br /><br />Kirschenbaum is a high school teacher who spent a significant amount of her career trying to work with inner-city youth.  Trying to get the typical child to read a standard \\"post-Gutenberg\\" book (black and white text in solid blocks on the page) was nearly impossible.  With her background in illustrated manuscripts produced prior to the printing press, she decided to start adding color and font design to the writings, as well as illustrations and text layout that flowed on the page.  These writings started to resemble the style of the early manuscripts, and suddenly the students were working the assignments and were excited about reading.<br /><br />The premise of her book is that we are at a time in history where technology can allow us to cheaply produce \\"designer writing\\" in full color, much like the Gutenberg press allowed the common people to possess books.  But with all this technology available to us, we're still stuck in the same old black and white serif font, where the words are sterilized from the original emotions and feelings of the author.  She urges authors to become designer writers, to use fonts, colors, and illustrations to bring emotion back to the printed page.  When you look at the declining rates of reading across all age groups, it's obvious that our exposure to multimedia is rendering the printed page less attractive.<br /><br />As a writer, I fully agree with where she is trying to go.  When you read this book, her creative use of fonts and illustrations (as well as type layout) evokes more understanding than if you were to just plow through normal print.  Even if you don't necessarily accept her premise, the book is visually stunning.  The only nit I have is that she does tend to repeat the same points in each chapter, so by the end you might feel like you've already read the material earlier.  And, perhaps you have.  But even with that criticism, I still have to give the book a top recommendation.  Kirschenbaum has thrown down the gauntlet and challenged the status quo.  It's up to us as readers and writers to take up the challenge.pt her premise, the book is visually stunning.

So, what do you do when you're on a five hour red-eye flight and can't sleep?  If you're me, you end up reading.  And this flight was spent reading Weirdos in the Workplace - The New Normal... Thriving In The Age Of The Individual by John Putzier (FT-Prentice Hall).  This is an interesting read on how to effective manage \\"weirdo\\" talent in today's workplace.<br /><br />Chapter List:  How Did We Get Here, and Where Are We Going?; Individuality from Soup to Nuts; What's IN with High Performers?; Tools and Techniques to Change Others, Organizations, and Yourself; Conclusions and Universal Truths; About the Author; Weirdisms; Index<br /><br />Putzier's premise is that \\"as society goes, so goes the workplace\\".  Today's society values the individual, and the highly talented individual is allowed to be as \\"weird\\" as they want because the value they deliver is needed.  In the workplace, these people can contribute greatly to the organization, but they challenge the \\"normal\\" methods of management which have worked in the past.  This book does a great job of explaining the traits that make up the \\"weird\\" individual, and how those traits need to be managed.  With a little foresight and understanding, today's manager can effectively lead a department of these people and look like a miracle worker.  Putzier considers himself a weirdo also, and his writing style is irreverent and fun to read.<br /><br />If you think you might be a \\"weirdo\\", you need to read this to understand how the workplace is changing.  And if you manage a group of \\"weirdos\\", you absolutely need to read this in order to maintain your sanity.	2004-12-17

Ever wondered how that thing you have at the top of your head works (or doesn't work, as the case may be)?  Mind Hacks - Tips & Tools for Using Your Brain (O'Reilly) by Tom Stafford and Matt Webb is a fun read to gain insight into your cranial mysteries.<br /><br />Chapter List: Inside The Brain; Seeing; Attention; Hearing And Language; Integrating; Moving; Reasoning; Togetherness; Remembering; Other People; Index<br /><br />The Hacks series, for those who haven't read one, is a volume of 100 tip, tricks, and \\"hacks\\" into whatever the subject matter happens to be.  In this case, Stafford and Webb explore the inner workings of your mind.  The early part of the book (\\"Inside The Brain\\") does a lot of explanation as to how the brain works, as well as how we can study the mind with our current technology.  It's pretty much informational rather than \\"hands-on\\".  But starting at #13 in \\"Seeing\\", you start to delve into specific areas of the mind.  Many different studies and examples are shown (often referenced with URLs where you can follow along) that illustrate the given point.  For example, #30 (\\"Understanding The Rotating Snakes Illusion\\") explains how the random movements of our eyes can create motion where there isn't any.  #48 (\\"Detect Sounds On The Margins Of Certainty\\") show how the mind is adept in picking out signals hidden in random noise. And #75 (\\"Grasp The Gestalt\\") show how visual groupings influence how certain expectations are formed.  Excellent material, and you may finally figure out why taking a test while drunk could be a legitimate strategy for passing.<br /><br />This would also be a good book for game designers.  By learning how the brain interprets certain signals and images, it would be possible to create simulations that are more lifelike on a level beyond what is currently available.  From that perspective, this book should be required reading along with how to program games.<br /><br />Interesting read, and one that should be done sitting in front of a computer so you can experience each hack in its fullest.ting in front of a computer so you can experience each hack in its fullest.	2004-12-16

I dipped into my vacation stack of paperbacks and pulled out Seeing Eye by Jack Ellis.  Not a bad novel...<br /><br />The main character, Campbell, is a blind guy who lost his eyes in an accident.  He's not handling his blindness well, and is pretty upset at the world.  His sister is dating a guy who is doing experimental research involving neural hookups between man and dog that allows a blind human to see through the dog's eyes.  He finally consents to the experiment and travels overseas for the surgery.  The process works remarkably well, and Campbell and Shadow start to bond tightly.  But things start getting strange when he starts seeing visions involving kidnapped children.  It appears that some psychic connection between Shadow and something else is bleeding through to Campbell, and he's the only person who can possibly track down a recently kidnapped child who is about to be murdered if the killer is not stopped.<br /><br />The pacing and characters in the book are nicely done.  The idea of seeing everything through the eyes of your seeing eye dog is interesting, as are the situations where he is looking into his own face as the dog is looking at him.  Sort of like being a voyeur of your own life.  His new girlfriend is also having to adjust to the bond that is forming between him and the dog, as well as learning to deal with the visions and become involved in the attempt to save the girl's life.<br /><br />Entertaining read, nothing earthshattering, but fun nonetheless...	2004-12-15

I was recently contacted by Natalie Collins, who asked if I would be interested in reading her new book Wives And Sisters. As the premise sounded interesting and I was in between fiction titles, I readily agreed.  And I'm glad I did...  This is a well-written book with many disturbing and thought-provoking themes...<br /><br />Allison Jensen is a young girl being raised in a strict, authoritarian Mormon household.  When she was six, her and her friend Cindy were victims of a sexual predator in the woods.  She escaped but was knocked unconscious in a fall.  When she awoke, Cindy was missing, nobody knew what happened to her, and no one would discuss it with her.  This started her questioning of God and the church, as well as a series of increasingly physical abusive episodes with her father trying to bring her \\"back in line\\".  She tries to protect her younger siblings from this abuse, but finally the death of her mother pushes her over the edge.  She leaves home, rejects all of her upbringing, and starts living a life that is at odds with all that her family and the community believes.<br /><br />Eventually her younger sister weds a Mormon missionary who returned from his assignment, and Allison is not quite sure what is bothering her about the guy.  Over a short period of time, he goes from model Mormon husband to an abusive, secretive individual who makes a pass at Allison.  After some digging around, she finds out that he has a secret past that was covered up by the church elders, and there are shattered lives left in the aftermath of the cover-up.  His spiraling decline coupled with his obsession with Allison leads to a dangerous, life-threatening situation for everyone involved with her.  It also holds the answer for what happened to Cindy so many years ago.<br /><br />Let me first say that most devout Mormons would probably hate this book.  It does not portray the Mormon Church in a positive light.  It is a story of how authoritarian, secretive rule by a powerful body or organization can so easily be abused.  With the type of story and incidents used in the book, it would be just as easy to write this novel and substitute in the Catholic Church with the problems they struggle with these days.  But if you set whatever religious views you might have to the side, there emerges a strong story with deep characters and gut-wrenching emotions.  It's written in the first-person style, and you almost wonder at times if the author is telling her own story.  It comes across as that authentic.  And while the \\"bad guys\\" in the story have a litany of faults, you almost feel some pity for them at the end as you start to understand how they've come to be what they are.  It's not a \\"feel good\\" story with a nice happy ending to wrap it all up, but it's an emotionally satisfying read as you know you've seen the depths of writing that isn't always present.<br /><br />An excellent job by a very talented writer...  Highly recommended.powerful body or organization can so easily be abused.

But if you set whatever religious views you might have to the side, there emerges a strong story with deep characters and gut-wrenching emotions.  It's written in the first-person style, and you almost wonder at times if the author is telling her own story.  It comes across as that authentic.  And while the \\"bad guys\\" in the story have a litany of faults, you almost feel some pity for them at the end as you start to understand how they've come to be what they are.  It's not a \\"feel good\\" story with a nice happy ending to wrap it all up, but it's an emotionally satisfying read as you know you've seen the depths of writing that isn't always present. <br /> <br />An excellent job by a very talented writer...  Highly recommended.	2004-12-11

As computers have gotten smaller and faster, developers have become more and more removed from the lowest levels of programming.  Randall Hyde's new book Write Great Code - Volume 1: Understanding The Machine (No Starch Press) will help you get back to the basic levels of how computers work and how that affects your programming.<br /><br />Chapter List:  What You Need To Know To Write Great Code; Numeric Representation; Binary Arithmetic And Bit Operation; Floating-Point Representation; Character Representation; Memory Organization And Access; Composite Data Types And Memory Objects; Boolean Logic And Digital Design; CPU Architecture; Instruction Set Architecture; Memory Architecture And Organization; Input And Output (I/O); Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level; ASCII Character Set; Index<br /><br />It used to be you couldn't program at all without knowing this material.  The design of a program was tied closely to the machine architecture, and it drove the instruction set and the overall programming decisions.  But now the higher-level programs have made it easier for mere mortals to write a program and be completely oblivious to how a CPU executes an instruction or loads data from memory.  Hyde goes into great detail on all the instructional design and theory, and I'd venture to guess that a very small number of programmers (and I'm not one of them) know most of this information.  The assumption is that you'll know at least one procedural language (like C, C++, BASIC, or assembly).  He rotates examples among C, C++, Pascal, BASIC, and assembly so as to keep the examples as language-neutral as possible.  The goal when you finish the reading is that you should understand exactly how the architecture of a CPU affects your program, and how to make programming decisions that will lead to efficient programs.  This volume will be followed up by another book titled Think Low-Level, Write High-Level.  For me, I think this is where a lot of this information will come together.<br /><br />Foundational information presented in great detail, and a book that all serious developers should take the time to read and understand.together. <br /> <br />Foundational information presented in great detail, and a book that all serious developers should take the time to read and understand.	2004-12-06

In order to fight an enemy, you have to understand him.  And in order to fight spam, you need to understand the mindset of the spammer.  To do that, pick up a copy of Inside the SPAM Cartel by Spammer-X (Syngress).<br /><br />Chapter List:  Inside the Head of a Spammer; How Spam Works; Sending Spam; Your E-mail: Digital Gold; Creating the Message and Getting It Read; Spam Filters: Detection and Evasion; Spam Filters: Advanced Detection and Evasion; Phishing and Scam Spam; Spam and the Law; Analyzing Spam; The Real Cost of Spam; Statistics of Spam; The Future of Spam; FAQs of Spam; Closing Comments; Combating Spam with Exchange Server and Outlook; Index<br /><br />This book is written from the first-person perspective of a spammer, and goes into great detail about the mentality and technology of spamming.  Whether Spammer-X is a real person or not is irrelevant.  The information is excellent and will definitely aid anyone who is responsible for combatting spam in an organization.  He covers everything from how spammers make their money, how they hide their tracks, what technology they use to send out the mailings, and what techniques are used to prevent the money from being tracked.  If you're trying to figure out where a spam email originates from, you'll learn how to read the headers to deduce what's real and what's not.  It's definitely interesting to read about the whole spam process from a \\"spammer friendly\\" perspective.  The argument could be made that this is a handbook on how to become a spammer, but it's also important to know what the \\"enemy\\" is up against.  I think it has much more value in that way.<br /><br />My only complaint with the book is that the editing process of the writing must have broken down somewhere here.  There are a number of typos and grammatical errors in the book.  If the book wasn't so interesting and useful, I'd probably mark it down a notch for that.  But the value of the material can't be overlooked, so I'll award it the top rating on Amazon... 5 stars.rating on Amazon... 5 stars.	2004-12-05

While waiting for my wife to browse quilting books at Powell's book store, I wandered down an aisle and breezed through an entertaining book that caught my eye...  Odd Jobs: Portraits Of Unusual Occupations by Nancy Rica Schiff.<br /><br />Schiff came across a person with an unusual job one day...  the official timekeeper at a horse race track.  She then started wondering about other \\"unusual\\" jobs that people have, and set out to find those jobs and photograph the people who do them.  The result is this book.  It's not large, only 152 pages.  The format is a set of opposite pages for each job.  The description of the job and person is on the left, along with a picture of the job and person on the right.  And we're talking some really unusual jobs...  How about a condom tester held by a lady who is definitely old enough to be your grandmother?  A person who milks venom from snakes.  A mortuary beautician who prepares bodies for their \\"final viewing\\".  Dog walker, bull inseminator, tampon tester...  all things that need to be done, but you probably don't really think about (or *want* to think about) the people or skills it takes to do them.<br /><br />So if you're feeling that your job is horrible and you'd like to do something different, take 15 minutes or so and glance through this book.  You'll either come back with some new employment possibilities or figure out that your job isn't so bad after all!	2004-12-05

The flexibility of XML can often mean that there's a gap between using XML and using XML effectively.  Elliotte Rusty Harold's book Effective XML - 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your XML (Addison Wesley) is an excellent way to move towards the latter condition.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Syntax; Structure; Semantics; Implementation; Recommended Reading; Index<br /><br />There are obviously a large number of books that will teach you the semantics of writing and using XML.  But just because you can create an XML file doesn't mean that you've done it well or effectively.  Harold's book provides a bridge to being able to create XML files that will be usable in nearly all situations.  The book starts out in the introduction with explanations of terms that are often confused (element vs. tag, text vs. character data vs. markup, etc.).  Then there are four parts of the book that include a total of 50 tips that will improve the quality of your XML usage.  Some tips are pretty basic, like \\"Include an XML Declaration\\".  Others are more complex like \\"Verify Documents with XML Digital Signatures\\".  But every one is practical and useful for making sure that your XML is widely useable by all potential applications.<br /><br />Excellent bridge book to read after you've learned the basics of XML.  This is a book that, when taken to heart and used, will cause your coworkers to thank you.	2004-12-05

Along with the PowerPoint 2003 Personal Trainer book, I received a review copy of Excel 2003 Personal Trainer (O'Reilly) the other day.  This is one I won't show my wife, as I think I'll keep this one for myself.<br /><br />Chapter List:  The Fundamentals; Editing a Worksheet; Formatting a Worksheet; Creating and Working with Charts; Managing Your Workbooks; More Functions and Formulas; Working with Lists; Automating Tasks with Macros; Working with Other Programs; Using Excel with the Internet; Data Analysis and PivotTables; What-If Analysis; Advanced Topics; Index<br /><br />As a long-time techie, people expect me to be an expert in any software they happen to be running.  One of the more common questions I get is &#34;how do I do &#60;insert their problem here&#62; in Excel?&#34;.  To which I answer...  &#34;Beats me!&#34;  I've just never taken the time to learn how to work the software.  In fact, my wife (who is a relative newbie when it comes to software) knows more about Excel than I do.  So, looking at this book, I think it's about time to improve on those skills.<br /><br />The Personal Trainer series uses a lightly-themed muscle/superhero motif that isn't overly cute or annoying.  Each chapter has objectives, a central task, and prerequisites to working the following lessons.  After anywhere from five to twenty lessons for a given chapter, there's a summary of the material, a quiz, and &#34;homework&#34; that you can do to explore a little further on your own.  On top of all that, the CD in the back has an Excel simulator you can use to practice your skills without necessarily having to have the software loaded on a given computer.  Since I have Excel loaded, I won't need that, nor will I have to go through each of the lessons that assume little to no background in Excel or even how Window applications work.  But I should be able to grasp all the Excel fundamentals I sorely lack right now in a relatively short period of time.  And then I might be able to answer some of my wife's pleas for application support.<br /><br />Good material, covers all the basics and quite a few of the bells and whistles, and it all reads well.

If you're a typical programmer, you may be unaware of the potential security risks of certain statements in your language of choice.  The new book Programmer's Ultimate Security DeskRef by James C. Foster (Syngress) can help you in that area.<br /><br />Chapter List: ASP; C; C++; C#; ColdFusion; JavaScript; JScript; LISP; Perl; PHP; Python; VBA; VBScript<br /><br />For as far as this book goes, it does a nice job.  Each chapter for a language lists the language, and how it's used (like an example program line).  There's a summary of what it does, along with a short description of how it should be used.  You then get into the security aspect with a section on risk (how it might be used or exploited by an attacker), impact of the risk, and a list of additional resources where you can find more information on the risk issue.  Finally, if applicable, there's a cross-reference to any other language statements that might have the same issue.<br /><br />The information that's contained in the book is good, to be sure.  If you use any of these languages in your normal coding efforts, you'll likely discover hidden risks in your program that you didn't know existed.  I would have liked to see two other features in the book, however.  The first thing I would have liked is to see a more concrete example of the potential exploit.  Some of the risk assessments are general in nature, and you might have a hard time trying to bridge the gap between general caution and actual usage.  And second, it seems like there could have been some additional languages added to the mix.  Visual Basic isn't included (although it could be argued that VBA is close enough).  Java seems to be an obvious exclusion, and it would have been much more valuable to me with that language included.  And if you included ASP, you could have just as easily included JSP along with it.<br /><br />Even with those omission or caveats, it's still a valuable addition to a programmer's bookshelf.	2004-12-04

Since my son is an Xbox fan, I decide to review the new book Xbox Fan Book by Mark Holt Walker (O'Reilly).  This book surprised me by being more than I expected...<br /><br />Chapter List: Preface; Up and Running; Maximizing Your Xbox Experience; Networking the Xbox; Take It Online with Xbox Live; Xbox Accessories; Xbox Buyer's Guide: The Best Games Now and in the Future; The Future Is Bright; Index<br /><br />This is a really small book, both in number of pages (104) and dimension (like 6 inches by 6 inches).  Very colorful, with lots of photographs and screen shots of different games.  I was expecting something that would appeal to total newbies to gaming and the Xbox, but surprisingly there's more to it than that.  The Up and Running chapters are the typical \\"how do you hook it up\\" material, but the networking and Xbox Live chapters are very useful for any level of Xbox'er who hasn't taken that step.  Not only does the author explain how to network your Xbox, but there's a pretty good troubleshooting section there also.  He also references other websites and books that will take you much deeper into the internal workings of the console if you want to move in that direction.  Couple all this with an irreverent wit and writing style, and this is actually fun to read as more than just an instructional manual.<br /><br />So...  If you're buying an Xbox (for yourself or someone else), spend the few extra dollars and pick up this book to go with it.  It's the book that probably *should* have been packaged with the Xbox in the first place.	2004-12-04

O'Reilly has a new series of titles out called the Personal Trainer series.  I had a chance to review PowerPoint 2003 Personal Trainer, and it's pretty good for what it's setting out to accomplish.<br /><br />Chapter List:  The Fundamentals; Editing a Presentation; Formatting Your Presentation; Drawing and Working with Graphics; Working with Tables and WordArt; Working with Graphs and Organization Charts; Delivering Your Presentation; Working with Multimedia; Working with Other Programs and the Internet; Advanced Topics; Index<br /><br />The theming of the book is supposed to be muscle/superhero-related, but it's a pretty light application of that theme.  You don't see a lot of efforts to fit everything into that motif (which is probably good).  Each chapter starts out with a list of objectives, followed by a target task for the chapter.  There's a short list of prerequisites you should know/have in order to be able to do the lessons.  What follows is then anywhere from 4 to 18 lessons that clearly walk you through activities and features which are directly applicable to the tasks you'll do when using the software.  Each lesson is followed by a quick reference (one of the few places you see the superhero motif), and the entire chapter ends with a summary, a quiz, and some homework you can do in order to enhance your learning and stretch your wings.  The writing is clear and concise, and I think just about anyone should be able to follow along without feeling like an idiot.<br /><br />The other nice feature is that the book comes with a CD that contains a simulation of PowerPoint.  You can use the CD to work on the exercises, without the worry that you'll mess up your real software.  This could also be used as true \\"homework\\" in order to learn skills you may use in the office without necessarily having the software at home.<br /><br />The simulation software definitely makes this book stand out from most other \\"teach-yourself\\" type books on the market.  While the cover might make you wonder how serious it is, the content is solid and useful.  If learning PowerPoint is on your list of \\"to do's\\", this book will help you get there.le the cover might make you wonder how serious it is, the content is solid and useful.

It's called How Full Is Your Bucket? by Tom Rath and Donald O. Clifton, Ph. D.<br /><br />The book is a self-improvement title for developing \\"positive strategies for work and life\\".  They use the metaphor of a bucket and dipper to explain how your everyday interactions with others can have lasting impacts for both parties.  If you have a negative interaction, it's like taking your dipper and removing liquid from their bucket.  Positive words and interactions have the opposite effect.  You're using your dipper to add to their bucket, and in the process you add to your own.  And as one's bucket is filled, it becomes much easier to share that overflow with others.<br /><br />The authors have a number of studies that show the very real benefits of positive interactions, both mentally and physically.  They also use a number of real-life stories showing how even a single positive interaction can turn around someone's life and have far-reaching effects.  This isn't to say that you have to walk around all happy and cheery all the time, but it does force you to look at how you approach others and what effect you might be having on them (and yourself).<br /><br />The changes this book offers are simple and easy to implement, and the payback can be large.  A recommended read if you're looking to make some changes in your life.	2004-12-04

As I have a slight issue with tinnitus (ringing in the ears), I picked up this book from the library:  Tinnitus - A Self-Management Guide For The Ringing In Your Ears by Jane L. Henry and Peter H. Wilson.  I'm not quite sure that this book would be helpful to what I see as the target audience.<br /><br />Chapter List:  It's Time to Take Control!; Some Facts about Tinnitus; Assessing Your Tinnitus: How Does It Affect You?; The Connection between Thoughts and Emotions; Changing the Way You Think about Tinnitus; Relaxation and Stress-Management Techniques; Attention Control Techniques; Becoming Your Own Coach; Dealing with High-Risk Situations; Reducing the Impact of Tinnitus on Your Daily Lifestyle; Maintaining Gaines in the Longer-Term; Some Final Tips on Managing Your Tinnitus; Additional Reading; Appendix; Index<br /><br />Tinnitus, for those who don't know, is the condition where you have a constant noise in your ear(s), like a ringing or buzzing.  It's thought to be due to damage in the inner ear, but it's not something that can be easily corrected in many situations.  And since the sound tends to always be there at some level, it can be an annoyance (or worse).  The authors in this book do a high-level overview of what tinnitus is, what the causes are, and then go into cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques on how you can learn to live with the condition and manage your response to it.  The program they outline is pretty detailed and involved, and involves a lot of writing and answering of questions to discover your current ways of coping.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier I didn't think the book was too helpful.  The examples and situations they feature in the book all tend to be towards the extreme end of the scale, such that the person is unable to function normally with the condition.  In my case, I've had a very minor case for a long time (too much loud music growing up), and it's gotten a little worse with my dysthymia medication.  Still, I wouldn't trade the benefits of the fluoxetine for reduction of the noise.  For the extreme examples in the book, these people are at wits end and can't concentrate or deal with life.  In that state, I don't see them taking the time and effort to work through this program on their own.  With an external coach or mentor guiding them, it may be useful.  But history shows that most people can't pull off a self-guided improvement program of any type on their own.  Throw in a debilitating condition on top of it, and I think the chances of success drop to low single digits.n't trade the benefits of the fluoxetine for reduction of the noise.

Have you ever wondered how to effectively introduce new ideas in your organization and get them to fly?  Wonder why some people effortlessly get buy-in on their ideas while you struggle?  Mary Lynn Manns, Ph. D. and Linda Rising, Ph. D. reveal some of those secrets in the book Fearless Change - Patterns For Introducing New Ideas (Addison Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter list:<br /><br />Part 1 - Overview:  Organizations and Change; Strategies or Patterns; Where Do I Start?; What Do I Do Next?; Meetings and More; Take Action!; It's All About People; A New Role: Now You're Dedicated!; Convince The Masses; More Influence Strategies; Keep It Going; Dealing with Resistance<br /><br />Part 2 - Experiences: Multiple Sclerosis Society Experience Report; UNCA Experience Report; Sun Core J2EE Patterns Experience Report; Customer Training Experience Report<br /><br />Part 3 - The Patterns<br /><br />Appendix; References; Index<br /><br />I'd have typed in each of the patterns, but that would have put me over Amazon's word limit on reviews!  :-)<br /><br />The concept of \\"patterns\\" involve finding a practice, or a method of doing something that is successful and can be applied to multiple situations.  This is similar to the use of patterns in programming, where you use a particular type of program structure to solve a problem, knowing that the architecture and process has been proven to work in multiple settings.  Manns and Rising use this pattern concept to show how you can successfully push new ideas through in an organization without making mistakes that will derail you before you even get started.<br /><br />For instance, \\"Location, Location, Location\\" talks about how moving to a off-site area (or a very nice area) can limit distractions and also show the group how important the idea is.  \\"Guru On Your Side\\" helps you understand how cultivating a guru who likes your idea can help smooth the path as others in the organization will be more willing and ready to accept the idea from them.  A \\"Champion Skeptic\\" pattern is to bring in a person who may be less than thrilled with your idea, but is willing to talk about why and help you make it a better one.  There are a total of 49 patterns you can utilize during all phases of an idea or project, but I think you can get the idea where the value in this book lies.<br /><br />As everyone is involved in selling their ideas at some point, this book will be important to just about everyone across an organization.  If you want to be more effective in getting people to follow you when things change (or need to), reading this book will get you there.\\"Champion Skeptic\\" pattern is to bring in a person who may be less than thrilled with your idea, but is willing to talk about why and help you make it a better one.

Although it's a bit dated (the stories are from 2002), I decided to read Best Business Crime Writing Of The Year edited By James Surowiecki.  Definitely a good read for those looking to make sense of an ugly period of corporate America.<br /><br />The book is a compilation of various columns and articles from publications over the year 2002, and they all deal with the criminal aspect of businesses like Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and others.  As most of the articles are \\"feature length\\", there's a solid level of coverage on each story, so you don't feel like you're just getting a taste of the real story.  The chapters are grouped by section, so you get stories about the main players, the accountants and auditors who were supposed to be watching the store, and some analysis about how the companies imploded.<br /><br />Even though the material is a couple years old, it doesn't suffer much with the lag time.  In fact, it's sort of interesting to see how things have progressed since the story was written.  I think the parts that are most valuable and will continue to be are the biographies of the CEOs who led the companies to their demise.  Definitely worth reading, especially if you were involved in any way with these fiascoes.	2004-12-03

The book has 250 pages, and the first 50 and last 40 are more general in nature.  By \\"general\\", I mean the chapters talk about how chips are constructed, why you'd want to overclock a CPU, and what considerations you have to keep in mind as you proceed.  The information is pretty detailed, and it's not something you'd give to your grandmother to help her get a bit more \\"oomph\\" from her old 486.  Everything in the middle of the book is specific information for individual CPU chips produced by different manufacturers.  These specs involve such items as physical design, performance ratings, bus speeds, multiplier ratios, overclocking potential, and overclocking tolerances.  If you happen to have one of the CPUs covered in here, you'll have more than enough information to determine how best to max out the performance.<br /><br />The only \\"problem\\" with this book is that it was published in January 2003.  Since it's now two years later, there's an increasingly greater chance that the chip you have is not covered in this book.

I've heard a lot about the book Zen in the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel, so I decided it was about time to read it.  An interesting look at how a Westerner learned about Zen using the Japanese art of archery.<br /><br />Herrigel went to Japan in order to teach philosophy, and while there took the opportunity to become immersed in Zen Buddhism.  He is able to get a master of archery to teach him after searching for a mechanism to learn Zen principles.  As a Westerner, he has a number of problems creating the right mental mindset that would allow him to understand Zen and release himself.  But through years of perseverance and continued study, he finally learns the principles and experiences the Zen of becoming one with the bow and target.<br /><br />It's an interesting look at how Zen principles can be applied to any activity.  If you've never been exposed to any Zen philosophy before, you will probably struggle with much of the seemingly nonsensical statements you'll encounter.  But if you have a basic understanding going into the book, you should be able to get the value that the author intended.	2004-11-28

Since I find the whole Titanic story fascinating, I checked out Return To Titanic - A New Look At The World's Most Famous Lost Ship by Robert D. Ballard with Michael S. Sweeney.  It's a beautiful book with a definite agenda.<br /><br />Ballard was the person who originally discovered the sunken remains of the Titanic in 1985.  He returns for another look at the ship in May 2004 and undertakes a project to get as complete of an external photo record of the ship as possible.  He has definite opinions about the large number of visitors and scavengers who have, in his view, greatly accelerated the deterioration of the ship over the last few years.  By comparing photographs of certain key areas, you can see where damage has occurred.  Certain popular spots on the ship have become defacto landing areas for submersibles, and they've broken down decking and walls.  Pirate scavengers have literally torn open parts of the ship or cut off sections in order to get prized souvenirs, like the phone system from the crow's nest where the first iceberg sighting occurred.  The photography is beautiful, and the story of the return trip is interesting.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps me from giving this book a full five stars is the fact that the author is *very* opinionated about the damage to the ship being caused entirely by human visitors.  He's adamant that things should be a \\"look but don't touch\\" situation, and I'm inclined to agree.  But writing off all deterioration to people instead of the ravages of being submerged for over 90 years is a bit extreme.  Since there's no baseline from 1912 forward, you have to assume that pictures from 1985 chronicle the way the ship was during all that time.  I don't know that you can prove that conclusively.  Regardless, if the Titanic is of interest to you, you should enjoy this book quite a bit.	2004-11-28

I finally got the chance to read Sparkle Hayter's first book What's A Girl Gotta Do?  I must say, it's probably one of her best...<br /><br />Robin Hudson is a soon-to-be divorced journalist who has been shunted off to the tabloid story department of the TV network she works for.  One day she gets a message from a private investigator revealing a lot of personal/intimate information about her that she thought nobody knew.  But before she can meet with the guy to figure out what he wants, he's murdered in such a way that it looks like she could be the killer.  The more she picks at the story, the more she finds out, and it looks like a number of the personalities at the station were also investigated and blackmailed.  While she's trying to stay alive, stay out of the bed of a co-worker, and deal with her soon-to-be ex and his pregnant fiancee, she also has to do an undercover story at a sperm bank posing as the wife to her slimebag boss.<br /><br />This is a wacky story with funny, snide, and sexy characters.  This book sets a lot of the background color for many of her future Robin Hudson novels that I've already read.  This may well be my favorite of all her novels, and it will be interesting to see if her future work can work back up to this level.	2004-11-28

It's a great medical thriller set in space...<br /><br />Emma Watson, an astronaut and physician, is sent up to the International Space Station when a current occupant's wife dies as the result of a car accident.  Shortly after she gets up there, one of the other astronauts contracts a strange illness and dies a gruesome death.  They are unable to figure out why or what the cause is until suspicion centers on one of the cellular experiments that isn't going as they expected.  The dead astronaut is put on the space shuttle for a return to earth, but the deadly killer leaks out and attacks all of those astronauts, causing them to die on the way back to earth.  It then becomes a race against time and the government (who wants to keep the virus up there as they know what it is) to save Watson before she becomes the last victim.<br /><br />This was an excellent story with plenty of suspense and mystery.  It was one of those books I kept trying to read in any spare moment I had, as the characters were compelling and the story was building towards a interesting finale.  I have a definite feeling that Gerritsen's other novels will quickly make their way onto my must-read list.	2004-11-28

Based on a comment from my boss at work, I found and read the book Pay It Forward by Catherine Ryan Hyde.  It's an incredible story and concept that has powerful implications.<br /><br />Trevor McKinney, a 12 year boy, is given an assignment by his teacher, Reuben St. Clair.  Think up a project that will change the world.  Trevor comes up with the concept of Pay It Forward.  The concept is simple...  you do something important and valuable for 3 people.  Instead of taking payment for it, those three people have to \\"pay it forward\\" by doing something for 3 other people.  Through multiplication, pretty soon everyone is looking for ways to do good to others.  Trevor picks three people to do something good for, but it appears that all three people fail to pay it forward.  But unknown to Trevor, those good deeds do get paid forward, and soon the concept and movement jumps to the west coast and catches on.  An enterprising reporter traces down the source of the project and Trevor is highlighted to the country as someone who has changed the world.  But tragedy strikes the family and things don't turn out well.  But the movement takes off and changes the world.<br /><br />So how'd I find this book?  I boss at work used the phrase \\"pay it forward\\" in conjunction with an email I had sent him.  I also had another blogger use that phrase in an email exchange.  After using Google to figure out exactly what it meant, I checked out the book from the library.  Very glad I did.  The idea of \\"paying it forward\\" is powerful and would change lives if it ever caught on.  I'm not so naive to think that something like this would ever happen, but there's nothing to prevent me from implementing this in my own life.  Sorta like changing the world one person at a time.	2004-11-22

If you're a gamer who is always looking for new information to improve your gaming experience, check out Gaming Hacks by Simon Carless (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Playing Classic Games; Playing Portably; Playing Well With Others; Playing With Hardware; Playing with Console and Arcade Hardware; Playing Around the Game Engine; Playing Your Own Games; Playing Everything Else; Index<br /><br />Like all Hacks titles, there are 100 hints, tips, and hacks that cover the spectrum of gaming, from hardware to software, from consoles to online gaming.  If you're old like me, you might enjoy Play Commodore 64 Games Without the C-64 (#2) and Play Atari ROMs Without the Atari (#3).  Those will take you back to your early days of computing.  If you're into first player shooting games, Tweak Your Tactics for FPS Glory (#94) will help boost your scoring.  Carless will even help you play Japanese video games without knowing the language in #97 - Play Japanese Games Without Speaking Japanese.  He shows you some basic hiragana and katakana that you'll encounter frequently in those games, and that might allow you to bridge the language gap.<br /><br />The only trouble I see with the book is that it's covering such a wide area of subject matter.  Unless you're a full-time gamer, you'll probably find a number of areas in this book that don't pertain to your interests.  In some ways, that's OK for a Hacks title, as not everything is meant to apply to every single reader.  But this particular title seems to be a bit more scattered than usual.  The material is good, to be sure, but each reader may have a different opinion of the book based on what their gaming interests are.	2004-11-21

Have you got an old Atari 2600 sitting around that you don't know what to do with?  Game Console Hacking will give you some interesting ideas on how to recycle those old gaming consoles.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Tools of the Warranty-Voiding Trade; Case Modifications: Building an Atari 2600PC; The Xbox; PlayStation 2; Nintendo Game Boy Advance; Gamepark 32 (GP32); Nintendo NES; Atari 2600; Atari 5200; Atari 7800; Electrical Engineering Basics; Coding 101; Operating Systems; Index<br /><br />Although I'm not into gaming so much any more, my kids have had most of the more recent consoles at one time or another.  And growing up, I had one of the Atari 2600.  But after the latest and greatest comes out, the older gaming systems end up gathering dust.  Game Console Hacking is an interesting book on things you can do to breathe new life into the old classics.  This book is heavy on altering hardware components, so you need to be comfortable with a screwdriver and a soldiering iron.  But even if you're not as experienced in that area as you'd like, the book has an abundance of photos to show exactly what you should be doing at any given point in the process.  At the end of each chapter, there's also a section on homebrew game development as well as additional resources on the Web for that particular console.  So even if you're not wanting to hack your hardware, you will be able to find information to push your gaming fun even further.<br /><br />For me, my favorite hack was using an Atari 2600 console to contain a full-blown PC.  I thought that was just too cool.  I could imagine showing up at a user group meeting to do some software demo with an Atari 2600 under my arm, and blowing people away when I boot it up as a regular PC.  I don't know that I'll get around to doing it, but it's an intriguing idea.	2004-11-21

Online Investing Hacks by Bonnie Biafore (O'Reilly) is one of those books that can pay for itself in short order, as well as over and over.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Screening Investments; Hacking Excel for Financial Analysis; Collecting Financial Data; Analyzing Company Fundamentals; Technical Analysis; Executing Trades; Investing in Mutual Funds; Managing Your Portfolio; Financial Planning; Index<br /><br />I worked at Enron from 1998 through 2001, and spent plenty of time during that dot.com era following my stock portfolio.  I watched my Enron stock value go from incredible value to a point where it cost more to sell the stock than it was worth.  I won a few bets (face it, that's what they were) on a few dot.coms and lost many more.  What could have been an incredible nest egg, isn't.  This book would have been a lifesaver if I had read and paid attention to it a few years ago.  Biafore shows you how you can analyze and invest wisely using a variety of tools available to everyone.<br /><br />If you're an Excel user, you'll find it an invaluable tool for analysis.  She'll show you how you can use it to create financial charts (#13), calculate compound annual rates of growth (#26), and use rational values to buy and sell wisely (#36).  #39 - Spot Hanky Panky with Cash Flow Analysis (using Enron as an example) would have literally saved me hundreds of thousands of dollars had I known about it.  Even if you don't care about the investing tips, the hack on downloading data via Excel web queries (#7) was something I didn't know how to do (or that you could even do it!).  The book has a little something for everyone.<br /><br />As with all Hacks titles, you probably won't be interested in every single item.  Some may not be applicable to your situation or may be too complex for what you care to handle.  But all it would take is one hack to work out and change your investing for this book to pay huge dividends.  If you do your own investing, you owe it to yourself to get this book.	2004-11-21

Although I'm not a C++ programmer, I was still able to get value from the book C++ Coding Standards - 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices by Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu (Addison Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter List:  Preface; Organizational and Policy Issues; Design Style; Coding Style; Functions and Operators; Design and Inheritance; Construction, Destruction, and Copying; Namespaces and Modules; Templates and Genericity; Error Handling and Exceptions; STL: Containers; STL: Algorithms; Type Safety; Bibliography; Summary of Summaries; Index<br /><br />This book consists of 101 tips and guidelines that each run between 1 to 3 pages in length.  There's a short summary statement of the tip (like \\"Sharing causes contention: Avoid shared data, especially global data.\\"), followed by a discussion of the tip along with exceptions to the rule and further references if you want to read more about the subject.  There's a range of tips for all experience levels, so developers at all levels should be able to gain at least one or two tips that will help them on a daily basis.<br /><br />I'm not a C++ developer, but there is plenty of common sense material here for all developers (such as Java programmers).  The first three chapters will largely apply to just about any developer, and should be taken to heart regardless of platform.  So while you may not run right out and buy it if you're not a C++ developer, definitely read it if you get the opportunity.	2004-11-21

Stuart Woods has a new character in his novel stable...  Rick Barron is introduced in The Prince Of Beverly Hills.<br /><br />Set in the '30s, Barron is a cop in Beverly Hills that has been demoted from detective due to a run-in with the head of the department.  While doing a late-night stint watching traffic, he witnesses a deadly accident involving a film star at Centurion Studios.  When he gets the actor back to the studio without alerting officials, the head of the studio sees him as a replacement for the security head who recently was involved in a murder/suicide.  Barron takes the job and fits in well, impressing everyone with his creativity and results.  But when he runs into an associate of the Mafia, he ends up with a price on his head.  Furthermore, it looks like this associate was also involved in his predecessor's demise.  Barron has to figure out how this all ties together while keeping himself alive in the process.<br /><br />I didn't go into this book with many expectations, and soon found myself wrapped up in the story.  The main character is a strange mix between someone who works around the rules and someone you can count on.  The subplots of love and friendship set against the escalating war in Europe also lends a different slant on the story.  I hope that Woods continues this character for a few novels, as I think this would be an interesting series to follow.	2004-11-20

In light of our recent elections here, I read an interesting novel of alternative history.  It's called The Plot Against America by Philip Roth.  While it's not as good as I'd hoped, it does make you think...<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of Roth's childhood growing up as a Jew from June 1940 through October 1942.  Charles Lindberg is at the height of his popularity, and ends up defeating Roosevelt to become the President of the United States.  He wins on a platform of staying out of World War 2, and is not shy about his admiration of Hitler.  The American Jewish population is uneasy about this turn of events, and become even more concerned when certain programs are implemented that force them to move to different parts of the country against their will.  Walter Winchell, an outspoken Jewish commentator, decides to run for president against him and inflames the country against the Jewish people.  As all this comes to a head, you see remarkable similarities to how Germany evolved into a country that massacred the Jewish people.  What's even more amazing is that much of the story is derived from real events and real beliefs that were held by the people at that time.<br /><br />As the book is written from the view of a nine year old, it's interesting to see how world events and the interpretation of them by parents drive the thoughts and feelings of a child.  Unfortunately, I felt that there were too many instances where the story-line was secondary and the thread of the American political scene was somewhat lost.  During those times I wish the writing had been a little tighter.  In fact, I was about to give the book an average rating until the last couple of chapters.  At that point you start to see the full effect of how a society can be manipulated to discriminate against a group of people, and how that discrimination can become accepted and even approved.  It's there that the book really got me thinking and caused me to raise my opinion.<br /><br />A good story to underscore how society needs to guard against rhetoric and actions designed to segregate people in order to gain approval of their discrimination.br /> <br />A good story to underscore how society needs to guard against rhetoric and actions designed to segregate people in order to gain approval of their discrimination.	2004-11-18

I have never understood how all the cables and slots fit together.  But I may change that habit after reading Building The Perfect PC by Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Chapter List: Fundamentals; Choosing and Buying Components; Building a Mainstream PC; Building a SOHO Server; Building A Kick-Ass LAN Party PC; Building a Home Theater PC; Building a Small Form Factor PC; Index<br /><br />As stated above, I have never done well with hardware.  But my son has absolutely no qualms about swapping things in and out, sometimes for no real reason other than to open up the box and do it.  Some of that must be rubbing off, as normally I wouldn't even be interested in a book like this.  Now I'm glad I got it.  The authors do an excellent job in explaining what each component is, how it works, and what considerations you need to keep in mind based on the type of system you want to build.  After explaining all that, they take that information and apply it to building five specific types of systems, one of which probably comes close to your needs.  And most important, there are pictures!  Lots and lots of pictures of components being installed, screwed in, plugged in, and fired up.  For those of us who haven't done a lot of hardware assembly, we appreciate that.  :-)  Armed with this book, you could easily walk into a store like Fryes and walk out with everything you need to build your own PC from scratch, *and* have it work when you get done.<br /><br />A superb, well-done book that will end up being the basis of at least one father-son project in this household.  If I had found this book about six months earlier, I might have ended up building my son's computer instead of buying it.	2004-11-16

If you're the type of computer user who likes to tweak the machine to do things it normally doesn't do, you'll like Hacking Windows XP by Steve Sinchak (Wiley).<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Part 1 - Customizing Your System - Customizing the Look of the Startup; Customizing User Navigation; Hacking the Desktop; Customizing the Appearance of the Windows Interface; Hacking Windows Explorer; Exploring Other Windows Enhancements<br /><br />Part 2 - Increasing Your System's Performance - Analyzing Your System; Speeding Up the System Boot; Making Your Computer Load Faster; Making Your Computer More Responsive; Speeding Up Your Computer<br /><br />Part 3 - Securing Your System - Protecting Your Computer from Intruders; Fighting Spam, Spyware, and Viruses; Protecting Your Privacy<br /><br />Appendix A: What's on the CD-ROM; Index; End-User License Agreement<br /><br />I had no sooner opened the box that had this book in it, and my son immediately took off with it.  Since he's the only one running XP in the house, I figured that was reasonable.  In less than an hour, he had a whole new boot screen proclaiming his Windows XP OS to be the Doom 3 version with a video game wallpaper with no icons showing.  He was also showing me how to set the priorities of certain tasks that were running with the Task Manager options.  It's only taken me about three weeks to finally sneak it off his desk.<br /><br />Sinchak uses a variety of built-in features and third-party software to give you the ability to change many of the features of your system.  If you want to change your boot-up screen, you'll have step-by-step instructions on how to do so.  If you want to customize the way your windows act on the desktop, that's here too.  While the Part 1 tweaks are more for fun, Part 2 gets more serious and useful.  He goes into a number of tweaks and settings that will allow you to wring out every last drop of performance from your system.  If you're running the latest and greatest Ghz CPU, you may not need to do these things, but PCs that are two or three years old could benefit from these settings.<br /><br />Good book, interesting material, and lots of fun to explore.

If you're familiar with JSP technology and you're ready to take the next step, you might find the book Foundations Of JSP Design Patterns by Andrew Patzer (Apress) interesting...<br /><br />Chapter list:  JSP Foundations; Using JSP; Role Separation with JavaBeans; Role Separation with Custom Tags; Development Using Patterns; The Decorating Filter Pattern; The Front Controller Pattern; The View Helper Pattern; Testing Techniques; Deployment Techniques; Application Frameworks; Putting It All Together; Index<br /><br />While this book does cover some basics of JSP, I wouldn't recommend it for a complete newcomer to the subject.  This book is more designed for the person who has learned the basics, done some work with JSP, and would now like to learn how to better structure their code to separate business logic from presentation.  Patzer does a good job in showing how a consistent approach to presentation/logic separation can avoid maintenance issues down the road, and how it allows developers and designers with different roles to work together on a project.  By introducing patterns, the developer can build applications with a solid structure that follow proven architecture that works.  The thing I appreciate most is that the pattern chapters have plenty of code that allows you to understand the pattern both by explanation and by example of a real application.  That helps take the information from a theoretical to a practical level.  The chapters at the end that deal with testing and deployment are also very valuable, and they should help the developer to follow a solid approach to JSP application development from design through implementation.  Very good material here.	2004-11-14

Most of my Java coding has been server-side with no user interface.  But I'd like to try some interactive Java programming.  O'Reilly's SWT - A Developer's Notebook by Tim Hatton looks like it should be perfect for where I'm at...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Getting Started; SWT Shells; SWT Menus; SWT Toolbars; SWT Text Fields; SWT Buttons; SWT Lists; The SWT Combo; SWT Layouts; SWT Composites and Groups; SWT Tabbed Folders; SWT Tables; SWT Trees; Other SWT Listeners; SWT CoolBars; SWT Slider and ProgressBar; SWT Standard Dialogs; A Complete SWT Application; Index<br /><br />I like the Developer's Notebook series from O'Reilly as it is a down-to-earth, practical approach to learning some new aspect of technology.  In this installment, Hatton quickly gets you up and running with the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) within Eclipse so that you can start building interactive applications in Java with user interfaces.  There's a lot of code to show you real examples, along with the screen shots to show you what it should look like when you're done.  The \\"How Do I Do That?\\" and \\"What Just Happened?\\" sections after each example take just enough time to give you the explanations of the technique you just learned, without giving you time to lose your momentum.  The final chapter lets you tie together all the techniques you've learned into a fully functional application.  When you're done, not only should you have a good grasp of SWT coding, but you'll have a good book to keep around to help you remember things as you continue forward.<br /><br />Nicely done, and another solid addition to the Developer's Notebook series in my opinion.	2004-11-14

Over the last couple of days, I've been reading Michael Palmer's latest novel, Society.  It definitely ends better than it starts out...<br /><br />Dr. Will Grant is a physician crusading against the evils of managed care and the big bad insurance companies.  All is going well until executives of managed care companies start getting murdered.  It looks like one or more people have an axe to grind with managed care, and the police think that Grant is involved, all except a woman detective who believes him but has been forced off the case.  During a surgery, Grant is drugged, passes out during the operation, is accused of drug abuse, and is kicked off the staff of the hospital.  With his life in ruins, he decides to hire a lawyer and fight back.  This leads to a showdown at the end with the killers who set him up.  I'll keep it really high level so as not to give away the twists at the end.<br /><br />Within the first five pages, Palmer establishes that HMO companies are evil and are the bad guys.  No subtlety whatsoever.  I was pretty well prepared to give it a 3 out of 5 at that point.  Even though that premise continues throughout the book, the plot does get more intense and I started to identify with what the characters were going through.  There are some nasty plot twists at the end, and the book became a \\"can't put down\\" for the last few chapters.  Plot line would have given this book a full 5 stars.  I'll average the ranking out and give it a 4.  A good story, but the \\"evil HMO\\" could have been delivered better than it was...	2004-11-14

Kanter examines the culture of winning and losing by using sports teams and a number of organization and government leaders.  By telling their stories and examining their histories, it becomes clear how winning begets winning and losing begets losing, and it's a formidable task to break the cycle.  I think one of the most inspirational and moving stories is when she writes about Nelson Mandela's rise from a prison cell to leader of South Africa, and the steps he took to promote and drive racial and cultural unity when it would have been much easier to just take the route of revenge.  Although the examples are large, it's not devoid of personal application.  Each chapter distills down the lessons into actions that you can take as an individual to build your own confidence and lead others in the same path.<br /><br />Good material, and well worth reading...	2004-11-13

Since I am acquainted with the issues of antidepressants as someone with dysthymia, I decided it might be interesting to read the \\"other\\" side of the story.  To that end, I just finished Let Them Eat Prozac - The Unhealthy Relationship Between The Pharmaceutical Industry And Depression by David Healy.  Interesting stuff here...<br /><br />Healy is listed as a former secretary of the British Association for Psychopharmacology and has written a number of articles and books on the subject.  He's also been on the prescribing end of antidepressants, so I don't see (at least on the surface) any particular conflict of interest that might color his statements and conclusions.  The book is part a personal story of his experience with the drug Prozac and its parent company Lilly, as well as an expose of how pharmaceutical companies are able to distort facts and studies to present misleading results on drug testing.  The main thrust of this book is how Prozac and SSRI drugs in general show a strong increase in the rate of suicidal tendencies in users during the first few weeks of use.  But looking at the information from the drug companies, you'd never know it.  Based on creative manipulation of statistics, the suicide rates were presented as far less than they really were.  And even now that Prozac has gone off patent and is now available in its generic form of fluoxetine, he still claims that little is known about the long-term effects of the drug, and who might be held responsible if issues arise down the road.<br /><br />Coming into this book, I was ready to write him off as a conspiracy nut with an axe to grind.  I was given fluoxetine nearly two years ago to help me deal with chronic low-level depression, and it's been a lifesaver.  I've experienced very few side effects (very minor), and it has given me a new lease on life.  But after reading the book, I realize that I am pretty lucky, in that the story could have been much worse.  It's nearly impossible (from what I can tell) to predict how a specific person will react on an SSRI drug.  My position has been that the doctor should be watching them extremely closely over the first two to four weeks.  I'd now change that to the first two to four *days*.  An adverse reaction to the drug could be deadly, and for more than just the person taking the drug.<br /><br />Overall, very interesting material.  I would hope that reading something like this wouldn't dissuade a person from seeking treatment and trying SSRI drugs, as they can and do work well for many people.  But it's valuable to understand that they don't work for everyone, and it's possible that they could make the condition even worse.  Just proceed with caution...I can tell) to predict how a specific person will react on an SSRI drug.

It's titled The Real Business Of Web Design by John Waters (Allworth Press).  It offers up some different views on web site design that I hadn't considered before...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Linking and Thinking; New Rules for Growth; After the Bubble Burst; Business Fundamentals; Expanding the Circle; The Growth Continues; The Information Age Is History; Mission-Driven Design; Organizing the Trip; Developing the Look and Feel; Building the Site; Form, Function, and Feasibility; Interaction Designers; Functional Designers; Business Designers; Governing the Web; New Basics for Marketing; Making a Difference; What Customers Want; A Value Proposition for the Web; Building One-to-One Relationships; Integrated Marketing Communications; Faster, Better, Cheaper; Economic Possibilities; The Circle of Language; Golden Music; Resources; Notes; Index<br /><br />To be sure, this isn't a mechanics book.  You won't go here to learn new techniques for animating graphics or structuring navigation.  What you will learn is how to approach web design from a functional and business perspective.  It's not enough to just throw out a few web pages and call it good.  People expect more than that.  Your site becomes the calling card for your business and is really an extension of it.  If the customer has a bad experience on the site, you can rest assured you'll never see them again.  By designing for a specific person who is using your site to accomplish something, you'll meet the needs of that person type as a whole.  So instead of saying \\"what would a user want to do?\\", you build a fictional person, complete with name and background, who has a specific goal in mind.  You then design for that single person.  After designing the site for a set of these characters, you'll find you've successfully met the needs of most everyone who falls into those categories.  In addition to that design technique, Waters covers a wealth of more generic information on the business of using the web to run your business.<br /><br />All very good stuff, and worth the read...information on the business of using the web to run your business.   <br /> <br />All very good stuff, and worth the read...	2004-11-10

Depending on your background, I think you'll have varying reactions to the book.  People who haven't been exposed to information like this will quickly learn that all is not safe when you're online.  If you've surfed the web for any length of time as an IT professional, you'll read a lot of the information and say \\"I already know that\\".  But even then, you'll pick up some ideas and concepts that you may not have been aware of.  For instance, I didn't know there were servers that would send you requested web pages via email in order to bypass filtering or banned sites.  And the chapter on alternative sources of news will cause you to think about expanding your media view of the world.<br /><br />The packaging of the book is rather unique.  The cover and pages have a dirty, \\"photocopied\\" look to make it appear more illicit than it actually is.  It becomes one of those books that will catch someone's eyes on a book shelf, and may need to be explained.  :-)<br /><br />An interesting read, and you will learn a few things along the way....have a dirty, \\"photocopied\\" look to make it appear more illicit than it actually is.

I just finished reading Knoppix Hacks by Kyle Rankin (O'Reilly), and I really didn't have a clue as to the power of Knoppix...<br /><br />Chapter List:  Boot Knoppix; Use Your Knoppix Desktop; Tweak Your Desktop; Install Linux With Knoppix; Put Knoppix In Your Toolbox; Repair Linux; Rescue Windows; Knoppix Reloaded; Knoppix Remastered; Index<br /><br />I'm going to guess I'm like most non-Linux junkies when I say that I had heard of Knoppix and thought I knew what it was.  It's a distribution of Linux that runs from a CD, and allows you to load Linux on a computer without installing anything.  Just boot from the CD and five minutes later you're running Linux.  Remove the CD and reboot, and you're back to your original configuration.  A nice safe way to play with Linux and decide if you want to go any further.  End of story.<br /><br />Wrong...<br /><br />In Knoppix Hacks, Rankin covers 100 \\"hacks\\" that you can do with the Knoppix distribution.  Beyond just trying out Linux, I quickly learned that a Knoppix CD is like a Swiss Army knife of tools that you can use to do all sorts of cool things.  You learn in the first chapter how you can launch Knoppix to load up in a number of different configurations.  Using Hack #8, you can use Knoppix to find out if your laptop is going to work well with Linux before loading it for good.  But the further you get into the book, the more Knoppix becomes a safety net the likes of which you may never have realized.  Hack #41 covers using Knoppix to build an emergency file server, and #42 is how to build an emergency web server.  Chapter 6 goes into how Knoppix can be used to repair existing Linux installs, like #59 where you rescue files from damaged hard drives.  Even if you're a Windows person, you can use Knoppix to repair Windows installations, like with hack #79 which shows you how to download Window patches securely.  He even covers how to build your own custom version of Knoppix with Linux software selections that are important to you.  The book comes with a Knoppix CD, so you can try out many of the hacks without having to go hunting for a Knoppix download.<br /><br />This is probably the first Hacks title that transcends the Hacks philosophy and becomes a \\"user manual\\" on Knoppix.  There just isn't anything out on the market like this book, and once you read the material you quickly realize how much you've been missing by not having a Knoppix CD in your CD case.<br /><br />This is an incredible book on an incredible tool that is much more than what meets the eye.  Highly recommended.e selections that are important to you.

Do you like to play around in your PC's BIOS settings?  Do you run your computer without a cover so you can mess around with the hardware inside?  If so, you'll like PC Hacks by Jim Aspinwall (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Chapter List:  Basic System Board Hacks; Basic System Board Setup; CPU Hacks; Memory Hacks; Disk Hacks; Disk Drive Performance Hacks; Video Hacks; I/O Device Hacks; Boot-Up Hacks; Configuring A New PC; Index<br /><br />As you can tell from the list of chapters, there's a heavy emphasis on hacks that involve tweaking hardware settings or upgrading core components.  Many of the hacks have performance in mind, like Boot Faster (#4) or Speed It Up With RAID (#64).  Other hacks allow you to use little known Windows tools to set system options, like Let Windows Tell You About I/O Card Conflicts (#75) and Convert FAT to NTFS (#45).  If you're into overclocking your PC devices, you'll have a great time here as the author covers everything from overclocking CPUs to video cards.  He also warns that it's possible to completely toast your machine if you push the limits too far, so these things might not be the best tricks to mess with on a critical PC.  I'd suggest getting a second-hand machine that you can destroy (if it comes to that), and see what you can do by following the tips in this book.<br /><br />As with all Hacks books, there are 100 tips to play with.  Some may not apply to you, and others may be worth the purchase price of the book by themselves.  But that's part of the fun with the Hacks series.  If you don't like the one you just read, keep going.  The next one may solve a problem you've been struggling with for years.<br /><br />A very good book for those who want to eke out every last drop of performance from their system, or for those who are more interested in how the operating system works instead of just running applications.	2004-11-08

Since my son is into hardware hacking and also into his Xbox, I got a review copy of Hacking The Xbox by Andrew Huang.  While not my particular area of interest, he really thought the book was great!<br /><br />Chapter List:  Voiding The Warranty; Thinking Inside The Box; Installing A Blue LED; Building A USB Adapter; Replacing A Broken Power Supply; The Best Xbox Game: Security Hacking; A Brief Primer On Security; Reverse Engineering Xbox Security; Sneaking In The Back Door; More Hardware Projects; Developing Software For The Xbox; Caveat Hacker; Onward!; Where To Get Your Hacking Gear; Soldering Techniques; Getting Into PCB Layout; Getting Started With FPGAs; Debugging: Hints and Tips; Xbox Hardware Reference; Index<br /><br />Within 10 minutes of getting this book, Cam was hunting for my toolkit and shortly thereafter had his Xbox opened up all over my office floor.  I knew basically that the Xbox was a PC disguised as a gaming system, but I didn't realize how true that was until Cam opened it up and showed me the internals.  It was like opening up my desktop system!  Huang does a great job in showing what tools are necessary as well as illustrating via pictures what needs to be done to \\"lift the lid\\" of your system.  Once there, he shows you some of the basic modifications you can make like adding custom lighting or replacing power supplies.  Beyond the basics of hardware, Huang takes the reader into very in-depth examinations of the system structure of the Xbox and what needs to be known in order to understand how to modify software and hardware.  For me, the most interesting chapter covered how you can modify an Xbox to turn it into a low-cost Linux machine.  Although it's not what Microsoft envisioned, there really is a lot you can do to and with this machine.<br /><br />If you're ready to dig into your Xbox and go beyond just playing games, this is the first book you should get your hands on.	2004-11-07

When I was first learning Java, one of the most useful books I used was Just Java 2.  The 6th edition of Just Java 2 by Peter van der Linden (Prentice-Hall) continues to be a quality resource.<br /><br />Chapter List:  What Can Java Do For Me?; Introducing Objects; Primitive Types, Wrappers, and Boxing; Statements and Comments; OOP Part 2 - Constructors and Visibility; Static, Final, and Enumerated Types; Names, Operators, and Accuracy; More OOP - Extending Classes; Arrays; Exceptions; Interfaces; Nested Classes; Doing Several Things at Once: Threads; Advanced Thread Topics; Explanation &#60;Generics&#62;; Collections; Simple Input Output; Advanced Input Output; Regular Expressions; GUI Basics and Event Handling; JFC and the Swing Package; Containers, Layouts, and SWT Loose Ends; Relational Databases and SQL; JDBC; Networking in Java; Servlets and JSP; XML and Java; Web Services at Google and Amazon; Downloading Java; Powers of Two Table; Codesets; Index<br /><br />This 6th edition covers all the recent additions in Java from J2SE 5.0, so you can get this book knowing you'll have the most up-to-date information.  The thing I appreciate most about this book is the tone and readability of what is one of the most complete tutorial style books on Java on the market.  The tone is conversational, so you're not struggling through dry text.  With dashes of humor and sidebars that cover interesting history and stories of IT significance, the book comes close to being one of the few learning guides that could almost be read cover to cover as an interesting read regardless of whether you work the examples or not.  The servlet and JSP chapter at the end, along with the XML chapter, is more high-level than the rest of the book.  You could buy entire volumes that deal specifically with those concepts.  So if that's the main reason you're buying the book, you could do better.  Of course, if you bought the book for the last two chapters only, I'd question why you did so in the first place...  :-)<br /><br />This is an excellent book that spans the gap between hard-core tutorial and pure entertainment.  I can't imagine too many people who wouldn't enjoy and benefit from this text if they want to learn Java.first place...  :-) <br /> <br />This is an excellent book that spans the gap between hard-core tutorial and pure entertainment.

After reviewing Unix Shells By Example (4th Edition) by Ellie Quigley (Prentice-Hall), I think I've found the book I need to get started.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Introduction to UNIX/Linux Shells; Shell Programming QuickStart; Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching; The grep Family; sed, The Streamlined Editor; The awk Utility; The Interactive Bourne Shell; Programming The Bourne Shell; The Interactive C And TC Shells; Programming The C And TC Shells; The Interactive Korn Shell; Programming The Korn Shell; The Interactive Bash Shell; Programming The Bash Shell; Debugging Shell Scripts; The System Administrator And The Shell; Useful UNIX/Linux Utilities For Shell Programmers; Comparison Of The Shells; Index<br /><br />I know that there are a number of different shell scripting platforms, but I really don't know enough to understand what is different between them.  In a single book, Quigley covers all the options so I can start to make some decisions about what direction I'd like to go in.  And regardless of whatever choice that might be, she covers all the different platforms in equal depth so I don't have to go out and buy another book to get started.  Each chapter is filled with a number of examples, immediately followed by an explanation of how the example works.  So not only do you have the benefit of reference material on how something like the grep utility works, but you also have the benefit of seeing working examples in order to translate theory into practical knowledge.  Her style of writing is clear and concise, and I really think that with a little time on my part, this book will take me well down the road to where I want to be.<br /><br />An excellent choice if you're looking to get into command line scripting of your UNIX or Linux systems...	2004-11-07

In the personal improvement genre, I recently finished Victory! by Brian Tracy.  Not a bad read, and it has some pretty good ideas to improve your effectiveness in life.<br /><br />The book consists of a number of \\"principles\\" that are pulled from military commanders and strategy.  There are titles such as \\"The Principle of the Objective - Clarity Is Essential\\" and \\"The Principle of the Mass - Concentrate Your Power\\".  The first part of each chapter starts with an illustration from a famous war or battle, and shows how a leader's decision based on that principle made a difference.  An explanation of the principle is followed by how it relates to company effectiveness, and finally the principle is applied to your personal life.  Since the book relies on military strategy, there are numerous examples and philosophies scattered throughout that tie back to generals and wars.<br /><br />I've always liked Brian Tracy's writings.  He is able to distill down ideas and concepts into practical steps you can take to become more effective.  If you've read any number of personal improvement books, you'll see many ideas here that you've seen in other places.  You may not have viewed them in light of military strategy, so that could lead to some additional insights.  If this is your first exposure to self-improvement literature, you'll come away with a number of ideas that, once implemented, will cause you to become more successful in your personal life.  And the book isn't written such that you have to do everything here or it doesn't work.  Even the successful implementation of a single idea, like simplification of your personal life, can yield tremendous benefits.<br /><br />If you're looking to break out of a rut or try some new ideas to become more successful, this book will definitely help you get there...	2004-11-06

For a recreational reading break, I recently finished Lost City by Clive Cussler with Paul Kemprecos.  This is classic Cussler and is very entertaining...<br /><br />A number of scientists that worked on a secret project have met their deaths in rather questionable ways.  This thread is dropped for awhile until you get further into the book.  Meanwhile, Kurt Austin helps out a woman researcher (beautiful, what else?) who is trying to find evidence of an ancient trade route at the bottom of a lake attached to a glacier.  The researchers at the glacier also find a man entombed in the ice who appears to be about 100 years old, is wearing flying gear, and has a strange helmet.  When reporters are permitted to see the find, one of them takes a box belonging to the frozen man and blows up part of the glacier in order to cover his tracks.  Thus starts the series of cliff-hanger rescues and adventures that Austin and the researcher find themselves in.  Castles with dungeons, arms-dealing families with long histories and murky pasts, and killer algae all combine into a novel that keeps moving at a rapid pace.<br /><br />Is this Nobel prize literature?  Not by a long shot.  It's escapism and entertainment, nothing more.  But it's good entertainment, and the book is hard to put down.  Since this isn't Cussler's primary series with Dirk Pitt, I went into it without a high level of expectation.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a fun read.	2004-11-06

As I've mentioned before, I'm a Disney addict.  So it was understandable when I picked up The Gospel According To Disney - Faith, Trust, and Pixie Dust by Mark I. Pinsky.  As usual in these types of books, I was somewhat disappointed...<br /><br />Pinsky is the religion reporter for the Orlando Sentinel, and he's also written The Gospel According To The Simpsons (which I haven't read).  In the Disney book, he first looks at the Disney organization and attempts to determine what the company religious views are.  That can mean anything from the company's view of life to how they tolerate organized religion.  This information then provides the backdrop for the majority of the book, which is a review of the company's animated films and what religious concepts are woven into them.  The last couple of chapters examines the Disney theme parks and the Baptist boycott in the light of religious themes.<br /><br />Now I have a bias here myself.  I don't go to Disney films to gain religious instruction or insight.  I go to be entertained.  And while there are lessons to be learned in films, it's also easy to superimpose a personal view or bias and then interpret everything in that light.  Unfortunately, I feel that's what is happening in this book.  Since Pinsky is looking to find religious thought in each film, everything that appears is colored by that expectation.  It's very possible that what he sees is really there and was really intended.  But all too often I felt as if the explanation was possible only because you were looking for it.  I'm sure if an organization like PETA were to write a book like this looking at Disney from an animal rights perspective, they would end up seeing the same type of thoughts that pertain to their views and make it look like Disney's foremost thought in films is animal rights.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that if you reduce any examination of events to a single issue (politics, religion, etc.), it's easy to see things that aren't there.  I come away from this book feeling like a fair amount of that occurred.n't there.  I come away from this book feeling like a fair amount of that occurred.	2004-11-06

It's in the style of the Visual QuickStart Guides, which means there's lots of full page graphics with text inserts directing you on specific tasks.  It's not meant to be a reference guide, nor is it meant to give you the \\"whys\\" or a lot of detail.  The target audience is someone who wants to get something done quickly without getting bogged down in all the minutiae...<br /><br />Now given that as the target audience, I think it does pretty well.  My wife, who has never done a PowerPoint presentation, immediately latched on to this book and claimed it as her own.  Given her background and learning style, she'll find this a perfect book to take into her workplace and try something she hasn't attempted before.  My only real issue with the book is that it doesn't talk much about style considerations.  When a new person is shown how to make the text dance and shimmer, they tend to think all their slides should do that.  But just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  I would have liked to have seen a bit of coverage of basic design concepts to prevent new users from going wild with all the features.<br /><br />For the right audience, Creating a Presentation in PowerPoint will be a good first book to get them started.	2004-11-01

I'm going to avoid addressing the ethical considerations of file sharing and comment strictly on the content of the book.  You get to draw your own ethical lines.<br /><br />Overall, the book is good.  I came away with a much better understanding of how peer-to-peer networks work, and how there are multiple networks available, each with their own clients for access.

Wang includes a lot of software recommendations (along with URLs) for each type of file acquisition (like newsgroup readers and online proxy sites), so you can quickly start trying out some of the techniques he outlines.  The style and type layout of the book is also \\"dirty\\", much like an underground publishing effort.  It gives the book a look of something that you'd probably not display on your bookshelf because \\"proper\\" people don't read things like this.<br /><br />While there's plenty of stuff you already know here, there's also quite a bit of material that will fill in some gaps (if they are gaps you want filled in)...ty of stuff you already know here, there's also quite a bit of material that will fill in some gaps (if they are gaps you want filled in)...	2004-10-31

If you're a programmer who has to look at code that others have written, you'll appreciate this book...  Find The Bug by Adam Barr (Addison-Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Bug Classification; Tips on Walking Through Code; C; Python; Java; Perl; x86 Assembly Language; Classification of Bugs; Index of Bugs by Type; References; Index<br /><br />This is a excellent text to help you improve your skills on reading code and mentally debugging it.  There are 10 short program or routines for each of the five languages.  Your goal is to walk through the code and figure out what is the hidden error in it.  There are three or four suggestions if you need help thinking it through, a couple of direct hints to focus your thoughts, and a complete explanation at the end.  Even though you may not be familiar with some of the languages, Barr gives you a basic coverage of the fundamentals at the beginning of the chapter so that you can see if you are able to spot the error.  Add to all that some good information on how best to walk through code, and you end up with a book that should be part of every developer's training.  If you're part of a development group that does code walkthroughs, this would be an excellent guide to help everyone become more effective during the process.<br /><br />A good way to step outside your normal thought processes and improve your skills...  good stuff.	2004-10-31

Even though I read a lot, there are a few authors and series that I still get excited about.  At the top of the list is the In Death series by Nora Roberts writing as J. D. Robb.  Her latest, Visions In Death, once again delivers the goods...<br /><br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her partner Detective Peabody pick up a murder where the victim's eyes are cut out and she's posed naked on some rocks in the water.  As with all killings, Dallas takes it personally and seeks to find the person responsible.  But then another murder occurs with the same M.O., and she's got a serial killer on her hands.  She's contacted by a \\"sensitive\\" who is seeing the killings in visions, but Eve has to overcome her bias about trusting anything that can't be touched or investigated.  The killings become more violent with less time between episodes, and everything comes to a crescendo when Peabody is attacked by the killer and narrowly escapes death.  As a subplot, Eve is having to learn to share her own abused past with her partner, and to take that next level of trust with Peabody.<br /><br />This is the 19th book in the In Death series, and who knows how many other books Nora Roberts has written on top of those.  She cranks out stuff at an incredible rate.  As I've watched authors and series like Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta character crash and burn, I keep fearing that each new In Death novel will be the beginning of the end.  But to my joy and amazement, Robb/Roberts continues to shine here.  She's taken Peabody from a straight-laced assistant to a full character who can hold her own against Dallas.  Eve's mega-rich husband Roarke complements her hard-edged tendencies and forces her to experience life outside of being a cop.  And each episode chips away a little bit more at Eve's defenses against her past and makes her more human.<br /><br />I realize at some point the series will have run its course, but I certainly don't look forward to that day.  But until then, I'll continue to enjoy Robb's work to the fullest and place it near the top of my \\"must read now\\" list.inue to enjoy Robb's work to the fullest and place it near the top of my \\"must read now\\" list.	2004-10-31

I had a chance to review the book Core Java 2 - Volume 1 - Fundamentals (7th Edition) by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell (Prentice Hall).  This is a very good choice for experienced programmers who want to learn Java and have a good reference book to continue to use over time...<br /><br />Chapter List: An Introduction to Java; The Java Programming Environment; Fundamental Programming Structures in Java; Objects and Classes; Inheritance; Interfaces and Inner Classes; Graphics Programming; Event Handling; User Interface Components with Swing; Deploying Applets and Applications; Exceptions and Debugging; Streams and Files; Generic Programming; Java Keywords; Retrofitting JDK 5.0 Code; Index<br /><br />When a book survives into its seventh edition, you know it must be good.  Core Java 2 is that.  It's a solid, serious treatment of the Java language with plenty of examples and in-depth explanations as to how things work.  And while no single book can cover the complete Java API, this book does a good job of documenting each area they cover so that you can refer back to the work as you start to use Java on a regular basis.  There are not a lot of good Java learning books that also adequately serve as a reference book.  The authors should be commended for this.<br /><br />Because the authors target \\"serious\\" developers, there's less emphasis on Hello World type applications and more focus on the types of routines you might find yourself writing in a business environment.  There's also coverage of the newest features in Java 1.5, so you can buy this particular edition with fear of having it be obsolete in a month.<br /><br />This is a volume that I'll happily keep on my shelf and refer to as I get into some of the newer features of Java...	2004-10-31

I've been doing application development for a long time, and some of that time has been spent doing web development.  While I wouldn't grab this book to find an answer to an HTML or JavaScript question, I would use it to understand graphical composition, navigation, and more of the site structure thoughts.  There's always new stuff to learn, and it helps to get new ideas from others in that area.  And if you've seen my (lack of) graphical ability, you'd understand.  Die-hard web designers will also squawk about the reliance on tables and frames for design.  I'd tend to agree with them, but I'm also not as dogmatic about the whole issue.<br /><br />If you're a casual computer use who thinks they have a great idea for a web site, and if you think you could build that site on your own, you'd probably gravitate to a book like this.  To be sure, everything you absolutely need to know is in here.  But I think you could quickly find yourself overwhelmed with everything you need to learn to set the site up.  And when you start talking about setting up an online store and shopping carts, you could end up making mistakes that could cost you dearly in security and fraud.<br /><br />So is it a good book?  In my opinion, yes.  It's well-written and there is a lot of valuable information in it.  I just tend to think it serves developers with some prior background knowledge better than it would serve a complete newbie.bably gravitate to a book like this.

I've just found another favorite series/style of tech book for learning Java.  This one is Java Garage by Eben Hewitt (Prentice Hall).  Quirky, funny, strange, and it rocks...<br /><br />Chapter list:  What is the Java Garage?; Java Buzz; Java Editions and Platforms; Compiling and Running Java Applications; Where to Write Code; Primitive Types; Operators; Control Statements; Classes; Fridge: Mmm-mmm Lamb Chops and a Manhattan; Classes Reloaded; Inheritance; Strings; Arrays; Documenting Your Code with Javadoc; Abstract Classes; Interfaces; Casting and Type Conversions; Inner Classes; Blog: Inner Classes and Event Handlers; Handling Exceptions; File Input/Output; Fridge: Guacamole; Using Regular Expressions; Creating GUIs with Swing; Blog Entry: Software Development Black Market; Dates and Times; Using Timer Tasks; Applets; Fridge: Big Daddy Flapjacks; Using System and Runtime; Using the Java Development Tools; FAQ; Packaging and Deploying Java Applications; Toolkit; System.Exit; Java Glossary on Steroids; Index<br /><br />And yes, there *are* recipes for guacamole, pancakes, lamb chops, and a Manhattan in the book.  I *told* you it was quirky...<br /><br />This book is hard to describe.  Hewitt's concept of \\"the garage\\" is a place where you go on Saturday to bang on things and hack it out.  It's a place to experiment.  It's where you go to be alone and to be with your friends.  I look at the book and I think \\"zen\\" and \\"stream of consciousness\\".  The author is talking to you in the pages, and it's not so much a tutorial as it is a couple of geeks sitting down learning a programming language by doing.  And like all conversations, there are little sidebars that fill in the color and flavor of the main topic being discussed.<br /><br />Looking beyond the style, the content is solid.  It covers Java version 1.5, so you're getting the latest in features and techniques.  There are code samples all over the place in the book, and much to my pleasure, they are commented extensively.  He tells you exactly what the code is doing in the comments, so there's no guessing as to what might have been intended.  Since I tend to comment in this fashion, I am thrilled to see someone else who does that too.  Anyone needing to learn Java will be able to pick up this book and absorb the concepts without much effort.  Even if you're already somewhat knowledgeable on Java, you'll enjoy reading the book to get a new slant on things.  It's one of the few techie books that is almost an enjoyable read even if you don't need the lessons.<br /><br />Java Garage is a refreshing break from the ordinary, and it will force you to shelve your expectations as to what a learning guide should be.

Body Double by Tess Gerritsen.  A nice read...<br /><br />Dr. Maura Isles is a pathologist in the big city.  Her life takes a bizarre turn when someone is shot and murdered in front of her apartment.  The problem is that the victim could pass as her identical twin.  If true, this means that Isles had a sister she didn't know about, and it looks as if that sister was trying to contact her.  She talks to a lawyer who handled the twin's adoption, and finds out that her mother is a mentally deranged prisoner convicted of a brutal slaying of two sisters, one of which was nearly full-term pregnant.  Continuing the investigation, she finds that it's possible that her mother had an accomplice who is still on the loose, and it may be the person who killed her sister and may also be looking for her.<br /><br />The writing in this book is pretty tight, and the plot line is workable.  There's the subtext of Isles discovering a sister she didn't know existed, and struggling to decide whether she wants to know if the monster she meant in prison is really her mother.  If so, do the genetics of the family predispose her to this same type of insanity?  This is an author I really enjoy reading, and this book was no exception.  I'm looking forward to her future works.	2004-10-27

As I was part of one of the biggest corporate mistakes in U.S. history, I thought it would be interesting to read Will Your Next Mistake Be Fatal? by Robert E. Mittelstaedt, Jr.  I wasn't disappointed...  This should be required reading in all organizations.<br /><br />Chapter list: The Power of M3 and the Need to Understand Mistakes; Execution Mistakes; Execution Mistakes and Successes as Catalysts for Change; Strategy - How Do You Know It's a Mistake?; Physical Disasters with Cultural Foundations and Business Implications; Cultures that Create \\"Accidents\\"; Mistakes as Catalysts for Cultural Change; Economics at Work: Watching Entire Industries Lose It; Mistakes Aren't Just for Big Companies - Small Company Chains; Making M3 Part of Your Culture for Success; Summary of Insights; References; Index<br /><br />I started working for Enron Broadband back in 1998 when it first got going.  I was laid off on September 1st, 2001 when the Portland office closed.  Little did any of us know that the entire company would melt down just three months later.  Did they plan for that to be the culmination of all their actions?  No, but no one in power saw the signs and had enough courage to stop the string of mistakes that ultimately doomed the company.  Mittelstaedt uses Enron and numerous other companies to show how a culture of tolerating mistakes can lead a company to the brink of disaster (and many times right over the edge).  But instead of just concentrating on \\"when bad things happen to good companies\\", he also covers how strong leadership can allow a company to survive and prosper in adverse conditions (like J&J's handling of the Tylenol tampering case).  There's a lot of material here that is excellent reading and should cause organizations to ponder their ways.<br /><br />There are 38 \\"insights\\" that summarize the main teachings and help the reader to focus on making the necessary changes for success.  Insights such as \\"fly the airplane\\" and \\"you cannot afford even a whiff of an ethical lapse\\" are easy to remember and should quickly bring you back to a proper attitude for running a successful and thriving organization.  Oh, and the \\"M3\\" you see in the chapter list refers to \\"managing multiple mistakes\\".  Once you start to implement a systematic approach to M3, you won't guarantee that your company will never make an error or misstep again.  But you will be assured of not letting things get totally beyond control.<br /><br />Excellent book, and it's so very relevant to today's business environment.

Every once in awhile I read a book that reminds me I'm not a very introspective person, and I don't do \\"subtle\\".  This time it's Islands In The Clickstream by Richard Thieme.<br /><br />Chapter list: This is the Way the Internet Works; Computer-Mediated Living: The Digital Filter; Doing Business Digitally; Hacking and the Passion for Knowledge; Digital Spirituality; Mostly True Predictions; The Psychology of Digital Life: Identity and Destiny; Political Implications; The Dark Side of the Moon and Beyond; Technology Gets Personal<br /><br />Thieme is a speaker and writer who is apparently in high demand.  This book is a compilation of selected essays from his [...] site over a time period from January 1997 to March 2004.  His background is one of an Episcopalian priest who left the ministry to focus on \\"the impact of computer technology on organizations, societies, and one's own self\\".  When I got the book for review, I was looking forward to some practical insights that I could apply.  What I got was a number of ethereal, new-age'ish thoughts on things that sometimes didn't even touch on technology.  Occasionally there was a gem or two I could relate to, but I found myself reading faster and faster just to get to the end.  For me, it wasn't worth the time investment.<br /><br />Another irritating part of this book...  Because it's selected writings over a eight year period, you get repeated thoughts and phrases grouped together instead of spaced over the months that they originally occurred.  After reading about the same scene from Blade Runner over and over, you wonder if the guy was fixated on the movie.  In reality, the original essays were spaced over many months and that wouldn't have been noticeable.  Same thing with an incident where a woman asked him \\"Do you still believe in God?\\" after he left the ministry.  Over months, the conversation would be useful for examples.  Seeing it in 50% of the essays in a chapter, it gets redundant.  And when he spends a whole chapter relating his UFO interest to the digital world, I was pretty much ready for it to be over.<br /><br />I'll admit I tend to be less introspective and more pragmatic.  As a result, a book like this doesn't work well for me.  Some of my friends who are more contemplative would probably love it.  But since this is my review, you get my thoughts...  That's about five hours of my life I'll never have back.a whole chapter relating his UFO interest to the digital world, I was pretty much ready for it to be over. <br /> <br />I'll admit I tend to be less introspective and more pragmatic.

(...)<br /><br />The story follows a number of spammers as they take their first steps into the world of unsolicited bulk mailings, and how they learn to evade the laws and regulations designed to shut them down.  At the same time, you're reading about a group of anti-spammers who take spam seriously and make it their primary goal to shut these people down.  The detective work and technical skill exhibited by both sides is quite incredible, and it's amazing to read what type of lengths both sides go to in order to win their battles.<br /><br />Most of the story revolves around Davis Hawke, a neo-Nazi who is evading his past to make his fortune in internet marketing, and Susan Gunn, a determined anti-spammer who soon becomes the queen of the anti-spammers.  Along the way, you meet a number of other interesting characters on both sides of the issue.  You'll also read about the internet groups like Spamhaus.org and NANAE who police this activity and battle the spammers every step of the way.  And even though there are no acts of violence carried out, the physical threats are real, and many of the escalations are scary.  When you have spammers posting your name, address, and phone number on the web with pictures of where you live, things can get dicey.<br /><br />The book doesn't necessarily have one of those \\"feel good\\" endings.  Spammers still spam, and some of the players in the book are still evading the law.  Furthermore, you don't walk away with a number of ideas on how to combat the problem.  This is more along of the lines of an autobiography that takes you up to a couple months ago, but could be continued and added to each year.  You won't finish the book feeling optimistic, but you'll understand the players much better than you did.	2004-10-23

If you're looking for a book to explain the array of options when it comes to high-speed internet access, get a copy of the book Broadband Bible Desktop Edition by James E. Gaskin (Wiley).  This is a really good book...<br /><br />Chapter list:  Why You Need Broadband Internet Access; Getting Familiar with Broadband Technology; Types of Broadband Providers; Types of Alternative Broadband Providers; Emerging Broadband Service Options; Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option; Understanding Computer Security; Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup; Examining the Multitenant Broadband Hookup; Server and Storage Options; What You Need To Know About Desktop Networking; What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks and Routing; Backup and Disaster Recovery; Wired Connection Options; Wireless Connection Options; Wireless Security in Depth; Avoiding Wireless Eavesdropping and Hacking; Troubleshooting Internet Access Problems; Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection; Quick Hits Roundup; Additional Web Directory Listings; Broadband, Internet, and Networking Definitions; Index<br /><br />If you haven't yet made the jump to broadband internet access, you may be confused over all the options and terminology.  Cable vs. DSL?  Home networking?  Routers?  Gaskin does an excellent job in this book to explain everything you need to know to make the move.  The flow of the book is well-done, in that it moves from \\"why do you need broadband\\" to \\"here's how you decide which option is best\\".  Even for those of us who have had broadband for awhile, it's a good read to catch up on some other options that are becoming more viable, such as broadband over power lines.  The writing is clear and concise, without falling into endless jargon that defies the reader to understand it.<br /><br />This book would have helped me out immensely when I made the jump from a slower DSL line to 3MB cable internet access.  Since we have a number of computers in the home, I wasn't quite sure how to make sure I did and bought the right things to allow me to get them all to access the internet.  Although I ended up being successful at the whole setup, there was a lot of fear and trepidation on my part.  With Gaskin's book, I would have been much more confident up front.  Even now, there's some information in here that will help me debug an issue I'm having with communication between two of the computers.<br /><br />For a single source of understandable information on moving to high-speed internet access, you won't go wrong with this book.  Highly recommended.to make sure I did and bought the right things to allow me to get them all to access the internet.

Being a long-time resident of Portland, Oregon, I know that there are plenty of quirky locations in the city.  Fugitives And Refugees by Chuck Palahniuk reminded me of that...<br /><br />This is one of those strange little books that will probably only appeal to those who live (or have lived) in the city.  It's sort of a travel guide, personal diary, and social commentary of Palahnuik wrapped into a single small volume.  Each chapter that deals with locations or places to see is followed by a \\"postcard\\" from the past that relates a personal experience.  These are really bizarre stories, and you'll either really like them or wonder why they are even in the book.  The chapters on locations list such things as restaurants to see, the most haunted locations in Portland, and museums that are worth visiting.  Many of these sites are *not* five star locations you'll see in any other travel guide, like Wacky Willy's Surplus.  But it will send you down the path to the off-beat side of Portland.<br /><br />The part I found most interesting is the chapter on the Shanghai Tunnels.  Portland was a notorious port in earlier days, and most of the bars and hotels at that time were connected to an underground tunnel system.  These tunnels were used to \\"shanghai\\", or abduct, people and smuggle them onto ships for forced labor.  There were also opium dens and other uses for these underground passages.  Over time they deteriorated, but there are now guided tours and efforts to restore them as part of Portland's past.<br /><br />Is the book good?  It's got moments...  For me, it was more hit and miss, however...	2004-10-23

I finally finished McNally's Bluff by Laurence Sanders and Vincent Lardo.  I say *finally* as this one took me about a week when generally it'd be a two day book...<br /><br />Archy McNally is called to investigate a murder when a party he's attending turns into a crime scene.  A carnival owner who has moved into town has a maze built on the property, and during a grand opening party his wife is murdered and found dead in the goal of the maze.  It's nearly impossible that she was able to appear earlier as a performer at the party and then be found dead, but that's apparently what happened.  There are a number of people who might be connected to the death in some way, but none appear to have a clear-cut motive.  When one of these people shows up dead, the plot gets even more complicated.  Archy is trying to solve the murder and unravel the mystery before anyone else dies in the process...<br /><br />Normally I'm a big fan of the McNally series written by Lardo since Sanders passed away.  And on the surface, this latest installment has the same witty writing and word play.  But something just seems to be missing.  Archie and Connie are no longer together, and the relationship between him and Georgia doesn't seem to advance anywhere here.  His normal frustration with Binky is not there, as Binky seems to have a mind and life of his own in this book.  Even Archie's dad, the head of the law firm, plays an extremely minor role here.  The spark that normally propels me along with these books just wasn't there.<br /><br />Everyone's entitled to an off-day.  I just hope this isn't a precursor to the end of an excellent series...	2004-10-22

Your discarded toys will never be quite the same again.<br /><br />Chapter list: Tools of the Warranty Voiding Trade; Electrical Engineering Basics; Declawing Your CueCat; Case Modification: Building a Custom Terabyte FireWire Hard Drive; Macintosh; Home Theater PCs; Hack Your Atari 2600 and 7800; Hack Your Atari 5200 and 8-Bit Computer; Hacking the PlayStation 2; Wireless 802.11 Hacks; Hacking the iPod; Can You Hear Me Now? Nokia 6210 Mobile Phone Modifications; Upgrading Memory on Palm Devices; Operating Systems Overview; Coding 101; Index<br /><br />The first thing to know about this book is that it isn't a beginner's volume.  There is some serious hardware modifications going on here.  You should be comfortable with electrical theory, devices such as resistors and capacitors, and tools like soldering irons.  Also, I'd recommend that you don't try these things on primary devices.  I'd say there's a decent chance you could damage it trying some of these tricks.  But having said all that, you'll enjoy the book if you meet the above qualifications.<br /><br />Since I'm not a major hardware geek, I don't know that I could do many of these mods.  One of the mods that would be useful even to non-geeks is the chapter on the iPod.  You will learn how to replace the battery and how to upgrade the hard drive on your earlier generation iPods, and you don't even need to be that handy.  That tip alone would probably pay for the cost of the book.  Each hack is very well illustrated with excellent photos and instructions, so you don't feel like you're reading assembly instructions written by something that was run through an automatic translator.<br /><br />So if you have some old video game consoles gathering dust in the basement, pull them out and see what you can do with them using this book.  You'll end up being the envy of all your geeky friends.  :-)ll end up being the envy of all your geeky friends.  :-)	2004-10-21
486176:US	52517734	RCZ22DP9M8B3V	1583470441	29809195	Eclipse: Step-by-Step (Step-by-Step series)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A good choice for the right target audience...	As part of my preparation for an Eclipse presentation later this month, I reviewed Eclipse Step-By-Step by Joe Pluta (MC Press).  For someone with absolutely no exposure to the package, this will help you get started.<br /><br />Chapter list: Welcome to Eclipse!; Installing Eclipse; Introducing the Workbench; The Resource Perspective; The Java Perspective; The Debug Perspective; A Simple Program; Running and Debugging; The User Interface; Adding the Database; Install a Java Runtime; Install Winzip; Download Eclipse; On Things GUI; Start Your SQL Engines; Index<br /><br />I think to understand this book's style, you have to know the target audience of the author.  He wants to show working code and examples that are well commented, and he wants to walk you through the steps involved in a task.  He also wanted to show how Eclipse works from a Java perspective, even if the reader doesn't know Java.  That's why you can type in the code he provides, or you can import it from the CD.  The steps are very detailed with tons of screen shots to show you what each step should look like.  Things are taken in bite-size chunks, so that really *anyone* could understand and use Eclipse by the time you get done with this book.  If you have any experience with Eclipse already, you probably won't get much out of this book that you don't already know.  But the beginner will be able to work through this material with no problem.<br /><br />The argument could be made that there is too much handholding and screen shots of things that people have seen millions of times already.  In addition, the screen shots are large.  They take up a lot of space and make the book larger than it probably deserves to be.  For a $60 book, I think I would have tried for smaller images and more content to make up the 362 pages.  Experienced IT professionals might think it's too much step-by-step detail, but then again the hard-core IT person probably isn't the target audience.  Finally, once you work through this material, you'll want to get a more detailed book on Eclipse to learn how to use the tool with all the whistles and bells.  But at least you'll have the basics down before you get there.<br /><br />So do I recommend it?  If you want a no-threat introduction to Eclipse that assumes very little, yes.  If you're looking for a single reference volume that will give you all the finely detailed minutiae of the platform, no.  It all depends on where you're at and what you want.ough this material, you'll want to get a more detailed book on Eclipse to learn how to use the tool with all the whistles and bells.

Since I'm not \\"hardware oriented\\" when it comes to technology, you have to work hard to help me understand it.  One book that does a great job is the PC Upgrade and Repair Bible Desktop Edition by Barry Press and Marcia Press (Wiley).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Getting Ready; Why Isn't the Same Computer Right for Everyone?; PC Overview; Processors, Cache, and Memory; Buses, Chipsets, and Motherboards; Video; Monitors and Flat Panels; Hard Disks and Disk Arrays; CD and DVD; Removable Storage; Modems; Wired and Wireless Networking; Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls; Configuring a Windows Network; Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam; Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players; Digital Cameras, Video Capture, and DVDs; Keyboards and Game Controllers; Mice, Trackballs, and Tablets; Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units; Cases, Cooling, and Power; Laptops and Handheld Computers; You're Going to Put That Where?; Diagnosis and Repair; Building an Extreme Machine; Glossary; Index<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I'm a software developer and I just want my hardware to work.  One of the hardest things for me to do would be to try and build a computer from scratch.  But watching my son (who has no fear of hardware) has made me a bit more at ease with it.  And with this book, I think I could actually try it.  Each of the chapters gives an excellent explanation about how that piece of hardware works and how it fits into the larger picture of a full computer.  For instance, in the CD chapter you'll get an understandable write-up of how information is stored and read on a CD-ROM disk.  Then they transition into how a DVD is read and how the drive functions.  And I actually understood it!<br /><br />The only place where I thought this book was a little weak is that there doesn't seem to be a lot of upgrade or repair instructions.  I expected more along the lines of step-by-step pictures and instructions on how to replace or repair certain parts in your machine.  There is some of that towards the end when you get into the Diagnosis and Repair chapters, but little as you're working through the book.  Some buyers might be a little upset that the title doesn't quite mesh with the content of the book.  Still, the actual content *is* quite good...  just not what you might expect.<br /><br />Overall, I like the book a lot as it helps me understand my computer hardware better than I did before.  Just a minor deduction for possible title and content confusion...machine.

Last night I finished the book Outsource: Competing in the Global Productivity Race by Edward Yourdon (Prentice Hall).  I'm highly impressed with Yourdon's treatment of this subject.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introduction; Key Factors Driving Outsourcing; Today's Situation in IT; Additional Forms of Outsourcing; Likely Trends for the Next Decade; Implications for the Individual; Implications for Companies Supplying Knowledge-Based Services; Implications for Companies Buying Knowledge-Based Products or Services; Implications for Government and Society; Conclusion; Index<br /><br />Since outsourcing (especially off-shoring) is such an emotional subject, it's hard to find a book that doesn't quickly descend into histrionics and hand-wringing.  And in the past, Yourdon has had a tendency to paint doom and gloom scenarios (like Y2K) and hype them.  But in this book, the whole subject of outsourcing is treated in an analytical and realistic way.  Yourdon accepts the fact that the American consumer wants cheap, high quality items, and that companies have to consider outsourcing to provide those products.  When foreign knowledge workers can be found for a fraction of the cost of US workers, it's hard to ignore.  So by acknowledging the reality of outsourcing, Yourdon moves on to what you can do as an individual to protect yourself.<br /><br />To me, this is where the book shines.  Yourdon lays out a number of steps that a knowledge worker in the US can take to protect their career and weather the trends that are becoming more common.  This is the only (in my opinion) rational approach to take.  You can yell and whine about how companies are unfair, but ultimately your career and ability to pay your rent is up to you.  Taking Yourdon's advice may not stop you from being off-shored or outsourced, but you'll be ready for it if it does happen, and you'll be able to keep moving along with your life.<br /><br />Recommended reading for everyone that earns their living by what they know...hat they know...	2004-10-17

I just had my eyes opened to all that Visio can do by reviewing the book Visio 2003 Bible by Bonnie Biafore (Wiley).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Getting Started with Visio; Getting Started with Drawings; Working with Visio Files; Working with Shapes; Connecting Shapes; Working with Text; Formatting Visio Elements; Inserting, Linking, and Embedding Objects; Importing, Exporting, and Publishing Visio Data to the Web; Linking Shapes with Data; Collaborating with Others; Building Block Diagrams; Constructing Charts and Graphs; Working with Organization Charts; Working with Flowcharts; Documenting Business Processes; Scheduling Projects with Visio; Documenting Brainstorming Sessions; Modeling and Documenting Databases; Building UML Models; Building Software Development Diagrams; Mapping Web Sites; Creating Network Diagrams; Working with Scaled Drawings; Creating Scaled Plan Drawings; Laying Out Architectural and Engineering Plans; Integrating CAD and Visio; Working with Engineering Drawings; Creating and Customizing Templates; Creating and Customizing Stencils; Creating and Customizing Shapes; Customizing Shapes Using ShapeSheets; Formatting with Styles; Customizing Toolbars and Menus; Automating Visio; Installing Visio 2003; Visio 2003 Help Resources; Additional Resources for Templates and Stencils; Keyboard Shortcuts; Template and Stencil Reference; Index<br /><br />As you can tell, there's not much left to cover after Bonnie gets done.  :-)<br /><br />As an IT professional, I've used Visio for the basics.  Someone wants a flowchart, I can fake my way through a decent looking diagram.  And that was pretty much all I thought Visio could do...  basic drawings.  But going through this book was an eye-opener.  I didn't know that you could output Visio output for the web.  I didn't know you could hook shapes up to data sources.  And I *really* didn't know that Visio could produce a site map of a web site!  Guess what I'll be trying at work tomorrow...<br /><br />The author does a great job of covering the material at a level that everyone can understand.  Due to the comprehensive nature of the book, I think that all levels of users can get something from the book, too.  Those who are new to Visio will get a good foundation in the basics.  Those (like me) who haven't explored past the basics will discover all sorts of new toys.  And experts may find a feature or two that they didn't know about.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper that will end up on my bookshelf at work, and one that I'll have to guard against greedy fingers...author does a great job of covering the material at a level that everyone can understand.

Getting out of the tech genre for awhile, I relaxed with Mark Billingham's Scaredy Cat.  This is his follow-up to Sleepyhead (that I really liked)...<br /><br />A number of killings in England has Tom Thorne looking for a serial killer.  The victims are found in pairs, and although the methods are similar, the intensity of the violence is different.  He figures there are actually a pair of killers working in tandem.  The pair of killers go back to a grammar school friendship, and it's the typical controller/controllee type relationship.  The cops quickly get one of the killers, but then try to set a trap for the other one.  Unfortunately, the trap backfires and the killer starts to strike closer to home.  The question becomes can he be stopped before he kills someone close to Thorne.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I really liked Sleepyhead.  Very dark, and hard to tell who was guilty and who was innocent.  Scaredy Cat was just as dark, but the suspense wasn't there.  You find out right away who the killers are, but you're not quite sure about the current identity of the controlling personality.  The relationship between the killers is rather complex and somewhat ill-explained, and one of the common elements that tie them together is left to hang out there for far too long.  When it's finally revealed, it doesn't seem to have the impact that it was probably intended to.  Thorne's personal torments don't seem to do anything but sit there.  The relationship between his partner Holland and a female cop with issues also doesn't seem to add anything to the storyline.<br /><br />Maybe it's just the sophomore jinx, but this novel definitely isn't on par with his first...	2004-10-15

If you're looking for a single volume on XML to give you many of the answers you need, I would suggest checking out XML In A Nutshell by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introducing XML; XML Fundamentals; Document Type Definitions (DTDs); Namespaces; Internationalization; XML as a Document Format; XML on the Web; XSL Transformation (XSLT); XPath; XLinks; XPointers; XInclude; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS); XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO); Resource Directory Description Language (RDDL); XML as a Data Format; XML Schemas; Programming Models; Document Object Model (DOM); Simple API for XML (SAX); XML Reference; Schemas Reference; XPath Reference; XSLT Reference; DOM Reference; SAX Reference; Character Sets; Index<br /><br />As you can see, there's a lot of ground covered here.  Since XML is such a diverse set of standards and technologies, different readers will probably get differing amounts of value from this book.  For instance, if I was delving into CSS for a website project, this book wouldn't give me much of what I need.  The coverage on CSS is very light and introductory.  Conversely, if I was starting to use SAX, the initial chapter on SAX along with the reference chapter would give me a solid foundational base from which to work.  It seems that most of the quality material is found in the core XML standards.  And as with most Nutshell books, they are not meant to be tutorials for the beginner.  They provide a no-fluff reference for the professional to refer back to for quick answers.  This book coupled with a stand-alone book on a specific XML standard would be a great combination.<br /><br />Is it perfect?  No.  But it will give you a lot of information in a single location that will prevent you from having to comb through multiple other volumes.	2004-10-11

I recently picked up a book at the library titled The Fiefdom Syndrome by Robert J. Herbold.  This is an excellent book on understanding and eliminating corporate turf battles.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introduction; The Problem With Fiefdoms; Fiefdoms And Human Nature; The Seven Disciplines Of The Well-Run Corporation; The Six People Disciplines; Creativity And Fiefdoms; Balancing Discipline And Creativity; Achieving Discipline; Fostering Creativity; How Fiefdoms Affect Strategy And Execution; How Fiefdoms Hamstring Mergers And Acquisitions; Communication As A Tool To Fight Fiefdoms; Beating The Fiefdom Syndrome; Index<br /><br />If you've worked in corporate America for any length of time, you've experienced the fiefdom syndrome.  A manager runs their department as if they were a wholly separate company, and decisions are made to benefit the department, not the corporation.  This type of behavior, if not confronted and eliminated, leads to less than optimal performance for the organization.  In extreme cases, it can kill the department AND the corporation.  Herbold does a great job of both cataloging the behaviors that indicate the existence of fiefdoms, as well as the steps of well-run organizations that prevent them from forming.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for management in large corporations, regardless of whether they think they have problems or not (and you probably do have them).  Smaller companies would do well to take these lessons to heart in order to successfully grow without sabotaging one's success.	2004-10-10

One of the most comprehensive books I've seen lately on malware is the title Malware: Fighting Malicious Code by Ed Skoudis with Lenny Zeltser (Prentice Hall).<br /><br />Chapter list: Introduction; Viruses; Worms; Malicious Mobile Code; Backdoors; Trojan Horses; User-Mode Rootkits; Kernal-Mode Rootkits; Going Deeper; Scenarios; Malware Analysis; Conclusion; Index<br /><br />In each of these chapters, the authors give a brief history of that malware type, an in-depth explanation as to how they work, and complete coverage on how you can help prevent getting damaged by it.  Each chapter wraps up with a conclusion, a summary, and the list of references for the chapter.  For readers looking to find detailed information, they won't be disappointed.  For readers looking at receiving their first exposure to the material, the writing style is easy to follow and doesn't overwhelm.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the chapters on Malware Analysis and Scenarios.  The Analysis chapter gives you an excellent outline for setting up a malware analysis lab.  You'll learn how to set up the hardware, protect yourself against leakage to other networks, and what software is needed to do your analysis.  Following this outline, you'll be well-prepared to track down bugs like a pro.  The Scenario chapter is also excellent.  The authors set up three malware scenarios with actual people and configurations, and show how certain choices and mistakes can lead to disaster.  There's lots of good learning material here.<br /><br />Great book, excellent material, and a definite must for your security bookshelf.	2004-10-09

I received a really cool book today titled F1 Get The Most Out Of Excel by Joseph Rubin, CPA (Limelight Media).  A unique format that has a lot of practical use...<br /><br />Chapter list:  What's New in Excel 2002 & 2003; Working Inside; Excel Environment; Text, Date, Times; Summing & Counting; Formulas; Printing & Mailing; Lists, Analyzing Data; Index<br /><br />I like books that are practical, but I don't think I've ever seen one that is set up to be *this* practical.  There are 322 tips spread out over the chapters listed above.  Each tip occupies a left/right page arrangement.  On the right page is the title of the tip, the explanation of how to accomplish the task, and a screen print that illustrates the point.  On the left, you have an area for \\"Notes\\" and \\"My Tips/Shortcuts\\".  So not only do you have the author's information, but you can build up your own collection of notes on Excel tricks.  At the very bottom of the left page, there's a reference to any related tips or shortcuts.  I'm very impressed with the layout of this book.  It's excellent.  Also, each tip notes the versions of Excel that the tip relates to.  The vast majority of the information encompasses Excel 97, 2000, 2002, and 2003.<br /><br />With all the tips and information, the book runs over 800 pages.  It's printed in a smaller format, so it's pretty easy to carry around.  About the only thing I can fault the publisher for (*not* the author) is the thickness of the paper used in the book.  The paper is pretty thin in order to keep the book from getting too bulky.  The problem is that ink will easily bleed through if you aren't careful with your own notes (or even if you *are* careful).  I think you better plan on using a pencil for any notes.<br /><br />Excellent material in a unique, practical format...  A definite winner for Excel users.	2004-10-08

I recently received a copy of Privacy: What Developers and IT Professionals Should Know by J. C. Cannon (Addison-Wesley).  This is a good book that does an excellent job in delivering to the target audience.<br /><br />Chapter list:  An Overview Of Privacy; The Importance of Privacy-Enhancing and Privacy-Aware Technologies; Privacy Legislation; Managing Windows Privacy; Managing Spam; Privacy-Invasive Devices; Building a Privacy Organizational Infrastructure; The Privacy Response Center; Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P); Integrating Privacy in the Development Process; Performing a Privacy Analysis; A Sample Privacy-Aware Application; Protecting Database Data; Managing Access to Data: A Coding Example; Digital Rights Management; Privacy Section for a Feature Specification; Privacy Review Template; Data Analysis Template; List of Privacy Content; Privacy Checklist; Privacy Standard; References; Index<br /><br />In today's environment, nearly every aspect of your daily existence touches data processing systems in some way.  And if you surf the web, you know you are constantly being asked for personal and demographic information.  But all too often, privacy issues related to all this information are not addressed in a secure, consistent methodology.  Because of that, you stand a good chance of having far more personal information released to 3rd parties than you may be comfortable with.  This book will help you become aware of the issues and build solid systems and processes that protect that privacy.<br /><br />The first part of the book shows you how to secure your own privacy when you're working with computers.  With the use of features such as pop-up blockers, cookie blockers, anonymous email services, and other related tools, you can effectively control the amount of information about your person and your activities while online.  This information is really useful to anyone reading the book regardless of whether they are in IT or not.  The second part of the book concentrates more on building software and processes that recognizes this right to privacy and gives the consumer choices on how to disclose and manage their personal information.  The information is very practical and readable, and organizations would do well to consider the information presented here.<br /><br />If you happen to be working in an industry affected by legislation such as HIPAA, this book becomes critical.  If you're dealing with personal health information, you have no choices when it comes to privacy.  The laws are spelled out, and the legal consequences for violating these laws are severe.  Companies such as these should definitely get a copy.<br /><br />This information has even affected one of the application changes I am currently working on.  The user wanted to track the number of hits that a document got for reading.  I started to build the change to track *who* read it, but then remembered that \\"less is more\\".  There's no reason to track that information, so I shouldn't.  As a result, I've got a more privacy-friendly application that delivers the desired results without violating the reader's privacy.<br /><br />Good book, and worth the time for reading...d part of the book concentrates more on building software and processes that recognizes this right to privacy and gives the consumer choices on how to disclose and manage their personal information.

Enterprise Java Beans are not easy to understand.  A great way to get started in that area is the book Head First EJB by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates (O'Reilly).<br /><br />Chapter list: Welcome to EJB; EJB Architecture; Exposing Yourself; Being a Session Bean; Entities are Persistent; Being an Entity Bean; When Beans Relate; Getting the Message; The Atomic Age; When Beans Go Bad; Protect Your Secrets; The Joy of Deployment; Final Mock Exam; Index<br /><br />When I first started trying to learn EJB technology awhile back, I used a different book.  Within two chapters I was totally lost and feeling really stupid.  Not one to give up quickly, I gave it another try with Head First EJB.  I learned more in the first chapter of that book than I learned in the entire prior book.  The Head First method of writing and learning almost ensures that you'll be able to pick up even the most difficult concepts, and you'll definitely have more fun doing so.<br /><br />The primary goal of this book is to help you pass the Sun Certified Business Component Developer Exam.  Since Kathy and Bert are co-developers of the test, you can pretty much figure out they understand the content and style of the questions that you will face.  It'd be hard to go wrong using this as a primary study guide.  You can read the material to fill in the gaps of your understanding, and then use the mock exam to figure out if you're ready for the real test.  But even if the test is not on your radar screen, this book will give you the foundational information you'll need to start out with EJBs.  Once you've got that down, then you can go play with the more \\"serious\\" material...<br /><br />Once again, a great title from the Head First team.  I can't wait to see what they will cover next.	2004-10-04

(This review is for the 3rd edition of the book)<br /><br />Thread programming in Java can be a great feature or the bane of your existence.  If you need a good book for understanding the subject in depth, get a copy of Java Threads (3rd edition) by Scott Oaks and Henry Wong (O'Reilly).  It's quite good...<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introduction to Threads; Thread Creation and Management; Data Synchronization; Thread Notification; Minimal Synchronization Techniques; Advanced Synchronization Topics; Threads and Swing; Threads and Collection Classes; Thread Scheduling; Thread Pools; Task Scheduling; Threads and I/O; Miscellaneous Thread Topics; Thread Performance; Parallelizing Loops for Multiprocessor Machines; Superseded Threading Utilities; Index<br /><br />The first thing to note about this book is it's now in its 3rd edition, and apparently has been vastly improved.  I never read the 2nd edition, but the reviews on Amazon are less than steller.  The authors have updated the book using J2SE 5.0, which has improved the threading abilities of Java.  As a result, there are fewer custom classes in the book that the authors deemed necessary to do more complex tasks.  The focus has returned to core Java threading functionality available in the latest version of Java, so you'll be getting the most up to date information here.  The subject matter starts off with the basics of threading, and then builds upon that information so that you can start to code and build complex threading applications.  They also do a good job of noting the differences in 5.0 so that you can see where improvements have occurred.  All really good stuff...<br /><br />I enjoyed going through this book, and I'm sure I'll be referring back to it on a constant basis when my coding starts to get into any threading issues.	2004-10-04

If so, you'll enjoy The Spam Letters by Jonathan Land (No Starch Press).  This is a funny read...<br /><br />Chapter list: Introduction; Products for Prey: Part 1; Foreign Affairs: Part 1; Spam Potpourri: Part 1; A Quick Buck; Interlude: Bad Impressions; Products for Prey: Part 2; Foreign Affairs: Part 2: Nigerian Scam Artists; Sex Sells; Spam Potpourri: Part 2; Warning/Disclaimer: Do Not Try This At Home<br /><br />This isn't a book that is going to give you any technical insights or strategies for dealing with spam.  Actually, it *will* give you a strategy...  yank their chains...  HARD!.  Land has taken various spam emails he's received (or that have been forwarded to him by co-conspirators) and let his warped creative writing skills loose.  Some of his efforts were more for his own benefit, as it was obvious that the return address was not going anywhere that was real.  But his real classics were with real emails who decided to scam or spam the wrong person.  His exchange with the fabric wholesaler in the middle east is funny.  The series with the stainless steel broker is just plausible enough to be real (and the broker played along well).  The best efforts were reserved for the Nigerian scam artists.  His scenarios of playing off scammers against each other, asking for bigger cuts, and playing the role of both financial advisor and committed asylum patient gives any reader who has received one of these emails a vicarious thrill.<br /><br />This is an excellent recreational read, but I probably shouldn't have opened it.  I'm just warped enough to think I could do this too...  :-)	2004-10-03

In my quest to learn Linux, I've been working through the book Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux & Fedora by Bill McCarty (O'Reilly).  This is exactly what I was looking for in a learning guide.<br /><br />Chapter list: Why Run Linux?; Preparing to Install Linux; Installing Linux; How Linux Works; Using the GNOME and KDE Desktops; Using Linux Applications; Conquering the bash Shell; Installing Software Using the RPM Package Manager; Configuring and Administering Linux; Connecting to the Internet; Setting Up Network Services; Advanced Shell Usage and Shell Scripts; Linux Directory Tree; Principal Linux Files; Managing the Boot Process; Linux Command Quick Reference; Index<br /><br />This book concentrates more on the desktop and graphical interface aspect of running Linux, which is exactly what I was looking for.  While this book won't tell you everything you need to know about any specific subject (like shell programming or networking), it covers more than enough to get you up and running with a complete Linux setup.  Using this volume, I've been able to get a full desktop and server setup going with little effort or trouble.  By following the rest of the book, I'll gain a solid base of knowledge of Linux, and then I'll be ready to move on to more detailed learning.<br /><br />Perfect level of coverage for where I'm at, and enough detail to get me up and running quickly...  I like it.	2004-10-03

A recent addition to my Eclipse library has been Eclipse Cookbook by Steve Holzner (O'Reilly).  It works well for my level of expertise at the package, but experienced users might find it lacking...<br /><br />Chapter list:  Basic Skills; Using Eclipse; Java Development; Refactoring, Building, and Launching; Testing and Debugging; Using Eclipse in Teams; Eclipse and Ant; SWT: Text, Buttons, Lists and Nonretangular Windows; SWT: Dialogs, Toolbars, Menus, and More; SWT: Coolbars, Tab Folders; Trees, and Browsers; JSP, Servlets, and Eclipse; Creating Plug-ins: Extension Points, Actions, and Menus; Creating Plug-ins: Wizards, Editors, and Views; Index<br /><br />Like all O'Reilly cookbooks, this follows the standard formula.  A problem is presented, a short two or three line solution is given, and then there's a discussion and fuller explanation of the answer.  There are plenty of screen shots and coding examples to help you through each of the recipes.<br /><br />Overall, the book will benefit new and intermediate users.  The author covers quite a few of the features of Eclipse that make it so powerful, like refactoring, running the debugger, and other various tasks.  You may know that these exist but not know how to use them, or you just may be ignorant of the fact that they even exist.  In that sense, it's really good.  The SWT portion seems to be more centered on programming with Eclipse as a secondary focus.  Maybe because it's because I don't do SWT development, but it just seemed to be a bit out of place.  The material also seems to be pretty basic for a cookbook.  Usually the recipes are more beyond the basics and get into things that aren't quite as intuitive as they might be.<br /><br />This will help me get up to speed on Eclipse, and I do like the book.  I'm just not sure it's for everyone...	2004-10-03

In preparation for a webcast I'm giving this month, I'm working through the book Eclipse by Steve Holzner (O'Reilly).  While not perfect, it's a good tool for learning about the package.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Essential Eclipse; Java Development; Testing and Debugging; Working in Teams; Building Eclipse Projects Using Ant; GUI Programming: From Applets to Swing; SWT: Buttons, Text, Labels, Lists, Layouts, and Events; SWT: Menus, Toolbars, Sliders, Trees, and Dialogs; Web Development; Developing Struts Applications with Eclipse; Developing a Plug-in: The Plug-in Development Environment, Manifests, and Extension Points; Developing a Plug-in: Creating Editors and Views; Eclipse 3.0; Index<br /><br />For the person new to Eclipse, this will do a decent job in getting you started.  Up through the Using Ant chapter, the focus is primarily on Eclipse.  The examples deal with the package, and that seems to be the primary focus.  After that, the style seems to change a bit.  The GUI development chapters seem to focus a lot on GUI programming, and then after that's finished, they show you how to do it in Eclipse.  Mind you, it's good information, but the focus has shifted.  The plug-in chapter gets back to Eclipse as the primary focus again.  While there are entire books dedicated to plug-in development, this chapter will get you comfortable with the idea and concepts.<br /><br />So is the book perfect?  No.  I feel that the material could have been a bit more consistent as to what the foremost goal was...  learning the Eclipse platform.  But having said that, it still accomplishes the goal of teaching you how Eclipse works in different scenarios.  I'd definitely recommend this as an initial Eclipse text for someone.	2004-10-02

If you're ready to make a serious attempt at moving your word processing needs off of Microsoft Word, check out OpenOffice.org Writer - The Free Alternative to Microsoft Word by Jean Hollis Weber (O'Reilly).  This is a no-fluff how-to book that will help you figure out how to work with Writer.<br /><br />Chapter list: Setting Up Writer to Work Your Way; Writing, Editing, and Reviewing Documents; Controlling Page Layout; Using Templates and Styles Effectively; Getting the Most from Fields; Tables of Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies; Working with Large or Complex Documents; Working with Graphics in Writer; Miscellaneous Tips and Tricks; Moving from Microsoft Word; Index<br /><br />This is one of those books that falls outside the normal expectations for tech books.  It's published by O'Reilly Community Press, which is described this way:<br /><br />Unlike classic O'Reilly animal books, O'Reilly's role in the series is limited to providing manufacturing and distribution services rather than editorial development, so that each Community Press title reflects the editorial voice and organization of the community that has created it.<br /><br />As a result, it doesn't have the same polish and finish as what you'd expect from an O'Reilly title.  But don't let that deter you from the excellent content contained within.  There's a three page preface stating the target audience, conventions in font, and all the other standard preface stuff.  After that, it's all practical content on how to do specific tasks in Writer.  The target audience is for intermediate to advanced users, so if you're competent around Word, you'll quickly catch on to what steps are required to produce the same time of reports you normally create in Word.  And if you're just getting exposed to Writer, you'll be amazed at how much power you'll have at your fingertips.  And of course, free is a very good price.<br /><br />The other thing I appreciate about the book is the section on converting to and from Word documents.  That's obviously the biggest concern since Word is nearly a standard in the business place.  The author doesn't try to gloss over and hype the conversion process.  Some things (simple documents) will convert with no problems at all.  Other more complex documents may not convert well at all.  This could lead to some manual tweaking once the document has been moved to the other platform.  But still, you get a good idea as to what you're up against.<br /><br />No fluff, plenty of meat, and highly practical...  A definite winner.ing to and from Word documents.

Looking for either an enjoyable intro into JSP and Servlets or material on passing the Sun Certified Web Component Developer exam?  Grab a copy of Head First Servlets & JSP by Bryan Basham, Kathy Sierra, and Bert Bates.  It rocks...<br /><br />Chapter list:  Intro; Why use Servlets & JSPs; Web app architecture; Mini MVC tutorial; Being a servlet; Being a web app; Conversational state; Being a JSP; Script-free pages; Custom tags are powerful; When JSTL is not enough; Deploying your web app; Keep it secret, keep it safe; The power of filters; Enterprise design patterns; Final mock exam; Index<br /><br />I've stated my preference in the past to learning subjects with a bit of humor thrown in.  OK...  a *lot* of humor.  If I have a chance to pick up a new tech skill with a study guide that makes me laugh and stay interested, I'm in heaven.  Is it any wonder then that I absolutely love the Head First series?  Bates and Sierra have created a concept that is unlike anything else on the market.  Through the use of cartoons, hand-drawn examples, off-beat questions, and other various types of learning material, they engage your brain on a number of levels.  And as a result, you're sucked in and learning stuff in spite of yourself.<br /><br />In this installment, they tackle the subject of servlets and JSPs.  Rather than try and explain things \\"technically\\", they have a common cast of characters throughout the book making observations and points about the material.  Using the hand-drawn notes around illustrations and code, you quickly understand the underlying concepts of what happens with servlet requests and responses, and how JSPs interact with the web server.  And given that there are exercises and questions at the end of each chapter (along with the answers), you have a chance to reinforce your learning immediately.<br /><br />There are two uses for this book.  The primary goal is to help you pass the Sun Certified Web Component Developer exam.  If you already know about servlets and JSPs, get the book for the mock exam and the questions at the end of each chapter.  The authors helped write the actual Sun test, so you'll get a good feel for the types of questions you'll face.  The other use of this book would be to learn and understand the subject matter, like a tutorial.  Once again, an excellent choice for that purpose.  You'll still need to get some sort of \\"official\\" reference book of some sort if you get deeper into the material, but this is a perfect way to get started.<br /><br />Once again, another winner from the warped minds that created the Head First concept.  May they continue to thrive for a long time!w about servlets and JSPs, get the book for the mock exam and the questions at the end of each chapter.

I finished reading an interesting book today called Succeeding With Open Source by Bernard Golden.  If your company is trying to figure out how to evaluate the potential use of open source software, this would be an excellent guide to removing the emotional aspect of the debate.<br /><br />Chapter list:  The Source of Open Source; Open Source Business Models; Open Source Risks; The Open Source Maturity Model; The Open Source Product; Open Source Technical Support; Open Source Documentation; Open Source Training; Open Source Integration with Other Products; Open Source Professional Services; JBoss Open Source Maturity Model Assessment; Conclusion; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />With the subject of open source software becoming more prevalent in corporations, it's often hard to separate logic from emotion.  All the techies have strong religious beliefs on the subject.  Executives are risk-adverse and want to have a \\"single neck to strangle\\" if something goes wrong.  But yet, the ability to use free software that you can own and modify as needed can save huge amounts of money.  How do you make a rational decision on an open source product?  Bernard Golden offers a process called the Open Source Maturity Model that allows you to assess important key components of software (such as training, support, and integration) on a weighted scale based on what's important to your business.  Based on how you see your company's relationship with technology (early adopter or pragmatic), you can then decide whether the software falls in a scoring range that is suitable for your needs.<br /><br />In each of the chapters on the different assessment areas, the author does a good job in examining the different pros and cons of open source.  For instance, documentation can be found in many different areas.  There may be commercial books, forums, discussion groups, or official documentation from the vendor.  These avenues can be examined to see how mature the product is in these areas, and then a score assigned.  Taking this evaluation approach with all your software can eliminate much of the emotional debate and lead to well-reasoned decisions.  The book uses the JBoss open source J2EE server software as an example throughout the book, so you get a feel for how this process really works.  And best of all, all levels of staff will understand the material.<br /><br />If you're having problems getting traction in your organization for open source usage, get a copy of this book and start a rational evaluation.  It may be the missing piece you've been looking for., and then a score assigned.

Are you a system administrator who needs to know more about security tools but you can't devote all your time to it?  A good book to look at is Open Source Security Tools - A Practical Guide To Security Applications by Tony Howlett.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Information Security and Open Source Software; Operating System Tools; Firewalls; Port Scanners; Vulnerability Scanners; Network Sniffers; Intrusion Detection Systems; Analysis and Management Tools; Encryption Tools; Wireless Tools; Forensic Tools; More on Open Source Software; Open Source Licenses; Basic Linux/UNIX Commands; Well-Known TCP/IP Port Numbers; General Permission and Waiver Form; References; Index<br /><br />This book is designed to be a practical, hands-on guide to using various open source tools to make your systems more secure.  It's also targeted for system administrators who don't have security administration as their primary responsibility.  Therefore, hard-core security techies might not get much new information in this book.  But for those of us who are less versed in full-time security will gain quite a bit.  I also appreciate how the author didn't just stick with Linux/UNIX tools.  Granted, that's where most of the open source software is developed, but Windows networks are some of the most insecure systems running.  Using some of these free tools will help you to cut down on the number of potential holes in the network.<br /><br />I like how the author has covered the full gamut of security situations.  You get information that helps you to lock down the entry points (firewalls) and packages that can help you test that configuration (port and vulnerability scanners).  Combining a number of these tools should allow you to make a high-quality assessment of your network security and improve your chances of surviving a network attack.	2004-09-28

Over the last couple of months, I've been reading a book titled IT Ethics Handbook by Stephen Northcutt (Syngress).  I'd like to say I spent all that time examining ethical issues, when in reality it was just a hard book to finish...<br /><br />Chapter list:  System Administration and Operations; Audit; Vulnerability Disclosure; Digital Postmaster; E-mail Scams; Information Security Officers; Programmers and System Analysts; Database Administration; Information Service Providers; Brother's Keeper; End-user and Employee Computer Security; Customer Ethics; Trusted Assistant; Ethics and Contractors/Consultants; Telecommuting and Mobile Computer Security; Personal Computer Users; Penetration Testing; Content Providing; Privacy; Management/Employer Ethics; Conclusion<br /><br />Each chapter is made up of a brief discussion of ethical matters in that particular area, followed by vignettes where you have to figure out what you'd do.  The author gives a \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" answer to the dilemma, followed by a summary of what they consider the right answer to be.  While there's some benefit to be gained from thinking through some of the scenarios, the content is just far too uneven and in some cases irrelevant.  It took me a number of attempts to find where the author explains what is meant by the conservative and liberal \\"answers\\".  They are so extreme as to be comical in some cases.  Apparently the author uses them as \\"guardrails\\" to set the boundaries of the issue.  Even then, the author's answer is often too liberal for my tastes or just wishy-washy.  In one scenario, the question is asked if IP spoofing is acceptable if it causes no damage (since it's a way for super hackers to show off).  The author feels that at best it helps shore up security, and at worst it eats up resources and causes destruction.  So what?  Is it right or wrong?<br /><br />In the Personal Computer Users area, the first scenario is being unable to stop playing FreeCell when your husband asks you to come to bed and not play past midnight.  For the life of me, I don't see how this has anything to do with IT ethics.  The whole Trusted Assistant chapter has nothing to do with IT.  It's basically about what an administrative assistant should or should not be able to do.  Fine for general business, out of place for IT ethics.  And as a final nit, the chapter on Information Service Providers has the term misspelled at the top of each page (\\"Information Sercive Providers\\").<br /><br />While it's possible to get some value from this book, I feel it could have been much better.band asks you to come to bed and not play past midnight.

The latest in the Syngress line of techno/hacking novels is The Mezonic Agenda - Hacking The Presidency by Dr. Herbert H. Thompson and Spyros Nomikos. While not on par with the writings of a Tom Clancy, it's worth reading for its relevancy to current events...<br /><br />Chad Davis is a computer researcher who is due to testify before Congress on an electronic voting system that he has been studying for security issues.  He can't seem to find any issues until a cracker gives him an encrypted diskette of information damaging to the new system.  But before Davis can get the story from the guy, he's murdered.  Davis has to figure out how to crack the CD in order to learn what the hacker had discovered.  Meanwhile, a powerful group of people are pushing for the usage of this system so that they can control the outcome of the election and dish out their own form of retribution for September 11th.  This group will stop at nothing to accomplish their goals, and Davis' life is worth nothing if he doesn't play along.<br /><br />This novel actually explains how software can be cracked, with decent explanations on buffer overflows and encryption.  In fact, the book comes with a CD that you can use to practice your skills after reading the book.  The person who can crack the CD can win a trip to a security conference in 2005.  Pretty good practical application there!  After the core story, there are appendices that explain the history of voting, encryption, buffer overflows, and stenography.  I actually learned quite a bit about the history of voting from this information.  And given the Florida fiasco of the 2000 election and the controversy over the use of Diebold voting machines with no audit trail, the general concepts in this book are extremely relevant to current events.<br /><br />Is it an excellent novel?  It's so-so...  And the ending is rather abrupt for my liking.  But if you haven't given much thought to the whole e-voting controversy, this book will give you a good foundation to be concerned.a good foundation to be concerned.	2004-09-27

If you're looking for a good architectural treatment of web services in Java, you'll want to look at Designing Web Services with the J2EE 1.4 Platform - JAX-RPC, SOAP, and XML Technologies by Inderjeet Singh, Sean Brydon, Greg Murray, Vijay Ramachandran, Thierry Violleau, and Beth Stearns (Addison Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introduction; Standards and Technologies; Service Endpoint Design, XML Processing; Client Design; Enterprise Application Integration; Security; Application Architecture and Design; Glossary; Index<br /><br />As with most books put out by Sun, this is an authoritative guide.  The quality of the material is high, and you are getting it \\"straight from the source\\", as they tout their books.  While they cover the subject well, it's not the type of book that the hard-code developer geek would want.  It seems to target more of the system architect position... the person who would be responsible for designing the overall approach to a system and specifying the technologies to be used.  There is some code, but not much.  It's also not a tutorial approach, either.  But when you get done, you should have an excellent understanding of how web service architectures are designed using Java and technologies supported by Sun.	2004-09-26

If you want to take your network security monitoring to the next level, check out The Tao Of Network Security Monitoring by Richard Bejtlich.  It does a good job covering new ground.<br /><br />Chapter list:  The Security Process; What Is Network Security Monitoring?; Deployment Considerations; The Reference Intrusion Model; Full Content Data; Additional Data Analysis; Session Data; Statistical Data; Alert Data: Bro and Prelude; Alert Data: NSM Using Sguil; Best Practices; Case Studies For Managers; Analyst Training Program; Discovering DSN; Harnessing The Power Of Session Data; Packet Monkey Heaven; Tools For Attacking Network Security Monitoring; Tactics For Attacking Network Security Monitoring; The Future Of Network Security Monitoring; Protocol Header Reference; Intellectual History Of Network Security Monitoring; Protocol Anomaly Detection; Index<br /><br />A sign of a good book is when the author sets out their scope and target audience, and then doesn't stray from it.  Bejtlich doesn't try to teach the reader every last thing about every package he can include.  Rather, he defines the scope as open source monitoring tools that haven't been written about ad nauseam.  Furthermore, there's no wasted space covering installation instructions.  He figures you can read the documentation for that.  So what you get is meaty information on how to conduct network security monitoring (NSM) using the different packages that are available.<br /><br />Another nice portion of the book includes the case studies and the analyst training.  This not only entertaining reading, but it also bridges the gap between just knowing about the subject to being able to practice those skills as part of your occupation.  Very nice feature...<br /><br />An excellent addition to your network security bookshelf...	2004-09-26

The creator of the Left Behind series has a new series underway called Babylon Rising.  The second in the series is The Secret On Ararat by Tim Lahaye and Bob Phillips.  Not too bad of a story...<br /><br />Michael Murphy is a biblical archaeologist who is also a university teacher.  He's attracted the attention of a dark secret organization who wants some of the biblical artifacts he's been able to discover.  In this episode, he's putting together an expedition to find Noah's ark.  He's also trying to figure out who is against him finding it, as he's finding people dropping dead all around him.  Once the ark is found, it's then a matter of trying to stay alive to get word back out to the world that it's real.<br /><br />I'm liking this series quite a bit.  The emotions of the characters feel real, and the writing is good.  Unlike the Left Behind series, I don't know quite where this series is going.  This seems like it could be just a series of adventures that don't particularly lead up to a final event.  Still, an entertaining read with spiritual overtones.	2004-09-26

I just finished reading a very useful book...  Pragmatic Project Automation by Mike Clark (Pragmatic Bookshelf).  If you've ever wondered how to make your life easier as a Java developer, this will answer some of your questions.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Introduction; One-Step Builds; Scheduled Builds; Push-Button Releases; Installation and Deployment; Monitoring; Resources; Pragmatic Project Automation: Summary<br /><br />The basic premise here is that most development teams spend far too much time managing the compile/build/deployment process because it's a manual one.  And with manual processes comes the real possibility of errors and neglect.  You should be spending more time coding business solutions and less time baby-sitting the infrastructure.  Clark takes you through some of the freely available open source tools that can help you make the build process repeatable and automated.  By doing this on a regular, consistent basis, you'll have higher quality software and faster response times to errors because you can narrow down to a matter of hours (or even minutes) when an error was introduced into a code stream.<br /><br />Along with the \\"why\\" of doing this, you'll learn enough about the components to get you started.  Ant will help you automate the compile and build process.  cron scheduling can set up your builds to happen on a regular basis without your intervention.  CruiseControl can take cron and Ant to a higher level and also send out notifications on the results of the builds.  CVS is covered as a repository that should be where your code is stored and versioned. And NSIS is covered as a way to create an automated installation package for your most current release.  While none of these technologies are covered in an all-inclusive way, there's enough here to get you started and to whet your appetite to pursue the matter further.<br /><br />This isn't a big book...  161 pages.  But there's a lot of practical advice and wisdom packed in there.  Definitely a \\"must have\\" book if you're spending too much time as the \\"buildmaster guru\\" on your projects...finitely a \\"must have\\" book if you're spending too much time as the \\"buildmaster guru\\" on your projects...	2004-09-23

Prentice Hall sent me a review copy of C++ Without Fear by Brian Overland.  Even though I'm not quite the target audience for the book, I must say I really like it.<br /><br />Chapter list:  Your First C++ Programs; Decisions, Decisions; The Handy, All-Purpose \\"for\\" Statement; Functions: Many Are Called; Arrays: We've Got Their Number; Pointers: Getting a Handle on Data; Strings: Analyzing the Text; Files: Electronic Storage; Some Advanced Programming Techniques; Getting Yourself Object Oriented; The Fraction Class; Constructors: If You Built It...; Operator Functions: Doing It with Class; What's \\"new\\": The StringParser Class; What's \\"this\\": The String Class; Inheritance: What a Legacy; Polymorphism: Object Independence; C++ Operators; Intrinsic Data Types; C++ Syntax Summary; ASCII Codes; Common Library Functions; Glossary of Terms; Index<br /><br />The basic premise of this book is that if you're comfortable with a computer and can run programs like a word processor, you can learn C++ using this book.  I'm not sure I'd recommend C++ to anyone as their first programming language.  Still, you can figure that this book isn't going to try and cover every little esoteric point of the language.  It covers the basic techniques and structure of C++, with copious examples and explanations.  Each chapter has a number of example programs you can type in and run.  After each example is a section called \\"How It Works\\" that takes an in-depth look at what is happening in the program.  There are then exercises that allow you to take the basic program and concepts and expand your expertise.  A few of the examples even have an optimization section where you learn how to modify the program to make it more efficient.  And if you're thinking you have to buy a C++ compiler in order to run your programs, think again.  The book comes with the GNU C++ freeware compiler, so you don't need anything beyond this book to get started.<br /><br />Even though I have more experience in programming than the author assumes, I'm still not at all familiar with C++.  Looking through this book, it has the type of style that I look for when I'm trying to learn a new skill.  Approachable writing and explanations that don't assume I have a computer science degree and dream in code...<br /><br />I like what the author and Prentice Hall have done with this title.  If I ever free up the time to learn C++, this will be the book I'll pull off the shelf to get started.ogramming than the author assumes, I'm still not at all familiar with C++.

I recently got a chance to review Wiley's book Mastering JavaServer Faces by Bill Dudney, Jonathan Lehr, Bill Willis, and LeRoy Mattingly.  Overall, this is a nice book if you're looking to get involved in JSF technology.<br /><br />Chapter list:  JSF Patterns and Architecture; Elements of JSF; JSF Request-Processing Life Cycle; JSF Configuration; JSP Integration in JSF; UI Components; Navigation, Actions, and Listeners; Validation and Conversion; Building JSF Applications; Custom JSF Components; Converting a Struts Application to JSF; What's on the Web Site; References; Index<br /><br />This is primarily a learning tool for JSF with a fair amount of reference material thrown in.  In chapters 4 through 8, you'll touch on each main area of JSF coding, and the authors provide a solid mix of learning and reference lists for your on-going use as you continue down the JSF path.  They don't skimp on code listings, so you'll have some decent examples to draw upon as you start to build your own applications.  They also use a variety of UML diagrams to show the flow of a JSF program and how the class structure is laid out.  This is good in that you'll run into this type of notation in quite a few places, so you'll get a good understanding of it here.<br /><br />The other thing I liked about this book was the \\"why\\" portion in the patterns and architecture section.  Too often, a book that is teaching you a new technology will not cover a lot of best practices and patterns on how programs should be built using the new tool.  By providing this type of information up front, the reader should be able to get into the right mindset and develop solid coding practices and concepts from the start.<br /><br />Bottom line...  a solid book with good information, and you should be happy with the result.	2004-09-22

I finally made it through the hold list at the library for Sue Grafton's latest - R is for Ricochet.  This is a nice rebound from the disappointment of her last novel.<br /><br />Kinsey Millhone is hired for what appears to be a babysitting job:  pick up a woman being released from a California prison and make sure she gets settled in and adjusted.  But of course, nothing is ever quite that simple.  The lady, Reba Lafferty, did 22 months for embezzlement from the company she worked for.  She was in love with the owner, and still holds a flame for him.  But she quickly finds out that her best friend who took over her job while she was in prison is also sleeping with the boss, and it also appears that the entire company is set up to launder drug money.  The feds want her to spill her guts, and they want Kinsey to talk her into it.  But things go wrong, Reba disappears in violation of her parole terms, and Kinsey has to find her before she gets killed.  In terms of subplots, Kinsey is getting romantically involved with the lead cop on the case.  Also, her landlord's brothers (in their 80's) are messing up Henry's chance to get some female companionship...<br /><br />In her last book, Grafton tried to weave a story around a true-life cold case.  It just didn't work.  It was the only one of Grafton's novels I really didn't like.  This latest installment in the alphabet returns to her former roots of good plot, funny writing, and varying levels of success at romance.  I had a fun time reading through this one, and I'm looking forward to \\"S\\".	2004-09-21

Every so often, either by accident or on purpose, I read something that is way outside of my normal patterns.  It could be that I want to try something different, or it may be that I misjudged a book.  Chasin' It by Tony Lindsay is one of those \\"far left field\\" books for me...<br /><br />In this case, it was a misjudgement that caused me to read it.  I received an email from the author pointing out the book (I'm assuming he got my name as an active Amazon reviewer).  It looked mildly interesting, so I checked it out from the library.  Looking at the back cover, it sounded OK...  Terri Parish is an ex-Vegas headliner who has ended up on the streets.  She still craves the attention, and is looking for a big score.  She ends up ripping off a lover and head of a Chicago street gang.  She then has to figure out how to stay alive before he finds and kills her.  Sex, drugs, crime...  typical stuff.  :-)  It's also described as an \\"urban story\\".  Hmm...<br /><br />The parental advisory on the cover for explicit content should have been a clue.  Terri Parish isn't a \\"she\\".  Parish is a he, a gay black man who crossdresses and works as a performer.  His life on the street is filled with smoking crack cocaine and turning tricks (which are often described in graphic detail).  He does a stint in prison where he's the head queen, and it's where he first meets the head of the street gang.  He's beaten badly, and the abuse continues when he's tracked down outside of prison.  The gist of the story is Parish learning how to come to terms with his gay lifestyle, the lifestyles of the men he dates, and how his grandmother and mother raised him into a life of prostitution.<br /><br />So how do you rank a book like this?  There are many conflicts here, but I want to be fair to the author.  I give it low marks for deception on the back cover.  Nowhere is there any mention that the whole basis of the story involves transgender issues.  The writing isn't bad, so that brings it up a bit.  I wasn't overly impressed with the plot line, but I'm not sure why.  Is it because the plot was pretty basic?  Was it because this is a culture and lifestyle I can't even begin to relate to?  Is it because most of the characters are African-American and either gay or bisexual (of which I'm neither)?  Dunno...<br /><br />I'll give this a three star ranking, as it's a book that will only appeal to a certain readership niche.

I have just finished one of the most riveting nonfiction books I've read in a long time...  Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson.  This is a true life diving adventure that is totally engrossing.<br /><br />Back in 1991, the owner of a dive boat charter was given the coordinates to a fishing spot 60 miles off the coast of New Jersey.  It was thought that there was some shipwreck down there, and he was going to try and figure out what vessel had gone down.  Over the next six years, John Chatterton and Richie Kohler became obsessed with discovering the identity of this wreck, which was a World War II U-boat.  The mystery was that no recorded history showed that a U-boat was sunk in that area.  It took six years of diving, worldwide research, rewriting recorded naval history, and the death of three divers to finally identify the vessel and figure out why it wasn't off the coast of Gibraltar where it was listed as sunk.<br /><br />If you've ever read Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, the book about the climbers who died on Mt. Everett, you'll see a strong resemblance to that style.  You learn about the personalities of the men who are driven to risk their life every time they dive on a wreck.  And this isn't recreational diving, either.  They go down 200+ feet, where you have approximately 25 minutes of time on the bottom before ascending and decompressing over the next 90 - 120 minutes.  One wrong move and you are literally a dead man.  As the story progresses, you start to understand the need to identify the ship so as to give the crew who died a final voice, a need to find the answers yet not to disturb the final resting place of the many who died when the ship sank.<br /><br />An absolutely incredible story that is well-written.  A must read.	2004-09-16

As a web developer, you'll most likely own a few reference books for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other related technologies.  Surprisingly, you can get most of what you need in a single volume - The Web Programmer's Desk Reference by Lazaro Issi Cohen and Joseph Issi Cohen (No Starch Press).<br /><br />Chapter list - Cascading Style Sheets; Object-Oriented Programming: The DOM and the Node Tree; Events and Event Handlers; JavaScript Core Language and Fundamentals; HTML Elements; HTML Attributes; Event Handlers; CSS Attributes and JavaScript Style Properties; Microsoft Internet Explorer Behaviors; Microsoft Filters and Transitions; JavaScript Properties; JavaScript Methods; JavaScript Collections; JavaScript Objects; HTML+TIME Microsoft Technologies; Index of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Listings<br /><br />I'll admit to not being a fan of single volume reference guides to multiple technologies.  In nearly all cases, the authors try to do too many things and be everything for everyone.  As a result, the book ends up being useless.  This one feels different, however.  The first 60-some-odd pages do a quick coverage of the overall technology, like CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM model.  In all likelihood, you probably won't use this part of the book.  It's not enough for a beginner, and it's too basic for an experienced developer.  But the book shines when it comes to the reference section.<br /><br />Each entry in the reference portion lists the tag or keyword, which browser versions support the option, the syntax of the option, code examples, and what other options or tags the original tag refers to.  Because there is so much information included (1000+ pages), it will take you a little while to get comfortable with the page layout.  But once you get that under your belt, this book could become very valuable to you.<br /><br />While I'm not ready to ditch my stand-alone reference books on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, this book might have caused me to think twice before buying them.  A good job...e buying them.  A good job...	2004-09-14

I enjoy the opportunity to bury myself in a Florida genre novel with a wacky plot.  Hiaasen's latest, Skinny Dip, doesn't disappoint...<br /><br />Chaz Perrone is a biologist who hates the outdoors and is more interested in money and sex.  He's married to a rich wife, but he's not in line to inherit any of her money.  So why does he toss her overboard a cruise ship on their 2nd anniversary and act if he was sleeping when it happened?  It takes a little while to have that reason work its way out.  Meanwhile, his wife (who he assumes is now fish food somewhere) ends up latching on to a bale of Jamaican pot (this *is* Florida!) and is rescued by a guy who lives a pretty solitary existence as a house caretaker on a deserted island.  Rather than just call the cops and have him arrested, she decides to start messing with his mind in order to drive him off the deep end.  They sneak into his house, rearrange items, and start a blackmail scheme.  At the same time, Perrone's employer, a farmer who is polluting the Everglades, sends over a bizarre bodyguard to make sure that Perrone doesn't do anything stupid.  As the pressures mount from all sides, Perrone is cracking up and going paranoid.  The question is who will be the first to either kill him, arrest him, or feed him to the gators.<br /><br />With Hiaasen, you know you are always going to get a dose of his views on the environment and attitudes of Florida.  I think he'd be happy if 75% of the people in Florida just up and left...  especially the developers.  His characters are quirky and off-beat, and the plot is funny yet plausible if you don't get too hung up on it.  In this book, you'll understand his feelings about the destruction of the Everglades by unscrupulous farmers and such.  But I appreciate that his underlying message doesn't overload the story.<br /><br />Anyway...  I like his writing and style, and this is another great installment in his writing career.ng career.	2004-09-14

I recently finished the book High-Tech Crimes Revealed - Cyberwar Stories From The Digital Front by Steve Branigan (Addison-Wesley).  It's a pretty good book, but with a few shortcomings...<br /><br />Chapter list:  An Attack on the Telephone Network; An Attack on an ISP; If He Had Just Paid the Rent; Inside a Hacker Sting Operation...; Identity Theft; Let's Ask the Hackers; Why Do Hackers Hack?; Setting the Stage; High-Tech Crime; What Not to Do; How to Run a High-Tech Case; What Have We Learned; Appendix; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />There are two types of writing in this book.  Up through Inside A Hacker Sting Operation, the focus is on real-life cases that the author was part of.  You learn details about how cyber-crime is conducted, uncovered, and prosecuted.  The benefit here is that you see the warts and failings of the process instead of the glorified versions as told by security experts.  After that chapter, there is less emphasis on stories and more focus on subjects, such as why these things occur and how to conduct an investigation.  There are still references to real-life events, but that's less of an emphasis.  Branigan's writing is humorous and lightly satirical, and makes for an enjoyable read.<br /><br />The shortcoming was something I couldn't quite put my finger on until I read the preface.  Steve started this book in 1999 and thought he'd be done in early 2002.  September 11th threw him off, and he didn't get started again until nearly a year later.  So in effect, you have a book on cyber-crime published in 2004 that was largely written between 1999 and 2001.  While there are references to events in the recent past, many of the significant stories and examples are vintage 2002 or earlier.  In my opinion, it's the only significant flaw in what is otherwise an interesting read.	2004-09-11

With my reading of Sparkle Hayter's latest book, Bandit Queen Boogie, I'm now up to date on her writings.  And I must say, this one is unusual...  It's difficult to describe the plot, as there are several wacky subplots that seem unrelated but converge at the end...<br /><br />Blackie and Chloe, two friends who appeared mismatched but understood each other, decide to head off to Europe to help Chloe forget a relationship.  While over there, they find out that they have a knack for running cons that separate men on the prowl from their money.  That's the main thread.  In initially unrelated subplots, you have an Indian crime boss who's Ganesh god statue is stolen with something of value stashed inside.  There's a rebellious heiress that skips out on court-ordered rehab and is trying to meet up with her boyfriend so they can run off together.  A reporter who's apparently on the edge is over in Europe on a company-ordered \\"vacation\\" and is stripped of a story he's been working on.  And believe it or not, all these things end up meshing at the end.  The girls are thought to have killed the son-in-law of the crime boss after he stole the statue.  They are being pursued unknowingly by his hired goons.  The reporter is trying to come up with a blockbuster story, and he's going to try and uncover the story of the heiress.  The heiress is on the run but her boyfriend has apparently dumped her and taken off with her money.  Chloe is mistaken as the heiress traveling with a Canadian friend, so everyone wants to find her.  Neither of the girls know much of what is transpiring.  There's a few more subplots there, too...  But any more would give things away, and it's just too confusing to try and explain anyway...<br /><br />This is a strange novel.  If you like crazy stories going off in different directions, and situations where peoples' lives intersect with each other in unusual ways, then you'll most likely enjoy this read.  If you want a logical plot with believable story lines and rational scenarios, then this one will drive you up the wall.

Based on the recommendation of a friend, I picked up Sleepyhead by Mark Billingham from the library.  It's a real dark crime \\"who dun it\\" with twists that keep you reading to the end.<br /><br />Detective Inspector Tom Thorne gets involved with a number of murders that are seemingly random until they find a \\"failed\\" attempt.  The victim who survived is completely paralyzed due to a stroke, and Thorne figures out that she was actually the \\"success\\" of the killer.  It turns out that the killer is really trying to \\"liberate\\" women from their bodies, leaving the only thing he values...  their minds.  He deliberately induces a stroke by physical manipulation of certain blood vessels, nerves and muscles.  Thorne thinks he knows who is doing the killing, but his evidence against him keeps coming up short.  The mental games between Thorne and his suspect grow more intense until Thorne is ready to admit defeat.  But the story comes to a dramatic end with a final confrontation with a number of lives on the line.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, the story is very dark.  Not only is the subject matter intense (a killer wanting to turn his victims into vegetables, not corpses), but Thorne is a damaged individual with a lot of personal and emotional baggage.  The author is English, so there are a number of slang phrases that American readers will have to think about in order to follow the conversation.  And even though you think you know who the killer is, you just know there's going to be a twist somewhere.<br /><br />Well written, and very different....  I look forward to his future work.	2004-09-10

If you are looking for an XSLT book that is more than just a reference or tutorial manual, you might like XSLT 2.0 Web Development by Dmitry Kirsanov (Prentice Hall).<br /><br />Chapter list:  XML and the Web; The source definition; Elements of a web site; An overview of XSLT; The XSLT stylesheet; XML software; XML on the server; Bibliography; Index<br /><br />Don't let the short list of chapters scare you off.  Each chapter is broken up into multiple \\"mini-chapters\\" that cover the subject matter quite well.  Having said that, I think that it's important to know exactly what you're getting here.  This is not a 1000 page tutorial and reference guide to all that is XML and XSLT.  In fact, if this is your first exposure to XSLT technology, you might actually find yourself a bit frustrated.  This is not so much of a \\"how to\\" as it is a \\"why to\\"...<br /><br />The author spends a lot of time explaining XML design and schemas, and how an accurate schema can make the difference between a good and bad application.  Once the proper schema is established, then he covers how XSLT can make the XML transform into a clear and well-structured site.  Really good stuff, but you probably won't learn all there is to know about XSLT by reading this book.  I actually see this as a good \\"second\\" XSLT title for a developer once they have mastered the language and syntax fundamentals.<br /><br />If you're looking to learn XSLT, you may want to choose a different title.  If you're looking to learn how to effectively utilize XSLT and XML on your web site, this is a very good option.	2004-09-09

The great thing is that you get the command and a list of the useful options, along with the syntax in less than half a page (and the book is small!).  So instead of hauling down the large volume and scrolling through multiple pages, you can get right to the command you need with the options you're probably looking for.<br /><br />For a beginner like me, it will help to make me more comfortable with many of the basics of command line work.  For experts, it will be the quick reference for that particular option that you can't remember the capitalization rules for...<br /><br />Short, concise, easy to understand, and packed with meat...  What more could you want in a reference manual?  This is a keeper.	2004-09-08

If you're looking to get an in-depth understanding of open source licensing and all the issues surrounding it, you should read Open Source Licensing by Lawrence Rosen (Prentice Hall).<br /><br />Chapter list:  Freedom and Open Source; Intellectual Property; Distribution of Software; Taxonomy of Licenses; Academic Licenses; Reciprocity and the GPL; The Mozilla Public License (MPL); The Common Public License (CPL); The OSL and the AFL; Choosing an Open Source License; Shared Source, Eventual Source, and Other Licensing Models; Open Source Litigation; Open Standards; The Open Source Paradigm; Appendices; Index<br /><br />On the positive side, this book will teach you more about licensing than you thought existed.  This book deals with all the legal issues that either have arisen or could become a problem as open source continues to make inroads against commercial software.  The analysis is detailed as only a lawyer can do it.  Another positive aspect of the book is that the author covers how different open source licenses mesh with each other.  You may be forced into choosing a certain type of license if you've incorporated software that already uses a license that you're expected to apply to your software.  All good stuff.<br /><br />On the negative side, I don't think the book delivers on its promise to present \\"a plain-English guide to open source law for developers, managers, users, and lawyers\\".  I see this as a book by a lawyer for lawyers needing to understand software licensing and how open source licensing fits into that.  Companies that are building a business model around open source will need this material, but the typical developer and nearly all users will be bored to death as individual words are pulled out and dissected as for potential legal interpretations that could be applied.<br /><br />I'm inclined to rank this a little higher than I'd like just because there's not a lot of material about this subject, and the author *does* cover it in great detail.  But if you think you're going to get an easy-to-digest explanation of open source licensing, you will probably be disappointed.great detail.

Normally when I read a Hacks book, I'm already familiar with the core technology and I'm looking for little tricks.  In this case, PDF Hacks by Sid Steward showed me far more about PDF technology than I knew existed.<br /><br />Chapter List:  Consuming PDF, Managing a Collection; Authoring and Self-Publishing: Hacking Outside the PDF; Creating PDF and Other Editions; Manipulating PDF Files; Dynamic PDF; Scripting and Programming Acrobat; Index<br /><br />I'm probably like many others when it comes to PDF files.  I read them with Adobe Reader, and that's about it.  I don't use Adobe Acrobat, so my main experience in creating PDF files is to print to PDF using the software from [...]  I didn't have a clue there was a much to PDF files as there is.  I learned how to speed up the processing of starting Adobe Reader by removing unnecessary plugins (Hack #4).  I learned how to use some open source software to manipulate PDF files nearly on par with running the full Acrobat program.  I found you can even program games using the PDF scripting language!

Apress was kind enough to send me a review copy of Joel On Software by Joel Spolsky.  Spolsky is the creator of the website [...] where he waxes eloquent on issues related to software and software development.  As the head of his own company, Fog Creek Software, he brings both a technical and a business perspective to many of his essays.<br /><br />This is the latest in a trend of books based on a compilation of a person's blog writing.  In Joel On Software, a selection of important and insightful entries over the last four years are gathered and presented in a single volume.  In some ways, it's a selective \\"best of...\\" book that distills down the writings that the author feels are still worth examining.  This could be due to truths that haven't changed or to show how much things *have* changed since the original entry.  You could say why read the book, as you can get it all on the web site.  True, but you don't get the opportunity to have the writer add any clarification based on hindsight.<br /><br />Joel will make you think about issues you've likely ignored, and he'll also teach you a few things in the process.  For instance, you may think you know everything about Unicode, but count on some new stuff in the essay \\"The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)\\".  And if you want to understand the two methods of growing your business, read \\"Ben & Jerry's vs. Amazon\\".  Really good stuff to ponder...<br /><br />This book will challenge, encourage, upset, and entertain you.  Spolsky knows his stuff, and he's got the war wounds to prove it.  This book is worth the price of admission...	2004-09-03

If I had written this review right after I finished the book, it would have been average at best.  But it's grown on me a bit over the last two days...<br /><br />Lt. Paul Wollf is a firefighter in Seattle, and he can best be described as an excellent firefighter with anger and impulse management control issues.  His father was also a firefighter and died in a fire that was set by a serial arsonist.  The arsonist appears to be back after a 25 year absence, and Wollf is trying to figure out whether its the same guy who killed his father and now seems to want him dead.  After his father died when he was young, his mom went to pieces, living with a number of lowlifes.  One killed his mom, and his brother and him killed the killer.  Due to bad representation, his brother ended up serving time for that murder, and that led to his anger issues.  The two story lines blend together at the end when the arsonist and Wollf come face to face and he learns some truths he didn't realize.<br /><br />The novel seems rather dark, and Wolff's fellow firefighters (especially his bosses) are all pretty dysfunctional.  Some of the leadership behavior is so bad, I kept thinking 1) why?, and 2) this wouldn't be allowed to continue.  As the book progresses, you start to understand some of the tension and interplay between Wollf and the bosses that causes all the conflict.  I guess I didn't think much of it to start as I was expecting more action.  But when I thought back on the characters and the interplay between them, I realized the book was a bit deeper than I originally gave it credit for.	2004-09-03

I finished up Jeffery Deaver's latest last night...  Garden Of Beasts.  While I didn't like it as much as his Lincoln Rhyme series, it was still not bad.<br /><br />The story is set in Berlin 1936, right before the Olympics.  Hitler has a member of his cabinet, Reinhard Ernst, who is planning the secret rearmament of Germany.  A small group of influential Americans want him stopped, so they offer Paul Schumann, a German-American hit man with a conscience, a chance to avoid prison and get a new start.  He's sent over on the ship with the rest of the Olympians, posing as a reporter.  He starts his mission, but quickly ends up with a dead person on his hands and the German police trying to find him.  The German government also has a hint that something is up, so the protection on Ernst is even heavier than normal.  Schumann has to sort out his feelings for his country, figure out who to trust, and still \\"correct God's mistake\\".  Some sneaky twists show up at the end, and it changes the whole direction of what's going on.<br /><br />I'm normally not one much for \\"historical\\" novels, but I usually like Deaver's work.  This one seemed pretty authentic, and showed a Germany slowly moving down the road of Jewish persecution and murder.  The story seemed to lag a bit at times, but the detail and attention to plot kept it going.  The character development was really well done, as you really felt for the different people, regardless of whether they were good or bad guys.  While not a \\"must read\\", it's still entertaining if you're looking for something in the crime/espionage genre.	2004-08-31

I'm secure enough in technology to admit that I enjoy Dummies titles.  The latest Dummies title I had the pleasure of reading and reviewing is iPAQ for Dummies by Brian Underdahl.  This is a nice book if you are looking for an enjoyable read that will walk you through all the features of your new mobile device.<br /><br />Chapter breakout:  Getting to Know the iPAQ; Choosing Your iPAQ; Understanding the iPAQ Basics; Entering Information into Your iPAQ; Keeping It in Sync; Keeping Your Address Book; Taking Some Notes; Keeping Your Mobile Calendar; Working With Pocket Word; Managing Your Calculations; Tracking Your Money; Connecting Your iPAQ; Surfing The Internet; Keeping Track of Your Email; Using Your iPAQ for Music; More Multimedia; Playing Around with Your iPAQ; Finding iPAQ Applications; Traveling with Your iPAQ; Ten Great iPAQ Accessories; Ten Great iPAQ Business Programs; Ten Great Ways To Have Fun with Your iPAQ; Ten Great iPAQ Utilities; Index<br /><br />When I got my iPAQ a couple of weeks ago, I was looking for a title that was more oriented towards a user of the device (as opposed to a title that showed you how to hack the device).  Underdahl delivers well on that need.  He covers both the hardware of the iPAQ (and all the different models) as well as each of the software packages that comes as part of the standard iPAQ configuration.  In addition to explaining the base software, he also recommends additional software and/or hardware that either adds functionality that isn't there or is better than what the iPAQ ships with.  And of course, all this is done in the lighter, humorous fashion that you normally find in a Dummies book.<br /><br />My favorite section was the portions on using the Internet with the Wi-Fi connectivity.  I downloaded an additional package based on his recommendation, and now I'm set to easily find and surf hotspots when I'm away from the house.  I also tried an alternative web browser, but I'm not yet sure if I like it or not.

Following up on Blunden's Cube Farm, I read his book Offshoring IT: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (Apress).  I was expecting a cynical rant with more emotion than logic.  What I got instead was a book that was anti-offshoring, but that presented both sides of the issue very well (in my opinion).<br /><br />Chapter breakout:  Setting The Stage; Measuring The Trend; The Offshoring Obstacle Course; Arguments In Favor Of Offshoring; Arguments Against Offshoring; Index<br /><br />Blunden's been around the IT world for awhile, and he's seen the effect of offshoring in the Silicon Valley area.  So this isn't an academic exercise in business economics conducted in an ivory tower.  He did his homework, as the book has extensive footnotes so that the reader can verify the numbers and statements.  In fact, he urges the reader to get involved and question things.  Rather than taking the conventional wisdom and oft-quoted reports and statistics, he digs underneath the conspiracy of corporate silence when it comes to the issue of shipping jobs offshore for cheaper labor.  The chapter on the Offshoring Obstacle Course is a well-written roadmap of what an organization should do if they are planning on going that route.  The chapter on arguments in favor of offshoring present all the well-worn platitudes about how this will benefit America in the long run and move our workers to more \\"fulfilling work\\" instead of the menial jobs nobody wants.  He does warn you however...  Those two chapters are not his voice, but the voice of balance required by the publisher.  In the final chapter, he cuts loose and exposes the arguments for what they are...  A simple exercise in making the rich richer and the working class poorer.  He ends by urging workers to get involved and not take this all lying down.<br /><br />While I think some measure of offshoring is inevitable, I think the trend of knowledge jobs heading overseas is a dangerous one.  The United States is setting themselves up for long-term pain when we don't have the skills to lead the world's economy any more.  It doesn't matter how much a multinational company saves with cheap labor if the US job market is made up of low wage jobs that can't buy anything but the essentials.<br /><br />There are a few times when he paints foreign workers as bogeymen while ignoring the fact that the same things happen here (intellectual theft occurs in the US, too).  Still, by and large, a good book to read and think about...for long-term pain when we don't have the skills to lead the world's economy any more.

It's a quirky little book about a person's foray from college into a corporate environment of a major Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software vendor.<br /><br />Blunden went to Cornell and got a degree in physics.  But in Cleveland, that and a couple of bucks will get you coffee at Starbucks.  It might even get you a job at Starbucks.  After a stint in food service, he got another degree in Management Science and ended up eventually securing a job in IT working for Lawson Software in Minnesota.  In his time there, he was part of a grossly dysfunctional company that had most of their software projects die before seeing a shipment to market.  The people, given code names in the book to \\"protect the guilty\\", are a rogue's gallery of misfits and psychopaths who will make you hope you never have a boss or coworkers like that.  The story ends when he decides to leave because he doesn't like what he's becoming.<br /><br />The book is touted as \\"a reality check for anyone preparing to enter the work force, and a survival guide for those entangled in their own personal version of Office Space.\\"  While I have no doubt these work environments exist, I've never seen all these personality types in a single place in my over 25 years of IT.  For a first IT job, this guy had a horrible experience.  His \\"lessons\\" at the end of each chapter are short one liners about corporate life, but they are largely based on an extremely cynical view of corporate life.  If I had his experience at Lawson, I'd probably feel the same.  But I'm not sure I'd buy this book as anything more than one person's hard luck story of life in IT as well as an entertaining read by a talented writer.  Using it as a guide to surviving in the office place might cause you problems if you work in a more normal company...	2004-08-27

I've often said that I like the O'Reilly \\"cookbook\\" format for getting ideas and solving issues I didn't know I had.  CSS Cookbook (2nd edition) by Christopher Schmitt is another one of those books that will earn space on my shelf at work...<br /><br />Contents: General; Web Typography; Images; Page Elements; Lists; Links and Navigation; Forms; Tables; Page Layouts; Print; Hacks, Workarounds, and Troubleshooting; Designing with CSS; Resources; CSS 2.1 Properties and Proprietary Extensions; CSS 2.1 Selectors, Pseudo-Classes, and Pseudo-Elements; Styling of Form Elements; Index<br /><br />The \\"cookbook\\" formula has a number of recipes on how to do certain things with CSS.  It starts with a problem statement, a brief and concise solution, and then a discussion about how it works and factors that come into play.  Some of the recipes are really basic, like setting the size of type on a page.  In a case like that, the answer is simply font-size with a discussion of how that works.  In other cases, the recipe is much more advanced, such as applying specific CSS properties to the IE 5.x browser to handle it's quirky box model implementation.  That one is much longer, as there's more to it than just reading the specs or a basic tutorial...<br /><br />My only disappointment here is that some of the included items are *really* basic.  For instance, the General chapter seems to be a basic CSS guide formatted as a series of recipes.  A recipe of using comments in your CSS file, while a legitimate question, is one that I'd expect someone to know if they are picking up a book like this.  I would have preferred see that space be used for less tutorial-like information and more \\"meat\\".  Still, having said that, it's still a book that I'd feel comfortable with having around...<br /><br />Once you're past the \\"what is CSS\\" phase, this is a good book to spend time with.  It will either answer the \\"how do I do that\\" questions or spur the \\"I hadn't thought of doing that\\" moments.....	2004-08-26

I finished reading Cyber Adversary Characterization - Auditing The Hacker Mind by Tom Parker, Eric Shaw, Ed Stroz, Matthew G. Devost, and Marcus H. Sachs.  This is a very different book than anything I've seen, read, or reviewed...<br /><br />Chapter breakout:  Introduction; Theoretical Characterization Metrics; Disclosure and the Cyber Food Chain; Rating the Attack: Post-Incident Characterization Metrics; Asset Threat Characterization; Bringing It All Together: Completing the Cyber Adversary Model; WarmTouch: Assessing the Insider Threat and Relationship Management; Managing the Insider Threat; The Cyber Adversary in Groups: Targeting Nations' Critical Infrastructures; Characterizing the Extremes - Terrorists and Nation States; Return on Investment; Final Words; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Most books that concern themselves with the \\"hacker mindset\\" do so with personality characterizations and attack methods.  When you get done, you may understand how attacks occur, but you're no further along in doing a critical risk assessment of your particular environment.  This book is the first I've seen that attempts to analyze the components mathematically in order to allow you to weight different scenarios against each other.  The authors do a decent job in taking individual characteristics of the attacker, the environment, and the target, explaining how each component affects an attack scenario, and then giving a formula that can be used to assign a numeric value.  While you may not agree with the interpretation, it's a rigorous approach to something that can be hard to quantify.<br /><br />I haven't decided whether I approve of the WarmTouch chapter.  It's a software package developed by the authors that attempts to chart threat assessment from a person based on email wording, actions, and other observed behavior.  The idea is interesting, but I normally have issues with a book like this being used to push an author's product.  I'll just say buyer beware in this case...<br /><br />Bottom line...  this would be a useful read for someone in security consulting and auditing, and would help an organization take a methodical view of their environment for risk assessment.  There's not much on the book market like this volume.case...  <br /> <br />Bottom line...  this would be a useful read for someone in security consulting and auditing, and would help an organization take a methodical view of their environment for risk assessment.

Have you ever wondered what it is project managers do while you're off cranking out code and fixing bugs?  If so, you can get a really thorough coverage of the art and science of project management in the book IT Project Management - On Track from Start to Finish (2nd edition) by Joseph Phillips (McGraw-Hill/Osborne).<br /><br />Chapter breakout:  Initiating the Project; Planning the Project; Working with Management; Creating the Budget; Creating a Work Breakdown Structure; Organizing a Project Team; Building the Project Plan; Implementing the Project Plan; Revising the Project Plan; Enforcing Quality; Managing Teams; Completing the Project; IT Project+ Exam Objectives; Critical Exam Information; Working as an Independent Contractor; About the CD; Glossary; Index<br /><br />This book actually serves a couple of purposes.  For the beginning or intermediate project manager, this book serves as a guide to the entire project planning process.  I know if I were placed in the role of a project planner (of which I have little experience), I would need a book exactly like this to guide me through the process.  The other function of the book is to help the person who is planning for the IT Project+ certification exam.  While I have no desire to go after that certification, I think I'd place this book on my study list if I were pursuing it.<br /><br />Along with the solid content in each chapter, there are some features at the end that are interesting.  One is a feature called \\"From The Field\\", which is an interview with a real project manager answering questions related to the content covered in that chapter.  That's a nice move to add some practicality to the material.  There is also a chapter quiz and exercises at the end so you can bridge the gap from theoretical to practical.<br /><br />Overall, a good treatment of the subject matter, and worth getting if this is an interest of yours.	2004-08-22

O'Reilly has delivered another excellent title in the Hacks series.  This time it's XML Hacks by Michael Fitzgerald.  While not as \\"fun\\" as, say, the Digital Photography Hacks book, it's just as useful if working with XML is something you do as part of your IT job.<br /><br />Chapter breakout:  Looking At XML Documents; Creating XML Documents; Transforming XML Documents; XML Vocabularies; Defining XML Vocabularies with Schema Language; RSS and Atom; Advanced XML Hacks<br /><br />For those not familiar with the Hacks series, each book contains 100 tips, techniques, and plain cool things you can do with the technology.  Some will be things you already know, some will be things you aren't quite ready for yet, and others will be ones that you just can't wait to try out as they solve a problem you've been living with for far too long.<br /><br />There were two areas I liked in this book.  The Creating and Transforming chapters introduce a number of software packages, both commercial and free, that can help you manage the process of working with your XML files in something more elegant than Notepad.  The RSS and Atom chapter is also cool as I use RSS in my blog feed, and this will help me understand and enhance that feed.<br /><br />I've yet to find a bad Hacks title, and this is no exception.

Since I recently got an HP iPaq, I decided it was about time to dig in and see what sort of software was available for this new toy.  Part of that search led me to the book 101 Killer Apps For Your Pocket PC by Rick Broida and Dave Johnson (McGraw-Hill/Osborne).  While you could probably find these software titles on your own by using the internet, this book is an entertaining way to get a nice overview of the wide range of software you should think about adding to your Pocket PC.<br /><br />The book covers, you guessed it, 101 applications in the following chapters:  On The Job; Bon Voyage!; Gone Fishin'; Fun and Games; A Handier Pocket PC; Learn Something; Connected Tricks; A Penny Saved; And Finally, Our Favorites<br /><br />The two authors have a unique writing style where they freely take digs at each other while describing how the other uses their Pocket PC device.  This makes for at the minimum an entertaining read.  But beyond that, they are free with their advice on the strengths and deficiencies of the applications that come pre-installed on most Pocket PC devices, and how there are inexpensive alternatives that are much more feature-rich and robust for the serious user.  The book also comes with a CD that contains nearly all the software mentioned in the book.  In most all cases, these are trial versions that have some time or feature limitation that will go away once you purchase the software.  While you can head out to the 'net and find the latest version, the CD makes it a bit quicker.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more emphasis on freeware programs, as most of the programs need to be purchased.  Even so, the costs are very reasonable, so using the trial versions is a great way to see if you want to spend the money to get the full version.  Couple this book with your own research on Google or your favorite search engine, and you should be set.	2004-08-22

I haven't read a lot of Michael Connelly's stuff, so I wasn't sure what to expect from his latest Harry Bosch novel, The Narrows.  After reading the book, I think I may be going back to catch up on his earlier work.  This was a good novel.<br /><br />Bosch is asked to investigate the death of his ex-partner by the widow.  The partner had a heart transplant, and he ended up dying of heart failure while running a fishing charter in open waters.  The widow finds that his medication had been switched, and that's why his heart gave out.  Bosch's investigation dovetails into an FBI investigation into a serial killer known as the Poet.  The Poet was an FBI guru who was actually killing the people on the case he was leading.  Agent Rachael Walling, his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, thought that she killed him in an earlier showdown.  But he apparently survived, is killing again, and has called her specifically into the final stages of the investigation.  Walling and Bosch, both \\"outcasts\\" from the FBI's viewpoint, end up teaming to find the Poet, figure out his next move, and confront him.<br /><br />This is a nice mystery with a touch of darkness to it.  There are a number of subthreads going on that would have probably made more sense had I read earlier novels in the series.  While that might have made the novel a bit better for me, it didn't get in the way of enjoying the book on its own merits.  As I mentioned above, I will probably end up putting Connelly on my \\"catch-up\\" list.	2004-08-22

This is a small, easy to read and understand book on getting the most out of your digital camera.<br /><br />The chapters:  Before You Shoot: Buying Guide; Digital Camera Basics; Photographing People; Capturing Motion; Indoor Places; Outdoor Places; After You Shoot; Digital Camera Troubleshooting; Index<br /><br />For what this book is and for the intended audience, it's pretty good.  The book starts out by explaining how a digital camera works and what the basic features are that you'll want to have.  From there, it covers a number of shooting situations you'll experience in the real world, and what camera features you can use to best handle the scene.  For instance, trying to shoot good sporting pictures is difficult.  The latency between when you click the shutter and when the picture records means that you'll most likely end up getting the split second AFTER the perfect shot.  Not good.  But the authors show you how to anticipate the action to compensate for latency.  The other option is to set for continuous shooting so that a single click will produce a series of shots that will bracket the moment and increase your chances of the perfect picture.<br /><br />The serious photographer will already know most of this information, so they probably won't get much value out of the book.  But if you're a novice and aspire to understand your camera and the art of photography better, this is a good starting point.	2004-08-22

Since I liked Just A Geek so much, I decided to read and review Dancing Barefoot (O'Reilly).  It's a book of stories about Wil Wheaton's life as a person trying to place his former life as a teen actor on the Star Trek: The Next Generation in perspective.  These are the stories that didn't make it into Just A Geek, but that Wil thought were still important.<br /><br />Although I liked the book and his writing style, I think Just A Geek is much better.  JAG tells more of a story, and you get to understand the feelings behind what it's like to be treated as a TV character instead of as an actual person.  DB is more along the lines of isolated vignettes that are fun to read but don't really take you anywhere much.  It's real short (like 115 pages), so it's not like there's a huge time commitment.  My recommendation would be to get the books together, cruise through this one quickly to get a flavor of his writing style, and then dig into JAG.  You'll probably like this book better if you do it in that order...	2004-08-20

I'm now all caught up on the Tim Cockey series involving Hitchcock Sewell.  I missed Murder In The Hearse Degree when it first came out, so now was the time to round out the reading.  And as always, Cockey creates a fun read with great dialogue...<br /><br />In this version, an old flame of Sewell's who is now married with children is fearful that her nanny has gone missing.  The girl turns up dead at the base of a bridge.  The police seem to want to quickly write it off as a suicide, but Sewell isn't so sure.  After a little investigation, he finds out that the nanny was pregnant, and no one is quite sure who the father is.  And if they figure that out, they may know who the killer is.  There's a tie with a right-wing religious group that isn't all it's cracked up to be, and Sewell is getting on their nerves with the continued snooping.  The goal is to find the killer without becoming a victim.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I wasn't as \\"in to\\" this one as others I've read.  This should have been a two day read at most, but I ended up reading a number of other books interspersed with this one.  So was the lack of focus just me, or was the story not quite as gripping as normal?  I'm really not sure.  If you're a fan of the Hitchcock Sewell series, you'll like this one.  If you're new to the series, maybe you should save this one and read it in order.	2004-08-19

We, The Media by Dan Gillmor (O'Reilly) is probably the best and most important book I've read in the last couple of years.  It's a must read for serious bloggers and journalists, both \\"professional\\" and \\"citizen\\".<br /><br />Chapter breakout:  From Tom Paine to Blogs and Beyond; The Read-Write Web; The Gates Come Down; Newsmakers Turn the Tables; The Consent of the Governed; Professional Journalists Join the Conversation; The Former Audience Joins the Party; Next Steps; Trolls, Spin, and the Boundaries of Trust; Here Come the Judges (and Lawyers); The Empire Strikes Back; Making Our Own News<br /><br />So why is this book important?  Because the balance of media power has shifted, and it's no longer in the hands of a few publishers who can make or break public perception.  Via the power of the internet and the new tools such as blogs and wikis, anyone with a point of view and an interest becomes a reporter and has a voice.  Those who are consumers of news no longer are restricted to controlled media outlets.  With the use of RSS, you can \\"roll your own news\\" and assemble a collection of media feeds and outlets to get a more balanced view of events.  During the Iraq war, people followed the blog of Where's Raed? to get a view of real life in the country as opposed to what we were permitted to see on mainstream news.  Gilmore does an incredible job of revealing the power shift, as well as looking ahead to what this many-to-many approach to media might be in the future.  In addition, he explains many of the legal issues surrounding electronic media that are being hashed out on a daily basis.<br /><br />This whole subject recently became very real to me and a group of bloggers in my circle of interest.  An IT analyst firm known as The Radicati Group engaged in some behavior that was viewed by many in the blogging community as unethical.  For the whole story, see [...]  But rather than have the story restricted to a small handful of individuals, the independent blogging community picked up the story and exposed the \\"anonymous\\" behavior.  In short order, the mainstream IT media ran the story and discredited much of the firm's defense.  The power had shifted from corporation to individual, and the individuals made the news.  Even two or three years ago this couldn't have happened.  Now with the new electronic media, the ethical behavior of individuals, companies, and goverments can be examined and exposed when necessary.<br /><br />If you're a serious blogger or a journalist, this should be the next book you read.  Your viewpoint of what you do \\"for fun\\" will be forever changed, and you'll have a much richer appreciation for exactly what it is you represent.r than have the story restricted to a small handful of individuals, the independent blogging community picked up the story and exposed the \\"anonymous\\" behavior.

I'm seeing more security books come out in the style of cyber-novel.  The latest one is called Zero-Day Exploit - Countdown To Darkness by Rob Shein.  While not on par with Tom Clancy material, it does quite well and should appeal to the cyber-geek in all of us.<br /><br />In the novel, two security programmers (both geeky but pretty normal) are hired to do a security audit on a new VPN product to be used by the Department of Justice.  They quickly find two exploitable bugs (denial of service and buffer overflow) and report the situation.  But as often happens in real-life, politics and CYA cause the findings to be minimized and the software is installed anyway with a promise to fix the software later.  Of course, it doesn't get done.  Meanwhile, Islamic idealists enlist the help of two hackers in the Phillipeans to scan networks looking for this VPN package as well as some industrial software so that a cyber-attack can be launched against the US.  The original security audit team (this is years later) notices the increase in port scans for the VPN package and try to alert the DoJ.  But until the attack actually occurs, no one will listen.  Once all hell breaks loose, its them against the hackers.<br /><br />This is more of a novel and less of a security primer than books like Steal The Box.  The author does go into detail on the technology, but not to the point of putting pages and pages of screen prints in the book.  It's all part of the story dialog and action.  The second member of the team (\\"MadFast\\") starts just about each sentence with \\"Right on\\", so don't expect outstanding dialogue.  But then again, this would be closer to reality if you were listening and watching real computer geeks/hackers.  A reader experienced in security will be entertained (but won't learn much), but others less tied into computer security may have their eyes opened as to dangers that are very real.<br /><br />While not perfect, I still liked it a lot.  Definitely worth a read...a read...  <br />	2004-08-16

(note:  this review is for the 2ND edition of the book...)<br /><br />I just found a new book that I'll get to wear out really quickly.  It's the CSS Pocket Reference (2nd edition) by Eric A. Meyer (O'Reilly).  As with all O'Reilly Pocket References, it's just the core information formatted so you can find it quickly for reference.<br /><br />Chapter Breakout:  Adding Styles to HTML and XHTML; Rule Structure; Style Precedence; Element Classification; Element Display Roles; Basic Visual Layout; Floating Rules; Positioning Rules; Table Layout; Values; Selectors; Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements; Property Reference; Tables; Paged Media; Dropped From CSS2.1; Visual Styles; Paged Media; Aural Styles; Index<br /><br />For all the Amazon reviewers complaining about this book not being up-to-date...  You need to get the 2nd edition.  It's got the latest on what you need.<br /><br />Now, this is not a training manual or something you're going to be able to use to pick up CSS.  Rather, like all Pocket Guides, it's the distilled essence of the reference material that you need on a daily basis.  Rather than dig through a large book looking for stuff, you can use the pocket guide to get the answer quickly.  I'm at the stage in my CSS learning where I understand what I can and can't do, but I don't always know the exact syntax or options available to me in a particular parameter.  I've grown quite fond of the larger CSS book from Meyer and O'Reilly, and in fact I've memorized certain page numbers that I continually go back to.  This pocket reference will replace much of the wear and tear on that book, and allow me to save it for when I need explanations on concepts.<br /><br />Another keeper to add to my programming bookshelf...	2004-08-16

I just got done reading Internet Babylon by Greg Holden (Apress).  This is one of those books that reminds you of a car wreck on the side of the road.  You know the proper thing to do is avert your gaze and drive on by.  But you know you can't...  You know you have to sneak a look...  And then you just can't turn away.<br /><br />Chapter breakdown:  Family Values in Babylon; Washed Up in Babylon; The Babylon Enquirer; Unsolved Mysteries in Babylon; Death in Babylon; God in Babylon; Hackers and Other Internet Heros; Spam and Other E-Mail Follies in Babylon; Low-Down, Dirty Scum in Babylon, Flakes and Fanatics in Babylon; Political Intrigue in Babylon; Scandals in Babylon; Government Secrets in Babylon; Tongue Lashings in Babylon; Silliness, Fun, and Games in Babylon; Gossip in Babylon; Internet Legends, Myths, and Symbols; Dressing Up Your Home Page - and Yourself; Big (and Not So Big) Business; E-Commerce Comedies in Babylon; But Is It Art?; Index<br /><br />Holden has created a book that explores the quirky, strange, and seedy side of the Internet.  In each of the chapters, he examines one or more web sites and tells the story behind the concept or the person who created it.  And as you can see, he covers the gamut of topics.  Inside, you'll find links to sites such as The Necrocam (a web cam in a coffin), spamradio.com, and Bob Dole's Exploding Head.  Internet geeks and long-time internet users will recognize and relive memories of some of the sites (like Hamsterdance), and everyone will find new and \\"interesting\\" sites that they've never heard of.  And for those classics that no longer exist (such as the Gary Coleman Web-a-thon site), Holden provides links to archive sites that have captured the pages for posterity.<br /><br />At least for me, this will end up being a two-pass book.  The first pass was just to read it and be amazed/amused/whatever.  The second pass will be to visit some of the sites and gaze upon the carnage.  I'd like to give you some lofty reason for buying or reading this book.  I can't.  It's just plain voyeurism that is too much fun(?) to put down.<br /><br />Yes...  I hate to admit it.

I got my first experience with a new O'Reilly series...  The Developer's Notebook.  This notebook is the Java 1.5 Tiger Developer's Notebook by Brett McLaughlin and David Flanagan.  This is a great book and a nice concept sure to become a favorite with developers.<br /><br />The chapter breakdown:  What's New?; Generics; Enumerated Types; Autoboxing and Unboxing; varargs; Annotations; The for/in Statement; Static Imports; Formatting; Threading; Index<br /><br />As you can see, this is not a Java tutorial or a broad overview of the Java language.  It is a practical focus on the new features in Java 1.5 (codenamed Tiger), and it skips the fluff and takes you right into hands-on stuff.  The concept of a \\"developer's notebook\\" is that it's a place to record observations and take notes.  It goes to the meat of the subject.  The book is printed on paper that has a graphed background, and there are \\"handwritten\\" notes in the margin to point out additional facts.  Conversational in tone, you are walked through how each of the new features work as well as what you would use them for.  Each chapter has a number of \\"How do I do that?\\", \\"What just happened?\\", and \\"What about...\\" paragraphs that quickly guide you into understanding each new feature.<br /><br />For instance, the for/in language feature is covered nicely.  The authors show you how it is a nice replacement for the Iterator class.  But rather than stop there, they tell you what the pros and cons of the feature are....  When you'd want to use it instead of an Iterator, and when an Iterator is the only way to get what you're looking for.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot.  I'm looking forward to more books in the Developer's Notebook series.  It might end up being the best series for getting into a subject quickly without wading through a lot of fluff or hard-to-follow jargon.	2004-08-10

I had the opportunity to review the book Hibernate - A Developer's Notebook by James Elliott (O'Reilly).  This is the second Developer's Notebook I've had the pleasure to work with, and I'm becoming a big fan of this series.  This notebook on Hibernate is very nicely done.<br /><br />The chapter breakdown:  Installation and Setup; Introduction To Mapping; Harnessing Hibernate; Collections and Associations; Richer Associations; Persistent Enumerated Types; Custom Value Types; Criteria Queries; A Look at HQL; Hibernate Types; Standard Criteria; Hibernate SQL Dialects; Index<br /><br />As I mentioned on the Java 1.5 Tiger Developer's Notebook, this is a new series by O'Reilly that focuses on practical information on a specific subject.  The books are short, conversation, and devoid of fluff.  It's all hands-on.  If I had seen this book a couple of months ago, I would have said \\"What's Hibernate?  I've never heard of it.\\"  I was asked to do a tech edit of another Hibernate book from the perspective of someone who hadn't ever worked with the technology.  After reading this book, everything about the technology fell into place.  This book will walk you through exactly what you need and what you need to know to start using Hibernate.  Furthermore, the tone and style of the book makes it very easy to follow along.  One thing I appreciated in this book is that there is a single application sample used throughout the book, so you don't have a disconnected set of code snippets that don't make sense outside of the context of the chapter.<br /><br />I was of the mindset before that Hibernate was a niche technology.  I've since learned more and heard more about it, and see the real value of what Hibernate brings to the table.  If you're doing any coding to bridge relational and object oriented data, Hibernate will be an important technology for you.  And to get off the ground with it, you won't do much better than the Hibernate specs and the Hibernate Developer's Notebook..	2004-08-10

WebSphere Portal (WP) is becoming a major technology, but there's still not a lot of books out there to help you understand and implement it.  I had a chance to review Wiley's Mastering IBM WebSphere Portal by Ron Ben-Natan, Richard Gornitsky, Tim Hanis, and Ori Sasson.  Having done some work with Portal, I can say I wish I had this book a lot sooner.  It would have saved me some headaches.<br /><br />The chapter breakdown:  Introducing WP; Installing WP on Windows 2000 Server; Installing WP on Linux; Customizing WP; Installing WP Tools and Problem Analysis; Migrating to WP Version 5.0; Defining Portals and Pages; Tailoring the Portal Web Design; WP Personalization; Portal Administration; Document and Content Management within WP; Adding Collaboration and Search Components to Your Portals; Extending Portal Functionality: Portlets; Portlet Programming Model and API; WebSphere Portlet Development Environment; Portlet Development; Portlet Interactive Debug and JSR 168 Example; Struts Portlet Framework; Implementing Authentication for Large Enterprises; Integrating Security and Identity Management Tools with WP; Designing High Availability into Your Portal Server; WP Support for Web Services and Remote Portlets; Integrating External Applications with WP; Supporting Mobile Users; Index<br /><br />As you can see from the list of chapters, there's a lot of information that spans many different roles.  There's the administration processes, the development processes, security processes, and architecture.  Regardless of what part of WP you are dealing with, you'll find something of interest in here.  The authors are well-versed and experienced in WP developement and implementation, so it's not a rehash of \\"here's what the instructions tell you to do\\".  Plenty of illustrations and code samples will help you quickly get to where you need to be.<br /><br />From a development perspective (since that's my area of expertise), I appreciated the different looks at portlet development.  I know that Struts is becoming a de facto standard, but it's hard to find information on how to integrate that into a portlet program.  They cover that here.  They also cover the differences between the WP API and the JSR 168 standards for development, which is very nice.<br /><br />Basically, it's one of the most up-to-date books on WP that is currently on the market, and between it and the IBM redbooks you should be able to come up with a successful portal implementation.development.

Another \\"favorite author\\" has a new novel out.  This time it's Kathy Reichs' Monday Mourning.  All I can say is she's still hitting on all cylinders with this series.  Great stuff...<br /><br />Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist for both North Carolina and Quebec, is up in Montreal in December when she's pulled into a bizarre case.  Three skeletons are found buried in the basement of a pizza parlor, and it appears to be three young girls.  As there's no flesh left, it's difficult to determine whether these are historical or signs of a homicide.  Because of certain clues, the police want to write it off as historical, but Brennan isn't too sure.  The more she pushes, the more recent the killings become.  When she starts investigating prior owners of the building, a clear suspect emerges.  The story then focuses on kidnapping and slavery, and Brennan has to try and rescue what looks to be the next victim.<br /><br />Reichs' novels are often compared to Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series.  And there is some similarities back when Cornwell used to be...  well, Patricia Cornwell.  But the Scarpetta novels have been really bad of late, and Reichs has taken over as the queen of this type of novel.  Great writing, very fast pacing, character personalities that don't overwhelm the action, and interesting plot twists.  The only thing I didn't care for was the way the scene with Brennan's escape played out.  A little too much of a reach.  But even with that, it was still a great read and a solid five star.	2004-08-09

It was Wil Wheaton's Just A Geek.  Since I've been doing little but reading and reviewing tech books of late, I decided to take a break and dive into this one.  I am so glad I did.  It's quite the read...<br /><br />Wheaton, as many probably know, played Wesley Crusher in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation and starred in the movie Stand By Me.  He was a teen actor at that time, and decided that TNG was holding him back from moving on to feature films.  When he left the series, little did he know that his acting career would never be the same.  He resented and hated how people defined him as Wesley, not as Wil, and struggled hard with what role TNG should have in his life.  During that angst-ridden time, he got married, became a father to two stepchildren, struggled to find acting jobs, and most importantly, started a blog before blogs were all the rage.  His site, [...] became a hit and attracted a loyal following.  While many readers were trekkies, there was also a large audience of people who visited due to his writing, his comedy, and his ability to open up his life and share his feelings and struggles with others.  This book tells the story, through blog entries and vignettes, of his transformation from child actor to budding writer.<br /><br />The style is raw, comedic, emotional...  While most of us don't come from his background, all of us can relate to the constant companions of Doubt and Self-Loathing, two creatures who question our every move and live to make sure they're having more fun than we are.  I'm not a big Star Trek fan, and mostly got this book due to having some fellow colleagues who know Wil.  After reading the book, I've added his site to my list of must-read blogs and look forward to reading his other book.<br /><br />Wheaton has found his life's calling...  he's a writer.  And those of us who are his readers are better because of it.	2004-08-05

Security is often the mundane task of writing policies and enforcing regulations.  Gupta and Laliberte draw upon experience from their past consulting engagements to look at these various issues with a sense of realism that is often missing in these types of security books.  Most companies that suffer some sort of security breach don't want any news whatsoever of the incident leaking out.  While the authors don't use real company names, the actual incidents did happen.  You can learn from them before you find yourself in the same position.<br /><br />There is a reasonable balance between detail and concept in the various chapters.  Management will be able to follow along and understand what type of issues are at stake.  The techies will be able to glean enough technical detail to help prevent the same type of issues from occurring to their company.

The concept is that the intruder will spend time with that box and leave the rest of the network alone.  A honeynet is the same thing but only at a network level.  The authors of this book are experts at setting up these kind of systems in order to see how attackers work and discover new exploits before they are used against actual production systems.  They take you through all the different parts of the process; how to set up a honeypot/honeynet, how to analyze an attack, what legal considerations have to be kept in mind, and examples of exploits that actually were recorded and analyzed.<br /><br />While there are plenty of books that talk about computer security, there are few that show you how to take the offensive and learn first-hand how to analyze and understand real-life attacks.  This is a unique offering that will have high appeal for the security professional looking for in-depth understanding of the attacker mindset.h appeal for the security professional looking for in-depth understanding of the attacker mindset.	2004-08-02

Therefore, a book like Java Cookbook by Ian Darwin (O'Reilly) is the exact type of book I look for and use on a regular basis.<br /><br /> The chapter breakdown: Getting Started; Interacting With The Environment; Strings and Things; Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions; Numbers; Dates and Times; Structuring Data with Java; Data Structuring with Generics, foreach, and Enumerations; Object-Oriented Techniques; Input and Output; Directory and Filesystem Operations; Programming External Devices: Serial and Parallel Ports; Graphics and Sound; Graphical User Interfaces; Internationalization and Localization; Network Clients; Server-Side Java: Sockets; Network Clients II: Applets and Web Clients; Java and Electronic Mail; Database Access; XML; Distributed Java: RMI; Packages and Packaging; Threaded Java; Introspection, or &quot;A Class Named Class&quot;; Using Java with Other Languages<br /><br /> For those unfamiliar with the &quot;Cookbook&quot; style, the chapters have a series of real-life problems, such as playing a sound file, playing a video clip, and printing in Java. The problem is followed by a short one or two line solution and an expanded discussion of the issue complete with code. This approach makes it really easy to find something that is similar to the issue you're facing and to see how someone else would solve it.<br /><br /> For me, the quality of this book is really high. It's a second edition covering the Java 1.5 package, so it's fully up on the current technology. In fact, the Generics chapter deals exclusively with new features in 1.5. Some of the solutions are code classes developed by the author and made available for download. But unlike some books I've reviewed where the author supplies code, this isn't an attempt to push their company or product. It's just a clean way to use a solution that someone else has worked through.<br /><br /> This isn't a book you'd use to learn Java from scratch, but it's a book you'll use on a regular basis as you continue to expand your Java knowledge. Highly recommended.clean way to use a solution that someone else has worked through. <br />  <br /> This isn't a book you'd use to learn Java from scratch, but it's a book you'll use on a regular basis as you continue to expand your Java knowledge.

Based on another recommendation from my local librarian, I picked up Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane.  This is an unusual mystery with a wicked twist at the end.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels is a US Marshal in the summer of 1954, and he's been asked to head out to Shutter Island to help track down a missing patient/inmate.  Shutter Island is a mental hospital and semi-prison where criminals with major psychological issues are sent.  Ward A and Ward B are split between men and women, and Ward C is for the hardcore cases.  Teddy and his partner Chuck Aule take the ferry to the island and start their investigation.  But the site seems to be larger and more heavily guarded than is necessary for a simple psychiatric institution.  The staff seem to be hiding something, and there is no cooperation to find the missing woman who escaped.  There are clues she left, and he's trying to break her code to figure out what's really going on out there.  He's also convinced that the guy who killed his wife in an apartment fire is also on the island, and he wants to settle the score.  But as he gets closer to the answer, reality as he knows it makes a dramatic shift.<br /><br />This was a different read, in that the story setting in the mid-50's seemed to give it a darker, edgier feel.  The interaction between the two partners is interesting, and takes on a different view as the story progresses.  And the plot twist was fully unexpected and was a mind-bender.  An intelligent read and superb story.	2004-08-01

One of the nice things about being a regular at the library is that the librarians start to &quot;look out for you&quot;. They know my tastes and make sure I know when particular books come out. One of my favorite ladies over there clued me in to the latest Tim Cockey novel, Backstabber. Fun mystery, good story, and excellent writing and dialog...<br /><br /> Cockey's main character is Hitchcock Sewell, an undertaker. This series could accurately be called the male amateur detective genre. Hitch is called to the scene of a crime, complete with dead body, by his friend Sisco. The victim is the husband of the wife that Sisco is having an affair with. Hitch wants no part of the plan to cover up the crime, but still becomes a suspect when he's seen leaving the house in the early morning hours before the police have been called. The widow isn't really forthcoming on who might have been involved in the killing, so Hitch has to defend himself as well as Sisco to the police. In the meantime, he gets wrapped up in the death of an elderly lady he knew. She died in what appeared to be suspicious circumstances in a nursing home, and Hitch is unable to accept the fact that something is amiss. Characters from these two plot lines start to intertwine until a final showdown at the end that finally clears up who did what, as well as why they did it.<br /><br /> Cockey writes a fast-paced novel with a smart-alecky main character. The dialog is directed at the reader in first person form, almost like a Archie McNally novel. Hitch doesn't get flustered by much, and there's always a good comeback regardless of what happens. This is really one of my favorite series, and I appreciate the fact that it was brought to my attention again.	2004-07-30

Vladimirov, Konstantin V. Gavrilenko, and Andrei A. Mikhailovsky (Addison-Wesley).  This is an excellent book for people charged with running and securing a wireless network.<br /><br />The chapter breakdown:  Real World Wireless Security; Under Siege; Putting the Gear Together: 802.11 Hardware; Making the Engine Run: 802.11 Drivers and Utilities; Learning to WarDrive: Network Mapping and Site Surveying; Assembling the Arsenal: Tools of the Trade; Planning the Attack; Breaking Through; Looting and Pillaging: The Enemy Inside; Building the Citadel: An Introduction to Wireless LAN Defense; Introduction to Applied Cryptography: Symmetric Ciphers; Cryptographic Data Integrity Protection, Key Exchange, and User Authentication Mechanisms; The Fortress Gates: User Authentication in Wireless Security; Guarding the Airwaves; Deploying Higher-Layer Wireless VPNs; Counterintelligence: Wireless IDS Systems; Decibel-Watts Conversion Table; 802.11 Wireless Equipment; Antenna Irradiation Patterns; Wireless Utilities Manpages; Signal Loss for Obstacle Types; Warchalking Signs; Wireless Penetration Testing Template; Default SSIDs for Several Common 802.11 Products<br /><br />As you can see from the chapter selection above, there's not a lot left that isn't covered in some way in this book.  The coverage of wireless security is taken from both sides.  The first part of the book looks at how to mount a survelliance effort and a concentrated attack on a wireless network.  This could, as with all books like this, be used by the hacker community to crack your system.  On the other hand, they already know this stuff.  You as an IT professional can use this to view your system as an outsider to understand where the weaknesses might be.  The second part of the book then shifts over to what it takes to secure your system and fend off all but the most diligent and agressive attempts to hack your system.  Using both parts together, you have no reason for having glaring holes in your environment.<br /><br />To be sure, this is not a fluff book.  There is an abundance of technical detail on software configuration of both systems and hacking tools that you will need in order to be totally locked down.  The chapters on cryptography go into great detail on how crypto systems work and how the formulas are derived.  I'm still not sure if its too much detail for a book on wireless networks, but it will definitely keep the uber-geeks fully engaged in the material.<br /><br />Definitely a must-have/must-read for the wireless security/wireless administrator professional...Using both parts together, you have no reason for having glaring holes in your environment.  <br /> <br />To be sure, this is not a fluff book.

On the recommendation of my sister, I went to the library and picked up Under The Banner Of Heaven by Jon Krakauer. It's a look at a murder of a woman and her baby by two Mormon Fundamentalists who claimed that God told them to kill the victims. But while that's the core premise on the cover, it's really a deeper examination of the Mormon religion and how the Fundamentalist groups have split off over the issue of &quot;plural marriages&quot;, or polygamy. I found the book and material interesting and challenging on a number of levels.<br /><br /> I'm not a Mormon, but I can understand how many adherents to that faith would find this book distasteful. It doesn't paint the history of the Mormon religion in a very positive light. On the flip side, this would be like examining evangelical Christianity through David Koresh or Catholicism through the events of the Crusades. It's not hard to see how the narcissistic tendencies of a single charismatic individual can lead people down a path that eventually leads to corruption and abuse of power. It also forced me to look at my faith and belief system in a more critical light.<br /><br /> Krakauer writes a very clean and factual account of the events he covers. Into Thin Air was a riveting account of mountain climbing deaths, and this book follows in the same style. I might have structured the last third of the book a little differently, in that he jumps way back into Mormon history as a break in the telling of the story about the killing. By the time you got through all that, there was a bit of continuity loss. But still, it's a book well worth reading...	2004-07-29

I recently got Every Second Counts by Lance Armstrong with Sally Jenkins at the library. Seemed a timely read with Lance winning the Tour de France. I'm not sure this is a great book, but it was interesting in a number of ways...<br /><br /> The book picks up after the end of his first one It's Not About The Bike. There is less of the cancer struggle in this one, but more of the drive and fight to win the Tour race. The underlying theme here is that you aren't guaranteed anything in life, and life is precious. So you should live life to the fullest and make each second count (and hence the title).<br /><br /> There's a certain &quot;rambling&quot; element to the book. You'll start a chapter with one story that illustrates some point he wants to make. Before you get to the end, you're someplace else entirely. Not that it's a good or bad thing, it's just seemingly a little scattered at times. There are some excellent points to make you think, such as what it's like to be &quot;thrown back&quot; into life after being at death's door.<br /><br /> While I can admire what he's done and his drive and accomplishments, I don't know that I'd like Lance as an individual. I think the book gives you a good sense of who he is and what drives him, but I'm not sure I could exist long around a person who is that intense and driven.	2004-07-28

I'm almost done with my Sparkle Hayter read-a-thon... This one is Naked Brunch. This is not one of her Robin Hudson stories, and despite the back cover description is more serious than her other stuff. You'd think you're about to read a zany story of love and werewolves, but the zany part was pretty subdued. But don't get me wrong. I actually really liked it.<br /><br /> A legal secretary finds out she has Lycanthropic Metamorphic Disorder (LMT) when she morphs into a wolf and kills someone during a full moon. She's not really sure it all happened until the same thing happens the following month, and she finds another wolf in the same condition. Meanwhile, the city is in turmoil over the &quot;Mad Dog&quot; killings, and a private clinic (run by someone who also has LMT) tries to find her and bring her under control. A power struggle arises between the head of the clinic and the other wolf, who had been a clinic patient but faked a suicide when he was accused of killing another female wolf while staying there. Since the doctor can't assure himself that he can bring the situation under control, he decides to kill both of them.<br /><br /> Playing out at the same time is a secondary plot of a newscaster who is about to be fired as he doesn't have a clue as to how to report, but he picks up this story and starts to run with it. His wife, another media personality, is cheating on him and is outed in a gossip column, but he's oblivious to all the talk. The news station wants to keep him that way so that he can follow the story, and steps are taken to make sure that whole &quot;affair&quot; is controlled so that he isn't hurt in the process.<br /><br /> While the cluelessness of the reporter and the gossip column material is funny, the core story of the wolves is pretty serious and involves a lot of death and destruction (although the people who get killed deserve it). The basic plot could be really good Dean Koontz material. Definitely a different style of story for Hayter, but one I really liked.for Hayter, but one I really liked.	2004-07-26

One of the books I recently finished reading for review was Design Concepts With Code: An Approach For Developers by Kelly Carey and Stanko Blatnik (Apress). While this book might appeal to some niche of website design and development, I don't think I'm part of that group.<br /><br /> The chapter breakdown: Introducing Interface Design; Introducing Design Principles; Project 1: Building an Open Source Portal; Implementing Design Elements: Line, Type, and Shape; Implementing Design Elements: Texture, Space, Size, Value, and Layout; Project 2: Building an Online Resource Center; Working with Content and Typography; Using Color; Project 3: Building a Webzine; Exploring Site Issues and Accessibility; Index<br /><br /> This is a different book that is hard for me to describe. There are a number of abstract sketches in boxes that are about 1&quot; x 1&quot;. The reader is asked how they would interpret the lines and they are given three choices. They are then told which answer is correct as far as the attitude and mood that is suggested by the design. Each sketch is followed by Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) code to show how that sketch is coded. After a number of these exercises, the concepts are used to show a design of a web page or site that incorporates that type of design to create the proper sense and feeling.<br /><br /> If you're a graphic designer of web sites, you would probably get something from this book. A developer (or at least *this* developer) would have a much harder time getting past the &quot;here's a picture and here's the right answer as to what it should mean to you&quot; style. Outside of that, the incessant use of showing each sketch's SVG code seems to be nothing more than a space filler. I would have much rather seen something like this be downloadable from a website and to skip the endless code listings. I guess I misread the title Design Concepts With Code. I was thinking the book would cover how your code can show design concepts, not to show design concepts with code printed for each picture.<br /><br /> I won't say it's a bad book... It's just got a few flaws I would have done differently, and it definitely isn't a book that will appeal to everyone., not to show design concepts with code printed for each picture.  <br />  <br /> I won't say it's a bad book...

In keeping with the Hayter streak I've been on of late, I started and finished The Chelsea Girl Murders by Sparkle Hayter.  This is probably one of the more serious Robin Hudson novels to date...<br /><br />Robin Hudson's apartment burns down, and she's forced to take refuge in a friend's apartment at the Chelsea Hotel.  The Chelsea is a quirky historic hotel that caters to artists and celebrities.  Anyway, a runaway girl also shows up at the apartment, apparently with the approval of Hudson's friend.  This girl is trying to escape an arranged marriage.  There's also a young man who shows up, and Hudson naturally thinks that those are the two lovers.  But each of them keeps disappearing, and Hudson is trying hard to find them and reunite them.  Meanwhile, someone is murdered on Hudson's doorstep, and quite a few residents have a reason to have wanted him dead.  The two plotlines start to converge, and Hudson finds herself the target of killers who are mixed up in the whole affair.<br /><br />As all Robin Hudson novels, the story is quirky and funny.  But this seems to have a more serious element in it, and isn't quite as offbeat as the others.  This could possibly be my favorite novel in the series.	2004-07-23

I've mentioned in the past that books on web standards and markup tend to irritate me due to their &quot;I'm an expert and my opinion is always right&quot; attitude. But never one to give up, I had the chance to review Web Standards Solutions - The Markup and Style Handbook by Dan Cederhold (Apress). Much like the book Designing With Web Standards by Jeffrey Zeldman, this is a refreshing change and extremely practical. I really like it!<br /><br /> The chapter breakdown: Lists; Headings; Tables Are Evil?; Quotations; Forms; &lt;strong>, &lt;em>, and Other Phrase Elements; Anchors; More Lists; Minimizing Markup; Applying CSS; Print Styles; CSS Layouts; Styling Text; Image Replacement; Styling  ; Next Steps; Index<br /><br /> The chapters follow a common format... A topic is introduced, and three or four different methods are shown on how to accomplish the task (like lists). Each method is explored for pros and cons, with the goal of finding a solution that puts emphasis on semantic meaning and clean markup. This is followed by an &quot;extra credit&quot; section that pushes past the basic topic and starts to show some more unique ways to use CSS for appealing page images.<br /><br /> For one, the tone is conversational in nature. You're not being lectured to or scolded for not adhering to perfect and exact standards (or opinions). The book is also not a reference manual as such. It's a practical guide on how to use CSS to get the job done and give yourself a solid design that will work for multiple types of browsers. Throw in a little humor along the way, and this book becomes one which you find yourself picking up repeatedly.<br /><br /> The sign of a good book for me is one where I'm using the book either before or during my review. Based on a project I'm currently coding, I've already started to memorize certain page numbers I keep going back to. This book will definitely secure a spot on the bookshelf at work, and will be closely guarded to make sure it doesn't disappear.it doesn't disappear.	2004-07-23

If you're a Windows network administrator responsible for making sure your environment is secure, you'll be interested in reading the book Hardening Windows by Jonathan Hassell (Apress).<br /><br /> The chapter breakdown: Hardening: Theory and General Practice; Windows NT Security; Windows 2000 Security; Windows XP Security; Defining Enterprise Security Policies with Windows 2000 and Later; Patch Management; Network Access Quarantine Control; Internet Information Services Security; Exchange 2000 Server Security; Security Auditing and Event Logs; Quick Reference Checklists; Index<br /><br /> A couple things to keep in mind when you read this book. The target audience is definitely network administrators, as there is plenty of talk about group, system, and security policies. If you're looking for a book to help you secure your home laptop, this isn't it. The other thing to remember is that this isn't meant to be a comprehensive reference manual to explain every last security setting. It's meant to be a practical &quot;quick reference&quot; to help you focus on what it takes to make a Windows environment secure. Even with that caveat, there's a lot of information packed into less than 200 pages.<br /><br /> The key word that typlifies this book is &quot;practical&quot;. Hassell uses a lot of lists and charts to show recommended settings to ensure a secure environment. In addition to that, each chapter ends with a &quot;Checkpoints&quot; list that enables you to get a quick list of activities and rules to implement in order to maximize your time and efforts. An experienced administrator could use this to make sure nothing has been forgotten, and a new administrator would do well to use this as a roadmap.	2004-07-21

Also while on vacation, I started and finished The Taking by Dean Koontz.  This is his latest supernatural thriller novel, and it's not bad.  Not his best, but I still like his style.<br />A couple wakes up in the middle of the night as a strange torrential downpour starts.  It feels oppressive and doesn't stop.  Even some of the wild animals in the woods around them (like wolves) start acting strangely and seek shelter in their house.  News stories from around the world show that this is not a local occurrance, and pretty soon TV and radio stations starting going off the air, along with the power going out.  They go into town to try and band together with others, but people are acting strangely.  There are odd creatures that are starting to grow out of fungus that isn't natural to the area (or anyplace else), and these creatures seem bent on evil and killing.  They can even animate dead bodies and communicate through them.  Throughout all this strangeness and killing, the couple is safe, along with the dog that is helping them find children that have been abandoned.  Although they don't know why, the creatures seem to be unable to harm the children or the people/creatures that are helping them.  The story progresses through the buildup of the alien creatures and what will happen to earth when they are done.<br />While this isn't probably his best work, I still like his style of writing.  He paints vivid scenes with his words, and I enjoy building the story in my mind as he writes.  The plot line seems to be a little short, with a lot of writing about not much action.  If I didn't like the writing so much, I'd probably give it an average.  But since I learn a lot about style every time I read a Koontz novel, I'll bump it up one star from there.	2004-07-19

In hopes that her next work would be better, I read and finished The Last Manly Man by Sparkle Hayter while on vacation this week.  It was definitely better than the last novel of hers, so I'll keep her on my favorite author list.<br />In this story, Robin Hudson is approached by a man who she doesn't know, but who gives her a hat and an address before being abducted off the street by some thugs in a limo.  She attempts to find the address to return the hat, but it's bogus.  A couple of days later, the guy turns up dead in the waters off Coney Island, and she wants to figure out what happened.  A number of people now appear to be after her, and they think she knows some secrets that were passed on by the dead guy.  Throw in animal rights activists, vegetarians, missing horny bonobo chimps, and radical feminism (yes, it all fits), and the story gets wacky, crazy, and deadly at the end.<br />I continue to enjoy the craziness of the story lines that Hayter puts out, as well as the attitude of the lead character as she tries to steer clear of dead bodies and develop some type of relationship with any guy she can find.  While this isn't a \\"deep\\" novel with a moral or anything, it is a fun read that will provide a few hours of entertainment.	2004-07-19

A pleasant surprise, and I'm sure I'll be reading more of his stuff down the road.<br />Doc Ford is a marine biologist with a murky past as a government agent involved in some killings in foreign locales.  He's living a quiet life around Tampa until he gets a call from Pilar Fuentes, the mother of his child and former wife of a corrupt Central American general who wants him dead.  Their son has been kidnapped, and Pilar wants Ford's help.  The kidnapper is a killer who is called Incindiaro, as he's fascinated by fire deaths and in fact is severly burned over most of his body.  The kidnapper appears to want the kid's skin for a face transplant, and Ford isn't about to let that happen.  To complicate everything, Pilar now wants nothing to do with Ford romantically, Ford's new love overhears his confession of love for Pilar and dumps him, and his sidekick Tomlinson may not be who Ford thinks he is...<br />Nice plot and pace, with some left-field (but reasonable) plot turns as the story comes down to the final pages.  There was definitely the potential for an &quot;everyone *doesn't* live happily ever after&quot; ending, but it resolves without being overly sappy or abrupt.  If I had read other books in the Doc Ford series first, I'd probably give this a top rating.  Starting here, there's some character development that's left out (and I assume is covered in earlier books).  Still, a very good read and well worth the time.	2004-07-14

There are some gaps in my classic sci-fi background, and I filled one of them in today.  I finished I, Robot by Isaac Asimov.  With the upcoming I, Robot movie with Will Smith, I figured it was about time to read the book before I ruined it by seeing the movie first.  :-)<br />Bottom line, this is top-flight classic science fiction by a master.  The book is part of the Robot series, and lays the foundation for the three laws of Robotics.  1) They mustn't harm a human being.  2) They must obey human orders.  3) They must protect their own existence, but only if it does not violate rules one and two.  The book is made up of a series of vignettes related to the rise of robots, from safe menial labor to all-knowing logic that runs society.  The interplay between the three laws and how they are interpreted definitely makes one think.	2004-07-14

I recently finished reading and reviewing the book Computer Security for the Home and Small Office by Thomas C. Greene (Apress).  While it does seem to lose focus a bit towards the end and has a definite bias (which I agree with!), the overall content and information is vital to know and understand.<br />The chapter breakdown:<br />Introducing the Dark Side; Vectors; Social Engineering; From Newbie to Power User; Treasure Hunt; The Open-Source Escape Hatch; Trust Nothing, Fear Nothing; Glossary; Procedures, Processes, and Ports; Online Resources; Index<br />First off, this is a highly readable and interesting book on how to secure your computer systems against attacks and keep your data private.  The author is very vocal in his opinions, and you'll quickly learn where those biases are.  He is a major proponent of using Linux and ditching Windows.  The only reason you should use IE is because you're forced to.  Even with that, he does go into each system and explain in detail what you need to do in order to harden your system.  This includes shutting down unnecessary services, running anti-virus software, and using firewalls.  All the stuff you'd expect to see in a book like this, and he delivers.  The detail is sufficient for most intermediate users to follow, and after you're done you'll have a system that most script kiddies will bypass as it's not worth the time or effort to crack.<br />Starting in the Trust Nothing chapter, he starts to rant about how security is portrayed in the media, along with the potential conflicts of interest between vunerabilities and the companies who fix them.  While interesting material, the focus on home/small office seems to get lost in the mix.  I don't know if it's just the style of the writing or what, but I was starting to wonder if we could just move on...<br />Windows bashers will love the book, Windows defenders will think he's overly critical of the platform.  Either way, this is material you can't afford to ignore in today's environment.environment.	2004-07-14

Today I was able to finish the review on the book Network Distributed Computing by Max K. Goff (Prentice Hall).  If you're looking for a high-level work that deals with much of the theory and direction of NDC, you'll get a lot from this book.<br />The chapter breakout:<br />Fitscapes and Fallacies; Ten Technology Trends; The Scope of NDC; NDC Theory; NDC Protocols; NDC Messaging; NDC Datacom: Wireless and Integration; Today's NDC Frameworks; Tomorrow's NDC Framework Options; Fallacies and Frameworks; Composability: Real-Time, Grids, and the Rise of an NDC Meta-Architecture; Innovation and Convergence; Index<br />Now let me go on record right away.  I deal much better with practical hands-on material.  I want to see code and systems.  From that perspective, this book was a let-down.  You aren't going to find code you can cut and paste to build a peer-to-peer client.  Having said that, this *is* an excellent book to understand exactly what types of issues are involved in conceiving, designing, and building NDC systems and architectures.  In fact, I could easily see this as a textbook for a college-level course on the subject.  The author stays remarkably vendor- and platform-neutral, so you won't get an overdose of *just* Sun or .Net approaches.<br />Not having spent much time thinking about all that goes into NDC systems, I was amazed at the complexity and issues that come into play for even the simpliest applications.  With the increasing significance of distributed computing, I think most IT professionals could benefit by reading through the material and becoming aware of trends that will be here in very short order.	2004-07-14

A page-turning mystery that delivers pretty well all the way through.<br />A woman by the name of Grace Lawson is living a normal life until she picks up a package of pictures from the photomat one day.  In the package is an older print of a group of people, one of which looks like a younger version of her husband.  When she asks him about it, he denies that it's him, but takes the picture and heads out late at night.  And like all good mysteries, he doesn't return.  Grace is trying to piece together what's going on when she gets a call from him asking for &quot;space&quot; to sort things out.  The police aren't quite sure what to think, especially when Jack's disappearance is tied into a murder and a near-killing from someone who is expert in martial arts.  The picture is the key, and they start to figure out who each person is.  But all the people have either been murdered or have disappeared.  The killings get closer and closer to Grace, and the race is on to find the killer and Jack before she's killed.<br />Overall, there's good suspense and action.  The thread that ties everything together is slowly revealed throughout the book, but each revelation seems to bring a new plot twist that takes it all in a different direction.  At the very end there's a number of things that come together quickly with a number of turns, but it all seems to be a bit muddled.  Not exactly a feel-good ending, but still worth the read.	2004-07-10

Instead of doing a number of things I *should* have been doing, I decided to start the novel Deception Point by Dan Brown.  Bad mistake...  I couldn't put it down.  :-)<br />The main story revolves around a meteorite which has been found embedded in ice in the Arctic Circle.  Even more surprising is that it shows fossils of bug-like creatures that prove that there is extraterrestrial life.  This occurs on a political backdrop where NASA (who discovered the meteor using a high-tech satellite) is under fire to be privatized, and the president is taking a beating from his opponent during an election year for defending them.  The president sends an NSA intel agent up to confirm the finding and report back, and at first all seems as it appears.  But people start getting murdered and some facts surface that point to the meteor being a well-constructed hoax.  Meanwhile, the senator gunning for the president's job is riding a roller coaster of fate on his campaign as NASA's stock goes up and down.  He's being illegally financed by a group that wants to take over the agency, and their discovery of the meteor could spell the end of his political life.  All these plotlines (and a few others) coverge at the end to a final showdown with a few twists I didn't see coming...<br />This is probably one of the best recreational reads I've had of late.  The pacing was perfect.  It wasn't over-written, even though the book is 557 pages long.  I was actually interested through the whole thing.  While I had my misgivings about his other works like The Da Vinci Code, Brown writes an excellent techo-thriller.	2004-07-06

Back to a little recreational reading...<br />I finished Hidden Prey by John Sandford a couple of days ago.  This is the latest in his Prey series with main character Lucas Davenport.  While I enjoyed it, it wasn't as good as some of his previous installments...<br />A Russian from a docked freighter is murdered on the docks.  The killer notices a homeless woman who has witnessed the crime and takes off after her (but doesn't find her).  A couple of days later, a homeless lady is found strangled and everyone thinks it's a connection to the first murder.  Davenport is called in to help investigate the crime when Russia sends over a female &quot;police chief&quot; to help with the case.  She is not who or what she seems to be, and it starts to look more and more like an espionage ring is responsible for the killing.  It's up to Davenport to not only figure out who the killer is, but why the killings took place.<br />I like Sandford's writing and characters, so from that perspective I liked the book.  What I didn't care for is how the story is structured.  Murder mysteries seem to be written in two main styles.  Either you don't have a clue who the killer is (and the story is tracking down who dun it), or you know right up front who the killer is (and you watch the action unfold as s/he is brought to justice).  This is a blend of the two.  You know who did the killing, and you watch them being tracked down, but there's no clue as to why the Russian was killed or how the espionage angle (which is very big in the story) figures in.  Since you don't learn the &quot;why&quot; until very close to the end, I tended to lose some interest in the whole story.  I was getting close to a &quot;who cares&quot; point.  I'd probably give this a 3.5 stars if I could do half ratings, but since I can't I'll error on the up side.	2004-07-04

As a follow-up to the XML 1.1 Bible review, I took a look at the XML Programming Bible by Brian Benz with John Durant (Wiley).  For those who want to use XML within their application development (as opposed to just web pages), this is the perfect follow-on book to have.<br />The chapter breakout...<br />Part 1 - Introducing XML - XML Concepts; XML Documents; XML Data Format and Validation; XML Parsing Concepts; Parsing XML with DOM; Parsing XML with SAX; XSLT Concepts; XSL Transformations; XSL Formatting Objects<br />Part 2 - Microsoft Office and XML - Microsoft XML Core Services; Working with the MSXML DOM; Generating XML from MS Access Data; Creating an Excel Spreadsheet from an XML Data Source<br />Part 3 - XML Web Applications Using J2EE - XML Tools for J2EE: IBM, Apache, Sun, and Others; Xerces; Xalan; XML APIs from Sun<br />Part 4 - Relational Data and XML - Accessing and Formatting XML from SQL Server Data; Accessing and Formatting XML from Oracle Data; Accessing and Formatting XML from DB2; Building XML-Based Web Applications with JDBC; Transforming Relational XML Output into Other Formats<br />Part 5 - Introducing Web Services - Web Services Concepts; SOAP; WSDL; UDDI; Microsoft Web Services; J2EE Web Services<br />Part 6 - Microsoft .Net and Web Services - Creating and Deploying .Net Web Services; Accessing .Net Web Services; Building a .Net Web Services Client<br />Part 7 - Web Services and J2EE - Web Service Tools for J2EE: IBM, Apache, Sun, and Others; Web Services with the Sun Java Web Services Developer Pack; Apache Axis; Access Web Services from Java Applications<br />Part 8 - Advanced Web Services - Accessing Relational Data via Web Services; Authentication and Security for Web Services; Index<br />I think I got finger cramps just typing all that!  :-)<br />Seriously, there's really good material here.  The assumption is made that you already understand basic XML technology.  Benz doesn't spend an inordinate amount of time covering introductory material.  Part 1 does do a bit of that, but only enough to establish the basic direction for the rest of the book.  There is much more attention paid to XML concepts that come into play for programmers, such as the document object model of XML and how the two types of parsers (DOM and SAX) work.  The rest of the book is highly practical, with examples of how to generate or access XML data using a variety of platforms, such as Microsoft Office, .Net, J2EE, Oracle, etc.<br />For me personally, I appreciate the emphasis on code and working examples.  I have always learned more by taking something that works, tearing it apart, and using it as the basis for my own efforts.  Benz has provided many examples that provide just that opportunity.  Being that he doesn't restrict his writing to a single platform (like .Net or J2EE), this is one of few books that have a cross-over appeal to many technology platforms.  If you happen to work in a shop that uses both Microsoft and Java technologies, you'll be able to get a single book that will assist you on both sides of the fence.<br />Basically, there's nothing I can find fault with for this book.

I've had the opportunity to go through the XML 1.1 Bible by Elliotte Rusty Harold (Wiley), and I must say it's impressive.  Any time you get a tech book going into a 3rd edition, you have to think that the author is doing something right.  If you fit the criteria for the target audience, you should be pleased.<br />The chapter breakout:<br />Part 1 - Introducing XML - An Eagle's Eye View of XML; XML Applications; Your First XML Document; Structuring Data; Attributes, Empty-Element Tags, and XSL; Well-formedness<br />Part 2 - Document Type Definitions - Validity; Element Declarations; Attribute Declarations; Entity Declarations; Namespaces<br />Part 3 - Style Languages - CSS Style Sheets; CSS Layouts; CSS Text Styles; XSL Transformations; XSL Formatting Objects<br />Part 4 - Supplemental Technologies - XLinks; XPointers; XInclude; Schemas<br />Part 5 - XML Applications - XHTML; Modular XHTML; The Resource Directory Description Language; Scalable Vector Graphics; Designing a New XML Application; Index<br />I mentioned the &quot;target audience&quot; above.  As you can tell from the chapter layout (and also in the introduction), the author is targeting XML as used in web page design.  You won't find anything in here about how to write a Java program to parse out XML using one of the XML parsers available.  If that's your need, don't get this book.  You'll be highly disappointed.  This should be used as more of a reference tool for working with XML or related technologies like DTD or XSL.<br />I also appreciated the author's explanation as to what went into the 3rd edition.  Rather than just add more stuff to what already existed, he removed XML technology chapters that just never caught momentum, like VML or RDF.  So although the book is still 1000 pages, it's made up of content that is usable and applicable to the current state and direction of the technology.  It's nice to know you're not getting a rehash of material just so the author can squeeze a few more bucks out of a title.  Thanks!<br />The conversational and informal tone of the writing makes the material very approachable and readable.  The examples are clear and concise, and relevant to how the technology would be used in the real world.  Overall, a very good selection to add to your XML bookshelf.t of a title.

If you are at all involved with the use of UML in your programming or analysis activities, you'll most likely be interested in seeing the UML Bible by Tom Pender (Wiley).  Like all 'Bible' titles from Wiley, this book covers a wide range of topics that should give you most any answer you need to find.<br />The chapter breakout is in seven parts:<br />Part 1 - An Introduction to UML - What Is UML?; UML Architecture; UML Diagrams and Extension Mechanisms; Object-Oriented Concepts<br />Part 2 - Modeling Object Structure - Capturing Rules about Objects in a Class Diagram; How to Capture Rules about Object Relationships; Testing With Objects<br />Part 3 - Modeling Object Interactions - Modeling Interactions in UML 1.4; Modeling Interactions in UML 2.0; Modeling an Object's Lifecycle in UML 1.4; Modeling an Object's Lifecycle in UML 2.0<br />Part 4 - Modeling Object Behavior - Modeling the Use of a System with the Use Case Diagram; Modeling Behavior Using an Activity Diagram<br />Part 5 - Modeling the Application Architecture - Using Packages; Modeling Software Using the Component Diagram; Using Deployment Diagrams in UML 1.4; Using Deployment Diagrams in UML 2.0<br />Part 6 - Bringing Rigor to the Model - Applying Constraints to the UML Diagrams; Action Semantics<br />Part 7 - Automating the UML Modeling Process - Using a Modeling Tool; Customizing UML Using Profiles; XML Metadata Interchange<br />Appendices - UML 1.4 Notation Guide; UML 2.0 Notation Guide; Standard Elements; Glossary; Index<br />Now, I'm not a UML expert by any stretch of the imagination.  But based on what I have read and studied to date, this book covers everything.  Taking the Use Case chapter as an example, I can see that there is an abundance of technical detail and diagramming to explain the topic completely.  Couple this chapter with the notation guide in the back, and you have a reference guide that is hard to beat.  At the time this book was written, UML 2.0 wasn't yet released.  But the author takes the specs that should be part of the final release and explains how those features are different than UML 1.4.  As a result, you shouldn't outgrow this book anytime soon.<br />The only quibble I have with the book is the audience that the author says he is targeting.  Readers new to object-oriented analysis are expected to be able to get an in-depth understanding of UML and be able to become a productive member of a team by reading this book.  In my opinion, that may be a bit of a reach.  If I had no UML experience, I'd find this book very daunting in both the size and complexity of the material.  My recommendation would be to find an entry level UML book, and work through it before tackling this book.  With the UML fundamentals fresh in your mind, you'll be able to come at this book from a much better position and benefit much more quickly.<br />Overall, a good book to have around...that should be part of the final release and explains how those features are different than UML 1.4.

Just the other day I finished Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves - The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation by Lynne Truss.  You can draw one of two conclusions from this.  Either I'm getting really serious about my writing, or I've gone over the edge and started reading books on arcane points of grammer and writing.  I'd like to think it's the first of the two options, with a bent toward reading some really funny stuff!<br />Lynne Truss is English, and has written a book that took many by surprise.  Ranked #5 on Amazon at this time, and it's a book on punctuation?  Hey, where else can you get writing like this:<br />&quot;As we shall shortly see, the comma has so many jobs as a 'separator' (punctuation marks are traditionally either 'separators' or 'terminators') that it tears about on the hillside of language, endlessly organising words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circulating and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory 'woof' to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom.  Commas, if you don't whistle at them to calm down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job.&quot;<br />As a writer, I at least try to pay attention to punctuation.  As a reader, you're more influenced by punctuation than you probably realize.  Truss covers the history of words and such with dry English wit and humor, making sure you learn dispite yourself.  After finishing this book, you should have a much better grasp of what little symbol goes where, and when you should use a comma vs. a semi-colon vs. a colon.  It's almost worth reading just for the quality of writing, regardless of whether the subject matter appeals to you.<br />The only problem with reading a book like this...  Now that it's known I've read the book, you can watch my writing and see whether I've learned anything.  :-)	2004-07-03

Back to some amateur female detective genre...  This time it's Revenge Of The Cootie Girls by Sparkle Hayter.  I picked up some of her work earlier and liked it, so I thought I'd keep reading.  In this case, it's a good thing this wasn't the first book of hers that I read.  It might have been the last.  This one just didn't click for me.<br />Robin Hudson, now an executive producer for the studio she works at, is ready for a Girls Night Out event on Halloween.  She invites her best friends as well as an intern who works for her.  When the intern doesn't show up at the appointed meeting place, Hudson gets a little concerned.  She ends up stumbling onto what appears to be some sort of charity event where her intern is going from place to place, and is then given a clue for the next location.  Since the questions are about Hudson, she thinks it's some sort of benefit.  But the clues get more bizarre, the locations more risky, and additional people start showing up who don't quite look like they're into &quot;charitable events&quot;.  Hudson thinks it's all part of something put on by an old school chum (a fellow &quot;cootie girl&quot;), but even that gets complicated.  The story works up to a life or death showdown at the end.<br />I'll give the book an average rating as I like Hayter's writing style and imagery.  For story and plot, it'd be a lot lower.  The story line is muddled and doesn't move much, and far too much time is spent reexaming Hudson's years as a school outcast.  At the end, I'm not quite sure who was doing what, much less why.  I sincerely hope for better stuff to come, as I still have a couple more of her books to get to...	2004-07-02

I recently received a review copy of Java Testing And Design - From Unit Testing To Automated Web Tests by Frank Cohen (Prentice Hall).  While there is some good information to be gleaned from the book, there were a few things that got in the way.<br />The chapter layout:  The Forces at Work Affecting Your Web-Enabled Software; When Application Performance Becomes A Problem; Modeling Tests; Java Development and Test Automation Tools; Bridging from Methodology to Design; Design and Test in HTTP/HTML Environments; Tuning SOAP and XML Web Services; State, Design, and Testing; Integrating with .NET Web Services; Building and Testing Intranets and Secure Environments; A Web Application Framework from Construction to Test; Turning Test Agent Results into Actionable Knowledge; Concurrency and Scalability in a High-Volume Datacenter; Making the Right Choices for SOAP Scalability; Multiprotocol Testing in an Email Environment; Index<br />When I first requested the book, I was thinking it would help me to understand how to adequately test my Java programs using software like JUnit and such.  Throw in some methodology and best practices, and I was ready to go.  To be fair, the author does cover the topics of testing quite throughly, and especially testing of web-based HTTP applications.  If you're not looking for software how-to or detailed discussion of many different products, then you'll benefit from the book.<br />Where I had problems is that most of the technical parts of the book involve showing the reader how to use an open source package that he wrote called TestMaker by PushToTest.  There is, in my view, too much &quot;using the software that we wrote&quot; material.  All the code uses JavaDoc comments that show the particular PushToTest developer who wrote the code.  Before too long, I felt as if I was in a 500 page infomercial for TestMaker.  The software might well be excellent, but I felt somewhat lead astray in that I felt as if I was being pushed towards TestMaker rather than towards a variety of tools that one could use.  I would have felt better about the whole thing had the title been &quot;Java Testing And Design Using TestMaker&quot;.er rather than towards a variety of tools that one could use.

Over the last month or so, I've been reading Enterprise Patterns And MDA - Building Better Software With Archetype Patterns And UML by Jim Arlow and Ila Newstadt (Addison-Wesley).  This is another one of those books that I thought would deliver one thing and instead produced much more than I expected.<br />Chapter breakdown:  Archetypes and Archetype Patterns; Model Driven Architecture with Archetype Patterns; Literate Modeling; Party Archtype Pattern; PartyRelationship Patter; Customer Relationship Management Pattern; Product Pattern; Inventory Pattern; Order Pattern; Quantity Pattern; Money Pattern; Rule Pattern; Summary; Archetype Glossary; Bibliography; Index<br />Now, when I requested this for review, I was expecting something in terms of programming patterns and technical material.  What I got was a great business tool for modeling typical business objects and transactions.  The authors take a business concept like Inventory, and they build a model around it.  The model is an archetype, or a entity that exists in some shape in every business.  Through UML diagrams, you'll see all the parts that make up the archetype and how to take the parts you need to build your own version of the entity.  While the Inventory model is very comprehensive in the book, you can also pull the pieces you need to model the reality that exists in your own business.<br />There's some very practical benefits you can gain from this book.  If you're building an application and need to track a customer (for example), you can turn to the Party model and see all the parts that make up that type of entity.  This will help you to understand all the data elements that make up a Party, such as address (web, email, telephone, geographic), organization, person/gender/ethnicity, relationship, etc.  These are elements you might think of and/or remember to include, but having the model there helps you get it right early on.<br />If you're a business analyst, you will really get your value from this book.

I just finished a rather interesting and different book on Open Source Software.  The title is Open Source Solutions for Small Business Problems by John Locke (Charles River Media).  The author contacted me and asked if I'd like to review the book, and I accepted.  Since this is an area which is grabbing more of my interest these days, it was helpful in many ways...<br />First, the chapter layout:<br />Part 1 - Small Business Computing Infrastructure - Open Source Software in Your Small Business; Why You Need A Server; Setting Up Your Office Network; Open Source on the Desktop; Setting Up an Email Server; Setting Up a Web Server<br />Part 2 - Computing Your Business Operations - Customer Relationship Management; Calendar and Schedule Management; Document Management; Financial Management; Managing Resources, Schedules, and Projects<br />Part 3 - Extending Your Business With Open Source - Sharing Information with Your Partners; Marketing Your Message; Connect from Offsite; Providing Private Communications<br />Part 4 - Keeping Your Network Secure and Intact - Securing Business Data; Network Security in a Wireless World; Disaster Recovery; Viruses and Spam<br />Appendices - The Open Source Definition; Basics Of Networking; Common Open Source Licenses<br />When I first started reading it, I was expecting something non-technical in nature, something that would be targeted for the average business owner that knows s/he wants to spend less on software and is looking for alternatives.  And to be sure, the book does deliver to that group.  But there are also chapters (or areas within each chapter) where the content gets pretty technical.  For instance, the detail on how to set up a web server isn't for the person who simply wants to turn on their computer and go.  These areas are going to appeal to the in-house technical support person who's been charged with making it all work.  While you could (and probably should) find whole books on many of these topics, there's enough detail to get you started in the right direction.<br />I think Part 2 is extremely valuable, in that it helps both the business owner and the techie figure out what's available in terms of open source alternatives to the typical business software.  You learn about OpenOffice.org as a replacement to Microsoft's Office.  You learn about MySQL as an alternative to Microsoft Access or many other more expensive relational database systems.  You'd be able to find all this out if you dug around on the web long enough, but the author packages up the information in a single location and helps you start to understand what's available for you.<br />There's also a CD in the back of the book that contains many of the open source packages discussed in the book.

You learn about OpenOffice.org as a replacement to Microsoft's Office.  You learn about MySQL as an alternative to Microsoft Access or many other more expensive relational database systems.  You'd be able to find all this out if you dug around on the web long enough, but the author packages up the information in a single location and helps you start to understand what's available for you.<br />There's also a CD in the back of the book that contains many of the open source packages discussed in the book.

It's Janet Evanovich's latest Stephanie Plum novel, Ten Big Ones.  Every time one of these come out, I always fear it's going to be the start of a downward spiral a la Patricia Cornwell.  I'm happy to report that Evanovich is still on track with fun reads.<br />Stephanie Plum (a &quot;fugitive apprehension agent&quot;) starts out at the wrong place at the wrong time when she witnesses a robbery by someone wearing a red devil mask.  She also sees his real face, and she's the only person who can identify him and stop a string of increasingly violent hold-ups by this guy.  Turns out he's part of a gang who wants her dead.  Plum, her &quot;partner&quot; Lula, and Grandma Mazur end up dodging gang members who are hunting her down.  Her cop boyfriend Morelli wants her to quit the job and hole up in his apartment, but she wants none of that.  Ranger, the mystery man who excites and scares her, loans her his truck after her car gets blown up (again!).  She hides out in his apartment, and then has to figure out how she feels about him vs. Morelli when he returns unexpectedly and finds her camping out there.  Throw in her sister's impending wedding and a transvestite wedding planner/bus driver/singer, and you once again have a wacky read with unforgettable characters.<br />I've yet to read one of these novels that I haven't liked.  There is less Vincent (the head of the bond agency) in this one, but much more Lula.  In fact, Lula ends up going out with Stephanie on most of the collections, and adds plenty of color to the apprehensions.  You also learn more about Ranger, and there's a fair amount of room there for the next installment.  Which I already am looking forward to...	2004-06-28

I recently received a copy of Black Hat: Misfits, Criminals, and Scammers in the Internet Age by John Biggs from Apress.  While the information technology professional might not learn anything new from this book, it will serve as a readable resource to help typical computer users to understand the threat to their well-being when they surf the internet.<br />The chapter selection is as follows:  Black Hats: Things That Go Ping In The Night; Y.O.U MAYHAVE ALREDY 1!: SPAM; Deep Cover: Spyware; Shockwave: Worms and Viruses; Dear Friend: Scams; Upload Or Perish: Pirates; Break In: Hacking; Don't Get Burned: White Hats; Glossary; Selected Reading; Index<br />Biggs has written a relatively short (158 pages) book that deals with most of the major security risks an average user will face on a regular basis on the internet.  For example, the chapter on spam starts off with a real-life scenario involving Alan Ralsky, a well-known spammer.  You're then taken back to the early days of the 'net when the first generally recognized piece of spam made its appearance in UseNet.  The growth of unsolicted mail is tracked to current day levels, as well as the reasons why spammers do what they do.  He even takes a typical piece of spam mail and dissects the headers to show the reader how all is not as it seems in terms of where it came from and how it got to you.  The current solutions, along with the pros and cons of each are discussed, in addition to where spam seems to be headed in the future.  All this is done in a narrative fashion that stays at a level that is understandable to the average \\"Joe Computer User\\".<br />The chapter on scams is also very valuable for helping people avoid getting fleeced.  A lot of space is given to the Nigerian 419 scam, where you are asked to help someone transfer money out of their country into your bank account for a cut of the millions.  I keep thinking no one would fall for this, but it still keeps sucking people in.  Biggs also explains phishing scams, where users end up at web sites which are clever imitations of real sites.  The person enters financial or personal information, and then finds themselves the victim of credit or identity fraud.  This is definitely a scam on the upswing, and can catch people at all levels of internet expertise.<br />I personally enjoyed reading it, knowing that there were a number of people I would recommend it to.  Like my kids or my parents.  :-)  If you're not an IT professional but you are an internet user, this book will help you to understand and avoid some very real dangers out there.scams, where users end up at web sites which are clever imitations of real sites.

I think this will catch me up on my book reviews over the last week...  :-)<br />For some recreational reading, I picked up Dale Brown's Plan Of Attack.  This is one of those military war thrillers involving the use of hi-tech weaponry to defeat the enemy.  Overall, a pretty good read.<br />In the latest episode of Patrick McLanahan's adventures, he's been demoted a rank for once again skirting a direct order given to him for defending a certain area by having and using some offensive weapons when they are attacked.  He ends up tucked away at a desk top with strict orders to mind his own business and just do his job.  But he ends up getting intel that points to Russia preparations to launch a full-scale nuclear attack on the US.  His direct superiors won' t listen to what appears to be an outlandish conclusion, so he goes over their heads and ends up facing a court martial.  But of course, he's right and the attack takes place.  His small group of hi-tech commandos are one of the few resources left to counter-attack, and he has to once again disobey some orders in order to make his plan happen.<br />Since this book uses characters that have appeared in other Dale Brown novels, there is not a lot of background character development.  If you haven't read the previous novels, you might be a little lost as to why McLanahan is viewed in such a negative light.  The story moves along at a decent pace, and the different weaponry is interesting to think about.  While I didn't see it as a &quot;can't put it down&quot; book, I did enjoy the read.	2004-06-26

Tommy Carmellini is a CIA agent who happens to stumble upon a CIA safehouse as a massacre is going down.  The disturbing part is that the killers are most definitely from the US and look professional (either military or law enforcement).  Carmellini is able to rescue one lady who is a Russian interpreter debriefing a Russian defector that was an archivist for the government and copied seven cases of materials over the years.  The defector is able to escape on his own, but his age and failing memory leaves him in a state of confusion as to where he is and what's happening.  The killers figure out who Carmellini is, and he (and anyone around him) is now a target of someone who appears to be high up in the government, and wants everything related to the defector (including the defector himself) eliminated to protect a secret.  Carmellini enlists the help of Jake Grafton (a major character from earlier Coontz novels) to get to the bottom of the mystery and to stay alive.<br />I'd give this a higher rating if it weren't for a stretch before the final showdown takes place.  Through the first half of the book, someone is after Carmellini is being hunted every time he turns around.  Once he decides to go to New York to try a last effort to uncover the truth, he ends up being left alone for a number of days while he sets up survellience and listening bugs.  Then at the end, he's conveniently a walking target again and nearly gets killed at every turn.  The break just didn't seem to fit too well in the story flow.  That fact notwithstanding, it's an entertaining read that will entertain you for awhile.	2004-06-21
620875:US	52517734	RT1JMLNU7TR5B	0399149783	370279775	Monkeewrench	Books	4	3	4	N	N	I liked it all until the very end...	While at my conference this week, I started and finished Monkeewrench by P. J. Tracy.  This is a very nice cyberthriller with a number of plot turns that does a pretty good job until the very end.<br />A software company called Monkeewrench puts out educational software, but decides to go with a serial killer &quot;who dun it&quot; game.  While some of their clients aren't thrilled about the content, things are OK until a series of real life murders start mimicing each level of the killings in the game.  The killings are occuring once a day, and even with the cops staking out the locations, they can't prevent the killings.  The leading programmer (Grace McBride) is a security paranoid who is blaming herself for all the killings, and the cops are wondering if the killer is her or one of her four co-workers at the company.  The cops from two different killings are able to trace down who the killer might be based on some clues, but they have no idea who this person might be at this point in time (due to name changes).  To complicate issues, all of the Monkeewrench staff have blocked FBI files and no traceable history past 10 years ago.  The killer starts communicating with McBride and seems to be getting close to killing her also.  All this builds up to a final showdown where the full story is revealed and the true killer is uncovered.<br />First off, I really like good cyberthrillers where computer software or technology plays a lead role in the story.  For that, the book gets high marks.  The building tension of each killing with no way to stop them is also well done.  The final scene was, in my opinion, a bit of a letdown.  The revealed killer along with the story of why it all happened didn't make a lot of sense, and it seemed like it could have finished up better.  Still, a very good read, especially if you like novels that include elements of computer gaming and programmer lifestyles.	2004-06-21

I'll be reading the rest	Some time back, someone recommended Sparkle Hayter to me as an author.  She writes in the female amateur detective genre, much like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  I was low on recreational reading material, so I picked up Nice Girls Finish Last.  I think I've found another favorite author...<br />The main protagonist in this series is Robin Hudson.  She's a reporter for a large news network, and she's part of the &quot;Special Reports&quot; division.  That would be the group that does stories on alien abductions and stuff.  She's not thrilled with this assignment, but she's stuck with it.  A doctor in her work building is found murdered, and it looks like there might be an element of S&amp;M involved.  The news editor wants Hudson to package the story as an S&amp;M killing, even though she thinks it might have nothing to do with that.  She starts investigating on her own, but unfortunately all the guys in her work and personal life are also getting shot at (she was supposed to have an appointment with the doctor that got killed later that evening).  The police see her as the common thread, but she can't figure out why for the life of her.  And it might be a short life if she can't get it solved quickly...<br />The character is single and cynical, loves the big city and her job, but hates her boss.  A real modern woman.  The dialogue and writing is sharp and witty, and I got into the story and the characters pretty easily.  The book is pretty short, so it's not much of a time investment to read.  Well worth picking up if you want to indulge your &quot;guilty pleasures&quot;...  :-)	2004-06-15

Occasionally I have the need to leave my IBM/Lotus programming platform and interact with data stored in Microsoft SQL Server 2000.  I even have it running on my laptop as a higher-end alternative to Access.  I found that the book, Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming by Robert Vieira (Wrox) is a very good reference for manipulating data in that environment.<br />Vieira concentrates specifically on the programming aspects of SQL Server 2000 as opposed to teaching you how to administer the server.  He does touch on an administration overview in chapter 30, but it's not something you'd read in order to pass an administration exam.  Although the title does say &quot;Professional&quot;, this does not mean you have to be a veteran SQL programmer to benefit from it.  The earlier chapters cover the fundamentals of RDBMS technology, as well as how SQL is used in a SQL Server 2000 environment.  The further you get into the book, the more you'll find subjects that are either more advanced or cover techniques you'll use in application development, such as how to build triggers and stored procedures.  While you will learn all these skills within the SQL Server 2000 platform, the core technologies are transferable to just about any RDBMS.  Time spent with this book will continue to pay off regardless of what database system you need to use at any given time.<br />While the content is technical, the writing style is conversational and approachable.  It's actually quite easy to read the material and digest the concepts without trying to fight against the author's style.  If you have need to work with SQL Server 2000 from a development standpoint, this is definitely a book to consider to guide you along the way.	2004-06-07

I recently decided to read a paperback I've had kicking around for awhile...  Red Rain by Michael Crow.  This is a crime thriller with a very gritty edge to it.  Good in some ways, not so hot in others...<br />The basic plot is this...  Luther Ewing, a cop, ends up running across a Russian mobster who he apparently fought next to in some war action.  The Russian is pushing drugs into his area, and Ewing decides to run undercover to get close to him and shut down the ring.  The problem is that he has to do this outside the bounds of normal law enforcement to protect a number of cops from getting killed by the ex-Spetnaz employed by the Russian.  Plenty of people in the drug world and law enforcement circles start getting assasinated, and Ewing has to kill or be killed.  There are a few side stories too, but I'll leave it at that.<br />Now, the book is written in a first person style.  The main character is half-Vietnamese, half-black, and takes medication to control brain damage from a bullet wound he suffered.  He's a trained killer, so his emotional side is less than touchy-feely.  There's a darkness and edge to the writing that matches the character and makes it a compelling read.  What I don't like is that much of the background of the different characters is only alluded to during the story.  If this were a second or third novel with the main character, I could understand it.  But this is the first one, and I would have expected a bit more character development along the way.  I wasn't always sure where the story was going or why certain things were happening.<br />So...  Stylistically, it's an interesting read.  From just a pure story viewpoint, it was average.	2004-06-06

In this field, technologies change rapidly and it's tough to keep up.  Often, authors stop after a first edition of a book, either due to lack of sales, financial return, or lack of interest in creating a follow-up.  Not only has Danny Goodman created a definitive guide to the JavaScript language, he's continued to keep it current and fresh through five iterations.  For that alone, he could be commended.  But aside from longevity, this is likely the most complete coverage I've seen on a given topic.<br />By starting off with a tutorial that is easy to follow, the JavaScript Bible will appeal to new users of the scripting language.  All of the essentials are covered, along with questions at the end of each chapter to test your retention.  For the veteran coder, parts 3 and 4 are worth their weight in gold.  Not only is every method and property of every object covered and documented, but you also are told what the browser compatibility expectations are.  Since all the browsers are not equal in support of JavaScript, you can quickly get into situations where a coded routine will run for IE but not Netscape.  You may even find problems between versions of the same brand browser.  By paying attention to the compatibility information, you have a fighting chance of writing code that will be usable by more than one browser.<br />This is also a situation where the CD-is actually useful.  The bonus chapters actually add more content to the book, instead of just adding on demo versions of software that you will never load.Since the CD contains the entire text of the book, you also have the distinct advantage of loading the PDF to your computer and searching for information you need.  There isn't much in this book that is a waste of time, nor is there much else I can imagine that could be added to the book to improve it.  It's truly a classic.<br />Conclusion<br />If you use JavaScript at all, this is the single reference book you'll need to own.

[Edited review for 2nd edition - 05/20/2006]<br /><br />Every time I read a book on Google, I find new stuff to get excited about (and get reminded about stuff I need to use more).  This one is no different...  Google: The Missing Manual (2nd Edition) by Sarah Milstein, J. D. Biersdorfer, and Matthew MacDonald.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Part 1 - Searching with Google: Google 101; Superior Searching<br />Part 2 - Google Tools: Googling Further - Images, News, Maps, and More; Googling with Others - Groups and Answers; Shopping with Google; The Google Toolbar; More Cool Google Tools<br />Part 3 - Google for Webmasters: Becoming a Search Result; Making Money with Google; Google Analytics<br />Part 4 - Gmail: Gmail<br />Part 5 - Appendix: The Google Wide Web<br />Index<br /><br />The book starts out with the requisite coverage on the search syntax of Google.  For those who have never gone beyond a basic search, this will be an eye-opener.  For people like me who have tried some of the other options, this serves as a good refresher for some techniques I may have forgotten.  The book really becomes valuable to me once it gets into the second part.  That's where I'm reminded about and exposed to the other features of Google that fall outside the normal searching.  For instance, I didn't know that you could do a personalized homepage using Google (much like MyYahoo).  I have that going on now.  Google Desktop?  I'm inclined to try it again after having dropped it during the initial download frenzy.  And using SMS and my cell phone to get Google information like driving directions might become a regular part of my techie toolbox.  While it's true you can dig around on the Google site and find all this stuff (\\"why buy a book for it?\\"), I much prefer to have that type of information packaged up for me.  Also, since Google changes daily, there's always the issue of things being gone or substantially revised by the time you read about it.  Still, *knowing* that a feature exists is the first step in learning how it works...<br /><br />This is a book that will remain close to my home computer, and one that I'll browse through on a regular basis to get those \\"I missed that feature!\\" moments...This is a book that will remain close to my home computer, and one that I'll browse through on a regular basis to get those \\"I missed that feature!\\" moments...	2004-06-06

While I was up half the night with what seems to be the flu, I was pretty much able to start and finish Bitter Sweets by G. A. McKevett.  This is the second book in the series, and you end up getting a fair amount of character development devoted to Savannah's grandmother.  She shows up on Savannah's doorstep, wanting to experience a trip to Disneyland.  Unfortunately, Savannah has a few other things going on.<br />Savannah's new detective agency gets its first case, and it's a request to track down a missing sister.  They take all the necessary precautions to make sure the person requesting the trace is actually her brother, and they start the hunt.  When they finally find her, they learn she's in hiding from her ex-husband who has threatened to kill her and their daughter.  Before Savannah can arrange a meeting between brother and sister, she finds out she's been duped.  The sister is murdered, the child is kidnapped, and Savannah now has to track down the killer.  To make it worse, the chief of police is seriously considering charging her with being an accessory to the murder.<br />A nice number of twists and turns, and some ethical questions at the end where you have to figure out whether justice would be served by doing the &quot;right&quot; thing.	2004-05-31

If you spend any time working with Excel as part of your job, you'll really like this book...  Excel Hacks by David &amp; Raina Hawley (O'Reilly).  This book contains 100 tips and tricks related to the Excel spreadsheet package from Microsoft.  The tips are divided into the following chapters:<br />Reducing Workbook And Worksheet Frustration; Hacking Excel's Built-in Features; Naming Hacks; Hacking PivotTables; Charting Hacks; Hacking Formulas And Functions; Macro Hacks; Connecting Excel To The World<br />This particular Hacks book has an advantage that many other Hacks titles don't have.  The subject matter relates to a single program, so nearly all the hacks are applicable to an Excel user.  Contrast that to a Hacks title like Network Security Hacks, where your choice of operating system limits the number of tips that you can use.  While there are some Windows-only Excel hacks included, most all the tricks work on both the Windows and Mac version of Excel.  Nobody should feel left out here.<br />I especially liked the chapter on the charting hacks.  They outline a technique for building a speedometer chart that is really impressive.<br />If you are an Excel power user (or know someone who is), this is the book for you.	2004-05-31

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Some helpful principles for your life...	I tend to like self-improvement titles, as picking up one or two good ideas you can implement in your life can make a world of difference.  To that end, I picked up a copy of The Present by Spencer Johnson.  Johnson, the author of another book I really liked, Who Moved My Cheese?, tells a parable about a young man who is mentored by an older gentleman.  The gentleman tells the man about &quot;the present&quot;, and he does all he can to figure out what exactly that means.  He finally realizes the &quot;present&quot; is not a physical gift, but a concept involving being totally involved in whatever you are currently doing.  By learning how to learn from the past and prepare from the future, you can be much happier and productive in the present.<br />Definitely some interesting concepts, and ones that I can easily see myself working to implement in my own life.	2004-05-31

In Death By Chocolate, Savannah Reid is hired to be a bodyguard for a TV cooking celebrity who is known for her chocolate recipes.  But once Savannah meets her, she realizes that the lady is really a bitter old woman who is bossy and irritating.  She's been receiving hate mail, and wants Savannah to figure out who is sending it.  The investigation is barely underway when the Chocolate Queen is poisoned, and now Savannah has to figure out who killed her.  And everywhere she turns, she finds people who fit the bill.<br />To complicate Savannah's life, her sister Cordele shows up unannounced and wants to work out some &quot;family issues&quot; with her.  Cordele can't seem to get past her &quot;horrible&quot; childhood, and wants to relive all her pain and agony, while Savannah just wants to send her back home.<br />Light reading, fun story, and all the twists and turns you expect in a G.

If you're at all responsible for or mindful of the security aspects of your network, here's a book you'll enjoy...  Network Security Hacks by Andrew Lockhart (O'Reilly).  As with all the Hacks titles, this book contains 100 various tips and ideas on how to improve your network security through the use of various software packages or procedures you can implement.  The Hacks are grouped into the following chapters:<br />Unix Host Security; Windows Host Security; Network Security; Logging; Monitoring and Trending; Secure Tunnels; Network Intrusion Detection; Recovery And Response.<br />This isn't a primer on all you need to know about system security, nor is it meant to be.  Network Security Hacks is most helpful for the system or network administrator who understands security but is always looking for various ways to enhance their level of security or ease the administration processes.  For instance, in the Monitoring and Trending chapter, you are introduced to a number of free tools you can download that will verify your services, graph your bandwidth trends, monitor real-time network stats, and audit the traffic on your network.  While not every hack will appeal or apply to you, you will find plenty of gems that will give you a real and quick payback.<br />The only &quot;gripe&quot; I have about the book is that it is heavily weighted towards the Unix environment.  The Windows chapter is pretty small, and even some of the Windows hacks involve allowing you to work with the data like you can with Unix.  So, if you're looking strictly for Windows security tips, you will probably find less satisfaction than you might if you were a hard-core Unix admin.  Even so, there is material there that will interest you, such as how to use Snort to set up an intrusion detection system or how to use built-in features of Windows to create your own firewall.<br />Very good book, and worthy to hold a spot on your bookshelf...	2004-05-31

Target Audience<br />Beginning web designers or web designers who want to grow beyond single page designs.<br />Contents<br />This is a reference/tutorial guide to web technologies that are necessary to build web sites.  The book is divided into three parts:<br />Part 1 - Building A Wicked Cool Web Page - So What's All This Web Jazz?; Building Your First Web Page: HTML Basics; Presenting Text Attractively; Moving Into The 21st Century With Cascading Style Sheets; Lists And Special Characters; Putting The Web In World Wide Web: Adding Pointers And Links; From Dull To Cool By Adding Graphics<br />Part 2 - Rockin' Page Design Strategies - Tables And Frames; Forms, User Input, and the Common Gateway Interface; Advanced Form Design; Activating Your Pages With JavaScript; Advanced Cascading Style Sheets; Site Development With Weblogs<br />Part 3 - Expanding Your Pages Into A Web Site - Web Sites versus Web Pages; Thinking About Your Visitors And Your Site's Usability; Validating Your Pages And Style Sheets; Building Traffic And Being Found; Closing Thoughts; Appendix A: Step-by-step Web Site Planning Guide; Appendix B: Finding A Home For Your Web Site; Index<br />Review<br />If you're just starting out with learning how to build Web pages or sites, you no doubt have a wide number of books to choose from to help you learn those skills.  But you can easily get bogged down in the minutiae of every little HTML tag and still not know what CSS means.  You need a readable book that gives you solid coverage of essential information.  With that in mind, you should check out Creating Cool Web Sites With HTML, XHTML, and CSS by Dave Taylor.<br />To position this properly, let's make sure you're the right audience.  This isn't a book that will teach new tricks to an experienced web designer who earns their living developing corporate web sites.  This book does an excellent job in covering a lot of ground without needing 1000+ pages to do so.  Taylor takes you through the basics of HTML and XHTML, as well as how to use CSS to add formatting and presentation to your page.  There's even some coverage of JavaScript as well.  As you continue to gain expertise in each of these areas, you will probably want a hard-core reference manual to continue your education, but Creating Cool Web Sites will give you the necessary foundation to get started.<br />While targeted more towards beginners, the information in part 3 is a worthy read for a larger audience.  To properly build a web site, you have to think of it as a cohesive whole, not just a collection of separate pages.  The author helps the reader think through site issues, such as traffic, accessibility, and so on.  Once again, any one of these topics could be a book on its own, but this is a nice level of coverage for initial exposure and to get started.<br />Conclusion<br />Beginners will find this to be an approachable coverage of web technologies, while intermediate designers will probably gravitate to the Web site design and CSS information.ML, as well as how to use CSS to add formatting and presentation to your page.

This is one of my favorite IT business strategy books out there...  In Search of Stupidity: Over Twenty Years of High Tech Marketing Disasters, Second Edition by Merrill R. Chapman.  It's amazing that people were paid millions to make these decisions and blunders.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />First Movers, First Mistakes: IBM Digital Research, Apple, and Microsoft<br /><br />A Rather Nutty Tale: IBM and the PC Junior<br /><br />Positioning Puzzlers: MicroPro and Microsoft<br /><br />We Hate You, We Really Hate You: Ed Esber, Ashton-Tate, and Siebel Systems<br /><br />The Idiot Piper: OS/2 and IBM<br /><br />Frenchman Eats Frog, Chokes to Death: Borland and Philippe Kahn<br /><br />Brands for the Burning: Intel, Motorola, and Google<br /><br />From Godzilla to Gecko: The Long, Slow Decline of Novell<br /><br />Ripping PR Yarns: Microsoft and Netscape<br /><br />Purple Haze All Through My Brain: The Internet and ASP Busts<br /><br />The Strange Case of Dr. Open and Mr. Proprietary<br /><br />On Avoiding Stupidity<br /><br />Stupid Analyses<br /><br />Afterword: Stupid Development Tricks<br /><br />Glossary of Terms<br /><br />Selected Bibliography<br /><br />Index<br /><br />Chapman covers some of the most famous blunders of the high tech industry...  How did Lotus 1-2-3, an industry standard, lose the battle to Microsoft Excel?  How did OS/2, a technically superior operating system to Windows, end up dying a slow, agonizing death?  What technical decisions led to Netscape's slide to irrelevance after creating the browser market?  All of those are examined here in biting, satirical detail.  I'll grant that there's an element of \\"everything's clear in hindsight\\" in play here.  Kildall's decision not to talk with IBM about CP/M (and Microsoft's subsequent win with DOS) *did* define how the PC industry played out, but how many other \\"no show\\" meetings happened during that time that never resulted in anything?  You can only add in the drama after the fact.  But the important thing here is to observe and learn.  Netscape's decision to completely rewrite their browser may have sounded OK at the time, but history shows that those types of technical decisions will likely kill your market share.  As such, you should think about Netscape when some techie guru says that a rewrite of your cash-cow product is a good idea.  It's not...<br /><br />Even if you're not interested in the industry examples (and you should be), the writing is a pure pleasure.  In what other tech book can you find a suggestion like \\"decreased drug use by industry executives might lead to clearer thinking\\" and \\"stupidity bites\\"?  Chapman pulls absolutely no punches in his storytelling and analysis, and he has a excellent ability to turn a phrase and roast those corporate sacred cows.  It's not often that I audibly chuckle or laugh when reading a book (especially a business or IT book).  It happened a number of times here.<br /><br />Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  Here are plenty of examples of \\"doomed\\" companies who continued to pull the trigger in hopes of missing their foot the next time.

I recently finished Stuart Wood's latest, Reckless Abandon.  While I like the Stone Barrington series, there seemed to be something missing in this one...<br />Wood brings together Stone Barrington and Holly Barker, the character from the Orchid series.  She's up in New York, tracking down a mobster who has committed a series of murders in her jurisdiction.  He's still a killer, but now he's being protected by the feds under the witness protection program.  She wants to somehow break that protection and see him brought to justice.  Barrington is helping her out since she's staying with him and he's got the hots for her.<br />I'm not sure what it is that's missing.  Not enough action?  Not enough mystery?  Light on plot?  I don't know.  I just can't put my finger on it.  It's an OK read, but I expected more...	2004-05-27

I recently read and reviewed Stealing The Network - How to Own the Box (STN) by Syngress Publishing.  Great read.  When I saw there was a follow-up titled Stealing The Network - How to Own a Continent (STC), I had to read it too.  Once again, a great read for computer and security people.<br />Much like STN, STC is a series of fictional episodes involving system attacks and exploits.  The episodes aren't real, but the techniques and concepts outlined are definitely true to life.  The main difference between the two is that STC is a cohesive series of attacks coordinated by a mysterious person in the background who wants to disrupt a continent and make a huge financial score.  So while each story in STN was a stand-alone chapter, STC is more like a mystery techno-thriller that is light on plot but heavy on technical detail.<br />In addition to learning about attacks and how they can occur (which you can get in just about any security book), STC once again adds the color of the attacker's personality into the equation...  Why they do it, what they stand to gain, and what level of effort they are willing to expend to gain their prize.  I feel that most security departments fall flat in this area.  They can configure and set up proper security &quot;by the book&quot;, but they are unable to think like a cracker and anticipate the unexpected.  That's probably where this book (actually, both books) adds the most value to the collection of security knowledge and wisdom that's available on the technical bookshelves today.<br />If you're looking for a techno-thriller novel that reads like Tom Clancy, this isn't your book.  But if you're looking for solid security information told in a colorful and unusual manner that will cause you to question your own security awareness, you found what you're looking for...	2004-05-27

If you're a blogger and enjoy the act of expressing your views and emotions online, you'll enjoy Never Threaten To Eat Your Co-Workers - Best Of Blogs (Apress).  This collection of blog entries edited by Alan Graham and Bonnie Burton is a fun look at various blogs and bloggers that range from the well-known to the obscure.  On one end you have a few blog entries by Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher of Star Trek: TNG fame).  On the other end might be Ali Davis, the writer for True Porn Clerk Stories (she is a clerk in a video porn shop and writes about her experiences).  The format is pretty simple...  random samplings of some of their blog entries, along with short interviews asking about their motivation behind blogging and their views on the concept.<br />Some of the entries may have you laughing to tears (\\"Dear Cranky[...]\\") and some will make you think (\\"Clutching For Answers In Baghdad\\"), but all them will reflect the person behind the keyboard, no matter how quirky and real they may be.  And in the interviews with the writers, you'll most likely see yourself, a fellow blogger who is sharing a small part of themselves with the world.	2004-05-24

Are you a digital photographer who is always looking to try something different or learn a new technique for your shooting?  If so, you'll like Digital Photography Hacks by Derrick Story (O'Reilly).  Like all Hacks titles, the book is made up of 100 ideas or techniques that you can use to do something different or unusual.  The hacks fall into the following chapter areas:<br />Digital Camera Attachments; Daytime Photo Secrets; Nighttime Photo Hacks; Magic With Flash; The Computer Connection; Photoshop Magic; Camera-Phone Tricks; Weekend Photo Projects<br />The thing I like most about the Hacks series is that if you don't like or can't use one tip, the next one may be exactly what you have been searching for.  And this book is no different.  To get the absolute most out of the material, you should have a digital SLR or a high-end digital camera that gives you a wide range of control over shutter speeds and aperture settings.  You should also have a copy of Photoshop CS, as that tool will allow you to do everything in the PS hacks chapter.  But even if you only have a good consumer level digital camera, you'll be able to try out some tricks you may never have thought about.<br />I particularly enjoyed the hacks on nighttime photography and panoramic techniques.  I've always loved the vividness and colors of great night scenes, and there are some great ideas on how to capture those elements.  There are also some cool tips for using longer shutter speeds to get light movement effects, such as head and tail lights of cars.  As for panoramic photography, I've seen it but never knew how it was done.  This book shows you how it works and how best to line up your shots for that type of shooting.<br />Very good book, great ideas, and you'll enjoy looking at your photography in new and unusual ways.	2004-05-23

Target Audience<br />IT professionals who are looking for instructions on how to implement the Rational Unified Process (RUP) in their project or organization.<br />Contents<br />This book is an instructional approach on how to implement RUP in an organization.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters: How To Adopt RUP In Your Organization; The First Meeting With RUP; What Is A RUP Project?; Assessing Your Organization; Motivating The RUP Adoption; Planning The RUP Adoption; Obtaining Support From The Organization; How To Adopt RUP In Your Project; Deciding Upon Your Process; Documenting Your Process; A Guide To Successful Mentoring; Experiences From Actual Implementations; Adding Another Project Management Method To RUP; Glossary; Recommended Reading; Index<br />Review<br />The Rational Unified Process, or RUP, is a software engineering methodology that attempts to map out and document all parts of a software development project.  It's extremely comprehensive, but it's also adaptable to whatever level of effort is appropriate for your situation.  This book, Adopting The Rational Unified Process, will not teach you RUP, but it will help guide you during the implementation process.<br />The authors have had extensive implementation experience with RUP, and they share their methodology of what works and what doesn't when it comes time to consider a RUP implementation for your organization.  While RUP can be overwhelming to look at and imagine within your company, Bergstrom and Raberg help you understand each step of what is needed during an implementation.  Plenty of time is spent assessing your organization and processes so that you can get a good fit and determination of what RUP pieces make sense given your particular situation.<br />In my view, this book is probably best used by a project manager or team leader who is responsible for implementing a RUP project.  If you are reading this material in conjunction with an actual real-life implementation, you'll get the most out of the information.<br />Conclusion<br />If you've had instruction in RUP and now need to take the next steps for implementation, this would be a good choice to assist you in that process.get the most out of the information.<br />Conclusion<BR>If you've had instruction in RUP and now need to take the next steps for implementation, this would be a good choice to assist you in that process.	2004-05-23

I finally finished up the last freelance writing book I had checked out from the library.  This one is the Freelance Writers' Guide put out by the National Writers Union.  And all I can really say is &quot;eh&quot;...<br />It's a series of chapters written by different authors on various issues related to the publishing industry.  Because the NWU is a group advocating the rights of writers, the tone and direction is more militant and confrontational than most of the other books I've read.  There is plenty of &quot;we believe this is grossly unfair to...&quot; type statements scattered throughout, and it seemed to get a bit old after awhile.  But conversely, if you are a freelancer trying to make a living at this, I suppose you have far more at stake here than I do.<br />Information you should know, but probably not the first book on how do do freelance writing that you want to read.  Little instruction on how, and more emphasis on running your business.	2004-05-22

Some are new and unique, and many are rehashed exploits made possible by the failure to patch and secure your systems.  In order to see your system as a cracker would, you need to understand the mindset and toolsets that are used against you.  This book, Network Security Assessment, will help you do just that.<br />Each chapter starts with a brief explanation of the area being discussed, as well as some of the overall security concerns related to that service.  The rest of the chapter is then devoted to various exploits and tools that can be launched against the different operating systems.  Chris McNab uses extensive illustrations and output listings to show the reader how the tools work and what type of information can be exposed to an attacker.  Since many of the tools are Unix-based or are expected to be used against Unix-type systems, the author does assume familiarity with administration of Unix variants.<br />There are a lot of things to like about this book.  The assessment methodology is organized and well thought out.  It's not just a random scattering of exploits.  The author also takes great pains to provide the sites where you can download the tools.  In addition to that, the tools are also mirrored at the O'Reilly site so that you are protected against websites that may move around.  The argument could be made that this provides a fledging cracker with all the information they need to break into your system.  True, but the information already exists, and they will find it with or without this book.  This book levels the playing field by making security information available to corporate administrators so that they have a chance against attackers.<br />Conclusion<br />A worthy addition to the bookshelf of network and security administrators.

Another Savannah Reid mystery....  Killer Calories by G. A. McKevett.  This is one of the earlier ones in the series (the 3rd), and it is definitely a fun read.<br />A disco movie star (who happens to run a &quot;health spa&quot;) is found dead in a mud bath.  All indications point to an accidental death involving too much heat and too much alcohol.  But Savannah gets an anonymous note with a load of money asking her to investigate the death.  The letter seems to point to either suicide or murder.  Savannah, who loves her food and her size, checks into the spa to do some undercover work.  But between the horrible food and the excessive exercise, she wants to wrap it up as soon as possible.<br />Everyone seems to have loved the dead star, but there are an abundance of suspects who would benefit from her death.  The harder Savannah pushes, the more her own life seems to be in danger.  Plenty of twists, and you don't find out the killer until the very end.<br />A shorter novel, a quick read, and excellent humorous writing and character development.  I'm really going to hate finishing up this series...	2004-05-20

I really dislike dogmatic ranting in tech books, and I must admit I was not looking forward to this book with much enthusiasm.  I knew I needed to read it, but it was going to be one of those things that was \\"good for me\\", but not enjoyable.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself actually liking the book!  There's some really good material in here...<br />Zeldman approaches the subject of standards-based web design from a pragmatic viewpoint.  By using XHTML and CSS correctly, you can design pages that render beautifully in modern browsers, but degrade gracefully when you view them in older browsers or other devices like PDAs.  The goal isn't to write pages that render exactly the same in all platforms, but to use XHTML to structure your page content, and allow CSS to control the presentation aspects of the page.  By maintaining that structure/content division, other browser devices can adequately display the core content of your site without losing all page visibility.  And by using CSS to control the presentation of the site, you can dramatically cut the size of your pages down, thereby reducing your overall bandwidth usage.<br />What I appreciated most about the book was Zeldman's humor and practicality.  For instance, using nested tables to control a unique page design is bad.  You can do the same thing with CSS.  But rather than absolutely declare tables as being bad, he suggests a hybrid approach that may use a basic table for simple layout that would be difficult to do in pure CSS.  Rather than being dogmatic about it, he focuses on what's practical to get the job done.  And the writing style is very humorous and enjoyable.  He definitely writes \\"to the reader\\", and there are plenty of asides and jokes that make the book approachable and \\"real\\", the perfect antithesis to other web design standards books written by \\"experts\\".<br />Conclusion<br />Quite possibly the best web design book I've read, and one that will completely change the way I write web pages.or other devices like PDAs.

666159:US	52517734	R2JZFDDTRCIDSJ	159059326X	831549364	Always Use Protection: A Teen's Guide to Safe Computing	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Great material for teens (and readers of all ages)...	Target Audience<br />Although the title suggests it's for teens who need to know the basics of computer security, it could also be useful to the vast majority of average computer users of all ages.<br />Contents<br />The book is written to cover the basics of computer security (firewalls, antivirus software, privacy, etc.) from the perspective of teens who use the computer in unique ways.  The content is divided into four parts:<br />Part 1 - Protecting Your Machine - Gremlins In Your Machine; When Software Attacks: All About Viruses; From Sneaks To Slammers: How Viruses Get On Your System; The Built-In Doctor: Antivirus Programs; Guardians At The Gate: Firewalls; Locking Up, Part 1: Software Updates; Locking Up, Part 2: System And Application Configuration; Backups: The Most Important Thing You'll Probably Never Do; What To Do When You've Been Hit<br />Part 2 - Protecting Your Privacy - When They Think It's You, But It Isn't: Identity Theft; Passwords: Your Key To The Internet; The Traces You Leave Behind: What Your Machine Says About You; Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You<br />Part 3 - Protecting Yourself - Chat Rooms, Public And Private; Scams<br />Part 4 - Appendixes - Everyday Security; Registry Tricks; A Note For Parents; Index<br />Review<br />\\"The Teen's Guide To Safe Computing\\"...  No, this isn't a moralistic guide to what sites are good and bad for your kid to be visiting.  \\"Always Use Protection\\"...  It's a book on what and how to secure your computer from attacks and scams, written with the unique needs of the teenaged computer user in mind.  But don't let that stop you from reading the book if you're a parent (or even if you don't have kids).  You'll learn plenty.<br />As you can tell from the table of contents, Dan Appleman covers the gamut of issues related to computer security.  You'll learn what viruses are, and how they can get onto your computer in the first place.  By using antivirus software and firewalls, you'll learn how to actively defend against virus attacks.  And by keeping your software up to date, you'll lessen your chances even further of being a victim of the latest virus sweeping the internet.  Appleman also goes into privacy and identity theft on the internet, and what you need to know about not exposing too much information that could be used against you.<br />So why is this written for teens?  The typical teenage computer user fits a different profile than the adult computer user.  There's more use of instant messaging and chat rooms to stay in touch with friends, as well as participation in file-sharing networks and online gaming sites.  These types of computing activities can leave certain pathways open to your computer and make it more susceptible to attack.  Rather than just say \\"don't do that\\" (which would be ignored anyway), the author explains how taking the right precautions can keep your computer from becoming the latest victim, while still participating in activities that you enjoy.  The tone is light, humorous, readable, and non-judgmental, and shouldn't pose an issue to any teen's sensibilities.<br />But quite honestly, you could drop the word \\"teen's\\" from the title, and this would still be an excellent book for the vast majority of average computer users.  Based on how viruses spread so quickly these days, most people are not following the basic information presented in this book.  Unless you're a full-scale computer geek, you'll probably learn something regardless of your age.  For me, the chapter on routers and firewalls was perfect.  I just recently bought a router for my cable internet connection, and now I know how the internals work.  Very nice stuff.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're the parent of teens who are \\"computer active\\", you owe it to yourself and them to get this book.  And while you're at it, you might want to read it yourself.  I guarantee you'll learn something and suffer far fewer virus attacks if you do.d against virus attacks.

This time, Savannah Reid is in the middle of a beauty pageant in Sour Grapes.  Savannah's been asked by a friend to provide security for a teen beauty pageant at a posh winery.  She takes the job, thinking this will be some of the easiest money she's made in awhile.  But one of her sisters shows up nearly unannounced to compete, and one of the contestants turns up missing (and is later found dead).  Savannah now has to figure out if the death was a murder or a suicide, while trying to also keep her sister safe if there's foul play going on...<br />Pretty good plot line with the usual number of twists and turns along the way.  Of all the Savannah Reid novels I've read to date, this one probably has more character development of a sibling than any other.  The story also touches on accepting oneself without trying to fit into society's mold, when Savannah finds out her sister is taking laxatives to maintain a already low weight.<br />Still enjoying the series...	2004-05-15

I'm getting close to being current with this series...  :-)<br />In Peaches And Screams, Savannah Reid heads back to Georgia to be a bridesmaid in another sister's wedding.  But when she arrives, she finds that her youngest brother is being held for the murder of a town judge.  She, like a good sister, doesn't believe he did it, but the signs are not encouraging.  She starts her own investigation to see if she can clear her brother.  Tammi and Dirk arrive from California to help her, and with their assistance she starts to piece together the puzzle of who dun it.<br />There is probably less action in this installment than in any other I've read so far.  Much of the story that doesn't revolve around her investigation explores how her Grandmother is dealing with the lazy leeches that make up most of her siblings.  By the end of the book, Savannah has gotten her to set some new ground rules to avoid being taken advantage of.  She also has to deal with an old flame from her past, who just happens to be the head cop in the town.<br />While a good story, I was probably less enthralled with this one than any of the others.  There just didn't seem to be that sense of urgency about it.	2004-05-15

Target Audience<br />IT professionals who need to learn about the Rational Unified Process (RUP)<br />Contents<br />This book is a relatively high-level overview of the entire RUP process.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters: Software Development Best Practices; The Rational Unified Process; Static Structure: Process Description; Dynamic Structure: Iterative Development; An Architecture-Centric Process; A Use-Case-Driven Process; The Project Management Discipline; The Business Modeling Discipline; The Requirements Discipline; The Analysis and Design Discipline; The Implementation Discipline; The Test Discipline; The Configuration and Change Management Discipline; The Environment Discipline; The Deployment Discipline; Typical Iteration Plans; Implementing the Rational Unified Process; Summary of Roles; Summary of Artifacts; Acronyms; Glossary; Bibliography; Index<br />Review<br />The Rational Unified Process, or RUP, is a software engineering methodology that attempts to map out and document all parts of a software development project.  It's extremely comprehensive, but it's also adaptable to whatever level of effort is appropriate for your situation.  This book, The Rational Unified Process - An Introduction, is a good start to begin your understanding of RUP.<br />First off, let me say this is not an easy read.  It's a good book with all the information you need to know to start using RUP, but the information is dense and highly detail oriented.  Like most developers, I'm more oriented towards coding and testing.  But realistically, you need to know what the system should do before you get to the coding piece.  RUP helps to put all that into a formal framework so that the necessary things will get done in the proper order.<br />While the entire RUP framework might feel overwhelming, the author makes sure to let you know that you can adapt the RUP to meet your situation.  If you are adding a function to an existing system, you will be more focused on use cases, development, and deployment processes.  The author does a good job in segmenting the information so that you can more easily focus on your needs.<br />You should also not consider this the end-all volume on RUP that you will ever need.  Kruchten doesn't try to detail specific techniques like use cases or UML.  You will learn where they fit in to RUP, but you will need additional information on how to implement use cases or UML diagrams.  Consider this the volume that allows you to place everything in a mental framework so that you can figure out what you will need to know going forward.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are considering or in the process of implementing RUP, this is a book you should be studying.  It's not an easy read, but it will give you the overview you need to understand the process and concepts.e cases, development, and deployment processes.

674718:US	52517734	R3TZQ4R6J9IE0Q	1931836655	359953548	Scene of the Cybercrime: Computer Forensics Handbook	Books	5	6	7	N	N	So very good on so many levels...	I'm currently in the middle of the book Scene Of The Cybercrime by Debra Littlejohn Shinder, but I decided to do a review right now.  This is a really good book on a number of levels...<br />Most books on computer and network security are written for the techie trying to secure their assets from outside attack.  Obviously, there's a huge need for that information.  But it seems that there is virtually nothing written from the law enforcement perspective on computer security.  That's a major problem in two ways...  For one, there are too few law enforcement personnel that understand exactly what cybercrime is and how it can be detected, fought, and prosecuted.  That's probably the audience that would benefit most from this book.  Second, most technical personnel don't know what to do in order to successfully build a case and prosecute an attacker once an intrusion has occurred.  That's the other audience that will gain the most from reading Shinder's work.<br />The book includes the following chapters:  Facing the Cybercrime Problem Head On; Reviewing the History of Cybercrime; Understanding the People on the Scene; Understanding Computer Basics; Understanding Network Basics; Understanding Network Intrusions and Attacks; Understanding Cybercrime Prevention; Implementing System Security; Implementing Cybercrime Detection Techniques; Collecting and Preserving Digital Evidence; Building the Cybercrime Case<br />The hardcore network security administrator will probably already know most of the information in the &quot;Understanding...&quot; chapters.  But unless they are adept or experienced in forensic analysis, the last three chapters will be crucial information for them.  Without the knowledge of how to preserve evidence, there's a good chance that you'll never have the satisfaction of seeing your attacker prosecuted.  Higher level managers of a corporate security department will find all of this information useful, as they may not be as hands-on as the administrators and may not understand what threats and risks are present in today's environment.<br />From the law enforcement perspective, it's all good.  Fighting cybercrime is so different than regular law enforcement.  This is the perfect volume to give the budding cybercop all the information they need to get up to speed with how crime is conducted electronically.  I would recommend that this book be required reading for law enforcement and prosecution personnel.<br />The book is well written with plenty of real-life examples of criminal activities and legal scenarios.  It's one of the most engrossing technical reads I've had in awhile.  A definite recommended read...and may not understand what threats and risks are present in today's environment.<br />From the law enforcement perspective, it's all good.

But if you're like me and more into the self-taught method, data structures are one of those things you hear about but never probably take the time to understand.  You may use them, but you don't really understand the theory behind what they are and when they should be used.  For you (and me), Data Structures Demystified helps get you up to speed in a practical, straightforward manner.<br />Each chapter follows a standard format.  The subject (such as linked lists) is likened to some real world situation.  The structure is then explained and illustrated in generic terms using C++ or Java code.  The methods necessary to manipulate the data structure are explained, followed by an implementation in both C++ and Java code.  Finally, there's a short quiz at the end to test your understanding of the concepts just discussed.<br />As a Java programmer, I found this book helpful in conceptually fleshing out some of the array constructs that you can use in the language.  While many reference books might tell you that you have a HashMap class along with certain properties and methods, not too many books actually go into any depth about what a hashmap is and how it should be used.  Having an understanding of these \\"whys\\" can make all the difference when you're trying to decide how best to structure your program.<br />And if you're tending to shy away from this title thinking it would be too simplistic, don't.  This is not an entertainment book that treats you like a newbie.  You'll have to think about what you're reading, and it will take some effort to understand the details.  But it's all presented clearly, so at least you have a chance if you're not Einstein to begin with.<br />Conclusion<br />This book is very good for C++ and Java programmers who have not taken formal courses in data structures, and need a better understanding of the subject.these \\"whys\\" can make all the difference when you're trying to decide how best to structure your program.<br />And if you're tending to shy away from this title thinking it would be too simplistic, don't.

Target Audience<br />Java developers who want to learn to develop graphical applications using the Swing classes<br />Contents<br />This book is part of the Sun tutorial series, and concentrates on the Swing classes of the language.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:  Before You Start; Learning Swing By Example; Using Swing Components; Laying Out Components within a Container; Writing Event Listeners; Performing Custom Painting; Component Reference; Layout Manager Reference; Other Swing Features Reference; Event Listeners References; Troubleshooting Reference; Index<br />Review<br />Most of the coding I do in Java involves background agents that don't involve any sort of a user interface.  But that's not to say that I haven't wanted to put a front end on some of my routines and allow for some user interaction.  In order to do that, I need to learn more about how to use the Java GUI classes.  This book, The JFC Swing Tutorial, is definitely what I need.<br />The book is a nice blend of tutorial and reference guide.  The first six chapters are definitely tutorial in nature, with a number of examples and things you are asked to try and work through.  At the end of each of those chapters, you'll find a series of questions and exercises that will allow you to assess your understanding of the material.  Starting in chapter seven, the book moves more towards a reference manual, but not in the typical \\"here's the documentation\\" format.  Each reference section has a series of \\"How To...\\" topics that give you more detailed information and examples about that feature.  For instance, the formatted text field section has a demo of that feature, instructions on how to work with features in the JFormattedTextField class, and an API chart of the related classes and specific methods in JFormattedTextField.  The blend of information and examples helps you to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical use.<br />The only \\"complaint\\" that one might have about this book is that much of the information can be found online at the Sun Java site.  To that I say, \\"so what?\\"  When I'm looking up a quick answer to something and I don't have my library available to me, online references are great.  But when I'm learning a new skill, give me a book that I can carry around, mark up, and have open in front of me at the keyboard.  It's how I work best.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a very complete and well-written volume on how to use the Swing GUI classes.

O'Reilly has a book out called Digital Photography Expert Techniques by Ken Milburn.  If you're ready to take your digital photography to the next level (close to professional grade), this is a book you'll want to see.<br />First off, the chapter contents:  The Digital Photographer; Be Prepared; Bringing Out The Best Picture; Panoramas; Photoshop Selections, Masks, and Paths; Basic Digital Photo Corrections; Converting Photos to Paintings; Special Photographic Effects; Retouching and Rescuing Photos; Creating Fictitious Photos; Color Printing; Use Pictures to Sell Yourself; Sell It on the Web<br />This book targets the professional, or serious, digital photographer who is using an SLR digital camera with at least six megapixels and plenty of memory.  It also assumes the use of Photoshop as the base editing tool for manipulating the images.  But rather than stick with Photoshop as the only tool, the author will also educate you on other tools or plug-ins that will give spectacular results beyond what you could get by sticking with the base software.  Another target for this book is the film photographer who wants to move to the digital realm, but doesn't quite know how best to set up the workflow of processing images.  Because a digital photograph can take many forms after image enhancement, there are a number of good ideas here to help you know what to save and what to delete.<br />Each chapter is made up of a series of &quot;tips&quot; on how to do something interesting with your images or with your camera.  For instance, in the retouching chapter, you'll find tips with the following titles:  Restore Youth; Remove Stains; Eliminate Junk from the Landscape; Cosmetic Emphasis; Focus the Light on Points of Interest; Punch Out the Paunch; Proboscis Pruning and Changing Expressions; and Clone Detail from Another Photo.  Each tip or technique is well documented as to the steps necessary in the software to accomplish the effect.  He also usually shows before and after full-color comparisons so that you can visually grasp how the effect works and how you can use it in your own work.<br />Now, if you're like me, puttering around in the consumer world of digital cameras, you can still get some great ideas from this book.  The tips on composition, image correction, and other basic skills are valid regardless of what level you're at.  Your final result may not be quite as good as his due to not having an original image of the same resolution, but you can still end up with some stunning shots that will wow your friends.<br />Bottom line...  quality information, well written, beautiful book that should be considered by any serious digital photographer.l-color comparisons so that you can visually grasp how the effect works and how you can use it in your own work.<br />Now, if you're like me, puttering around in the consumer world of digital cameras, you can still get some great ideas from this book.

Target Audience<br />Anyone with an interest in network security and wants to look into the mind of a network cracker/hacker.<br />Contents<br />This book is mostly a series of fictional stories written in first-person narrative on what happens during a network attack or an investigation into an attack.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:  Hide And Seek; The Worm Turns; Just Another Day At The Office; h3X's Adventures In Networkland; The Thief No One Saw; Flying The Friendly Skies; dis-card; Social (in)Security; BabelNet; The Art Of Tracking; The Laws Of Security<br />Review<br />All too often the topic of network security becomes an academic exercise, until it's too late.  Companies might know what they should do, and they might even think they are beyond attack.  But to a motivated person, your system may be nothing more than swiss cheese.  Stealing The Network takes you beyond the technical and into the psychology of an attack.<br />Stealing The Network is a series of fictional stories about network attacks of various sorts.  Hide And Seek is an attack on a company's network by a person upset with poor customer service.  He steals a credit card file and posts it for others to use.  The Worm Turns is an all-night hacking session to dissect the latest internet virus and post a patch before any of the other anti-virus firms do so.  Just Another Day At The Office is a story of hacking for organized crime against a firm developing a new type of land mine, and involves both network and physical building intrusion.  While it might be easy to dismiss these as the result of a vivid imagination, the reality is that all of these attacks are done on a daily basis.  They may even have happened to you at your company, and you just don't know it yet.<br />The final chapter, The Laws Of Security, is a discussion of computer security and how you need to be thinking in order to secure your network.  So it's not just a series of stories with no opportunities to learn what needs to be done.  Also, each story is detailed with specific software and techniques used to accomplish the hack or the trackdown of the intruder.  So as you're reading the story, you're actually picking up the necessary information you need in order to understand the network weakness and how to defend against it.<br />In my opinion, it's this blending of fictional reality that makes this book so valuable.  I'd definitely recommend this to any security professional who is looking to understand the person behind the attacks.<br />Conclusion<br />An excellent read...  Takes the subject of network security out of the academic and theoretical and places a face and attitude behind it all, while also teaching you the nuts and bolts of how attacks occur.at needs to be done.  Also, each story is detailed with specific software and techniques used to accomplish the hack or the trackdown of the intruder.

I'd definitely recommend this to any security professional who is looking to understand the person behind the attacks.<br />Conclusion<BR>An excellent read...  Takes the subject of network security out of the academic and theoretical and places a face and attitude behind it all, while also teaching you the nuts and bolts of how attacks occur.	2004-05-07

Another Savannah Reid mystery...  Sugar And Spite.  And I'm still liking this series a lot...<br />Savannah's ex-partner on the force, Dirk, is called by his ex-wife Polly (who Savannah can't stand) in what looks like a kiss and make up attempt.  But Savannah gets a call from Dirk that turns their world upside down.  Polly is dead, shot in Dirk's trailer, with Dirk's sidearm, her blood is all over Dirk, and neighbors heard them fighting before the gunshots.  He says he came out of the shower to find someone there who had just shot Polly, but was unable to grab him before the intruder escaped.  The chief of police seems to have it out for Dirk, and pushes hard to bring him up on murder charges.  Savannah and the members and friends of her detective agency have to figure out who really did it and save Dirk from a lifetime of jail or worse.<br />The subplot here involves why the chief might want to have Dirk out of the picture, and what he may know about the crime.  There is also a Savannah family subline (as there are in all the stories) that didn't work quite as well as the ones in the other stories.  Her father who deserted the family when she was young has shown back up and wants to talk with her.<br />Fun read, good pacing, and some excellent themes of friendship, love, and loyalty.  Probably one of the more emotionally satisfying stories I've read to date in this series.	2004-05-07

Target Audience<br />Developers who want to start using JavaServer Faces (JSF) technology for their web applications<br />Contents<br />This is a comprehensive tutorial on the JSF technology, how it works, and how to code an application using it.<br />The book has the following chapters:  Overview Of Java Web Technologies; Introduction To JavaServer Faces; Objects For Request Processing; The User Interface Component Model; JSF Simple Components; JSF Advanced Components; JSF Event Handling; Page Navigation; Validators; Converters; Internationalization And Localization; Renderers; Custom User Interface Components; Online Store Application; The Application Configuration File; Summing Up: How JSF Works; The JSP 2.0 Expression Language; The JSP Standard Tag Library; Installing And Configuring Tomcat 5; The Web Application Deployment Descriptor<br />Review<br />JavaServer Faces technology is gaining steam in the Java community as a standard framework for building web applications, much like Struts has become.  If this is a primary part of your development activity, you'll need to get up to speed on how JSF works.  This book will help you get started.<br />Budi starts by reviewing servlet and javaserver page concepts, which is what JSF is based on.  Once that area is reviewed, he starts with the basics of JSF coding and gives you plenty of examples of how they are coded.  To me, the writing style and examples are clear and appropriate for someone just starting out in this area. The chapters build on each other and it all comes together in chapter 14 where an entire online application is built.  After working your way through the book, you should have a basic mastery of the technology.<br />With a little additional research, I found that there is a later release of the technology (JSF beta 1) that supercedes the release on which this book was written (JSF Early Access 4).  Not yet being a JSF wizard, I can't tell you how much of a difference that will make in the accuracy of the information presented.  The author has updated the examples on his web site to work with the beta 1 version, so be prepared for some of the examples to work a little differently than what you see in print.  Unfortunately that's one of the drawbacks in trying to get a book in print about a technology who's foundational concepts are still in development.  That's probably why they call it the \\"bleeding edge of technology\\".<br />Conclusion<br />I thought this was a well-written, understandable book on an emerging technology.  Just keep in mind that what you currently read and what may be in the final release could change.e information presented.

To say I am &quot;graphically challenged&quot; would be an understatement.  For whatever reason, I just have a hard time envisioning what I can do with images and colors.  To help solve that issue, I got a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS one-on-one by Deke McClelland.  In short, this book is packed.<br />The book is organized into the following 12 lessons:  Open and Organize; Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows; Correcting Color Balance; Making Selections; Crop, Straighten, and Size; Paint, Edit, and Heal; Creating and Applying Masks; Adjusting Focus; Building Layered Compositions; Text and Shapes; Layer Styles and Adjustments; and Printing and Output.<br />Each lesson starts out with an &quot;About This Lesson&quot; page, which gives you an idea of what you're going to cover.  It ends with a &quot;What Did You Learn?&quot; exercise where you match the concept with the description.  And in between is the excellent material on how to do what it is that's being covered.  Interspersed throughout the text are &quot;Pearls Of Wisdom&quot; which are short 5 to 10 line sidebars that explain a concept or a slant on the material that you may not have realized.  And McClelland doesn't just explain how to do things, either.  He goes into the concepts behind how graphics and color work, such as how to read a histogram or the difference between 8 vs. 16 bits per channel.  So when you get done with the book, you should have a greater understanding and appreciation for the art of graphical manipulation.<br />But you're not done yet.  The book comes with a CD that includes video lessons that follow along with the book, as well as the files you'll need to do the exercises.  Unlike most CDs that are included in a book, this is one that actually enhances the value of the material instead of just allowing the publisher or author to charge more for stuff you may never look at.<br />On the aesthetic side of things, the book is really stunning.  High-quality paper and beautiful colors on the examples.  The only flaw I can mention is that my copy must have gotten a bad batch of paper at the printers.  A small number of pages are flawed (ingrained folds) and a couple of the graphic screen shots are blurred to the point of not being able to read the text.  Even with that, there is nothing that takes away from the usefulness and quality of this effort.<br />If you use Photoshop and want to learn how to utilize it to the fullest, you owe it to yourself to check out this book.mples.

Yes, I *do* read classics once in a while...  :-)  Our local library was sponsoring a program called &quot;Everyone Reads&quot; where a number of people all read the same book and have discussions about it.  Fahrenheit 451 was the featured book, and I've been meaning to reread it anyway.  You probably already know the storyline...  Reading books is a banned activity, and firemen are not used to put out fires, but to burn down houses where books are being covertly hidden.  Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns, hence the title.  The main character, Montag, starts to wonder why people would still risk having books, and ends up becoming a book hoarder himself.  His house is burned down, and he flees before he can be arrested.  He meets up with other readers in the countryside and decides to remember and preserve books rather than return to the city, which, by the way, just got anniliated by atomic warfare...<br />This isn't so much a novel as a longer short story critiquing society's ever-decreasing attention span and lack of time spent actually thinking.  Everything is based on entertainment, and ideas and concepts are spoonfed to the public in short, repeated soundbites.  Sound disturbingly familiar?  I found it amazing that, 50 years after having written the book, Bradbury's view of the future isn't that far removed from reality.  We don't burn down houses with books, but we try to censor ideas and make everything &quot;politically correct&quot; so that no one is offended.<br />This particular paperback edition is the 50th anniversary edition of the book, and features an interview with the writer at the end.  He also expounds on what the characters in the book would say and do now if the book were to be expanded.<br />Well worth reading (or reading again if you haven't done so lately).	2004-05-02

And fortunately for me, the Linux desktop has evolved to the place where you can use it much like a Windows environment.  But like earlier versions of Windows, there is a lot of power if you delve under the graphic layer of the operating system.  In Windows, that was DOS.  With the Linux, it's the command line interface.  If you don't know where to start when you get there, Teach Yourself Unix In 24 Hours will get you off on the right foot.<br />Dave Taylor takes you through a hands-on approach to the basics of maneuvering and manipulating a Unix-style operating system.  By working through the examples and exercises, you'll start to grasp the commands that are needed to do the basics.  From there, you learn how to string commands together to create scripts that will automate many of your tasks.  And that's where the real power starts to come into play.  You'll also learn about permissions and ownership of files and directories, which you'll run into with many other systems you may work with during the course of your job.<br />I found this book useful on a number of levels.  First of all, it helped me to understand some of the Unix concepts I need to know when I'm working with other departments that use Unix as their base platform.  It's also giving me the fundamental knowledge I'll need when I start with my Linux work.  Even though I'll be doing a lot of work at the graphical layer, I want to be able to feel confident to go beyond that when I need to.  Until I get beyond the basics, this book will stay close at hand in order to figure out what I just did or what I just broke.  :-)<br />Conclusion<br />This is an ideal text for someone who has to work with Unix and doesn't have much, if any, prior experience.

And once that happens, you need to know who is asking for the data and whether they should be allowed to see it.  You need to start understanding how security works in the Java world.  And Enterprise Java Security is a good place to start gaining that knowledge.<br />The authors cover a lot of different concepts and technologies in this book.  While nearly any of the subjects (like cryptography or web services security) could be expanded into a book in its own right, enough information is provided to give you the concepts necessary to grasp the essentials.  From there, you can continue in your learning for the areas that apply to your situation.

But somewhere along the way, you do something that is not quite what the program expected.  Maybe you entered an incorrect date or missed a required field.  Your joy quickly disappears as the site makes you jump through a number of hoops to correct the data or get back on track.  They end up losing a customer without even knowing it.  If you're a web developer, this is a critical issue for you, and the book Defensive Design for the Web is what you need to start correcting these issues.<br />The authors present 40 guidelines that cover different aspects of defensive design, or contingency design as they call it.  Some are pretty basic, such as \\"Always identify errors the same way\\".  Others require a bit more thought in the coding of the site, such as \\"Assist form dropouts by saving information\\".  But instead of just stating the guideline and moving on, they take it a step further.  Using familiar and popular web sites, they provide \\"thumbs up\\" and \\"thumbs down\\" examples of each guideline.  By seeing the guidelines actually applied in real-life, you are much more likely to understand the problems associated with it.  I know if my site was used as a \\"thumbs down\\" example, I'd be motivated to get it fixed post haste.<br />At the end of the book, there is a contingency test you can apply to your site.  You start by taking the test yourself as a baseline.  After you think you've cleaned up the site, then have some real visitors use the site and take the test.  If you can do well in both these scenarios, then your site is better off than most others out there.  You're probably also seeing a high rate of repeat traffic.<br />The book is easy to read, but you'll most likely return to the guidelines over and over.  This is a book that is going to be no more than an arms-length away.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a \\"must have\\" if you develop web sites.

Target Audience<br />Portal developers and administrators who are responsible for the installation and maintenance of WebSphere portal server.<br />Contents<br />This is a tutorial guide on how to install and configure WebSphere Portal, as well as how portlets are developed.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:<br />Enter The Portal; A Portal Blueprint; Putting Up The Doorway; Customizing The Portal; Building Blocks; Personalizing The Portal; Portal Gatekeeper; Portal And Beyond; Portal Crossing; Installation Planning Worksheet; Jlog Properties File; Portal Related Web Sites<br />Review<br />IBM is pushing the concept of the portal very hard, and their portal branding falls under the WebSphere umbrella.  But unlike installing Notes/Domino or Microsoft Office, trying to get WebSphere Portal (WP) up and running is not a trivial task.  Things have to be done in a certain order with certain settings.  And then once that is done, you have to start configuring the portal environment with the portlets you want to use.  This book can help guide you through that whole process.<br />First, the good things...  There's a good blend between background material on the J2EE technology involved and the \\"hands-on\\" tasks, such as installation and configuration.  The screen shots and step-by-step writing is very well done, and you should be able to get up to speed quickly.  I wish I had access to this book when I first started exploring WP a year or so ago.  It would have saved me a lot of time and aimless wandering.<br />Now the not-so-good thing...  Since IBM is banking on WP being the next significant business platform, they are enhancing and simplifying the software on an aggressive schedule.  As a result, the current version of WP has gone beyond the version used for this tutorial.  Normally that wouldn't be deadly to a book like this, but in this case it may be.  The install process has been improved, as well as the administration process.  If the user is trying to follow along using the WP 5.x software, there won't be a lot of matches.  That could prove frustrating to the beginning WP administrator.<br />Even with the version issue, I'd still recommend this as a good secondary book to add to your portal bookshelf.  There are still many basic principles that apply to version 5, such as the portlet development concepts, theming, and some of the out-of-the box portlets you can download and use for free.<br />Conclusion<br />The main drawback to this book is that WebSphere Portal is now up to version 5.x, and the book covers version 4.1.  Since WP 5 is significantly improved over 4.x, you may not get as much out of this book as you'd like.  But the basic information and explanations are solid and informative.llow along using the WP 5.x software, there won't be a lot of matches.

Target Audience<br />Individuals who are interested in searching out wireless access points and defending their own wireless networks against unauthorized use.<br />Contents<br />This book covers the subject of wardriving (searching for wireless networks) and securing your wireless network.  The chapters include:<br />Learning To WarDrive; NetStumbler and MiniStumbler: Overview; Operating NetStumbler and MiniStumbler; Installing Kismet in Slackware Linux 9.1; Installing Kismet in Fedora Core 1; Attacking Wireless Networks; Basic Wireless Network Security; Advanced Wireless Network Security; Index<br />Review<br />The hacking concept of exploring technology is something that has always appealed to me.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I don't spend time cracking networks and breaking into things.  It's more of a fascination of \\"what's out there\\".  And of course, with the advent of wireless networks and the affordability of the hardware, there is a lot more \\"out there\\" out there!  That's where the concept of wardriving comes in...  Surfing the airwaves to see what networks exist.  This book will teach you what you need to know to join in this phenomenon.<br />In many ways, this book is a guide to running some common wardriving software.  Once the hardware needs are covered in the opening chapter, the authors start to go into packages such as Kismet, NetStumbler, and MiniStumbler.  They do cover software for both Linux and Windows, so you can benefit regardless of what OS you prefer.  Interspersed throughout the book is the technical details that will fill in the gaps to the basic \\"how to\\" information.  Examples of this type of detail are sidebars on active vs. passive WLAN detection, disabling the broadcast beacon, and troubleshooting GPS problems.  Once you get the software installed, you'll learn how to map your results for future reference.<br />The book is also beneficial if you're a network administrator.  There is substantial information on how to take steps to make your network less susceptible to discovery and intrusion, as well as what you need to do to improve the encryption capabilities of your network.  It is somewhat disturbing to see how many wireless networks are set up with default level access and no encryption.  The authors take great pains to distinguish between the discovery of access points and the actual use of them.  So while you may think that they are advocating illegal activity, they are actually making sure that you can be a wardriver without breaking any laws.<br />While generally I like the book, there is something that irritates me about it.  They use a lot of screen shots related to the installing and operation of the different software packages.  While that might be useful for installing the Linux software if you're not a penguin-head, it borders on overkill for Windows software.  I really don't need to see screenshots to know to press Next after the install splash screen and the directory location.  Once you're running and configuring the software, that's different.  It's a minor point in the overall quality of the book, however.<br />Conclusion<br />If the concept of wardriving is something that appeals to you, this is a good one-stop book to get started.  Furthermore, if you run or are responsible for maintaining a wireless network, you'll need to know this information in order to secure your network against unauthorized access.work less susceptible to discovery and intrusion, as well as what you need to do to improve the encryption capabilities of your network.

In the last couple of days, I finished Cereal Killer by G. A. McKevett.  This is part of a series (a Savannah Reid mystery), and I can see myself going back and getting caught up with this author.  A fun read...<br />Savannah is a private detective who used to be a cop.  Her former partner (Dirk) is still in the force, and they often collaborate on cases.  She's a southern belle who packs a few extra pounds and enjoys her food.  Dirk is a grump who shares her love of food and is always looking for a free meal.  In this episode, Dirk is called to investigate the death of a plus-size model who Savannah has admired.  It looks to be a case of heat stroke from too little food and unhealthy attempts at weight loss.  This is because she signed a contract to lose weight eating a particular breakfast cereal, and she's not where she needs to be.  Things then get a little suspious when another plus-size model with the same contract also dies in a hit-and-run accident that isn't what it seems.  Savannah goes undercover as a model to try and help Dirk crack the case.  And to add some subplot and color, Savannah's loud and man-crazy sister shows up from Georgia to meet a man she met over the internet, and then goes to pieces when the guy dumps her after the first night.<br />I'll admit a fondness for the female detective genre, but I was plesantly surprised with this one.  The characters are colorful, and all of the main players have flaws that make them less than perfect but oh so real.  I loved the interplay between Savannah and her sister, where southern speech patterns and sayings all come to the surface.  The story line strings you along and doesn't reveal the killers until the end.  The author also does a good job in examining some of the preconceptions about the size of a person and how it often is connected to their feelings of self-worth.<br />A light, enjoyable story , and extra special if you're just discovering this author.  Expect a few more reviews on her titles in the very near future.ra special if you're just discovering this author.  Expect a few more reviews on her titles in the very near future.	2004-04-27

While I was in the emergency room with my son yesterday, I pretty much started and finished the book 3rd Degree by James Patterson and Andrew Gross.  This is the latest installment of his Women's Murder Club series, and it was an enjoyable read.<br />Detective Lindsey Boxer is jogging along one day when the house she passes literally blows up.  She rushes in to save a child, but three other adults die in the fire.  She quickly determines that it was not an accident, and the killer(s?) has left a manifesto demanding the reform of corporate greed.  Shortly after that explosion, another prominent businessman dies by a massive overdose of rictin, and the city knows a terrorist organization is on the loose.  They threaten a G3 economic summit meeting in San Francisco in a week unless their demands are met.  The race is then on to find out who the killers are, and what motivation they have for what they are doing.  The subplots involve (among other things) Lindsey's budding romantic involvement with the deputy director of Homeland Security who is also on this case.<br />Fast-paced writing, with really short chapters which keep you thinking &quot;just one more chapter, then I'll put it away&quot;.  Plenty of character development, and he makes some good points on how the &quot;have nots&quot; of society are ignored and exploited by the &quot;haves&quot;.  While you quickly learn who some of the killers are, you are kept in the dark about motives until the end.  Good stuff.  I also find it interesting how Patterson (a white guy) writes novels with main characters who are black (Alex Cross) and female (Lindsey Boxer).  Not often that you see a writer go cross-cultural AND cross-gender.	2004-04-26

After thoroughly enjoying Mumbo Gumbo, I looked forward to reading Jerrilyn Farmer's latest Madeline Bean novel, Perfect Sax.  And I can say it was worth the wait.  Lots of stuff going on in this book...<br />Madeline Bean has just finished putting on a catered event for a charitable group, and she's ready to go home and collapse.  Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.  She finds some personal papers of a neighbor in her driveway and finds the person at the event.  When she tries to tell him that she has them, he thinks that she is trying to blackmail him.  His girlfriend also goes off the deep end on Maddie.  A rare and expensive saxaphone which had a $100K bid turns up missing when people go to claim their winnings after the event.  On her co-worker's request after the event, she loans her jeep to an employee for an emergency, but the employee turns up in Maddie's bedroom that night shot to death.  When the neighbor whose papers she found also turns up murdered, she starts wondering if she's next.  A number of people in her life could well be the killer and/or be involved in the theft, and she's not real sure who to trust.  To make it worse, she's falling hard for this guy who might be involved, and she's still not sure how she feels about her ex-boyfriend cop who wasn't quite yet divorce from his wife.<br />Much like Mumbo Gumbo, the plot twists keep you guessing, and you don't get complete resolution until the end.  Maddie's an extremely likeable character, and you easily identify with her as she's trying to stay alive and not lose her sanity.  While her personal life is still up in the air at the end of the book, there is plenty of room to run with it in the next installment.  Good read, and good job by the author.	2004-04-26

I finished Angels And Demons by Dan Brown the other night.  This book rocks as a recreational read!  This is by the same author as The DaVinci Code, and it looks like it was a previous work that was re-released after the success of Code.<br />Symbologist Robert Langdon gets an early morning call from a person in Switzerland claiming to have a dead body with an Illuminati brand on his chest.  The caller turns out to be the head of CERN, and he's concerned about the Illuminati cult that everyone thought was dead.  Langdon ends up in Switzerland to lend his expertise in the symbol, and from there is rushed to the Vatican when a massive explosive anti-matter device is stolen from CERN and is set to blow up the ancient seat of the Catholic church.  A dead pope, kidnapped cardinals turning up branded and dead, an ancient secret society that everyone thought was extinct, and a countdown to finding and stopping the explosion.  On top of that, the plot starts twisting at breakneck speed in the last 100 pages.<br />This is a book I could have easily plowed straight through and been perfectly happy in doing so.  The pace of the story never slowed down, and the turns at the end weren't quite what I expected them to be.  I wasn't highly thrilled with The DaVinci Code, as it went off in some theological directions I didn't care much for.  And I also felt it was the author espousing his beliefs in novel form and pounding the reader over the head about them repeatedly.  This book is more a crime/conspiracy novel set in the Vatican, but not so heavy on alternative theology.<br />Definitely one of the better recreational reads of late...	2004-04-22

So what's a blogger who doesn't use that software doing reviewing a book like that?  It's always good to know what else is out there, and Rogers has done a really good job creating a guide to get you going.<br />The book is divided into four parts with the following chapters:  Tuning in to Radio Userland; Publishing a Weblog; Enhancing a Weblog; Reading RSS Newsfeeds with the News Aggregator; Upstreaming Files to a Web Server; Designing a Weblog Theme; Calling Scripts to Create Weblog Content; Creating Outlines; Backing Up Data; Exploring the Object Database; Creating New Tables and Other Data; Editing a New Script; Writing Statements and Calling Verbs; Reading and Writing to the Database; Using Variables and Arrays; Working with Loops and Conditionals; Developing Web Services with XML-RPC; Sending and Receiving Email; Handling Errors and Debugging Scripts; Creating and Distributing Tools; RSS; OPML; XML; XML-RPC; Index<br />The book opened my eyes to the fact that Radio Userland isn't just &quot;blogging software&quot;, but is in reality a development environment for content management.  It edits your content, aggregates news feeds from other sources, and publishes the content to your hosting service.  It also does scripting for building specialized tools to work with your content.  Rogers' examples are easy to follow, and help you to understand exactly what types of tasks you can build on your own.  Regardless of whether you're a blogger who can't program or a techno-guru who wants to start sharing thoughts, you should be able to benefit from this book.<br />The statement is made that Radio Userland has no official documentation manual and that the author hopes that you'll consider this book the next best thing.  Based on what I see here, I would agree with him.	2004-04-18

Margolin is another one of my &quot;must read&quot; authors, and I look forward to each new novel from him.  And once again, I was not disappointed.<br />The author actually tells two stories by jumping between past and present, and allows them both to meet up at the end.  Ashley Spencer is a teenager who's father and best friend are murdered by a serial killer, and she narrowly escapes.  After it appears she is getting her life back on track, her mother is murdered by the same person.  That's the story that occurs in the past.  The current story is being told by a writer who's sister was put into a coma by the same attack that killed Ashley's mother.  He wrote the story as a tribute to his sister, and he's added some new chapters after the killer was captured five years after the attacks.  That is occurring in the present, and that's about as much of the plotline that I'll reveal here, as a number of twists and turns start happening that definitely keep you guessing as to the outcome of it all.<br />The writing is tight and emotional, and you get to know the characters very well without a loss of action.  He throws in a number of well-timed plot turns that alter the entire direction of the story and how you view the players.  I'll admit to a bias here as the writer is from Portland, Oregon and his stories all take place in the local area.  It's enjoyable to read stories where you can vividly put yourself at the exact location where the action is occurring.<br />Great read, great story, and I highly recommend this one.	2004-04-17

Target Audience<br />Anyone who is an internet user and hasn't thought about protecting their identity.<br />Contents<br />This book outlines the issues involved in protecting your identity in an online environment, along with giving practical suggestions on how to do so.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:  Identity Theft: Are You At Risk?; Protecting Your Hard Drive; Keeping Your Email Private; Self-Defense On The Web; Connecting To The Internet Safely; Are Your Kids Putting You At Risk?; If You Become A Victim; Configuring Your Browser And Firewall; Index<br />Review<br />If you're a long-time techno-geek, you've no doubt been aware of the risks of exposing your identity on the Internet.  You make sure credit cards are only used over encrypted links, you don't fall for phishing scams, and so on.  But as more people have started to go online over the years, the incidents of computer crime and identity theft have risen dramatically.  To combat your exposure to those scams, you should read Hack Proofing Your Identity In The Information Age.<br />The typical computer user will pick up quite a bit from this book.  The first chapter will introduce the concept of identity theft and how easy it is for someone to glean information from you and use it to open credit accounts.  There is also information here on how to avoid theft by non-electronic methods, such as securing your mail and cell phone.  Subsequent chapters go more into detail on specific areas, such as email and web browsing.  While the authors rightly state that it is impossible to completely protect yourself against a determined attacker, reading and implementing the material that you find in this book will significantly decrease your chances of becoming a victim.<br />To the techno-geek who's been living in the computer age for a long time, you will undoubtedly know most of this information.  Even so, it's not assured that you will never become a victim.  The chapter titled If You Become A Victim is a good reference on what steps to take once you determine that you've been targeted.  Since it can be a stressful experience to clean up the damage, the convenience of having all the steps spelled out for you can be a lifesaver.<br />Conclusion<br />A good book for people who have never considered the risks of identity theft as they surf the internet, as well as for someone who is trying to clean up the damage once the theft occurs.is a good reference on what steps to take once you determine that you've been targeted.

Being a Disney nut, I'll read just about anything that talks about the Disney corporation and culture.  I found Understanding Disney at the library and eagerly picked it up.  What a waste...<br />I should have been clued in on page 5 with this statement:  \\"The continued expansion and popularity of the Disney empire calls for the deliberate integration of political economic analysis with insights drawn from cultural analysis and audience studies or reception analysis, or, in other words, analysis emphasizing the economic as well as the ideological, or production as well as consumption.\\"<br />Huh?<br />She teaches a class at the University of Oregon on this stuff.  Very academic and abstract, and too much so for my liking.  While there were some interesting factoids about Walt's true history vs. the story told by Disney, she went into pure academia all too often.  An example, labeled \\"Psychoanalysis And Pinocchio\\":  \\"Brody observes the anal images and incorporation themes have been common in Disney tales, citing examples from The Three Little Pigs and Peter Pan.  Anal images, especially featuring the \\"often-kick-in-the-butt\\" Jiminy Cricket, are a rampant in Pinocchio as images of erection (Pinocchio's nose, the donkey ears), and incorporation is appearnt in the scenes of Pinocchio and Gepetto in the whale's stomach.\\"<br />Please!!!!  You have *got* to be kidding me...  She even covers Marxist analysis and the imperialist Disney.  And kids pay to take this class?	2004-04-15

In order to have the information I need to do my job, I got a copy of this book and I'm glad I did.<br />Meyer does a nice job in balancing the material between code examples, reference to cover all the parameters, and example output to show what the code will do.  I think the last part is very important, as it allows you to visualize the type of effects a certain command will have, and from there you can start to apply it to your own web site.  I am undecided as to whether this would make a good first tutorial for someone just learning CSS.  For me, it's a better reference guide once you have some basic CSS understanding.<br />There is one formatting decision that the author made in the second edition that some might find irritating.  He decided that to keep the book from growing too large, the information about which browsers support which features would be dropped from the print version.  You can get that information from the online web site, so it's not like you're left in the cold.  But if that information is important to you and you want one-stop reading, this book might not be what you want.<br />Conclusion<br />A solid reference manual on CSS that you will use for coding examples, parameter reference, and visual examples of the effects you can obtain.tion is important to you and you want one-stop reading, this book might not be what you want. <br />Conclusion<BR>A solid reference manual on CSS that you will use for coding examples, parameter reference, and visual examples of the effects you can obtain.	2004-04-15

I got on the library hold list pretty early for the book Glorious Appearing by LaHaye and Jenkins.  This is the 12th and final book in the Left Behind series, a Christian historical novel based on end-time biblical prophecies.  If you've read the entire series up to now, you should enjoy the conclusion as laid out in this book.  Well done, and a vivid portrayal of how events could play out during that time.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the series a lot.  I did think that the series could have been cut down to eight or nine volumes without losing much in the story.  The middle volumes tended to just mark time with not a lot of story advancement.  Still, one of the best novel treatments of pre-tribulation rapture theology.	2004-04-14

I finished a fun read a week or so ago.  It was Mumbo Gumbo by Jerrilyn Farmer.  Farmer's books involve a caterer named Madeline Bean who finds herself involved in crime mysteries not of her own choosing.  In Mumbo Gumbo, she is called on to do some writing for the final episode of a hit show called Food Freak when the head writer disappears.  No one knows where he took off to, but the people who write, produce, and star on the show all seem to have something to hide when it comes to his disappearance.  Bean's cop boyfriend is working on some serial killings that appear to be drug-related, and the two stories start to intertwine when a body is found in an arson fire of the head writer's home.  I'll stop there to avoid giving away any more of the plot...<br />The writing is well done and the dialog is fun.  The story seemed to get a little muddled in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's because it really was or if it was taking me some time to finish the book and I lost continuity.  Regardless, readers of the amateur female detective genre will enjoy this book.	2004-04-13

This is a book I've looked forward to for a long time, and I wasn't disappointed.  The Bookman's Promise by John Dunning is a continuation of the Cliff Janeway series, and I really wish this guy would write more.  Very good stories...<br />Cliff Janeway is an ex-cop who left the force after an excessive force incident, and he decided to open a book store specializing in rare and collectible books.  Dunning is an actual bookseller, and you can tell he knows the field well.  Janeway decides to buy a $30K volume by Richard Burton (the explorer) and is contacted by an elderly lady who claims to be related to someone who knew Burton well.  There is also rumor of a journal that Burton kept during a time period before the Civil War, and it could shed light on how the war actually started.  She claims that a large collection of the Burton works were stolen from her when her uncle died, and Janeway promises to try and uncover what may have happened to them.  She dies shortly after he makes the promise, and he can't let it go.  The search leads to the seedy side of the book-selling world, and soon Janeway has made a few enemies who want him dead.  He has to balance his promise against trying to stay alive and not cause any injury to the people surrounding him.<br />As a crime/mystery novel, the story is good.  Janeway is an interesting character, and you quickly become wrapped up in his quest.  For me, the element that makes it a special read is the backdrop of book selling.  I love books, and I love reading.  I can identify with the search for that hidden treasure and how it feels to hold a unique volume in your hands.  If you love books, Dunning will quickly become a favorite author.	2004-04-13

My wife was in Chicago recently for a quilt show, and she picked up a book for me while she was there.  It's called Skyscrapers by Judith Dupre, and it's an interesting coffee table book.<br />To start with, the size of the book is unique.  To emphasize the &quot;tallness&quot; of the subject matter, the book measures 18 inches by 8 inches.  It definitely doesn't fit on a bookshelf too well.  Each two page combination in the book examines one of the world's tallest or most unique skyscrapers.  The photography is well done, and the description and history of the buildings is often interesting.  If you're an architect or someone who appreciates the art of structures, you'll think this book is wonderful.  The only fault I can find with it (and it's more me than the book) is that the author tends to wax lyrical about artistic details and concepts that sometimes go a bit overboard.  I guess I'm not &quot;in touch&quot; with my inner self...  I found myself thinking &quot;It's a building!  Get over it!&quot; more than once.	2004-04-07

There is everything from simplistic guides to the person building their first web page, to in-depth guide for the professional web developers, to detailed reference guides that document every feature.  On that scale of coverage, this book falls somewhere on the lower end of the scale.  That's not a bad thing...  It's just good to know what the target audience is.<br />The tone of the author's writing is conversational and a little quirky.  He uses a number of examples in each chapter to illustrate the subject matter, and they illustrate the points well.  Each example is dissected so that the reader can follow along and understand what each line is doing.

Why use a mouse and a graphical interface if you can do it all via the keyboard and arcane system commands?  If that appeals to you and describes your world, then this book will appeal to you.<br />Now, before I say anything else, there's one thing that the reader should know.  This book was written in 2001, and I'll assume that the richness of the desktop graphical interfaces was not available back then.  The book seems to be written from the assumption that the command line is the only game in town.  The author makes a statement in the opening where he says this book will show \\"everyday users - artists, designers, businessmen, scholars, or scientists\\" how to use the tools and applications.  I'm here to tell you...  the average \\"user\\" he targets isn't in this group.  You show me a typical accounting supervisor who will use a command line interface, and I'll admit I'm in error.  But it isn't going to happen...<br />The book is written in \\"recipe\\" format.  Each example is numbered, and any other special handling instructions are included up front (like additional packages to download).

Target Audience<br />Users of Linux desktop environments who need to learn the basic tools that are equivalents of Windows software.<br />Contents<br />This is a highly illustrated, detailed explanation of the basic programs and utilities found on a typical Linux desktop environment.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:<br />Introduction; Learning About The Pieces; Logging In and Moving Around; Managing Files; Getting Organized; The OpenOffice Suite; Alternative Office Software; Working with Graphics; More on Graphics: The GIMP; Communication: Working with Email, Usenet News, and Faxes; Accessing the Web; Customizing Your Desktop; Making Job Backups; Using The Command Line; OpenOffice Default Key Bindings/Keyboard Shortcuts; What Does What: Matching Your Task with the Appropriate Program; Creating and Maintaining a GPG Key for KMail; Index<br />Review<br />When I first looked at Linux way too many years ago, it was nothing more than a DOS style operating system that required a fair amount of geekiness to use.  For various reasons, my experimentation with it didn't go much further.  I recently gave it another shot and was blown away by how far it's come and how close to a Windows environment you can get.  But what Linux programs do what when it comes to normal day-to-day activities?  This is where Linux In The Workplace comes in.<br />This is not a book on how to download and install a Linux system.  To get that type of information, you'll need to check out some other title.  But once you get your Linux system set up, you'll need to know how the desktop works, how to find files, how to create a document, etc.  Using the KDE graphical interface, the authors show you the commands and menu options available to you.  You'll quickly find that there is a matching Linux process to do just about everything you would do in Windows.  Once you're comfortable with the desktop interface, they then start to examine different productivity tools, such as OpenOffice.  You will quickly find that you can, once again, do just about anything in OpenOffice that you would need to do in Microsoft Office.<br />There is a chapter towards the end that gets into the command line interface that is part of Linux.  Power users will find this useful to see what they might be able to do if they want to push their knowledge.  True geeks will definitely want to find another title that goes into command line information in depth if that's what their next step will be.  And average users can bypass this information with no problems.<br />The authors have successfully (in my opinion) walked the line in the amount of information they convey in the book.  They don't try to tell you absolutely everything there is to know about a utility, but they do give you enough information that you can effectively use it right away.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're looking to try out a Linux desktop to replace your Windows operating system, and you need help understand what the different utilities and programs are, this is a perfect book to help you make that jump.u will quickly find that you can, once again, do just about anything in OpenOffice that you would need to do in Microsoft Office.<br />There is a chapter towards the end that gets into the command line interface that is part of Linux.

Although I'm not to the point with Grisham as I am with Patricia Corwell's Kay Scarpetta series, I'm getting a little burned out on uneven writing.  I finished The Last Juror, Grisham's latest novel, and I can't say I liked it as much as I thought I would.  The jacket cover led me to believe this was an action novel focused on revenge.  The novel takes place in the 70's in Mississippi, and a small town is forever altered when a brutal murder and rape takes place.  The killer is the son is some powerful criminal elements in the county, but they are unable to buy off the jury to acquit him of the crime.  The jury convicts him of the murder but can't sentence him to death.  After 10 years, he's released from prison and jurors start getting killed.  Everyone thinks he is guilty due to a threat he made at the trial.  All this action takes place against the backdrop of a young man who moves into the area, takes over the weekly local paper, and turns it into a powerful force of the community during all the changes that occurred in those turbulent times.<br />The novel is split up into three parts.  The first one delivers on what I thought the novel would be.  A crime, intrigue, fear, and tension.  The crime is solved, justice is served, and the criminal is sent to jail.  The second part then heads off in a direction that is completely detached from the main story.  There's no action.  It's just the advancement of the guy's career and life of running the paper.  Even when the third part of the story kicks in, the action of jurors getting killed doesn't kick in until the last 50 pages or so.  The ending twist comes up pretty quickly, and the final end of the novel sort of leaves you sitting there thinking &quot;he ended it like *that*?&quot;<br />If you were reading this for a human interest story covering the changes in the deep South during the 70's, it would work better in my opinion.  But to build this up as a crime thriller and then basically drop that angle until the last few pages left me feeling a little cheated.ast few pages left me feeling a little cheated.	2004-03-29

Target Audience<br />Developers who need an introduction to or a review of object-oriented programming.<br />Contents<br />This is an easily digestible tutorial on object-oriented programming (OOP) that can be used as an introductory or review text.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:<br />A Look At How We See The World; What Is a Class?; Encapsulation; Methods and Polymorphism; Inheritance; Abstraction; Identifying and Describing Objects; Real-World Modeling; Collaboration; Case Modeling; Interfaces; Object-Oriented Programming Languages; Final Exam; Answers to Quizzes and Final Exam; Classes In Java; Classes In C++; Class Definitions In C#; Index<br />Review<br />My career as a programmer started in the world of Cobol.  Because of that experience, I tend to think of programming in terms of procedural coding.  When I got ready to make the jump to Java and object-oriented programming (OOP), I had a difficult time getting my mind wrapped around OOP concepts.  The explanations of \\"an object is like an airplane\\" didn't cut it for me, because an airplane wasn't code.  I needed something that explained the concepts from a coding perspective without trying to teach you a language at the same time.  I would have done much better had OOP Demystified been around back then.<br />OOP Demystified is an approachable tutorial on OOP concepts for someone who doesn't come from that type of programming background.  Each chapter explains a concept, shows examples from a Java and C-style coding viewpoint, and then ends with a test so that you can see if you've absorbed the material.  If you've never seen Java or C code, the examples might be a little confusing, but not so much that you'd lose track of what's being discussed.  The tone is conversational, so the barriers to learning are lowered.<br />An additional benefit to this book over earlier attempts is that the authors include Unified Modeling Language (UML) concepts as the book progresses.  UML is the standard way of diagramming OOP systems, and programmers need to understand the basic methodology.  While not a \\"teach yourself UML\\" course, the reader will pick up enough information to be able to work in that environment.  The material will also allow you to move on to a more focused UML tutorial with little effort.<br />Even if you're not a complete novice to OOP, you will still benefit from having this book on your shelf.  If you're like me and still have to think through the concepts on a regular basis, this volume will provide you with a quick refresher on the basic concepts that you can quickly review as needed.  That's where my copy of this book will get most of its use.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're getting ready to dive into the world of Java or C#/C++ and you don't have a background in OOP, this will give you a good foundation of the concepts you'll need.  And if OOP isn't your primary background, you'll appreciate it as a refresher guide in order to cement specific concepts.diagramming OOP systems, and programmers need to understand the basic methodology.

Target Audience<br />Developers who are looking for an entry level text to learn XSLT and XPath.<br />Contents<br />This is a tutorial guide for teaching yourself the fundamentals of Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, or XSLT.<br />The book contains the following chapters:  Preface; Transforming Documents with XSLT; Building New Documents with XSLT; Controlling Output; Traversing the Tree; XPath and XSLT Functions; Copying Nodes; Using Variables and Parameters; Sorting Things Out; Numbering Lists; Templates; Using Keys; Conditional Processing; Working with Multiple Documents; Alternative Stylesheets; Extensions; XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0; Writing an XSLT Processor Interface; Parting Words; Appendix: XSLT Processors; Glossary; Index<br />Review<br />While XML is becoming the de facto standard for data exchange between programs and platforms, it does nothing to allow the reader to see the data in a useful, formatted output.  And, since XML is not concerned about presentation of data, that's proper.  What you need is some way to turn that data into readable output based on the reader's needs.  To do that, you use XSLT. That's where this book comes into play.<br />Michael Fitzgerald has written a concise, easy-to-follow book that will allow you to start working with the XSLT language.  Since this book is not combined with every other XML technology known to man, you will not get lost in a morass of acronyms or concepts that would quickly confuse the beginner.  The focus is just XSLT, and the assumption is that you are approaching the language for the first time.  There are a number of examples that give you hands-on experience during the learning process, and most of the examples also show a screen print of the browser output so that you know if you were successful with your coding.  The code can also be downloaded from the book's website, so if you just want to skip to the output, you can do that.<br />The author doesn't try to write for both the beginner and the expert.  Since the focus is on the beginning XSLT coder, the person with an existing base of XSLT experience may not find this book of much use.  I don't say that as a gripe against the book, rather as a way to manage your expectations.  It's better than a \\"For Dummies\\" title, but it's not an exhaustive guide to all that is XSLT.  If you fall into the target audience, you should gain a lot from this title.<br />Conclusion<br />Learning XSLT is a very good choice to start your foray into the world of XML transformations.  You should come away with the basic information you need to be effective and continue to expand your experience.the expert.

Not all my recreational reading is fiction...  :-)  I recently finished American Roulette by Richard Marcus.  This book tells the story of Marcus and his 25 year career of cheating casinos all over the world.  While a little repetitive at times, it's a fascinating look into a world that many of us know nothing about.<br />Marcus started out as a dealer in Las Vegas after losing a bundle and ending up sleeping under a bridge.  His personality attracts the attention of a team of casino cheats who enlist him into their group.  He learns the art of &quot;pastposting&quot;, which is learning how to switch chips after the outcome of a game is known.  This can involve either adding more chips to a winning bid or removing high-value chips after a loss.  This pastposting routine is used successfully at roulette, craps and blackjack, and Marcus starts to travel the world.  His team quickly becomes known world-wide by casino management, but they are unsuccessful at catching and stopping the team.  He &quot;retired&quot; a couple years ago, never having been caught and convicted during his 25 year career.<br />The story is an interesting look at the mentality of casino and cheats, as well as the psychology involved in pulling off successful scams.  It's also interesting to see how the team progresses from $100 moves to $10000 moves over the years.  I'm a little surprised that he would be as detailed as he is, as it seems like law enforcement could use this as a &quot;confession&quot; of sorts to prosecute him after the fact.  Regardless, it's a good read that will make you view casinos in a new light.	2004-03-27

More reading on writing...  :-)  This time, it was Robert Bly's book Write More, Sell More.  This book appeals to me as it addresses a core value I hold dear...  making money.  And if you are looking at freelance writing as your sole means of income, I would recommend you get a copy of this book.  It will help you think through many of the issues surrounding looking at your writing as a business.<br />Some writers will probably look at this book as a crass attempt to reduce the art of putting words on paper to nothing more than a means to make money.  But realistically, if writing is what you do for a living, that's what it comes down to.  He discusses what it takes to write faster and better, as well as what it takes to be a more prolific writer.  Some of these tips are common sense (set regular work hours, set writing goals), and some are different ways of looking at your work vs. pay.  For instance, writing two articles in one day for $1000 is better than writing one article over 2 days for $1750, in that you are getting a better hourly return for your labor.  Multiple lower paying jobs that can be cranked out in hours can be more lucrative than one single premium article that takes a longer time to finish.  That's not to say that a longer article is always a bad idea, especially if it gains you entry into a new publication or outlet.  But you should always keep the ratio of time expended to dollars received in order to maximize your only commodity...  time.<br />Some parts of the book are a little dated (this was written in 1998) when it comes to computers and technology.  But that doesn't detract from the overall message.  Also, some people might be put off by what seems to be a &quot;aren't I good at this?&quot; attitude that occasionally seeps in.  Still, there is plenty of material here that will help you as a writer realize a better return on your effort when it comes to the check.	2004-03-25

If you're confused about terms you find when dealing with the world of media, then the Writer's Encyclopedia can be helpful.  Trying to read the book from cover to cover is like reading a dictionary (not recommended, but I did it anyway), but you will learn plenty of new facts you may not have known otherwise.  For instance, a cutline is the text that accompanies a picture.  A frontispiece is the page immediately preceding the title page illustrating the book's major theme or subject.  And a peg is an angle that a nonfiction writer uses to develop an article.  All good stuff.<br />Since this was published in 1996, there are plenty of outdated entries for computer technology.  Compuserve isn't the leading dialup internet provider any more.  :-)  But many of the terms and entries are still applicable.  A solid book for budding writers.	2004-03-25

Target Audience<br />Intermediate to advanced programmers, network administrators, or security administrators who need an in-depth understanding of how software and systems can be exploited.<br />Contents<br />This is a detailed guide on how to reverse-engineer and analyze software and systems for vulnerabilities and exploits.<br />The book is divided into five parts:<br />Part 1 - Software Cracking - Assembly Language; Windows Reverse Engineering; Linux Reverse Engineering; Windows CE Reverse Engineering; Overflow Attacks<br />Part 2 - Network Stalking - TCP/IP Analysis; Social Engineering; Reconnaissance; OS Fingerprinting; Hiding The Tracks<br />Part 3 - Platform Attacks - Unix Defense; Unix Attacks; Windows Client Attacks; Windows Server Attacks; SOAP XML Web Services Security; SQL Injection; Wireless Security<br />Part 4 - Advanced Defenses - Audit Trail Analysis; Intrusion Detection Systems; Honeypots; Incident Response; Forensics and Antiforensics<br />Part 5 - Appendix<br />Review<br />\\"Know Your Enemy\\".  This phrase is on the cover of the book Security Warrior, and it is an apt subtitle for the book.  Very few security books on the market today do more than just tell you about the types of software and network attacks that exist.  Peikari and Chuvakin go beyond the \\"what\\" of attacks and show you \\"how\\" to exploit systems and software.<br />This book is definitely geared to the experienced developer or network administrator.  For instance, the first eight pages is an explanation of assembly language, registers, stacks and the like.  Each following chapter on reverse engineering then takes that knowledge and walks you through how to analyze an executable using tools that you can purchase or download.  Obviously, if you have absolutely no assembler language knowledge, you'll be lost here.  But if you have that background, you'll start to learn how hackers develop exploits, and how you can build more secure software once you understand the vulnerabilities.<br />At the end of each chapter, the authors list a number of additional references (both books and websites) that can help you to further your understanding of the material presented.  This is a great addition if you are looking to focus in on a particular type of attack, like those related to wireless security.  At the website for the book, they have also made sample programs available that can be used by the reader to work through exercises in the book.  For instance, when they present information on reverse engineering, they also provide a sample program that you can analyze and crack.  A perfect way to lead the reader from theory to practical knowledge.<br />The argument could be made that this book could be used by crackers to learn how to break software.  The reality is that this information is already out there.  A book like this will help those who are trying to prevent break-ins understand the methods that are being used against them.  And henceforth, the sub-title \\"Know Your Enemy\\".<br />One caveat about the book...  Be very careful with the material presented in the reverse engineering section.  Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), reverse engineering can be considered a crime in certain circumstances.  The authors acknowledge this, and that's probably why they provide their own sample programs for you to work on.  Still, just remember that this knowledge, if misused, could land you in some very hot water.<br />My only complaint about the book...  The sumo wrestlers on the cover really needed to be bigger...  :-)<br />Conclusion<br />This is one of the few books that goes beyond the \\"what\\" and deals with the \\"how\\" of system and software security.

Since I recently picked up a Tim Green novel and really liked it, I got a copy of his latest book and finished it this morning.  The book is called The First 48, and it's a very good crime thriller.  Jane Redmon is a newspaper writer, and she's been fed some information from a secret source that could destroy a senator's career.  The editors at the paper let her write the story, but before she can hit the deadline she disappears.  Her father, Tom Redmon, had his career as a prosecutor ruined by the same senator, and he's now an alcoholic lawyer and just scraping by.  But when he learns of his daughter's disappearance, he starts the manhunt himself.  The title comes from the adage that kidnappings that go more than 48 hours without being solved generally don't get solved or a body turns up.  He has 48 hours to find his daughter, and will do just about anything to get it done.<br />As a story, I liked the writing and pace.  The 48 hour countdown did lend a certain urgency to the search, but it was a little too convenient at the end.  Some nice plot twists along the way, and you're not quite sure who is good or bad.  The alcoholism slant doesn't really come into play much, and it could have been dropped with no effect on the story.  Regardless, not perfect, but it is entertaining.	2004-03-21

I picked up the book The Craft Of Research by Wayne Booth, Gregory Colomb, and Joseph Williams at the library awhile back, and I finished it over the course of this week.  Not quite what I was expecting, but useful if you buy it for the right reason.  I was looking for something more geared towards doing research for articles and such.  This is geared towards the college student or professional researcher who has to produce research papers on a regular basis.  It teaches you how to formulate your argument and properly research your material to make and prove your points.  Probably very helpful if you have an actual project to do at the time you're reading it.  Definitely a reference book you'd want to have on your shelf.<br />That's not to say that you couldn't gain some insight on article writing from this book.  It's just, in my opinion, a bit too advanced for the type of writing I would do.  But because it covers the target audience well, I can't complain.	2004-03-18

I keep picking up Elmore Leonard novels thinking I should like them for their quirky nature.  And nearly every time I finish one I'm disappointed.  His last one, Tishomingo Blues, was a *huge disappointment*.  Ever the optimist, I just finished Mr. Paradise in the last day or so.  And like normal, I'm sitting here going &quot;eh, so-so&quot;.<br />It's a &quot;Detroit crime novel&quot;, which is different than his last few books.  The story revolves around a pair of high-priced escorts/fashion models that end up at the house of an old guy who has purchased their &quot;services&quot; on an ongoing basis.  The guy and one of the girls is murdered, and the guy's main &quot;servant&quot; is apparently in on the crime.  He wants the remaining girl to assume the identity of the dead girl so that he can get the contents of a safe deposit box that is supposed to contain his &quot;inheritance&quot;.  The head detective on the case is falling for the girl but has to watch himself because she is a material witness to the crime.  He has to solve the crime and keep her alive from the two hitmen that pulled off the original murder.<br />It's not a bad novel, and infinitely better than his last one.  But at the end, I just didn't get any feeling of excitement or anticipation.  The story just moved along, but I never got caught up in it.

Target Audience<br />Web developers who are looking for real-life examples of the use of servlets and JSP.<br />Contents<br />This is a companion-type book that goes beyond strictly reference material to the use of different servlet and JSP features, along with working examples of code to illustrate the concepts.<br />The book is divided multiple chapters that each cover a different technique or function:<br />Writing Servlets and JSPs; Deploying Servlets and JSPs; Naming Your Servlets; Using Apache Ant; Altering the Format of JSPs; Dynamically Including Content In Servlets and JSPs; Handling Web Form Data in Servlets and JSPs; Uploading Files; Handling Exceptions in Web Applications; Reading And Setting Cookies; Session Tracking; Integrating JavaScript with Servlets And JSPs; Sending Non-HTML Content; Logging Messages from Servlets and JSPs; Authenticating Clients; Binding, Accessing, and Removing Attributes in Web Applications; Embedding Multimedia in JSPs; Working With The Client Request; Filtering Request and Responses; Managing Email In Servlets and JSPs; Accessing Databases; Using Custom Tag Libraries; Using The JSTL; Internationalization; Using JNDI and Enterprise JavaBeans; Harvesting Web Information; Using the Google and Amazon Web APIs<br />Review<br />I really like the O'Reilly Cookbook series.  I read a lot as part of my ongoing study, and often it's easy to understand conceptually what is going on.  But making the jump to practical solutions can be difficult at times.  The Cookbook series gets plenty of use on my bookshelf as I do my day to day coding.  And when it comes to servlet and JSP coding as I continue to learn more about Websphere Application Server, this book will surely become dog-eared like the rest of them.  Bruce Perry has done a great job.<br />As with most Cookbook titles, each chapter in the Servlet And JSP Cookbook is made up of a number of Problem/Solution/Discussion groupings.  This format proposes a coding problem, states the solution to solve it, and then devotes the necessary space to discuss the solution both with text and code.  By using this format, you can think through a working solution and determine how to apply that technique to your own problem.  Perry covers a wide range of problems that will help both the beginner and the experienced coder.  For beginners, the solutions for setting cookies with servlets and JSPs may be just what you need to get started.  Experienced people will find the internationalization and JNDI/Enterprise JavaBeans solutions useful.  I appreciate the fact that coders of all experience levels can get something out of this book.<br />The only caveat I have on this book is that it is very focused on the Tomcat and WebLogic web application servers.  If that's your platform of choice, you're going to get everything this book has to offer.  For me, I'm partial to the WebSphere platform.  While I will benefit from a lot of this book, there are chapters that will have no appeal to me, such as using the Ant package.  I will also need to pay attention to the coding examples to make sure that the techniques are coded correctly for my platform of choice.  Even with that warning, I would still highly recommend this book to all coders working in this area.<br />Conclusion<br />This is definitely a title that will be useful to you as you learn more about servlet and JSP programming.

It provides code examples for many of the classes used in those books.<br />The book contains the following chapters:<br />Part 1 - Learning Java - Java Basics; Objects, Classes, and Interfaces<br />Part 2 - Core Java APIs - Input/Output; Threads; Networking; New I/O; Security And Crytography; Internationalization; Reflection; Object Serialization<br />Part 3 - Desktop Java APIs - Graphical User Interfaces; Graphics; Printing; Data Transfer; JavaBeans; Applets; Sound<br />Part 4 - Enterprise Java APIs - Database Access With SQL; XML; Servlets and JavaServer Pages; Remote Method Invocation; Example Index<br />Review<br />Often when you are learning Java or exploring a new aspect of the language, it's difficult to make the bridge from the raw documentation to working code.  The O'Reilly \\"Examples In A Nutshell\\" series is designed to make that transition from theoretical to practical, and David Flanagan's Java Examples In A Nutshell is no exception.  It should be an essential part of your personal library if you are a Java professional.<br />Rather than spend time teaching the reader a particular class, the book assumes that you have one of the other Java Nutshell books for all the details of the class.  In this volume, Flanagan jumps right into complete, well-documented examples of code that use those classes, thereby giving you a feel for how they work.  Because he documents his code better than most of us do, there isn't that waste of time trying to figure out what the coder intended.  The examples are easy to follow, and they are definitely helpful when you are working through the details of an unfamiliar class or concept.  I often find myself looking through the chapters when I'm coding just to get a glance at how someone else would code a solution.  It's almost like having a partner to bounce ideas off of.<br />In this latest edition, the author covers some of the new features in Java 1.4 like the New I/O and Sound APIs.  Personally, I probably wouldn't do much with the sound code, but the New I/O section will be useful.  He also covers the regular expression features which are new in the New I/O API.  While I would also want documentation on regular expressions since I'm not a Perl expert, these examples will help me when I get to the point I need to use them.<br />Conclusion<br />Quite simply, this should be a \\"must buy\\" for your Java library.  This book bridges the gap between reference material and your actual coding better than any other book of its kind.code a solution.

There are humor-based guides and academic-based guides, reference guides and basic information guides, exhaustive volumes and \\"For Dummies\\" level material.  So how do you find something different?  Holzner finds it in Java 2 Black Book...  a guide oriented towards practical solutions.<br />Each chapter has a brief explanation of the material to be covered.  From there, the rest of the material is covered within the \\"immediate solution\\" sections.  The first section is an outline of each class to be covered, along with the properties and methods.  The rest of the immediate solutions follow a conversational tone with a series of fictional problems that need to be solved by a java programmer.  In many ways, this approach makes it easier to place the new information in context.  You see how someone might need to use a text box in an applet instead of just learning what a text box is.<br />This particular edition of the book covers Java through version 1.3, so if you want the most up to date information, you'll need to look elsewhere.  Also, by looking at the chapters, you'll see there is a lot of coverage given to AWT and Swing programming.  If you're more interested in server-side Java programming, this may not be your best choice.  I would think this book would appeal to someone who has already gone through one learning guide and is now starting to use Java on a regular basis.<br />Conclusion<br />This book is more conversational and practical in nature than many other Java guides, and will appeal to readers who appreciate a less academic approach to learning new concepts.  In my opinion, this would be a good \\"second Java book\\" for someone learning the language.The first section is an outline of each class to be covered, along with the properties and methods.

And if you've read (and enjoyed) any of Dorsey's prior novels, you'll also like this one.  It's great stuff...<br />For those of you who haven't read this series, it's hard to explain.  It's a Florida crime spree novel, with an abundance of humor and accurate observations on Florida life and culture.  The main character, Serge Storms, is an escapee from a mental institution who has a rap sheet a mile long and a very unique view of life.  The *very* basic plot in this book is that Serge is trying to track down the missing diamonds from the 1964 NYC Museum Of Natural History heist, along with proving that his grandfather didn't commit suicide (but was murdered).  And trust me, they are related.  Interspered throughout, you have mob kidnappings and killings, guided tours of Miami's seedy underbelly, invasions of Cuba, FBI and CIA involvement, The Beetles, Flipper, and various other random items that actually make sense in the story.<br />Think Carl Hiaasen without limits, and you'll start to get a feel for where Dorsey goes with his writing.  Great fun!	2004-03-13

A book that recently caught my eye was one by John Barry titled The Great Influenza - The Epic Story Of The Deadliest Plague In History.  Now, I generally have a phobia about needles, and have *never* received a flu vaccination, but I think that will change next year.  This was scary stuff...<br />Barry details the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 in great detail.  He starts by setting the stage of how American medicine was practiced at the end of the 19th century, and how there was little control or respect for the profession.  And rightly so...  Nearly anyone could call themselves a doctor and do nearly anything.  But through the efforts of a few key people, John Hopkins university was formed to bring the medical education up to European standards.  Most of this transformation was occuring when the flu pandemic started.  This is where the book gets interesting...  and frightening.<br />Because of World War 1, recruits were overcrowded into training facilities that were less than sanitary.  When the flu first broke out in one of the army camps in the states, it was quickly transferred to other camps when soldiers transferred.  From there, it easily jumped into major cities, decimating large numbers of people.  And when these soldiers went overseas, the flu went with them.  Being especially contagious, it swept the globe in short order and left, by some estimates, over 100 million dead.  That is so hard to comprehend.<br />When you look at the struggle they had to even identify the cause of the illness, you understand how it could so easily run rampant.  One would think that it couldn't happen today, but one would be wrong.  SARS, AIDS...  diseases that defy attempts to quickly identify the virus, and are resistant to attempts and efforts to treat them.  It's not hard to imagine how a pandemic could start so much more quickly today due to the ease of worldwide travel.<br />Well worth reading to understand how precarious the general health of society could be...	2004-03-12

Another &quot;how to write&quot; book I just finished was Write Where You Live - Successful Freelancing At Home Without Driving Yourself And Your Family Crazy by Elaine Fantle Shimberg.  It's a useful and humorous book on how to be a freelance writer while also trying to preserve your sanity at home (assuming that's where you do your writing).  Shimberg has been a freelance writer for over 40 years, and did much of that while trying to raise five kids.  You have to give her major kudos for pulling that one off.  She covers reasons for writing, how to structure your time, how to figure out what to write about, and much more.  There are a number of funny stories and witty observations sprinkled throughout, and you can tell she likes what she does.  There is also a fair amount of coverage on basic life issues, like organizational skills and believing in yourself.  If you're looking to do freelance writing, this would be a good choice for a read on how to get started.  The only criticism of the book I can make is that it was written in 1999 and computers are still looked on as an &quot;option&quot;.  I really don't think that's the case any more...<br />And my favorite quote she used in the book...  by someone named Louis Untermeyer...  &quot;Write out of love, write out of instinct, write out of reason.  But always for money.&quot;<br />I like the way that guy thinks!  :-)	2004-03-12

Stephen White is a favorite author of mine, and I thoroughly enjoyed his latest effort, Blinded.  In the latest installment, Alan Gregory is called on by a famous client to renew her therapy.  She drops a bombshell when she tells Alan that her husband has probably committed a number of murders.  Alan has to balance his ethical obligations against his legal requirements, while also trying to figure out what part of her story might be true and which part might be fabrication.<br />But what's a good psycho thriller without subplots?  His wife Lauren is a district attorney in Boulder Colorado.  She also has MS, and she suffers a flair-up of her condition here.  There's some character development there as Alan and Lauren both learn to deal with one of her episodes.  Alan also discovers that there is a leak of confidential information about his clients, and he has to determine where it is coming from, and why it is happening...  All before it destroys his practice.  And finally, Sam Purdy, Alan's police detective friend, has his wife leave him after he suffers a heart attack.  He becomes involved in the potential murder investigation, but isn't quite sure why he feels compelled to do so.<br />A good read...  Not heavy on action until the end, but plenty of interpersonal stuff going on.  Probably not his best one in the series, but I still like it a lot.	2004-03-11

For whatever reason, I tend to live with things rather than try and figure out how to get around them.  Reading through a book like this makes me realize that I don't have to put up with irritants.  Steve Bass does a great job in PC Annoyances in showing you the way.<br />Each chapter has a series of \\"The Annoyance - The Fix\\" pairs that will outline a common annoyance on your PC, and then show you how to make the necessary change to solve that problem.  The author liberally sprinkles a number of sidebar tips throughout the book with titles like clutter reduction, technical tips, and helpful hints.  The writing has a light and humorous flavor to it, but the instructions are clear, concise, and easy to follow.  If the problem or annoyance can't be resolved from within Windows or the particular software package, Steve will recommend low cost (or free!) software you can find on the web that will give you the power you need.  The book does focus a lot on Windows XP, but many of the tips will work (or can be adapted) for other Window platforms.<br />This book should appeal to a wide range of user types.  Newbies will learn how to do things they didn't know existed.  Power users will find a number of tips to make them more productive than they already are.  Gurus will discover a few software packages that will make them say \\"hey, that's cool!\\"  My favorite tip was on opening IE windows and the sizing of them.  I occasionally get into a situation where new IE windows open up in quirky sizes that I don't like.  I couldn't figure out why it happened and how to get it set back to normal.  With this book, I will no longer struggle with that.

You can't go a day without news on how another group has found and exploited some software flaw to create havoc on the internet.  It seems that the software bugs are found faster than the developers can patch them.  How can a software developer get ahead of the curve and write software that is more secure from the start?  Get this book.<br />The authors start out with an overview of software and how code is open to bugs and exploits.  By understanding the concepts of complexity, extensibility, and connectivity, you'll start to understand how easy it is for software to be \\"broke\\" by others to gain some sort of advantage or control over it.  The rest of the book then goes into specific areas of attack and how they occur.  There is an abundance of \\"attack patterns\\" that are highlighted throughout the chapters.  These short sidebars will help you understand all the types of attacks that can (and will be) used against your systems.  After you read and digest this information, you will be much better prepared to write code that is designed to be more secure from the initial design through implementation.<br />A question comes to mind quickly when reading the book...  Isn't it dangerous to put all this hacking information in one place where anyone can access it?  In my opinion, it's more dangerous to not have this data available.  If a person wants to break your software or systems, they already know this stuff.  In the case of software security, it's often the corporate developer who is at a distinct disadvantage as they are more concerned with getting their software to work in the first place.  By having a single volume that explains the concepts of software exploitation in detail, we can all start to write secure software instead of writing patches to fix flawed code.<br />Conclusion<br />This book should be on the shelf of all software developers and administrators who are concerned about writing and administering secure software.  And that should be all software developers and administrators!  The information may be disturbing, but you need to understand it before others use the information against you.stuff.

I was really looking forward to reading this one on my trip back from Lotusphere, as it was released the last week of January.  But she crossed me up by not going directly to paperback, and I can't pay $21 for a book I'll read in two days.  So, after a relatively short wait at the library, I was able to enjoy my favorite author..  Nora Roberts writing as J. D. Robb in Divided In Death.  And it was well worth the wait.<br />In this latest offering, Eve Dallas is asked by Rourke to handle a possible murder case that appears to have been committed by his head of security, Eva Ewing.  Rourke has a real fondness for the lady and her mother, and wants Dallas to make sure it's not a setup.  The murder was of Ewing's husband and her best friend when she learns of the affair they were having.  The lovers are killed in bed and everything points to Ewing as the killer.  But for Dallas, it's just a bit &quot;too&quot; clean, and she quickly clears Ewing of the murder.  But if not her, who?  The plot revolves around spies for a Homeland Security group, a rouge hacker underground, Rourke's security company, and the brother of the husband.  Plenty of twists and turns in this plot.<br />And for character development, Rourke hacks the computer files of the Homeland Security group and finds out some previously unknown information involving Eve's childhood traumas.  He wants to kill those responsible, but Dallas knows she can't be a cop and stand aside if she knows what Rourke wants to do.  They have to determine what's most important to each of them as they work through this crisis.<br />As usual, great story and wonderful characters.  I'm really glad that Roberts can crank these out so quickly, as I am forever waiting for the next one in the series to come out each time I finish the current one.	2004-03-07

One of the library books I've had around for awhile is Sally Stuart's Guide To Getting Published by, who else, Sally Stuart.  I finished reading it over the last couple of days, and it's a so-so book.  If you're just getting into the writing field, this would be a decent concise guide to many of the things you need to know for your writing career...  getting started, the basics, the business of writing, and so on.  If you've been writing (and getting published) for awhile or if you've read a number of other books on the same subject, you probably won't find any new ground covered here.<br />Also, Stuart is the author of the Christian Writers' Market Guide, and this book is meant to be somewhat of a companion piece to the Market Guide.  As a result, you'll see more references to the religious writing market than you would normally see in a book on writing.  It's not intrusive and the core information is still valid, but just be aware it's there if that's something that offends you.<br />Overall, not a bad book for those starting to explore the field, but not much to offer those who have &quot;been there, done that&quot;.	2004-03-04

This book will help you answer those questions.<br />The book serves two purposes.  Part 1 of the book will allow you, as a Java developer, to understand how to use the tool to code and test your programs.  They also devote coverage to how CVS, the open source version control tool.  Even if you're not interested in extending the Eclipse tool for your own use, this first part of the book would be worth the purchase.<br />Part 2 gets into how the Eclipse framework can be used to write your own tools to integrate into the environment.  Granted, this part of the book won't necessarily appeal to everyone, as some of you will only want to use the core functionality of Eclipse as an IDE.  But you can think of this section as a lesson on the internal architecture of Eclipse.  The more you understand about the tool, the more effective you can be with it.<br />And finally, you have the third part of the book that consists of a number of exercises to bridge the gap from theoretical to practical.  Taken as a whole, working through this entire book will give you a solid foundation in Eclipse.<br />And for Notes/Domino professionals...

I'm used to getting the latest book on a subject and doing it myself.  So it's unusual that I would end up with a textbook on a technical subject that I am using for self-education.  That's the situation I find myself in with this book.<br />Introduction To Object-Oriented Design And Analysis is designed to for use with a beginning course on the subject.  So right away, you can expect the material to be presented in a formal, academic fashion.  The author deliberately spends comparatively little time on introductory material and gets to the meat of the subject so that the reader can start to get some hands-on experience.  Each chapter states the learning objectives up front, and ends with a recap of key terms and additional references.  There are also review questions for the chapter, as well as problems to be solved.  Scattered throughout the chapters are \\"Just In Case You Wanted To Know\\" sidebars that relate the subject being discussed to real-life situations.  There are plenty of diagrams and illustrations to aid your understanding.  There are also two case studies that are built upon throughout the book so that the reader can follow an entire project of OO analysis and design from start to finish.  Finally, there is a CD included in the book that has a tool called ArgoUML that can be used to create your UML design diagrams.<br />I personally would recommend this book to someone wanting to learn more about OO analysis and design.  If you are trying to make the transition to OO programming (such as with J2EE), you'll need to have a good grasp of this material.  J2EE is not a rapid application development environment, and you need to have a solid system design in place before you start your coding.  This book will give you the skills and tools you require to get there.  It is a serious approach to learning, so if you prefer a lighter approach to a new subject, you should probably look for something a little different than what you'll find here.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a book that will appeal to those who like a more academic style for their learning.  If you take the time to answer the questions and follow the examples, you'll come away with an excellent understanding and grasp of the subject.paratively little time on introductory material and gets to the meat of the subject so that the reader can start to get some hands-on experience.

Since I was out of recreational reading material the other day, I picked up Liberation Day by Andy McNab at our library.  This is an espionage thriller novel with a main character by the name of Nick Stone.  It's also part of a series using the same characters.  This is the first time I've read McNab's writing, and I can't say I was impressed...<br />This story takes place shortly after 9/11, and Nick Stone is going on one last mission.  He has to infiltrate a country, find a certain target, and physically cut off the guy's head and deliver it back to his handlers.  If he completes this, he's been promised his US citizenship.  His girlfriend finds out about his last mission and decides to leave him, making his future less certain.  With this turn of events, he goes back into action.  He's asked to track down a series of physical money transfers in Monaco and Nice that will be used to finance more terrorist activities.  That is the majority of the action in this novel.<br />The author apparently was an actual Special Operations member who has to have his novels reviewed by British Secret Service before publication.  The realism and understanding of the trade shows up in his writing, but it's to the detriment of the storyline.  There was far too much checking of watches, radio chatter, and detailed descriptions of each area.  While it may be accurate from a spy standpoint, it makes for a less-than-exciting read.  The plot was rather basic, and it was as if he was trying to fluff it out with all the spy minutiae.<br />Maybe his earlier stuff is better...  This one certainly didn't do it for me.	2004-02-29

Over the last week or so, I've been reading The Complete Idiot's Guide To Publishing Magazine Articles by Sheree Bykofsky, Jennifer Basye Sander, and Lynne Rominger.  If you're inclined to want to explore this area of freelance writing, I would readily recommend this book for you.<br />The authors take a topic with an abundance of material and present it in an entertaining, digestible fashion.  They cover topics from what a freelance writer does, the basics of writing, and how the periodical industry works, to how to write an effective article and how to treat your writing as a business.  When you finish, you'll be able to tell whether this is something you want to pursue, as well as how to get started.<br />For me, I learned some tips on writing style (which is always good).  I also received some confirmation that steps I've taken already are leading me down the right path.<br />Bottom line...  this is an excellent book to move you further along in the periodical freelancing area.	2004-02-28

When I got this book, I guess I was expecting a bit more theology and less &quot;devotional&quot; material.  The information is solid and theologically sound, but the authors seem to flit from topic to topic.  I wanted more at the end of each chapter, but then we were on to a new topic.<br />If you have the right mindset, it's a good book.  If you're looking for something more academic or in-depth, this probably isn't what you're after.	2004-02-28

I just finished Tim Green's The Fifth Angel, and it's a very good read that tears at you.  A man's daughter is kidnapped, held captive, and is physically and sexually abused.  She is found, but is committed to a mental institution.  After his life is nearly destroyed, he determines that no child molester should be allowed to walk free.  Using his job that has him on the road quite a bit, he starts executing known molesters.  He doesn't find the peace he seeks, but he's driven to keep doling out his form of justice.<br />Meanwhile, a female FBI agent and a pompous police detective are paired up to hunt down the killer.  They have a bead on him, but no one is pushing hard to bring him in because of the targeted victims.  She believes her pursuit of the killer to be right until her own children are abducted and she has to confront the kidnapper with the help of the vigilante.<br />This is one of those novels where the \\"good\\" guy is the criminal and the \\"bad\\" guy is the victim, and you have to decide whether retribution or justice is deserved.  You feel for the vigilante, as you'd probably experience the same frustration if it was your child.  Conversely, if everyone decides to take justice in their own hands, anarchy would reign supreme.  While the story line is well done, it will cause you to question your feelings.	2004-02-25

Target Audience<br />Developers who are looking to learn how to build J2EE applications using Websphere Studio Application Developer and obtain certification on the tool.<br />Contents<br />This book is a tutorial towards learning how to develop J2EE applications using the WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD) product with an eye towards passing certification test #287.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:<br />Introduction To IBM WebSphere; Developing Enterprise Applications With WebSphere Studio; Servlets; JavaServer Pages (JSP); Developing EJBs - Session Beans And The EJB Architecture; Developing Entity EJBs With Websphere Studio; Message-Driven Beans; Transactions; Security; JCA Tools And Supports; Profiling Analysis Tools In WebSphere Studio; Implementing Clients; Packaging And Deployment; WebSphere Administration; Remote Debugger And Java Component Test Tools In WebSphere Studio; CD Instructions; End Of Chapter Questions And Answers; Index<br />Review<br />IBM offers a number of certifications that revolve around the WebSphere Studio product.  The top end certification in this track is the IBM Certified Enterprise Developer, also known as test 287.  If you want some help in focusing your study, take a look at this book.<br />The author lists each certification objective to start the chapter, and then does an introduction of the subject matter, like security.  From there, the topic is covered with text, diagrams where needed, and how it relates specifically to the WebSphere Studio package.  This last part is where you'll get the most value.  There are a number of books that can teach you about JavaServer Pages or servlets.  Very few will make the connection to allow you to use WebSphere Studio to create those design elements.  To wrap up each chapter, there are a number of questions you can use to assess your knowledge of the topic in preparation for the test.<br />This book does assume that you already know the J2EE technologies that are being covered.  While the author does attempt to provide background material on each topic, you really do need to know it before you get to this point.  The focus is on how each technology works with WebSphere for the purpose of passing the test.<br />In addition to using this book, I would also recommend getting a sample test from a test vendor.  Between that and the book, you will stand a very good chance of passing the test.<br />Conclusion<br />If your goal is to pass test 287 in the IBM certification track, this is a good choice to focus your study time.ng covered.

To finish up my troika of weekend reading, I completed the book Last Man Standing by David Baldacci.  This was recommended to me by Chris Miller, and he was right...  I liked it.<br />Web London is a member of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team.  During an operation to take out a drug house, something happens to cause London to freeze at the point where they were supposed to rush the location.  The operation turns out to be a setup, and the entire team is killed except for him.  He has to deal with the guilt over being the &quot;last man standing&quot;, along with trying to figure out what happened that caused him to freeze.  The deeper he digs, the more he finds that points towards a cover-up or a leak within the bureau.<br />Pretty good pacing for a book that's over 500 pages.  Good character development, and a number of plot twists that you don't see coming.  Definitely a time commitment due to the size, but a good psychological crime thriller.	2004-02-23

If you want a mind-candy read somewhat reminicient of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, you'll enjoy Highlights To Heaven by Nancy J. Cohen.  This is part of her &quot;Bad Hair Day Mystery&quot; series.  The main character, Marla Shore, is a south Florida Jewish hair stylist with her own salon, and she finds herself in the middle of crime investigations, much to the dismay of her love interest and police dectective Dalton Vail.<br />In the latest installment, her strange neighbor (nicknamed &quot;Goat&quot;) has gone missing.  When she goes over to investigate with Vail, they find a dead body, a stash of cash, and no Goat.  Shore recognizes the highlighting style on the dead guy, and asks some questions of the stylist who did the work.  Things start happening quickly at that point, and it seems to tie back to her styling school days when a group of her friends played a joke on another stylist who lost his hair in the process.  All the friends are being killed off, and Shore narrowly escapes death a couple of time.  A few unexpected plot twists brings the story to the typical life or death climax at the end.  And as a subplot throughout the story, Shore's relationship with Vail advances forward to the next major stage...  moving in.<br />This isn't deep thought-provoking material.  It's a light story with interesting characters, and it's the exact type of recreational read that I often look forward to.	2004-02-22

On the way down to Tucson, I finished up Remember When by Nora Roberts &quot;and&quot; J. D. Robb.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with those names, they are one and the same person.  Nora Roberts writes romance novels, and also pens futuristic crime novels under the pen name of J. D. Robb.  I really like the Robb titles (the &quot;In Death&quot; series), so I decided to give this one a try.  I liked it a lot...<br />In part 1 of the story (written by Roberts), a woman is trying to forget her father's criminal past and has set up a nice existence running an antique shop in a small town.  But a partner of her father shows up at the shop, tries to deliver a message to her, and gets killed running out of the shop when a car hits him.  When an investigator shows up, she gets really confused as to why all this attention has come her way.  Turns out the investigator is trying to track down a multi-million dollar diamond heist, and she's suspected of being part of the scheme to hide the diamonds.  As with most crime novels, she's innocent but is the target of a killer who also thinks she knows where they are.  Her and the investigator team up to try and solve the case.<br />Jump forward to part 2 (written by Robb) about 50 years in the future.  The granddaughter of the main characters in part 1 is a successful writer who has penned a blockbuster book about the original diamond heist.  People close to her start getting murdered, and it appears that it's related to some unresolved questions about the crime and a missing portion of the diamonds.  Eve Dallas and her husband Rourke are called in to sort out the murders and to protect the writer before she is murdered herself.<br />A unique approach to writing a book (writing as two different authors), and it worked for me.  Both stories can stand on their own, so it's almost as if you're getting two books for the price of one.  I've never read any Nora Roberts titles, and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as much a mushy romance as I expected.  The J. D. Robb portion was good as usual, with all the same players I've come to know and enjoy.  While I'm not going to run out and start reading Roberts romances, I'm more likely to at least read the flyleaf to see what the story line might be...mushy romance as I expected.  The J. D.

While you can pick and choose what you want to implement, its best to follow the entire program to get the whole synergistic effect.  For instance, I could start out by defragmenting my hard drive.  Of course, if I still have a lot of garbage on my drive, the defrag won't be as useful as it could be if I took the time to organize things first.  The authors have written an extremely useful and easy to read \\"how to\\" manual that will add years to your PC's life by getting it running closer to how it used to behave when it was new.<br />The book does assume a Windows XP environment for the degunking tasks.  However, many of the steps (such as file cleanup, desktop cleanup, defraging, and such) are applicable to all version of Windows.  So don't panic if you're not yet an XP user.  Also, hardcore operating system gurus will either know all this stuff already or \\"scoff\\" at the simplistic approach.  Fine, the book isn't for you.

I just finished The Fool's Run by John Camp, better known now as John Sandford (author of the Prey series).  This was originally written back in 1989, and revolves around computer hacking.  You're probably thinking &quot;a hacking story in 1989?  Quaint!&quot;.  Don't feel bad.  I thought the same.  But much to my surprise (and delight), it aged well...<br />The main character, Kidd, is a painter who is also a hacker for hire.  He's been known to pull some jobs that have kept him comfortable.  He's approached by a company who claims that their fighter jet plans were stolen by another competitor, and they want Kidd to scramble the competitor's records so that they can't gain a lead in the government bidding for the plane contract.  But after Kidd pretty much destroys the company, he finds out the story is not quite what he was led to believe.  And now, someone's out to kill him to tie up that loose end.<br />While much of the hacking involves mainframes and computer terminals over dialup lines, it isn't entirely juvenile.  The hacks are typical for that time frame, and the story surrounding the action is well done.  Maybe its because I remember those days of mainframe and dialup terminals, but I really liked this book.  My kids probably wouldn't relate, but old techno-geeks like me will understand and smile...	2004-02-12

The mindset of online writing is completely different than for print, and this book will help you to understand that.<br />People read books and magazines for many reasons, but often it's to be entertained or to learn about a subject in depth.  But when people visit web sites, it's usually to find an answer quickly.  The reader wants to find the chunk of information they seek and then move on.  If they don't see what they think they want, it's off to another site.  The authors do an excellent job in this book breaking down the content structure of web writing.  To successfully write for the web, you need to organize your information in discrete chunks that can be quickly linked to or scanned for applicable information.  They show you how to effectively structure your writing by the use of shorter paragraphs, lists, bullets, external links, and a number of other techniques that will allow your ideas to flourish in an online medium.<br />The tone of their writing is conversational and easy, without the academic lecturing that often shows up in books where opinion and fact can blur together.  They also use a lot of \\"before/after\\" examples to show you how the techniques actually work.  I was actually surprised that I liked the book as much as I did.  Many books on web site design go off on \\"expert rants\\" in which the author presents his likes/dislikes as expert opinion.  Although some of the information in this book could fall into the same category, there wasn't the strident tone that often happens in other books.<br />Conclusion<br />Writing for the web entails different skills than writing for print medium.  This book will help you understand the issues involved and to make a successful transition to online authoring.

While I am trying to get caught up on my technical book reviews, I haven't given up recreational reading.  And I just finished one that I enjoyed...  The Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson.  This is part of his Alex Cross series, where the main character is a cop going head-to-head with some nasty killers.  This latest installment has Cross training to become an FBI agent, wondering if he made a mistake by leaving the DC police force.  His reputation precedes him, and he ends up on a case involving kidnappings for possible slave trading.  The mastermind of the ring is a Russian Mafia leader nicknamed the Wolf, and Cross has to hunt him down before more people are kidnapped and killed, including members of the FBI trying to bring the criminal to justice.  And just to keep the character development going, the mother of his youngest child shows up in his life seeking to get custody back.<br />Perhaps not the best Cross novel that Patterson has done, but enjoyable nonetheless.  The ending is a little less than satisfactory, in that there's not the resolution you would expect.  I'm expecting a sequel titled something like \\"Blow Your House Down\\" in a year or so...	2004-02-10

Target Audience<br />Intermediate Java developers who want brief explanations of syntax and working examples to study<br />Contents<br />This is a condensed guide to the Java language with a heavy emphasis on code examples that can be used to solve your programming issues.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:  Getting Started With Java; Essential Java Syntax; Blocks And Statements; Methods, Classes, And Packages; Data Structures; Files And Streams; Java Database Connectivity; The Internet And Networking; XML And Java; Advanced Techniques; Security; Internationalization; Development Tools; References; The Java Virtual Machine; Active RFCs.<br />Review<br />There are some people who can read an explanation of something technical and immediately grasp how to use it in a real program.  Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.  I work best when I can read the explanation of how something works, and then see a working example that I can copy and use.  That's where this book shines.<br />Each chapter starts off with an \\"In Brief\\" section.  This is the \\"technical\\" explanation of the subject being covered, like classes or socket programming.  After a high level explanation of the chapter subject, the coverage then shifts to an \\"Immediate Solutions\\" section.  This is where you get the most bang for the buck.  You'll find a problem listed, such as resolving a hostname or opening a server socket.  A couple of paragraphs will explain what needs to be done, and that is followed by a code example that solves that problem.  By reading the chapter and seeing how they solve a number of issues, you should come away with one or more ideas on how to code your own solutions.<br />If you don't have a solid background in Java, you will probably want to get a tutorial-style book before you buy this volume.  It's billed as a \\"concise program solver\\", and as a result it doesn't attempt to teach the language to someone who is unfamiliar with it to start with.  If you are beyond the basics, then this book will quickly pay for itself after a couple of solutions.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a perfect book if you are familiar with Java but occasionally need to look up a command to see how it works along with a code example.  It bridges the gap between academic and practical knowledge of the language.s, then this book will quickly pay for itself after a couple of solutions.<br />Conclusion<BR>This is a perfect book if you are familiar with Java but occasionally need to look up a command to see how it works along with a code example.

But over time, things have gotten much more complicated.  HTML has grown, and the different browsers don't support all the tags in the same way.  HTML is now morphing into XHTML.  You have cascading style sheets (version 1 and 2), and of course browsers support those differently too.  Throw in XML, JavaScript, DHTML, ActiveX and applets, and you wonder how any of it works together.  To help you keep it all straight, you need to have a good reference manual that explains it all.  HTML &amp; XHTML: The Complete Reference by Thomas Powell is an excellent choice to have on your bookshelf.<br />Unlike pure reference-style manuals, this book bridges the gap between information and learning.  The appendixes at the end of the book can be used for just looking up a particular tag as well as what browsers support that feature.  This information is valuable as you attempt to code web pages that are compatible across browser versions.  But it doesn't stop there.  Each of the book sections discusses the different features in a learning style, complete with examples.  So instead of just seeing a &lt;big&gt; tag listed with browser support, you get a discussion of what it is, how it works, when you should use it, and a code example (with screen shot) to see how it will work.  For me, I need that bridge between theoretical and practical.<br />While the book does discuss XML, JavaScript, and DHTML to some degree, I wouldn't buy this book as a reference tool for those technologies.  You'll get basic coverage here, but you could buy separate books of this size on each of those subjects.  And if that's the only \\"bad\\" thing I can say about this book, it should give you an idea of how much I like this book.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are looking for a good \\"all-in-one\\" book to use in your web development efforts, this would be an excellent choice.

This is a quirky book for technical writers, and focuses on how to make your technical writing &quot;readable&quot; by untechnical people.  Bremer has done a lot of writing for software such as The Sims, so he knows his craft.  He also is involved in filmmaking, so you can guess he brings a lot of creativity into his writing.<br />I liked this book a lot.  The tone of the book is conversational, replete with interesting quotes related to the subject of writing.  While the book isn't one that will &quot;teach&quot; you how to write, it will help hone your technical writing skills such that you can effectively communicate to a non-technical readership.  All too often, technical writers write for other techies.  This may be fine if that's the audience, but usually it's not.<br />Another feature of this book is that it will help you understand the entire process of editing and layout.  At this stage of my writing career, I can put words to paper and send it off to be &quot;edited&quot;.  That part is still a mystery to me, as well as what it takes to get a clean copy into a layout ready for publishing.  After reading this book, I have a better idea of what others are doing to my original submission.<br />Good book if you do technical writing...	2004-02-08

Because I can't stand to travel without reading material, I had to stop at the Orlando airport before the flight back to Portland and find a paperback &quot;just in case&quot; I ran out of books.  I ran across Utopia by Lincoln Child.  Great surprise, and one of the best reads I've had in quite some time.<br />The story line revolves around a terror threat in a high-tech amusement park (yes, you can easily imagine Disney here).  A small band of terrorists have rigged a number of &quot;surprises&quot; in the park in order to make a large monetary heist and to get some proprietary software involving the holographic attractions.  An outside specialist there to work with the robotic network gets wrapped up in trying to stop the killings, one of which could be him or his daughter there with him.  When it becomes clear that an employee of the park must be part of the team, no one is sure who to trust any more.<br />Since I'm a Disney fan, I loved the setting of the theme park.  The plot line of the terror threats is carried out well, and the pace is just about perfect.  It's a longer paperback (434 pages), and it took me longer to read than many books of late.  It could be because I was actually savoring the read and trying to make it last.<br />If you get the chance to read this one, do so.	2004-02-07

As part of my Lotusphere preparation, I read the book 101 Secrets Of Highly Effective Speakers by Caryl Rae Krannich.  As the title indicates, it's a series of short &quot;secrets&quot; (tips) on how to make effective presentations.  The tips are broken up into categories such as Plan To Exceed Expectation, Build Your Body - Your Speech Body, Close With Power, and Prepare Like A Pro.<br />This isn't a &quot;program&quot; to help you overcome your fear.  Instead, it's more like a buffett of ideas.  Most of the ideas are common sense, and will strike you as &quot;I know that already&quot;.  If you've given presentations before, or if you're an experienced presenter, you might not take much away from the book.  But if you're just starting out on the speaking trail, the information in the book will help you to focus your efforts.	2004-02-07

And with this book, I now have the chance.<br />Scott Fullam has put together a fun volume of projects that span the range from rank beginners to people who read schematics on a daily basis.  Each project is rated for cost, time requirements, and difficulty.  Based on that, you can figure out whether or not the project is one you can reasonably expect to complete based on your skill level.  There are some basic instructions on tools and reading schematics, but I think that you'd be better off if you come into the project with at least a little background knowledge beforehand.  You could probably figure out the easier ones, but the advanced projects will be out of your reach.  Where applicable, each project also lists a bill of material and schematic drawing that will make it easy for you to get the items you need to build your dream device.  There are numerous illustrations and photos to keep you on track, so if you're a visual learner you're in luck.<br />What do I see myself doing from this book?

A book I'm having fun reading this year is Leo Laporte's 2004 Technology Almanac.  This is one of those books you may not get something from every day, but on many occasions you'll find a gem that will make your life a lot easier.  There's a page for each day of the year, and each month covers a different area of technology.  Those areas are Make Your Computer New For The New Year; Games And Entertainment; Stay Safe Online; Manage Your Life Online; Merry Month Of May; Weird And Wonderful World Wide Web; Family Photography; Work At The Beach; Back To School; Control Your Email, Battle Spam; Troubleshooting; Leftovers; and Index.  And in case you're wondering, the tips include both Mac and PC...<br />For instance, on January 3rd the coverage is on must-have system diagnostic tools.  The four tools they feature are PC Pitstop, SiSoftware Sandra, WCPUID, and Motherboard Monitor.  I was unaware of any of these package, and the SiSoftware Sandra package would help me clean up some things on my machine.  If I had been looking for something like this, I might have been able to find it.  But having a gem drop onto your path makes each day's reading something to look forward to.  Heavy-duty geeks might think too much of this is &quot;I already know that&quot; material, but for average users and developers like myself, it's nearly as fun as a Dilbert calendar (and more useful to boot).	2004-02-04

The chapters are as follows:<br />Part 1 - JSP Application Basics - Introducing JavaServer Pages; [...] and Servlet Basics; JSP Overview; Setting Up The JSP Environment;<br />Part 2 - JSP Application Development - Generating Dynamic Content; Using JavaBeans Components In JSP Pages; Using Custom Tag Libraries And The JSP Standard Tag Library; Processing Input And Output; Error Handling And Debugging; Sharing Data Between JSP Pages, Requests, and Users; Developing Custom Tag Libraries As Tag Files; Accessing A Database; Authentication And Personalization; Internationalization; Working With XML Data; Using Scripting Elements; Bits And Pieces;<br />Part 3 - JSP In J2EE And JSP Component Developments - Web Application Models; Combining JSP And Servlets; Developing JavaBeans Components For JSP; Developing Custom Tag Libraries Using Java; Advanced Custom Tag Library Features; Integrating Custom Code With JSTL; Data Access Strategies;<br />Part 4 - Appendixes - JSP Elements References; JSTL Actions And API Reference; JSP Expression Language Reference; JSP API Reference; Book Example Custom Actions And API Reference; Web Application Structure And Deployment Descriptor Reference;<br />Review<br />So, you're surfing a web site and hit a web page that ends with the extension .jsp.  Looks like a regular web page to you, and if you view the source, it still looks like regular HTML.  So what is a .jsp page, anyway?  This book will tell you everything you need to know, both as to what they are, how they work, and how you can start using the technology in your development projects.  Provided you have a basic understanding of Java, this book will work well for you.<br />The book starts off with an explanation of what JSPs are and why you would use them.  Basically, it provides a way to generate dynamic web pages using snippets of Java code.  Logically, it's much like ActiveServer Pages (ASP) code as provided by Microsoft, only using Java instead of Visual Basic.  It then goes into the benefits of generating content in this fashion, and how it's a superior method to other technologies such as CGI and ASP coding.  The rest of the book then goes into great detail (with a large number of examples) on the specifics of JSP syntax.  The author does an excellent job of meshing the approach of a tutorial with actual detail that can be referenced after you start developing applications.<br />The author assumes the use of the Tomcat J2EE server package to learn JSP technology.  Tomcat is a free download from [...] and it's easy to load and configure.  But don't despair if you are using a different web server.  The examples are very generic and portable, and with very little effort you can adapt the information to whatever platform you use.  In my case, I was using the Websphere platform and had no problems using that server to work my way through the book.<br />By getting the 3rd edition of the book, you'll learn about the latest versions of the JSP 2.0 specification, as well as the JSTL specification (version 1.1).  These were both released in late 2003, so you are getting the latest and greatest as far as the information goes.  Since the author was involved in developing the JSTL standards, he has replaced many of his custom examples with the new standard components that are now part of the language.  This is extremely important in that you will be learning core language features as you work your way through the book, instead of how the author had to work around deficiencies in the spec.<br />Conclusion<br />If you want to keep moving along in the Java-based IBM/Lotus world, servlet and JSP technologies are in your future.  While you may not need it right now, you WILL need it.

During the trip home from Orlando, I was able to finish up Tom Clancy's Net Force: Changing Of The Guard.  This is part of his paperback series that bear his name but is written by others.  The setting is about 10 years in the future, and the action revolves around a government office called Net Force.  This group uses computer technology and the Internet to track down criminal activity.  In this installment, the NF group has obtained an encrypted disk with the names of all the Russian spies throughout the world.  The breakdown of the code is going slow, but a certain sleeper spy in the US is willing to do anything to keep the government from learning of his involvement.  When the top NF codebreaker is nearly killed in a kidnapping attempt, there is an all-out attempt to find the killer and the person who might have hired him.<br />Generally speaking, it's a good read.  It will make more sense if you've followed the series, as there are references to past people and events that you won't know about otherwise.  It doesn't kill the book if you haven't done the reading, but it helps.  I personally like near-future techno-thriller novels, so this one works for me.  It's not as action-packed as others in the series, but it is still a pleasant diversion.	2004-02-02

On my way to Orlando, I finished up a paperback titled The War In 2020 by Ralph Peters.  It's a large paperback (607 pages) that tells a story of armed conflict in the future.  Russia is falling apart due to factional fighting internally, and the Islamic and Russian rebel forces are being supplied by the Japanese.  The US is no longer the leading world military power, but they don't want to see Russia overrun by Japan.  They step in to balance the equation, but end up on the receiving end of a deadly weapon launched by the Japanese.  Typical war thriller material.<br />If you're a Tom Clancy fan, you'll probably like it.  I'm sort of split on it.  While there were some interesting parts, there were characters and subplots that had nothing to do with the main story.  He has an explanation for that at the end, but I could have done without half of the book.  Also, the book was written in 1991, so some of the scenarios are interesting in light of the last 14 years.	2004-01-30

Since I wasn't able to sleep on my red-eye flight to Orlando, I was able to start (and finish) Digital Fortress by Dan Brown.  A very enjoyable read, especially if you're into technology security and encryption.  The storyline revolves around the National Security Agency (NSA) and their activities surrounding the monitoring of communication.  They are able to break any encryption with the aid of a massive secret computer, and life is good.  But when a code appears that can not be broken, all hell breaks loose.  The author, a former employee of the NSA, is about to release the code to the highest bidder.  The NSA has to stop this from happening so that they will not be locked out of all encrypted data.

Review<br />In my ongoing efforts to continue my technical education, I decided I wanted to learn more about the Struts framework for web application development.  To that end, I picked up a number of Struts books, and among them was Programming Jakarta Struts by Chuck Cavaness.  This book by O'Reilly is a fairly comprehensive guide to the framework, as well as a tutorial on how to use it.<br />The author starts with some high-level discussion of web applications in general, and some of the issues faced when building those types of applications.  From there, he starts to show how those issues can be handled within the Struts framework, as well as the advantages you gain by implementing it.  The rest of the book then goes into the different parts that make up a web application written with Struts, both from a tutorial standpoint, as well as from the perspective of documenting all the different parameters and options of each part.<br />There is a sample shopping-cart type application called Storefront that is used as a running example throughout the book.  This is good in that it allows you to see how Struts code would be structured in an actual application.  The downside of this approach is that at times the application can become the focus of the writing and not the underlying technology.  I struggled a bit in trying to keep straight what was Struts and what was the application logic, but it may have just been my inexperience.<br />If I hadn't read any other books on Struts prior to this one, I might have struggled more than I did.  While the framework makes sense once you wrap your mind around it, there are some moments of confusion when you first start out.  This book might not be the best \\"first exposure\\" to the subject matter.  I would recommend you try to find some introductory material on the web or in magazines first so that you have an idea of what things are before you start reading this book.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a good choice if you're looking for a Struts book that is part tutorial and part reference guide.  While the example application might be rather complex, it is a good idea of what can be done in Struts, and you will find all the pieces you need to use in there.  But be aware that it could be a little overwhelming if you've never been exposed to Struts in the first place.truts book that is part tutorial and part reference guide.

As part of my Lotusphere preparation, I've been reading 7 Steps To Fearless Speaking by Lilyan Wilder.  She's a communication consultant who has coached a number of broadcast correspondents.

Review<br />I recently worked my way through a Struts tutorial and really liked the approach for building web applications.  However, the Struts architecture has a lot of configuration files and standard components that are interrelated when building an application.  It's difficult to keep all the pieces in the right place in your mind as you're first coding with Struts.  This is where the Jakarta Struts Pocket Guide comes into play.<br />The authors use a straightforward, documentation style of writing to give you just the core information on all the pieces that make up the Struts architecture.  There's no conversational instruction on how to use or how to learn Struts.  It is assumed you have the basic knowledge and need to understand the details of each piece.  The format usually shows a piece of Java or XML code, explains what that piece does, and then documents each parameter that comes into play.  So instead of wading through 50 pages of a book to figure out the web.xml file, you can find the core information here in six pages.  You may need additional resources if you want to learn more about a particular feature, but this book will quickly show you that the feature exists and what it is meant to do.<br />If you're looking to learn Struts for the first time, hold off on this book until you've gone through a learning guide of some sort (like Programming Jakarta Struts by Chuck Cavaness).  You'll need that level of instruction to get up to speed on the architecture.  Once you have that down, you'll be able to use the pocket guide to find answers to your day-to-day questions on how the different parts work.<br />Conclusion<br />If you have already worked your way through a Struts book or if you use Struts on a daily basis, you'll find this a valuable little guide to give you focused answers on a timely basis.	2004-01-17

Most of the books either are basic \\"how to\\" learning guides or exhaustive reference manuals.  Both of those types of books are necessary for a good developer, but there comes a time when you want to cross over from the theoretical to the practical.  As in, \\"how would I do a function like this in JavaScript?\\"<br />The \\"cookbook\\" approach is designed to take a common web site feature, like a search engine, and code a common JavaScript routine that would do that.  You can then take the code in the book and use it with very little modification.  In most cases, you would learn from the code as you are implementing it, and from there you can enhance the function to better suit your particular needs.  You get the best of both worlds...  You are quickly able to implement a function you are getting paid to build, and you are learning at the same time.<br />I liked the piece on context-sensitive help files.  Nothing is really complex or visually impressive.  But it's core functionality that you can implement quickly, it's useful for the end user, and you can build on that technique both in your current and future applications.<br />For Notes/Domino developers, you'll find a lot you can use here.  Being that Domino functionality often translates to the web, you may find that a pure JavaScript implementation of a feature may not be the fastest or easiest way to build something for your application.  You'll need to examine the functionality you need for your application and determine the best way to do it.  But even if you choose to use Domino to accomplish some task, seeing the way to do it in JavaScript can help you expand your horizons and consider different approaches.<br />Conclusion<br />I would recommend this book as a practical supplement to a good \\"how to\\" and a good reference book.  If you're just starting to learn JavaScript, you may want to leave this one alone for awhile.	2004-01-11

What are we doing reviewing Microsoft application books in a Notes/Domino context?  Trust me, it actually makes sense here.  Read on...<br />This book is a refreshing change from the 1000+ page manuals you often see when you are looking for a technical reference book.  The author's philosophy is such that he doesn't resort to handholding, nor does he try to explain every last nuance of an application.  Instead, he gives a concise explanation of the material, and builds upon the information as you go.  When you are done with the material, you should have the basic knowledge you need to be productive immediately, as well as the tools you need to delve further into VBA and Excel programming.<br />The first part of the book shows you the editing environment used to program Excel.  Once you have that down, he explains the basics of VBA.  VBA, or Visual Basic For Applications, is a subset of the Visual Basic language, and is well suited for scripting activities within an application object model.  Once you understand all that, you start putting that newly acquired information to work by creating Excel applications that allow you to automate functions within Excel.<br />OK, now back to the Notes/Domino world.  Why do you need to know anything about Excel and how to program it?  It depends if you want to really want to extend the power of Notes.  With LotusScript, you can create an Excel object in code using COM technology.  Once you have the Excel object declared, you could use LotusScript to start manipulating the properties and methods of all the Excel objects.  So for instance, you could build an agent that would read all the documents in a view and create a simple Excel spreadsheet without having the user work through the cumbersome view export menu option.  Or to be more impressive, you could use the Excel object model within LotusScript to create monthly reports with all the formatting you would normally do manually within Excel.  This keeps the user from having to manually transfer data from one application to another.<br />So why this book?  To effectively program LotusScript and Excel, you MUST understand the object model of the application.  If you don't understand the object hierarchy of Excel, it makes it nearly impossible to do anything more than the simplest of tasks.  The author does a great job of explaining the different objects in Part 3 of the book.  While not all of the objects are applicable to your Notes/Domino programming, most of the material will give you the information you need to understand where to start and to figure out what is possible.<br />Conclusion<br />I recommend this book to any Notes/Domino developer who wants to create applications that interface with Excel.  Other books concentrate too much on how to work with Excel as an application.  This book gives you the tools you need to work with Excel as a programmable tool.eeps the user from having to manually transfer data from one application to another.  <br />So why this book?

This title is meant to be the third  volume of a three-volume set that covers the entire language.  Volume one covers the basic core Java APIs, while volume two covers the foundation classes.<br />Of the three volumes that make up this Nutshell series, this is the one that you'll be able to bypass if you're just moving into the world of Java.  I think that even experienced programmers might end up heavily using some chapters while never touching others.  The format is the same as other Nutshell volumes, where there is a lot of detail with not a lot of fluffy explanation.<br />Each of the Part 1 chapters give a quick overview and tutorial as to what the technology is (such as JavaServer Pages) and how it works.  There are some examples of code to help you understand how it works.  But the authors acknowledge that they do not expect you to be an expert after reading that chapter.  You have to either already know what's going on or seek out another book to more fully learn and understand what is going on.  O'Reilly has a vast array of books that go into each of these subjects in a more detailed manner.<br />For Notes/Domino 5 developers, I would say that there is little in this book that would be of value to you.  You might be interested in JDBC as a replacement/supplement to ODBC.  The XML chapter with information on parsers might also be of interest.  Moving into the Notes/Domino 6 world, more of the book becomes valuable.  Those chapters would include the information on servlets and JavaServer Pages.  As Notes/Domino becomes more tightly integrated with Websphere, you'll need to start understanding servlets and how they function.  This book could be a good tool to help you build them.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're an advanced Java developer and are working on enterprise Java applications, get this book.  If you're a Notes/Domino developer looking to move into servlets, JavaServer Pages, and XML, you should also get this book.  If you don't fit into either of these categories, you probably won't do much with this volume.ld also get this book.

If you are a Java developer and are wondering what all the hype is about surrounding web services and SOAP, you owe it to yourself to get this book.  Robert Englander doesn't waste time trying to teach you Java first.  He dives right in to what SOAP is, what the different related technologies are surrounding SOAP, and explanations on two different implementations of SOAP (Apache SOAP and GLUE).  Once the introductions are complete, he starts with basic examples in both Apache and GLUE.  Each chapter then builds upon those examples to cover more complex examples and situations.  The examples are very well detailed, and the explanations are easy to understand.  In addition, he covers how to write Java code to both call web services and expose your own Java code to be used as a web service.  By the time you're done, you should have a good grasp on how it all works.  The Apache implementation of SOAP is free for downloading at [...] so you can get all the tools you need to become proficient at this technology.<br />This book was very valuable to me as I was working on a project involving web services.  I was writing Java code on a platform that would allow for a user to enter a command and get information back from the server.  The concept of web services was intriguing as it opened up a large set of possibilities for features I could implement.  By using the information in this book, I was able to quickly get up to speed with a functional example that worked.  I was then able to fill in gaps in my knowledge and expand my examples to connect with additional sources of data.  Without the information in this book, it would have taken me a whole lot longer to figure it all out.<br />For Notes/Domino 5 developers, you may not see a use for this information (at least at this level of detail) at this time.  It's possible that you may want to write a Java agent for a Notes application that uses SOAP to get some data from a web service.  I would encourage you to try that if possible.  This would be much more applicable for someone who has started working with Websphere and is trying to build or consume web services.  In my case, I was using it to allow Sametime to interact with web services.  Some very cool stuff...<br />Conclusion<br />If you're ready to branch out into the world of web services and want to write and/or use one, you should seriously consider getting this book.  If you work through the examples and material, I am confident that you will end up being very successful in getting results in a short time frame.sible.

In some of my other reviews, I've talked about how you need a mixture of \\"how to\\" and reference books.  This book falls into the \\"how to\\" realm, as this is a volume you can use if you're just starting out with JavaScript.  Don't let the small size fool you, however.  There's a lot of really good information packed into a book of manageable size.<br />The book is made up of a series of code samples that illustrate a particular task or function you'd want to accomplish in a web page.  For instance, in the Forms And Validation chapter, the authors discuss why you would want to use JavaScript to do form validation.  They then start out with a simple script to show how you'd set up a validation script for a form.  After that, they start to build out the different validation edits that should catch invalid data.  At the end, they recap with the complete script they just walked you through.  The advantage to this style is that you are learning by doing real-world examples.  And when finished, you have examples of code that you can refer back to in the future when you need similar functionality.<br />Another important thing to understand about JavaScript is how to use it to work with the object model of the browser, such as windows, forms, images, etc.  Much of this information is interspersed within the chapters that are teaching you how to do things with JavaScript.  I would have liked to see a chapter devoted just to the browser object model.  However, given the intended audience (beginning web developers), it could have been a little too confusing to break that out.<br />For Notes/Domino developers, you'll find a lot that will be immediately useful as you start developing Domino web applications.  Once again, the form validation section will help you to understand how you can use JavaScript to do your form validation instead of making round trips to the server to edit the Domino form using @Formula language.  You will have to work a little harder to translate some of this into the Domino development environment, however.  Since Domino translates Notes design objects into HTML \\"on the fly\\", you may never end up coding &lt;FORM&gt; tags by hand.  You'll have to work to understand where you can put JavaScript code within Designer so that it works in your application.  Having said that, you will still need to know how to code the JavaScript routines that you'll need.  This book will help you get there.<br />Conclusion<br />I would recommend this book if you are just starting to get into using JavaScript for your Domino web apps.  You'll get up to speed quickly on basic functionality, and you can refer back to the examples over time to help you figure out new features you want to add over time.his into the Domino development environment, however.

In the first, Hope is retained by a young lady who's been involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  She seems very sane, and blames the situation on her mother who is trying to control a chunk of money she's inherited.  In the other plot line (that seems totally unrelated), a pair of detectives find the body of a young lady in a swamp.

I like this comprehensive JavaScript reference manual much more than others that I have on my shelf.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Part 1 - Core JavaScript: Lexical Structure; Datatypes and Values; Variables; Expressions and Operators; Statements; Objects and Arrays; Functions; Classes, Constructors, and Prototypes; Modules and Namespaces; Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions; Scripting Java<br /><br />Part 2 - Client-Side JavaScript: JavaScript in Web Browsers; Scripting Browser Windows; Scripting Documents; Cascading Style Sheets and Dynamic HTML; Events and Event Handling; Forms and Form Elements; Cookies and Client-Side Persistence; Scripting HTTP; JavaScript and XML; Scripted Client-Side Graphics; Scripting Java Applets and Flash Movies<br /><br />Part 3 - Core JavaScript Reference<br /><br />Part 4 - Client-Side JavaScript Reference<br /><br />Index<br /><br />Flanagan has the somewhat rare opportunity to update a book that deals with a technology that is actually mature, stable, and pretty well implemented by all the browser clients.  Trying to writing this book in the late 90's would have been an impossible nightmare.  Now the core JavaScript language has solidified, making it easier to decide what chapters work and which ones need tweaks.  It also allows the author to add chapters that touch on new ways that JavaScript is being used today, such as Ajax.  Once you get past Part 1 (the core reference/tutorial information), you learn how JavaScript can be leveraged in ways that weren't envisioned until recently.  In particular, there was some interesting material on cookies that I haven't seen anywhere else.  Parts 3 and 4 are the sections where you'll spend most of your time looking up those pesky parameters you can't remember on a day-to-day basis, and the layout is very easy to follow and find what you need.  I liked it a lot...<br /><br />I have a different JavaScript reference manual at work, but it's never been one that I've relished having to use.

This book covers the topic of web services, primarily from a Java perspective.  It assumes a familiarity with Java and XML so as to be able to follow the code examples.  The chapters are as follows:  Welcome To Web Services, Inside The Composite Computing Model, SOAP: The Cornerstone Of Interoperability, SOAP-RPC, SOAP-Faults, and Misunderstandings, Web Services Description Language, UDDI: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration, JAX-RPC and JAXM, J2EE and Web Services, Web Services Interoperability, and Web Services Security.<br />Review<br />If you read the chapter headings and say \\"What does THAT mean?\\", then you probably have a reasonability good idea as to whether this book is for you.  As stated in the preface, this is not a \\"For Dummies\\" treatment of web services.  While it covers all the different technologies that make up web services, it does it at a pretty high level of detail with a lot of code samples in Java.<br />The good thing here is that many of the examples are given using the Apache Tomcat server as the mechanism for processing the request.  This is great in that you can download that software for free from the Apache site.  This book doesn't go into detail as to how Tomcat is set up and configured, however.  You need to work through that on your own.  Once you get to that point, you can use Tomcat to play with the examples that are used throughout the book.  While they can look complex and intimidating, you can learn a lot from them.<br />As a Notes/Domino developer, I learned a lot by reading the book.  Am I ready to start developing web services?  Not hardly.  But I do understand more of the concepts behind how they work.  Since web services often use servlets to process requests, Notes/Domino 5 doesn't fit the traditional picture of the technology.  But since web services usually involve SOAP XML statements sent to a server, there's no reason you couldn't program a web service in Domino as a web agent that runs when a user submits a web page or runs a URL that  activates a server agent.  The processing is done and then returned to the client as an XML page.  Once you read and digest the basic concepts behind it all, it all starts to come together.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are a Notes/Domino developer who is trying to understand \\"web services\\", this book could be useful.  The book gets progressively more complex and detailed, so you may find yourself skimming at the end.  If you are to the point of being ready to run an implementation of a servlet and SOAP engine (like Tomcat), this book will help you get started with your understanding of web services.eb page or runs a URL that  activates a server agent.

I'm very into a method of programming called \\"R&amp;D\\"...  that stands for \\"Rob And Duplicate\\".  I'd rather not invent or reinvent something if I can \\"borrow\\" someone else's solution.  Given that as my mindset, I LOVE this book!<br />While the hardcore reference books are necessary, all too often the beleaguered developer is left asking for a simple example of how something works in a real program.  Sometimes it's nice just to be able to see a class (like the Java I/O classes) used in the context of a complete solution.  From there, you can figure out how to start using the class in your own program.  That's the real value of this book.  I may conceptually understand what a class does, but it's sometimes hard to translate that knowledge into syntactically correct code.  Seeing an example helps me get a grasp of how it is really used.<br />For Notes/Domino 5 developers, this is an extremely useful book.  Many Notes/Domino developers are used to using and sharing solutions that have already been coded and solved by others.  This book will feel very natural to them.  It allows you to get a core set of code working, and then from there you can expand to work into a complete coding solution.<br />Conclusion<br />Regardless of where you are at in your Java career, you should have this book.  If you're a Java newbie, it will help you bridge the gap between reference manuals and real programs.  If you're an experienced Java programmer, it will give you different perspectives on how a problem could be solved.	2004-01-11

This title is meant to be one volume of a three volume set that covers the entire language.  Volume two covers the foundation classes, while volume three covers the enterprise classes.<br />If you're just starting out with Java and you're trying to learn the language, this isn't the book for you.  While Part 1 could be used as instructional material, it is truly \\"no fluff\\".  It's best suited for an experienced object-oriented programmer making the leap to Java, or a Java programmer looking for a concise review.  A good learning book would be \\"Learning Java\\" by Pat Neimeyer and Jonathan Knudsen from O'Reilly.<br />The really valuable part of this book is Part 2.  Each chapter defines the classes in that package with an explanation on what it does and how it works.  There's a diagram that shows the class hierarchy from the root Object class, as well as what version of Java supports that class.  This is then followed by all the constructors and methods used in the class.  Don't expect detailed explanations on these methods.  As a nutshell book, you get all the basic info on what's available, but you'll need to experiment with some of the methods before you understand them.<br />A legitimate question might be...  Why get this book if I have the online API documentation from Sun?  I see them as complimentary.  You can probably find much of the reference material in either source.  Some will prefer the online hyperlink navigation, while others will appreciate having all the information on a subject in four or five pages that can be thumbed through.  I know when I'm stuck on a problem I want both sources!<br />For a Notes/Domino developer, it is somewhat similar to using online Notes help versus the manuals.  In that case, the material is identical, so it's more your preference in how you like to look up information.  In the case of this book versus the Java API documentation, you'll get good information from both sources, so you should avail yourself of both.<br />Conclusion<br />If you've completed something like Teach Yourself Java In 21 Days and now you have to DO something with Java, you owe it to yourself to get this book.  This will be one title you'll go back to again and again as you explore the wild, wild world of Java.rself of both.<br />Conclusion<BR>If you've completed something like Teach Yourself Java In 21 Days and now you have to DO something with Java, you owe it to yourself to get this book.

This title is meant to be the second volume of a three volume set that covers the entire language.  Volume one covers the basic core Java APIs, while volume three covers the enterprise classes.<br />Like all \\"In A Nutshell\\" books, this isn't probably where you want to start if you are trying to learn the language.  Part 1 is set up such that topics are introduced and discussed with code examples, but it is not a \\"hand-holding\\" type of explanation.  It assumes you are at least familiar with the information at a high-level, and understand the basic core Java fundamentals.  If you are at that point, you should be able to learn a lot from the first section.<br /><br />Part 2 is where an experienced Java GUI programmer will live and breath.  There is detailed documentation on each of the classes that are covered, as well as a diagram that shows the class hierarchy within the class, and where the class fits into the overall Java class hierarchy.  Once again, it's strictly documentation with no explanation.  Don't expect the author to explain how each method in the class works.  It's up to you to figure out how the method best integrates into your project.<br />I can pose the same question I did when I reviewed Java In A Nutshell...  Why get this book if I have the online API documentation from Sun?  I see them as complimentary.  You can probably find much of the reference material in either source.  Some will prefer the online hyperlink navigation, while others will appreciate having all the information on a subject in four or five pages that can be thumbed through.  I know when I'm stuck on a problem I want both sources!<br />For Notes/Domino 5 developers, I would say that there is little in this book that would be of value to you as you code a typical Notes/Domino application.  While Notes/Domino does support applets within the application, you would most likely code those outside of the Notes/Domino framework.  If you are tasked with developing a Java application that uses Notes/Domino APIs to capture some of the inherent power of the platform, then this book would be useful as you develop the GUI interface that you'll need for your project.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're a Java developer working with client-side applications, get this book.  If you're a Notes/Domino developer looking to use Java in your applications, you should probably focus on the Java In A Nutshell book.

That, and a two hour commute on light rail.  Anyway, I just finished Primal Scream by Michael Slade.  A strange and gruesome book that doesn't rank among my favorites.  To start with, I think that much of the character development takes place in his earlier book Headhunter (which I haven't read).  As a result, there were continual references to people and events that I didn't know anything about but that were important to this story.  Next, there are two crime stories going on here that may or may not be interrelated, and it was confusing to figure out what was going on, and why.  Third, there are vivid depictions of rape and sexual fetish stuff that is key to the story.  Not for the squeamish.  The storyline is that there are killings (beheadings, actually) that are going on, and they are similar to a crime spree from the first book.  DeClerq is trying to solve the crime and figure out if they perhaps killed the wrong person on the earlier case.  Some suspenseful moments to be sure, but very disturbing and somewhat confusing to follow...	2004-01-10

[Updated review of the 2nd edition - 05/15/2008]<br /><br />Even after programming for all these years, I *still* like to see examples of a new (or old) technique before I try and code it. That's why I like JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook by Danny Goodman.<br /><br />From simple JavaScript statements to complex web page parsing, Goodman shows you working code while also explaining how it works.<br /><br />Table of Contents:<br /><br />  1. Strings<br />  2. Numbers and Dates<br />  3. Arrays and Objects<br />  4. Variables, Functions, and Flow Control<br />  5. Browser Feature Detection<br />  6. Managing Browser Windows<br />  7. Managing Multiple Frames<br />  8. Dynamic Forms<br />  9. Managing Events<br />  10. Page Navigation Techniques<br />  11. Managing Style Sheets<br />  12. Visual Effects for Stationary Content<br />  13. Positioning HTML Elements<br />  14. Creating Dynamic Content<br />  15. Dynamic Content Applications<br /><br />Appendix A: Keyboard Event Character Values<br />Appendix B: Keyboard Key Code Values<br />Appendix C: ECMAScript Reserved Keywords<br />Index<br /><br />Since JavaScript is not a language I use on a daily basis (unlike LotusScript where I live and breathe), my mind doesn't automatically start writing code when someone asks for a feature in one of my Domino Web apps. In fact, I'm usually in a position of not knowing what I don't know. It's like trying to look up a word in the dictionary when you don't know how to spell it; it makes it really difficult.<br /><br />This is where I value Goodman's cookbook approach to JavaScript. Rather than focus on all the methods and properties of a JavaScript object, he lists things by activity, such as converting between Unicode values and String characters or auto-tabbing for fixed-length text boxes. You find the \\"recipe\\" that most closely resembles what you need to do. Within the recipe, you'll find a short description of the problem, followed by the solution (with code), a discussion of the answer, and any cross-references to other recipes that are similar in nature. The discussion is valuable, as it covers the pros and cons of the approach, as well as alternative techniques that would also be of interest.<br /><br />The range of topics will satisfy both JavaScript newbies as well as the veterans. You could be looking for examples of simple field validation code. It's not easy if you've never done it before. If you're more into parsing XML files to build a dynamic page or using web services within JavaScript, the latter chapters will give you what you need. And regardless of what level you're at, periodic perusal of the Table of Contents can trigger ideas that may solve that vexing issue you ran across just the other day.<br /><br />Don't expect this book to be a comprehensive tutorial or reference on JavaScript; it isn't, nor was it meant to be. But if you're looking for commentary on features and working code, this is the perfect choice. The JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook has a guarded position on my bookshelf at work.rs the pros and cons of the approach, as well as alternative techniques that would also be of interest.

If you're looking for a low-cost entry into the world of version control software, the open source CVS package is a very logical choice.  But like most open source packages, the documentation is less than perfect if you want something more than just a reference manual for learning purposes.  It's at this point you need a book that explains a bit more about the why's of what you need to do.  This book fills that gap nicely.<br /><br />The target audience is both users and administrators of the system.  Vesperman starts out with an explanation of what version management and source control systems are, and then goes into the usage of CVS for those different groups.  And if you are thinking that CVS is just for managing code, think again.  CVS can be used to manage any document types, such as code, documentation, images, etc.<br /><br />If you're using Websphere Application Development Studio (WSAD), the CVS package has an interface built right in.  You select that option during WSAD installation, and the right perspectives are added to your environment.  You will still need to have a CVS server set up somewhere to manage the source files, and this book will be very helpful in aiding you during that process.<br /><br />Since CVS is based on the Unix platform, all the examples in the book are set up to use command line interfaces to the functions.  Vesperman uses plenty of scripts to show you how to accomplish all the functions, which is great.  In my case, I'll be using WSAD to work with CVS as a developer, so many of those examples were wasted on me.  Still, the concepts behind CVS and the general capabilities of the package are covered well, so a read-through on this book will benefit you either way.<br /><br />For Notes/Domino developers, there is no interface you can use for this package.  You could, if you wanted, check in your .NSF files and use CVS to manage the version control.  You'd lose some of the benefits of CVS like file comparison, but it's still better than having no version control at all.  There are non-CVS systems out there for Notes/Domino content management, and you would probably derive more benefit from those packages than trying to use CVS in this case.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If you are moving into the WSAD world for Java development, check out CVS for version management.  If you do decide to go with CVS, get a copy of this book to supplement the official documentation.  Recommended.tter than having no version control at all.

This is the second edition of Holzner's book, which was originally titled Inside XML.  I purchased Inside XML back in 2001 when I first started exploring XML, and it was a good choice back then.  Looking at the new version of the book, my opinion hasn't changed.  It's still a good choice.<br /><br />Holzner assumes little programming knowledge in his writing.  The JavaScript and Java chapters dealing with XML each start with a very high-level tutorial on the language.  It's enough to allow you to understand how XML processing can fit in that environment.  Throughout the entire book, there is an abundance of examples that you can study and use to get you up and running quickly.  To me, the value of this book is how it gives you a great overview of all the pieces of XML as well as example code to make it all come together.<br /><br />Perhaps the only &quot;drawback&quot; to this book is how much it tries to cover.  Looking at the table of contents, you see that XML is actually a number of technologies that are used in conjunction with each other.  You could easily buy individual books that are more comprehensive in coverage for any one of these related technologies, like SOAP, XSL, or Cascading Style Sheets.  Conversely, you would get so bogged down in the minute details that you'd miss the bigger picture of how they all fit together.  This book gives you more than enough information to get started, as well as helping you to understand what it is you still don't know.<br /><br />For Notes/Domino developers, this is a perfect title to use to get started on XML technology.  You will likely find yourself at some point having to either read or produce an XML file for exchange with another business entity.  This book will help you to understand what you need to know to get it done.  You could use the Java examples in order to code Domino agents to process XML, and those same examples could also help you to understand some of the LotusScript XML classes that are now provided in Notes/Domino.  The SOAP chapters will also be valuable should you have to learn to use and/or create web services for your application.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If you are a beginning or intermediate developer who needs to learn the basics of XML in a hurry, this is a very good choice.  If you need in-depth knowledge of any particular part of XML, you could supplement this choice with a specific book on that subject.  Recommended.ided in Notes/Domino.

If you're an IBM/Lotus developer, you've no doubt heard all the talk about Java and portal development.  You may also be wondering what you need to do to keep up.  First off, you need to learn Java.  The third step is to learn how to develop portlets.  The middle step in there is to learn how servlets and JavaServer Pages work.  This is where Core Servlets And JavaServer Pages fits in.  Portal technology is really an extension of servlets, so once you understand how a servlet works, writing a portlet is just a small step away.<br /><br />The book starts off with servlet coding.  All the details are thoroughly covered with clear writing and a large number of example programs.  The authors spend time explaining the concepts behind the request/response nature of servlets, so you'll be able to build a solid foundation of understanding.  The second half of the book covers how JavaServer pages work.  This will allow you to learn how JSPs work.  It's also the basic information you need before you move on to the use of the Java Standard Tag Libraries, which are covered in the second volume of this series.  By the time you finish this book, you will be well-grounded in the fundamentals needed to move on to portal development.<br /><br />As with all books of this type, the authors have to make assumptions about the server platform you will be using.  So as to not lock any potential readers out, they choose platforms that are available for free download:  Apache Tomcat, Macromedia JRun, and Caucho Resin.  If you are running Websphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD), you'll have to make your own mental adjustments to some of the information, such as directory structure and build routines.  The good news is that WSAD does much of this for you, so you should be able to make the transition fairly easily.<br /><br />If you are a Domino developer who hasn't done much with Java, you probably won't get much out of this book.  You can write servlets for Domino, although it's not something you commonly see done much.  If you're interested in making the transition to using Domino apps in a portal environment, it would be worthwhile to get this book if nothing more than to understand how portlets work (the underlying servlet request/response cycle).<br /><br />Conclusion<br />There are a number of books out there that cover this material.  This book is one of the better ones.  I would recommend it for your servlet/JSP/portal eduction.something you commonly see done much.

I liked it because it presented information in a humorous fashion that made things easy to comprehend.  This style takes that type of learning to a whole new level.  Using a combination of writing style, graphics, illustrations, and sample code, they draw you into each subject in such a way that you can't help but learn and understand.<br />This book starts with the basics of Java and progresses clear through to RMI and JINI.  Granted, those last subjects are just touched on, but at least you're exposed to them.  Even after all the Java tutorial manuals I've read, I still got a lot out of this book.  For instance, I always was sort of fuzzy on the event listener logic.  The Head First explanation was one of the most understandable (and entertaining) treatments of it that I've ever read.  Likewise, inner classes were always confusing to me.  The coverage of that subject here makes it sound so simple.<br />And why do you need this if you're a Notes/Domino developer?  If you've never worked with Java, you're probably intimidated by the subject and afraid to get started.  Don't be...  This is the most fun you'll ever have learning a new skill.  While it doesn't talk specifically about how to code a Java agent in a Notes application, you'll learn the concepts and the syntax you'll need to be able to do that.  Once you have those skills in place, you can move on to a book specific to using Java in a Notes environment (such as Domino Development With Java by Tony Patton).  The book doesn't assume you're a programming guru to get started.  You will learn a lot from this material, and it's something you need to do in order to continue to stay relevant in the IBM/Lotus world.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're a C/C++ guru approaching Java, this book may not be for you.  You'll already know much of the material from your exposure to those languages.  But if you're a mere mortal like the rest of us, you need to buy this book if you're looking to learn Java.  I am SO hoping that the Head First approach to tech writing becomes a series.  If it does, I'm ruined for life in what I will expect from a book.  This is really great stuff!posure to those languages.  But if you're a mere mortal like the rest of us, you need to buy this book if you're looking to learn Java.

Review<br />If you are starting to work in the Java world of coding, you'll quickly run into the subject of servlets.  So what's a servlet?  A servlet is a Java agent running on a web server that is handling requests from clients such as browsers and wireless devices.  This is the most common way that you'll serve up dynamic interactive web content in applications.  The browser makes a request to a web server and specifies the URL of a servlet.  The servlet takes that request, does whatever is needed (such as reading a back-end data source), and then formats a response back to the browser consisting of HTML.<br />This book will take you from the conceptual ideas of how [...] works and how it communicates with a servlet running on the web server.  You'll then learn how a servlet works and why it's such a wonderful choice for building scalable and efficient web applications.  Following chapters build upon that basic framework and leads you through building a number of servlets that will show off some of the capabilities of the technology.  The examples are clear and well-documented, and you will come away with the skills needed to start using servlets in your web apps.  The book does not assume any particular web server, so you are free to use whatever vendor's server you want to work through the material.  If you don't already have a J2EE server available to you, you can download the free Tomcat package from [...] in order to start practicing.<br />And why do you need this if you're a Notes/Domino developer?  For the normal Notes application, this technology doesn't apply.  But IBM and Lotus are pushing enhancements in the Notes/Domino framework that will allow the use of Lotus components within a J2EE framework, and that means that you will be coding servlets to generate the dynamic web content that Domino can deliver.  Furthermore, if you start working with Websphere Portal (which is being pushed hard by IBM), 90% of what you code will be based on the servlet classes.  This is definitely material you will need to know.<br />Conclusion<br />The conclusion for this book is the same as my conclusion for the JavaServer Pages book by O'Reilly...  If you want to keep moving along in the IBM/Lotus world, servlet and JSP technologies are in your future.  While you may not need it right now, you WILL need it.  I highly recommend this book in addition to the JavaServer Pages book.  The combination of these two books will give you all you need to know in order to work in the NextGen world of IBM/Lotus..

Review<br />So, you're surfing a web site and hit a web page that ends with the extension .jsp.  Looks like a regular web page to you, and if you view the source, it still looks like regular HTML.  So what is a .jsp page, anyway?  This book will tell you everything you need to know, both as to what they are, how they work, and how you can start using the technology in your development projects.  Provided you have a basic understanding of Java, this book will work well for you.<br />The book starts off with an explanation of what JSPs are and why you would use them.  Basically, it provides a way to generate dynamic web pages using snippets of Java code.  Logically, it's much like ActiveServer Pages (ASP) code as provided by Microsoft, only using Java instead of Visual Basic.  It then goes into the benefits of generating content in this fashion, and how it's a superior method to other technologies such as CGI and ASP coding.  The rest of the book then goes into great detail (with a large number of examples) on the specifics of JSP syntax.  The author does an excellent job of meshing the approach of a tutorial with actual detail that can be referenced after you start developing applications.<br />The author assumes the use of the Tomcat J2EE server package to learn JSP technology.  Tomcat is a free download from [...] and it's easy to load and configure.  But don't dispair if you are using a different web server.  The examples are very generic and portable, and with very little effort you can adapt the information to whatever platform you use.  In my case, I was using the Websphere platform and had no problems using that server to work my way through the book.<br />Ok...  You're a Notes/Domino developer who is wondering why you should care about this stuff.  It's not Notes, and you don't know Java, so why bother?  Well, there is a whole area of Domino development now codenamed &quot;NextGen&quot; that will allow you to access Domino data and application components within a J2EE environment.  Much of this new approach to developing applications based on Domino will involve the use of servlets for business logic and JavaServer Pages to display the traditional forms and views.  Furthermore, Domino 6 provides custom tag libraries that do much of the &quot;Notes-y&quot; stuff for you when you are working with JSPs.  In order to start moving in this direction with Domino, you'll need to start learning about JSP technology, and this book will start you in that direction.  And if you are thinking about working with portals, you HAVE to learn this stuff.  Portlets are nothing more than an extension of servlet classes and JSPs to display the data.<br />Conclusion<br />If you want to keep moving along in the IBM/Lotus world, servlet and JSP technologies are in your future.  While you may not need it right now, you WILL need it.  I highly recommend this book as a great starter text on the subject that will grow with you as you learn and work with JSPs.a J2EE environment.

Being cooped in up the house in this storm, I've had plenty of time to read in the evenings.  A novel I just finished was Into The Inferno by Earl Emerson.  Looking at the cover, it would appear to be a firefighting story of some sort, but in actuality it's a medical thriller that has a firefighter as the main character.  One day they are called to an accident scene involving a number of cars and some overturned cargo from a semi.  Nothing appears to be suspect in the load, and everything is cleaned up with no problems.  But five months later, the members of the fire station involved in the response start dying off and/or going brain-dead over a week when they start to show symptoms of an unknown disease.  The main character recognizes that the source must be from the cargo spillage, and he races to find out the killer substance that is going to render him brain-dead in seven days unless he can solve the mystery.  When he finds out the true source, the question becomes whether the condition or a gun will kill him first.<br />A good read for something that I picked up at the library just scanning through the shelves.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased, even though it wasn't the type of book I thought it would be...	2004-01-08

The authors normally set themselves up as &quot;experts&quot; and present all their opinions as undeniable facts.  While you can get good information from their writings, I quickly tire of the tone of &quot;I'm the expert&quot;.<br /><br />So why am I reading a book on web accessibility?  Because I know it's good for me.  It's a subject I don't know much about.  And with this title, I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a very readable book by an engaging writer, and it's a good mix of opinion, fact, standards, and practicality.  It also helps that he doesn't much care for the &quot;my opinion is fact&quot; usability experts either.<br /><br />With the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, public entities have to address the issue of making their websites accessible to various groups of disabled individuals.  Clark starts off by explaining how visually-disabled, hearing-disabled, learning-disabled, and physically-disabled people use computers and the web.  He then explains in entertaining fashion how each type of element in your web page can be made accessible to the different devices that are used by the disabled.  The suggestions are also broken down into beginning, intermediate, and advanced techniques so that developers at all levels of experience can take positive steps towards compliance with accessibility regulations.<br /><br />For Notes/Domino developers, you have the same issues to deal with as do web developers on other platforms.  Since Domino applications on the web are often Notes applications rendered to HTML &quot;on the fly&quot;, it's a little more difficult to exercise the total control that other types of web page coding involve.  But you do have the &quot;HTML&quot; tag in the property box for each design element.  By using that set of properties to add accessibility tags, you can go far in designing Domino apps that are friendly to the disabled.  And if you work for a public organization, you may find that you have little choice but to comply.  It might be a good idea to get started on the learning curve now.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If you are responsible for maintaining an organizational website and either have to/want to address accessibility issues, this is the book you'll want to get.  Not only will you learn the &quot;whys&quot; of accessibilities, but you'll learn the different level of &quot;hows&quot;.  Highly recommended.bled.

This is a very well designed and written book covering EJB technology in a complete and in-depth manner.  There's a quick intro to the subject, and then the rest of the book builds on that knowledge in tutorial fashion.  You will build a cruise reservation system using beans, and in the process you'll learn a lot.  It does assume that you have a solid foundation in Java skills before you dive in, so don't get this book unless you're already well on your way to learning Java.  It's not for beginners.<br />Another very nice feature is the companion workbook that you can buy for this book.  It translates many of the exercises into more specific instructions for running them on the Websphere platform.  This is an extremely valuable addition to the learning process.  All too often, a writer has to assume a certain platform or system to be able to cover the material.  If you also use that same system, you're OK.  If you're not using what the author had, then there can be a translation process that can be frustrating at times.  Having a workbook focused on your specific platform will speed up the learning and avoid the hassles involved in debugging your errors.<br />If you're a Domino developer just getting into Java and J2EE technology, hold off on this book.  While you may well get to this point in your career sometime in the future, it will be of little use to you right now.  There isn't much that is applicable to the pure Domino world, and you'll need to be very well grounded in the Websphere world before this will start to gel for you.<br />Conclusion<br />I would recommend this book to a good Java developer needing to learn EJB technology for their jobs.  It's very complete and comprehensive.  If you're just trying to get started in Java, this book is still aways off for you.  I was pretty well lost through most of it, so I need to come back to it in a year or so once I have some more experience.	2004-01-08

This spans everyone from the end-user who has to describe what they do to the analyst who has to write the specs, to the developer who has to build the application, and even the tester who has to very that the system works as designed.  The Unified Modeling Language, or UML for short, is the way that is quickly becoming the de-facto standard for these descriptions.  And the author has done a good job in writing a book that will help you start to understand and use these concepts.<br />The book starts with an introduction to the language, along with what it is trying to accomplish.  The use of written language as a metaphor for UML works well, as it breaks down UML into component parts, making it much easier to grasp.  Differentiation is made between structural modeling and behavior modeling.  Structure modeling deals primarily with the, what else, structure of the system.  This includes classes, objects, use cases, and component diagrams.  These concepts should be familiar to the object-oriented developer, and the information in the book does a good job in covering the subjects in depth.  The behavioral modeling is used to show how the application should interact with the user(s) of the system, be they people or other system components.  This includes sequence, state, and activity diagrams.  These functions allow a user of the system to understand how everything relates together.  When coupled together, you have a complete system to describe an application from all perspectives.<br />I think the author did a great job in walking the line between a too-simplistic approach which doesn't teach enough, and a highly academic approach which is too difficult to understand for a beginner.  There are exercises at the end of each chapter to help you apply the concepts and start to integrate the learning into your everyday experience.  When finished with this book, you should be familiar with nearly all the concepts of UML, and should also feel comfortable when you start to use it for real-life modeling.<br />For the typical Lotus Notes/Domino developer, you may well be thinking, &quot;I don't need all this &quot;stuff&quot;.  After all, you've been building applications without it so far without it, right?  Well, I would suggest that you need to alter your thoughts a little.  For one, using a structured modeling approach on larger systems will lead to a better, more solid design as opposed to an ad-hoc &quot;build as you go&quot; approach.  You can also use the behavioral structure to show and demonstrate the user's perspective of the system, as well as how the different processes of the system work together.  And secondly, as you move into the world of Java and object-oriented systems, you will encounter the use of UML on a frequent basis.  Now would be a good time to start learning it so that there is one less thing to learn later on.<br />Conclusion<br />If you've not had any exposure to UML (or if it's been very light), I highly recommend getting this book and working through it.  The time you spend now learning this information will pay off down the road with better up-front system design, as well as gaining the ability to explain your design and application operation to others.  I know that as I move deeper into the world of object-oriented design and analysis, this book will be referred to very often.o integrate the learning into your everyday experience.

Specifically, I'm a software developer.  I don't want to build my own PC.  I want to turn it on and have it work.  When it doesn't work right, I start to get really nervous.  I hate to open up the case and look inside any of my PCs.  And I can't tell you how many times I've seriously hosed my machine by attempting to install a new piece of hardware or memory.  Bottom line...  I don't like hardware.<br /><br />So why am I reviewing a book on PC hardware?  Because fear is no excuse for not understanding the device that allows me to make my living.  Having worked a little with this book, I can honestly say that I would have saved myself a lot of grief if I knew about this book earlier.  It is amazing.<br /><br />Scott Mueller covers everything you can think of that you'll find in your PC.  He also includes both the &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;how to&quot; details of the devices.  For instance, you can read the chapters on magnetic storage and hard disk storage to understand how a hard drive works.  He then takes you from the theoretical knowledge to the practical information on how to install a new hard drive in your PC.  When I had to install a hard drive about a year ago after a drive failure, I truly had no clue as to what I was doing.  While I was successful, it was an extremely stressful experience.  If I had been able to review these chapters beforehand, I could have actually learned from the process instead of running scared through the ordeal.<br /><br />In this 15th anniversary edition, there is also a DVD with two hours of video related to the book.  I haven't had the time yet to review the DVD material, but I have no doubt that it will be of the same high quality as the book.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />You need to have this book if you ever plan on replacing or fixing anything on your PC.  I wish I had known about this book sooner...  You don't see many tech books that get past their first edition, much less the 15th edition.  This is a classic.much less the 15th edition.

If you are starting out in the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology, you will quickly learn the importance of running continual builds and unit tests of your code.  And if that process isn't easy and automated, realistically it won't get done.  Fortunately, there are a number of open source tools out there that are commonly used to take care of this.  The Java Extreme Programming Cookbook will help you understand what those tools are, how they are used, and how to solve some of your common problems with those tools.<br /><br />This isn't a tutorial on XP.  Instead, it concentrates on the tools you need to make XP work for you and become part of your normal development process.  In some ways, a more accurate title for this book would be the Java Extreme Programming Tools Cookbook.  The format provides a nice basic introduction to each tool, where you can download it from (as well as where to find the complete documentation), and then a number of problem/solution scenarios from basic install to more complex automation tools.<br /><br />For instance, let's take one of the tools; JUnit.  JUnit is a tool that does unit testing on your code.  You define a test class as well as test cases that should either pass or fail.  Once you have your test class and test cases set up, you can quickly test your code after making changes to make sure that all the results are still accurate.  In XP methodology, you actually write your test cases first, and then write the code to make them pass.  In that way, your testing drives your coding.  This book will give you the overall information on what JUnit is, how to install it, and how to run it.  You then run into a number of situations, such as running tests concurrently, repeating tests, testing naming conventions, and organizing tests into test suites.  Using the problem/solution layout of the Cookbook series, it's very easy to get the base information you need to stay productive.<br /><br />If you are brand new to XP or the tool set, you might be a little lost since it's not a &quot;step-by-step&quot; how-to of each tool.  It assumes you either have a small amount of working knowledge, or that you'll supplement your knowledge with the tool's documentation.  Still, you can't look up what you don't know, and this book made me aware of some tools I didn't know existed.  An experienced user of these tools might also gain a few tricks that they didn't know about, and it might be worth it for those tricks alone.<br /><br />For Websphere developers, you might find that a couple of these tools aren't necessary.  For instance, Websphere Studio does your build for you, so Ant isn't as critical as it would be if you were running a J2EE server such as Tomcat.  Also, JUnit integrates directly into Websphere Studio, so it's very easy to run that tool in your environment.  Even so, having this book will help you expand your horizons.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If you are a Java developer using the XP methodology, get this book to learn the tools you need to make your build and testing process flow correctly.  Even if you don't practice XP, the automated build and testing tools will help you to write better code.t, you might be a little lost since it's not a &quot;step-by-step&quot; how-to of each tool.

If you start reading about web services developed in Java, you'll quickly find that there are a number of Java technologies that come into play.  These include SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and others.  Since you'll need to know about all of them to effectively develop your services, you'll need a book that covers those areas in detail.  One of your choices would include Java Web Services In A Nutshell.<br /><br />Like all Nutshell books, this is not an entry-level tutorial on the subject.  It assumes preexisting knowledge so that less time is spent on the basics and more space can be devoted to the more complex intricacies of the technology.  If the chaptersin the table of contents do not sound familiar, you're most likely not ready for this book.  And yes, I would also include myself in that group...<br /><br />The first 2/3's of the book cover the different web services packages, both conceptually and in practice with examples.  You should be able to use the examples to jumpstart your own development efforts.  The last 1/3 of the book is the traditional documentation of the package API information.  As with most Nutshell books, this will be the area that quickly becomes worn and dog-earred.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are past the &quot;What are web services?&quot; stage, this book will be of value to you.  If you are still trying to figure out what all the hype is about, I would recommend a more entry-level book like Java Web Services by O'Reilly.	2004-01-08

Review<br />It's usually a good sign of a book's popularity and usefulness when it goes into a second (or higher) edition.  This is actually the fourth edition (title notwithstanding) of the book that started out as Exploring Java.  The authors have done a good job in keeping the content current and relevant to how Java is being used in the real world.<br />The progression of information presented here is logical and laid out very well.  You start with a quick tutorial that covers the obligatory Hello World application.  From there, you get into the core Java language syntax followed by information on threads and strings.  Chapter 10 and 11 wrap up the basic info by covering the core utilities (like collections) along with I/O features.<br />Chapters 12 through 14 move into more web-based application development using network programming, servlet, and web services concepts.  Chapters 15 through 20 will cover what you need to know for designing graphical interfaces using AWT and Swing, while the rest of the book picks up a variety of other topics not covered earlier, like JavaBeans and XML.<br />A few things I really like about this book...  They do not try to cover absolutely everything, thereby swamping the new developer with concepts they are not ready for.  The idea is to cover the basics in such a way that you can competently start to use those features.  From there, you can move on to other Java titles that explore specific areas in a more comprehensive manner.  I like this approach in that you may not be looking to develop graphical interfaces.  You may be more interested in servlet-style programming.<br />Another positive feature of this book is the de-emphasis on applet programming.  For a long time, it seemed that Java and applets were synonymous with each other.  All Java programming books had that as a main theme.  Over time, the use of applets has diminished, and the authors have appropriately altered their text to place that in the right context.<br />For the typical Lotus Notes/Domino developer, this is a good source of information on learning Java.  While you won't see information on how to manipulate the Domino Object Model, you will learn the core aspects of the language, which will enable you to start writing Domino agents in Java as well as LotusScript.<br />Conclusion<br />I think that everyone learning Java should have at least two basic &quot;how to&quot; books on their desk.  You can compare information if one doesn't make sense.  While this book doesn't have the off-beat approach of &quot;Head First Java&quot;, it does a great job in covering all the information you need to know to become competent in Java.  I would recommend you get a copy of this book if you are starting down the Java path./>For the typical Lotus Notes/Domino developer, this is a good source of information on learning Java.  While you won't see information on how to manipulate the Domino Object Model, you will learn the core aspects of the language, which will enable you to start writing Domino agents in Java as well as LotusScript.<br />Conclusion<BR>I think that everyone learning Java should have at least two basic &quot;how to&quot; books on their desk.  You can compare information if one doesn't make sense.  While this book doesn't have the off-beat approach of &quot;Head First Java&quot;, it does a great job in covering all the information you need to know to become competent in Java.  I would recommend you get a copy of this book if you are starting down the Java path.	2004-01-08

A little book for people who can't figure out a search engine.&quot;  After reading it, I either have to include myself in that group or change my opinion of the book.  This is really good stuff!<br />I knew there was more to Google than what I was probably using.  I've seen the Google groups area, I've used the image area, and of course I've done web searches.  But I didn't realize the power of the search syntax they use on the site.  I didn't know that you can restrict searches to document types, include/exclude sites or domains, include/exclude based on posted/updated date, decide whether you want the search term in the title, the entire page, or as part of an anchor link.  I didn't realize you could modify the URL on the fly to refine your search without going back to the search page each time.  I didn't know anything about Froogle.  And I definitely didn't know you could change your interface page to a variety of languages, including Klingon and pig Latin!<br />In a very concise, readable manner, the authors show you all you need to know to get started with the creation of much more powerful searches than you've had in the past.  And they repeatedly emphasize that learning how to use Google is best done by experimentation.  After reading this book (and it won't take you that long), you'll never view web searches in quite the same way again.<br />Conclusion<br />I used to say that if you give me five minutes, I can find what I'm looking for on the web.  After reading this book, I may have to revise that to three minutes.  If you get a chance to get this book, do so!	2004-01-08

You got a digital camera for Christmas, and you're now wanting to figure out how to shoot pictures that will cause everyone to go &quot;ooohhh!&quot;.  Your manual will get you familiar with the technical aspects of your new toy, but you should also learn about how to properly frame and expose your shots.  To do that, get a copy of Digital Photography Pocket Guide by Derrick Story.  It's a great little (113 pages) book that will quickly and concisely convey the information you'll need to take perfect pictures.  The first half of the book covers the different features of the camera, such as file formats, spot meters, and white balance.  The second half is a &quot;How Do I&quot; series that will help you figure out specific picture taken scenarios, such as capturing action shots, shooting good self-portraits, and taking pictures at weddings.  The final ten pages are tables of ISO speeds and exposure settings for certain conditions.<br />All in all, the book is a perfect way to quickly understand both your camera and the science of photography.  There are definitely books that are more comprehensive, but none that are as practical in as short a volume as you'll find here.	2004-01-07
841540:US	52517734	R16903O2Z0SJAX	0672324725	914688801	Struts Kick Start	Books	4	6	7	N	N	A good choice if you have the right background knowledge	The Struts framework is becoming a de-facto standard for developing interactive web applications using servlets.  If this type of development is something you are responsible for, you should consider getting a copy of this book to help you take the next step in your professional development.  The \\"kickstart\\" concept means that the authors don't spend a lot of time on fluff or auxilllary material.  You are quickly exposed to the core concepts along with a large number of examples to illustrate those technical points.<br />There are a number of assumptions made in this book.  The web server used for examples is the Jakarta Tomcat server.  If you're using that platform for your development, you'll be very comfortable with the book.  The authors also assume a prerequisite knowledge of JSP, as well as the use of MySQL for writing applications that access data from relational databases.  From a cost perspective, this is all good in that you can set up your test environment for free.  On the other hand, if you use other packages such as IBM's Websphere Application Server and DB2, you'll have to make the adjustments on your own.<br />The book is very comprehensive in what it covers, and there is an abundance of code to help you see working examples that you can use for your own purposes.  Since I'm not as \\"up to speed\\" on servlet technology as I'd like to be, I'd prefer a somewhat slower style for learning.  But that's not a knock on the book as much as my own personal preference.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're comfortable with web applications, deployment, and servlet coding, this will be a good choice for getting started with Struts.  If you're still relatively new to all this, you may want to get a book that doesn't assume quite so much to start with.  Once you get familiar with Struts, this would be a good companion book for examples.	2004-01-04

One of these authors is Dean Koontz.  I just finished his latest book, Odd Thomas, and I wasn't disappointed.  I used to avoid recommending Koontz to people due to his rather morbid, gruesome stories.  But his recent efforts are someone toned down, with very likeable characters and good plot.  In Odd Thomas, the main character (of the same name) has the special ability to see dead people.  This leads to the opportunity to uncover killers and crimes with the help of the local police.  He discovers that a mass killing is about to take place in his little town, and he has to try and stop it before the massacre takes place.<br />Great style of storytelling, tight writing, and some unusual plot twists.  I highly recommend this one.	2004-01-03

These are projects that are underfunded, understaffed, or have deadlines that are unrealistic by a factor of 2x or more.  You're expected to sacrifice your life and health for an extended period of time to complete an impossible task.  And what's worse, this type of project is becoming all too common in today's business.  The book \\"Death March\\", while it's unable to stop these projects, can help you survive and manage them.<br />Yourdon examines the reasons behind why companies run projects in this fashion, as well as some of the surrounding issues that can complicate an already impossible situation.  For instance, you may have a tight deadline, but the \\"Policy Police\\" expect all the required paperwork to be filled out for each deliverable.  Or even more common, you have decisions that need to be made by the customer, but the customer delays making those choices by days or weeks, thereby pushing the schedule off track even further.  By understanding these situations, you can devise ways to work around them or to manage expectations so that you don't get saddled with all the blame for missed deadlines in the end.<br />Both managers and developers will find useful material in this book.  It is slanted a bit more towards the management side, but it's useful for both parties to know and understand the external pressures that are affecting the outcome of their project.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are working on a death march project (or work for a company where they are all too common), this book can give you some practical ways to deal with the issues that cause them.  The projects will not go away, but you will at least have a chance to survive them without losing your sanity.	2004-01-03

Since there wasn't much one could do with the snow outside, I decided to finish up a novel I started yesterday.  It is The Hanged Man's Song by John Sandford.  I like Sandford's Prey series with Lucas Davenport, but I don't think I've read any of his Kidd novels.  Kidd is a painter and a hacker who lives pretty much on the wrong side of the laws when it comes to computer crime.  In this installment, an uber-hacker known as &quot;Bobby&quot; is murdered and his laptop is stolen.  When incriminating stories about government officials and programs start hitting the news, it becomes obvious that the person who stole the laptop was able to break the encryption codes and unleash the attacks until he gets what he is after.  Kidd needs to stop him in order to prevent his own life from coming to an end if there is damaging information about him contained in the files.<br />The writing is tight and realistic, and if you're at all into computer crime novels you'll enjoy this one a lot.	2004-01-02

As a software professional, I thought I knew about Mozilla.  I was under the impression that it was nothing more than the open source version of the Netscape browser.  But after reading this book, I was quickly corrected in my thinking.  Mozilla isn't just a browser.  It's a software development platform that combines XML, scripting, and objects in order to allow for rapid application development of web-enabled applications.  While browsers can be part of that application, there is much more there than I originally thought.<br />The book starts out by explaining XML User-interface Language, or XUL.  This is the foundation of the design layout of Mozilla applications.  JavaScript manipulation of the document object model is then covered so that you can build logic into your applications.  The concepts of RDF for data storage and XPCOM for object management round out the major new concepts you'll learn.  Throughout the book, you will build an application called NoteTaker that will allow you to create \\"notes\\" about web pages that will pop up whenever you display that web page.  The examples are clear and the end product of the application is something that is actually useful when you get done with it.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are looking for an open-source platform for rapidly building web-enabled applications, you should explore the use of Mozilla.  And if you do, this is the perfect book to get you started.	2004-01-01

There are 100 &quot;lessons&quot; in the book (each 1 to 3 pages long), followed by a paragraph of how you can put those lessons to work in your life.  By doing so, you will practice the way of the warrior in all you do.  For instance, there were a couple of items that spoke to me.  Lesson 3 was Revel In Your Awkwardness As Much As In Your Mastery.  In other words, learn to enjoy the learning phase of a new skill.  Everyone goes through it, so just enjoy that thrill of learning new skills.  As a consultant, you go through that phase with all new clients as you learn their processes.  The other lesson was #90 - Frequent Encounters With Fear Make You Strong.  Not too long ago, I would have tried to avoid certain activities that I wasn't comfortable with.  I feared them.  Now, I understand that I need to face those fears in order to grow past them.<br />A good book, and I recommend it...	2004-01-01

While waiting at the ice arena last night for Ian to finish his shift (it was snowing and I didn't want him driving), I finished Sphinx by Robin Cook.  This is one of his older books (1979) and is the first one of his I've read that wasn't a medical thriller.  I got the recommendation from  Ben Poole, and it was a good one.  The story involves an Egyptologist named Erica Barton who travels to Egypt to do some translation work and to satisfy a dream to go there.  She quickly gets emeshed in two murders and the trafficing of antiquities, as well as some personal issues involving her boyfriend and some mysterious people who are not quite what they seem to be.<br />The story moves quickly and keeps your attention.  Considering I'm not really into archeology, I enjoyed this novel more than I though I would.	2003-12-31

I finished a short book titled You Can Write For Magazines by Greg Daugherty.  It is 124 pages of practical advice on how to turn your writing efforts into salable material for magazines.  The book covers how to create ideas, how to write effective query letters to editors to sell those ideas, how manuscripts should be formatted, and so much more.  When you get done with this book, you'll have an idea of what you need to do in order to start your career as a part-time freelance writer.  If you've been writing already for publications or if you've read other books on this subject, you might not find an abundance of new material here.

If you're looking to start writing as a freelancer (magazine articles, stories, etc.), this is a good book to read.  He writes in a very practical and amusing style, and you'll get quite a few tips on how to start structuring your efforts in this field.  You'll learn the different types of freelance writing, what to expect during the process of seeking out assignments, how to make yourself easily acceptable to editors, and much more.  If you've been doing freelancing for awhile, you may already know most of this.  If you're just starting out like I am, then you'll benefit quite a bit from this read.	2003-12-27

I'm back from our Christmas trip to visit the relatives, so it's time to get caught up on a book review.  Yesterday I started (and finished) Capital Crimes by Stuart Woods.  Woods brings back one of his earlier characters (Will Lee) in this political crime mystery.  I must say I like the Stone Barrington novels better...  A serial killer is starting to pick off a number of right-wing government officials and media celebrities.  A web site is discovered that shows who is on the list to be killed, and the FBI has to figure it out quickly before he strikes again.  Perhaps it's because I haven't read the prior Will Lee novels in awhile, but this book lacked any depth or substance.  The story is OK, but the characters are just &quot;there&quot;.  Not much development if they were meant to stand on their own in this book.  If there's no other recreational reading to be had, I'd say go for it, but if you have other titles you want to start first, this one can wait.	2003-12-27

I finished the book Babylon Rising by Tim LaHaye and Greg Dinallo last night.  This is the beginning of a new series for LaHaye, author of the Left Behind series.  In this novel, a biblical archeologist is sent on a hunt for for an ancient artifact known as the Brazen Serpent.  The bronze snake is thought to be the staff used by Moses to heal the Israelites.  But as he's searching for the three parts based on cunniform clues, he's also being pursued by a group who wants to own the relic for their own dark purposes.<br />A pretty good read if you like LaHaye's writings, and it could shape up to be a decent series.	2003-12-24

This is a compilation of personal accounts of people who took Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil.  Each personal account is one to three pages long, and covers a very wide cross-section of situations and conditions.  The author is very up-front about this not being a scientific study, and she also recognizes that these are most likely examples from the extreme ends of the experience scale.  Still, a reader of this book will start to see some trends..<br />Most of the stories had individuals coming from severely depressed conditions and hitting rock bottom before going on Prozac.  Quite a stretch from dysthymia and where I started from.  For many of these people, the effects mirrored my own...  It took a few weeks for the effects to kick in, but one day you wake up and think...  I'm different.  I am finding pleasure in life again.  I'm not living at the extremes anymore.  I may still be sad at times, but it's \\"normal\\" sad.  On the other side, there were a number of situations in the book where people started with Prozac and went from bad to worse.  The drug exaggerated their existing conditions, and they had to discontinue it before they lost it completely.<br />You'll also read about the wide range of side effects that may or may not affect a user.  Some people had nausea, some didn't.  Some people had problems sleeping, some didn't.  Some had more vivid dreams (I've noticed this one), some didn't.  Some had a marked decrease in their libido (especially women), some didn't.  Some lost weight, some gained weight.  About the only effect that I have (and that was mentioned by one other person) was a slight ringing in my ears.  This whole area of side effects reminds me of one of the statements in the book...  \\"Prozac can make you healthy generally, and make you sick locally.\\"  While the overall effect of the drug can be a lifesaver, there are areas in which you'll be worse off than before (sleep, nausea, sex, etc.)  It then becomes up to you to decide whether the \\"local\\" should take precedence over the \\"general\\".  Treating conditions such as depression with pharmaceuticals can be as much an art as a science.<br />The book was published in 1995, so it's been awhile.  But the drug is still the same one, and the dosages are still the same.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the real-life experiences with SSRI drugs.worse off than before (sleep, nausea, sex, etc.)  It then becomes up to you to decide whether the \\"local\\" should take precedence over the \\"general\\".

With all my Lotusphere prep and such, my reading has slowed down dramatically this month.  But I did just finish a novel last night called The Footprints Of God by Greg Iles.  This is a sci-fi philosophical &quot;thriller&quot; (for lack of a better word) that was a great read.  A scientist is working on a top secret project called Trinity.  Part of the project involved an intense MRI brain scan, and now a number of the scientists who underwent the scans have neurological problems.  The book opens with him in a paranoid state looking out for people who want to kill him.  The first half of the story revolves around trying to stay alive, along with his psychologist who is falling in love with him despite his hallucinations.  The actual Trinity project doesn't really come into play until the second half.  I won't go much further, but you then get into some deep stuff about God, creation, artificial life, and many other areas.  A very good story, and it will appeal to sci-fi readers who like &quot;near-future&quot; or cyber type novels.	2003-12-19

Since I started taking fluoxetine (generic form of Prozac) a few months ago for dysthymia, I figured it would be interesting to read of some experiences of others who have used the drug.<br />Slater was one of the first to start using Prozac in 1988 and talks about her 10 year &quot;relationship&quot; with the drug.  She had some serious mental disturbances, and taking Prozac was yet another attempt to deal with them.  She chronicles the changes in her personality, the highs and lows of those changes, and how she dealt with the effect called &quot;Prozac poop-out&quot; when the drug ceases to work after an extended period of time.  On the positive side, she went on to become an accomplished psychologist after being a drifter for the first part of her life.  On the down side, she still struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCP) and feels that in some ways the Prozac has suppressed a number of internal parts of her personality.<br />For me, I couldn't relate to much of what the author wrote.  For one, there's a vast difference between low-level depression (dysthymia) and OCP/self-mutilation.  I could go back to my &quot;old&quot; self and function ok.  I just don't want to...  :-)  She can't.  Also, her style of writing is very &quot;artistic&quot; for lack of a better term.  Readers who are in touch with emotional writing will relate, but those looking for a clinical examination and discussion won't find it here.  If you look deep enough, you can see some themes that might make sense (Prozac as a personality/intellectual &quot;steroid&quot;), but for me the writing gets in the way of that.<br />If you struggle with Prozac, this might be a good read for you in order to get a different viewpoint.  Just don't judge all Prozac users by this book.	2003-12-19

Review<br />You would think that by now there would be no new ground to cover when it comes to books on learning Java.  There's everything from teaching yourself in a certain number of hours/days to dry academic textbooks to entertaining tutorials using adult learning techniques.  Each one appeals to a certain type of learner, and that's good.  Ground-Up Java (GUJ) seems to find an interesting niche that will draw in beginners with a variety of needs.<br />At its core, GUJ is a solid tutorial on Java.  All the basic features of the language are covered, as well as concepts of object-oriented programming.  The writing is concise, intelligent, and readable, and the reader will not feel like they are being \\"talked down to\\".  The author covers both the typical application style Java programs as well as the graphical (GUI) programming techniques to allow you to create visually appealing applications.  All well and good.<br />Where the book shines is with the enclosed CD.  Heller has taken the difference concepts (such as boolean logic or conditional looping) and written graphical Java apps that will allow you to watch and interact with code.  For instance, there's a Boolean Lab application that allows you to create a boolean expression with three variables, complete with NOTs, ANDs, parenthesis, etc.  You set the variables to true or false, and click the run button.  You can then watch an animated breakdown of the code as each part is parsed and evaluated.  Very helpful to see how order of evaluation plays into the answer.  Another of the programs allows you to enter a numerical formula and then watch the animation parse and evaluate it.  This is the type of learning that can take you into a much deeper understanding of what's going on.<br />Conclusion<br />Ground-Up Java is an excellent choice for those developers who want a serious yet readable tutorial guide, as well as an opportunity to visually interact with coding logic.  I recommend it.	2003-12-13

It's an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Eclipse IDE framework, and is customized to allow for easy integration of your code into the Websphere environment.  This book will help you understand the tool along with the basic technologies you can develop inside the IDE.<br /><br />The book starts out with an introduction to the toolset and a brief tutorial on how to code a basic Java application in WSAD.  There is a CD in the book that contains WebSphere Studio Site Developer, which is a smaller subset of WSAD.  The examples are clear and step you through the different menu options.  Next, the authors show you the outstanding debugging tool, and how to use it efficiently to root out development errors in your code.  From there, each major technology (HTML, servlets, JavaServer Pages, JDBC, MVC architecture, and deployment) is covered from the perspective of how WSAD allows you to develop that type of application.<br /><br />As this is the first WSAD book I've had a chance to review, I don't have much to compare it against.  I learned more about the tool than I knew before, and that's good.  But there seemed to be a problem with focus as to whether it wanted to be a certification guide, a WSAD tutorial, or a tutorial on J2EE technologies.  In other study guides, there is a heavy emphasis on the test.  Here, the test almost is relegated to an afterthought.  If I didn't know it was a study guide, I wouldn't view it as such.  Also, when covering the different J2EE technologies, I'm not sure whether the book is trying to teach me the technology or the way to code it using WSAD.  As a result, I felt that neither approach got quite the coverage it should have.  The information presented is good, to be sure.  It's just not as focused as I expected.<br /><br />I also recommend that you carefully read the explanations on setting up the workspaces for the exercises in the book.  The code is there, but a special compression tool is used to allow all the necessary information to be placed on the CD.  You really do need to have the CD code in order to effectively work with the exercises, and if you just guess at how to access the code, you'll end up very confused...<br />Conclusion<br />A good addition to your library if you're starting out with WSAD and J2EE, and you'd like to get the certification as part of your learning process.  Just don't let this be the only book or source you use if certification is your primary goal.sed as I expected.<br /> <br />I also recommend that you carefully read the explanations on setting up the workspaces for the exercises in the book.

And while there are numerous books that cover the technical \\"how to\\" of a portal package, there are fewer books that take a higher-level view about the \\"whys\\" of portals.  Management is left without a complete understanding as to why portal technology matters.  This book is designed to fill that gap.<br />Managers will appreciate the chapters on how to calculate the Return On Investment (ROI) on a portal implementation.  Since portals tend not to be inexpensive, the practical knowledge in this area is beneficial.  The author also mixes in a number of real-life case studies that will illustrate industry problems and how successful portal implementations solved those issues.<br />Project managers and portal architects will find even more highly practical information.  The architecture of a portal design is examined, as well as the options present for implementation (such as J2EE vs. .Net).  By the time the reader finishes the book, they should have a firm understanding of how to structure a portal architecture, as well as how functions such as searching and data warehousing fit into the picture.  There is also good information on what types of requirements need to be gathered in order to successfully design an effective portal.<br />If you are a developer or administrator who is responsible for installing the actual portal software that is chosen, you might not find this book to your liking.  Since much of the information is not tied to a specific brand of portal, it is not the book you will turn to for help in running the portal.  But it is still advisable to understand the bigger picture, and this book can help you get there.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are an IT manager or a project lead who has been assigned to a portal project, this is the book you need to understand the overall implications of your portal implementation.	2003-12-06

Review<br />I'm the type of developer who really doesn't know much about the networking side of things.  I can follow instructions OK, but when you start talking about subnet masks and DHCP, you lose me quickly.  While I don't want to become a networking engineer, I do want to understand a bit more about the technology.  To that end, I read through this book.  Good reading...<br />The book starts with the basics of networks and protocols.  From there, you will learn about the different types of networks (peer-to-peer and network operating systems), and how you can set up networking with three major NOS packages.  With that basic foundation in place, the author branches out into how networking works with the Internet.  Finally, the topic of network security is covered in order to be able to keep yourself safe.<br />The material is a good mix of explanation and usable instructions.  For example, if you are setting up Linux to work in a networked environment, you can use the information in this book to help you get it set up and running.  There are a number of Tip and Note sidebars that add additional information (such as disk partitioning on Linux) that may not be exactly network related, but is important information to know within the context of networking.  Each chapter ends with an \\"Absolute Minimum\\" section that recaps the chapter with a number of bullet points that were covered.<br />Some people might find the cutesy graphics a bit too much.  But remember, this is a beginner's book, not a comprehensive \\"how to\\" for running your network.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are looking for an understandable introduction to networking that doesn't assume you want to become a certified networking engineer, this book will work well for you.	2003-11-28

Review<br />As I move more into the world of Java and Websphere development, I'm spending more and more time in the Websphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD) IDE.  This is built on the open source Eclipse framework and allows you great flexibility in extending the package to include tools that you write and incorporate into your workspace.  But while it may be possible for you to write your own tools, you'll need to have a good resource to guide you through the process.  This is the book to do that.<br />Erich Gamma is well known as one of the \\"Gang Of Four\\" who wrote the classic Design Patterns book.  Kent Beck is the father of Extreme Programming.  Given the pedigree of these two authors, you know that there will be plenty of proper programming techniques and concepts that underlie each chapter.  They also stress that to properly build tools for Eclipse, you have to understand the platform and work with it.  They spare no effort in making sure that understanding is present each step of the way.<br />The book works through a sample plug-in to help you run JUnit tests on your code.  The style closely follows an Extreme Programming type development cycle.  The basic functionality is built and tested, and then more comprehensive features are added.  By the time you finish the book, you should be well on your way to understanding tool writing for both your own work or for possible product sale.<br />IBM has concentrated on the Eclipse platform for the development of a rich client that can run web applications.  Because of the extensible nature of Eclipse, this could lead to multiple opportunities for add-on features that could easily be integrated into the new client.  By using the concepts in this book, you can put yourself ahead of the curve as IBM moves forward in the Lotus area.<br />Conclusion<br />This is an excellent book if you are looking to build tools (for yourself or others) for either Eclipse or WSAD.  Very readable and filled with essential knowledge you need for this type of development.need for this type of development.	2003-11-28

While the concept of developing mobile applications with Java has seen much hype over the years, the actual software has yet to hit the critical mass.  Yuan goes beyond the basics to take the developer to the next level of mobile development.<br />The book assumes more than beginning level J2ME knowledge.  If you've never dealt with J2ME, you'll need to start with a book such as Wireless J2ME Platform Programming by Vartan Piroumian.  This will give you the foundation you need in order to tackle the concepts here.<br />The layout of the book is well done for combining both conceptual and practical knowledge.  The author starts out with a brief discussion of the subject, such as why best practices are necessary when developing for a mobile platform.  The end of each chapter lists a number of additional resources (both books and web sites) that provide additional information on the subject.  In between those two feature is plenty of practical knowledge, along with actual code you can use to implement the type of application being discussed.  If you already have the prerequisite background in J2ME development, you'll get a lot out of this book.<br />Summary<br />For those who are tasked with building J2ME software, this is a book you need to read.  There is plenty of solid material, both concepts and actual code, to take you to the next level of mobile application development.	2003-11-28

This is a short little book that covers Cosby's thoughts on growing old, having your body wear out, and how we're obsessed with wanting to be healthy without making any changes to our lifestyle.<br />While he's trying to be humorous, I think he's trying to make some serious points about our society.  Such as, how people who are smokers will go to incredible lengths and discomforts to be able to have a cigarette.  Or how people who need to change their eating habits will play mental games to try and avoid it (or ask for drugs to erase the effects of the bad food).  Too much of it rings true...<br />If you have a chance to read it, I would recommend the book.  Don't know that I would go out of my way to buy it, but having a library a block away makes some things much easier...  :-)	2003-11-18

Books	5	29	30	N	N	Great book to help you move from Windows to Linux	Review<br />I've been interested in running a Linux desktop lately, and I've looked at a number of books to help me get there.  The problem is that you either get a good book on installing Linux, or you get a book that delves into the guts of Linux.  But what if you just want to learn how to do day-to-day activities (like create documents, spreadsheets, listen to music, etc.)?  If that's your situation, this is your book.<br />The author does a good job in explaining what Linux is and the installation process for the different distributions, like Red Hat, Mandrake, and SuSE.  Following his instructions, you should be able to get a Linux desktop running with little effort.  While not an in-depth install manual, the typical user should have enough detail to accomplish the job.  From there, you will get acquainted with the different commonly used tools in a Linux distribution like Konqueror, Kmail, GIMP, and OpenOffice.  It's this information that will help you make the transition from being competent in a Windows environment to being competent on your new Linux desktop.<br />For those who want to get beyond the user desktop experience, you will find plenty of references to how the Linux shell operates and how you can use the command line utilities to experience the full power of Linux.  It's enough to allow you to do useful tasks without bogging you down in too much detail.<br />The book also includes a Knoppix Linux CD in the back.  This CD allows you to run a Linux system on your computer without installing anything.  While somewhat slow (since it runs from the CD) and limited (can't easily save your work), it does give you the chance to experience Linux with no commitment.<br />Do keep in mind that this book is not meant to be a complete reference book for Linux.  If you want to become an expert on shell scripting, you'll want something more than this.  But if you're looking for the tool to help you cross over from Windows to Linux, you'll like the level of coverage.<br />Conclusion<br />This is the best book I've read so far that talks about how to install and run Linux as a typical user.  It also covers all the applications you will want to run on a regular basis.  Truly a very good book.e.<br />Conclusion<BR>This is the best book I've read so far that talks about how to install and run Linux as a typical user.

Review<br />Once you've installed Linux and you're looking at the windowing system desktop, you may be wondering what you can do that relates to practical work, like writing a memo, creating a spreadsheet, or developing a presentation.  You may even be wondering where the games are.  If you can't find those tools yourself, this book can help you out.<br />The first half of the book deals with the installation and system maintenance aspect of running Linux.  It's rather dated, in that it is based on the Red Hat 6.2 distribution.  Since 8.0 and 9.0 are now common, you may not want to trust this data too much.  There are a few good chapters on file management and command line utilities, so it's not a total loss.<br />The second half of the book starts discussing the different productivity applications that come with the Red Hat distribution.  The StarOffice suite is a replacement for Microsoft's Office suite.  To a large degree, the two applications can read files produced by each other.  And given that the price is free, it's a very good deal.  You'll find that OpenOffice is now a very common open source productivity suite, so you may find that StarOffice isn't as relevant as it was a couple of years ago.  The other chapters on applications can help you find the tools you use on a regular basis in the Microsoft Windows world.  Since each chapter is limited due to space, you will probably rely more on the software's help files to assist you in learning more about each package you choose to use.  Everyday Linux can help you get there, but it probably won't take you as far as you'd like to go.<br />Conclusion<br />This book may be a little too dated to be of practical use now.  The Red Hat distribution is far past 6.2, and the bundled applications have also advanced or been replaced with other applications.  Still, it is one of the few books that does try to cover a number of the Linux desktop applications.	2003-11-08

While I did the Red Hat install without the benefit of this book, it would have helped a lot to have it around.  There is so much that is new and unfamiliar...<br />The installation chapters are accurate as to what I experienced.  There's more background here than what I deduced from the install screens, so that will help you make intelligent choices.  The value of the book comes into play starting in chapter 4.  That's where you are looking at your Red Hat desktop and thinking \\"what now?\\"  There are a multitude of applications you can run under Red Hat that behave very closely to their Windows counterparts, but the power of Linux is being able to get under that UI and work with the Linux command line statements and utilities.  This is where you'll have the full ability to manage access to files, write scripts to take care of tasks like moving files, viewing your logs, and other various tasks.  The author has a nice blend of showing you the command along with examples of how you would use the command to execute specific tasks.<br />The book does not spend a lot of time covering the different applications that come packaged with the distributions.  Don't look for extensive coverage of the different windowing applications, OpenOffice, or any other standard open source software that you'll end up using on a daily basis.  Most of the focus is towards being able to manipulate Linux at the command line level or via the command line utilities.<br />If you already have a background of Unix or Linux, this book is probably going to be too simplistic for you.  While it could be used as a reference book for certain commands, I think that many users would end up looking for more detail on commands than is offered here.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are looking at getting into Linux, and particularly the Red Hat distribution, this would be a good starting point.  You may outgrow it quickly, but it will give you that first boost of confidence to get things running.that first boost of confidence to get things running.	2003-11-08

Review<br />If you are working in the IBM Websphere area for web application development, you will often encounter references to the Struts architecture framework.  IBM highly recommends this standard for Java application development for Websphere.  And if you want to acquaint yourself with that framework, this is a good book to get you there.<br /><br />The book starts out with a quick sample application that you can download so that you can see a representative Struts-style application.  Most of the details are glossed over, but it's only temporary.  It's followed by a chapter that goes into the architecture, explaining how it works and why the pieces fit together.  From there, another simple application is developed, this time with more explanation as to what is going on.  The rest of the book then goes into each part of the Struts framework, with copious code examples and illustrations.<br />The authors assume a fair amount of previous experience on the part of the reader.  The assumption is that there is a familiarity with HTML, JSP syntax, JavaBean conventions, and similar technologies.  The reader should also be familiar with URLs, web application archives (WAR files), and other concepts surrounding web application development.  By assuming these pre-existing skills, the authors can spend more time and space on Struts information.  So if you are just starting out in web application development in Java, you may struggle a bit with this information.<br />The authors also assume the use of Tomcat for the web application server.  Since I'm working with IBM's Websphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD), I've had to make some mental adjustments on how to get things to work in that environment without the author's direct instruction.  Because of this, I'd recommend that you be familiar with WSAD before using this book.<br />The style of the book is very readable, and the concepts are easy to grasp.  You may have to read over the material a couple of times to get it, but that's not a fault of the writing.  New technology and concepts can be difficult to grasp.  Struts is no exception.  I can say that I'm understanding the material more quickly than I expected, and that's always a good thing.<br />Conclusion<br />If you're looking to learn Struts, you would be well-served to get this book and dig in.t that's not a fault of the writing.

Review<br />One way to develop dynamic page content on a web application is to use JavaServer Pages technology.  This allows you to embed bits of Java code, or scriptlets, within the HTML page.  The web server interprets the scriptlet when the page is called and produces the content that is coded.  This is all good, but there are common tasks (such as looping) that each developer had to reinvent from scratch each time it was used in a page.  To prevent this repetitive coding, a common set of JSP tags were created to allow developers to concentrate on business logic instead of coding structures.  This creation is known as the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL).  That's what this book is all about...<br />The book starts with an examination of how JSP and XML tags come together to form the basis of JSTL.  This is followed by a number of chapters that cover the different tags that are used to control branching, flow, text formatting, and other various structures.  After the basics of JSTL, the author looks at a number of common tasks encountered by JSP developers and how they would be coded using JSTL.  Finally, the book wraps up with reference data needed on a regular basis as you use JSTL, such as the API.<br />The writing is clear and concise, with an abundance of diagrams and code to illustrate the points.  The mix of reference, tutorial, and practical examples is perfect, and every developer will be able to use this book in a number of situations.<br />Websphere developers (both web application and portlet development) will get the most out of this book when it comes to the IBM/Lotus world.  The use of JSTL will reduce the code complexity of your JSP pages and speed up your development efforts.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are developing JSP pages and haven't looked into the use of the JSTL area, get this book.  It will save you time and effort in your coding, and you'll be glad you did.	2003-11-03

In today's world of tech books that are hundreds of pages long, it's nice to see a short, &quot;no fluff&quot; guide to a subject that is actually usable.  This book fills that bill nicely.<br />Even if you've read about and implemented XP in your shop, there are times you need to review one of the points about how it all works together.  Since the author covers all the main points of XP, you can quickly find the information you need.  You also get a nice cross-reference at the end of each chapter that shows how each point relies on other parts of the methodology.  I find this very useful if you are faced with having to modify XP for your use.  It's recommended that you implement XP in its entirety, as it's meant to be more than the sum of its part.  But if you have to tweak something, you know how it will affect the other areas.<br />I would not recommend this book as your only resource if you were just starting to implement XP.  You really need to read Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck.  He's the founder of XP, and that book goes into much more detail as to the whys of the process.  But this book is one that each member of the team should have to keep the concepts fresh.<br />This is a very good book to use as a supplemental reference or reminder guide if you're using the XP methodology.  If you were looking for a concise explanation of XP, this would also work for you.  If you were looking for a more in-depth explanation of the methodology, I would recommend one of the books by Kent Beck.	2003-09-28

[Review of 4th edition]<br /><br />This book has influenced my Java skills more than any other...  Thinking In Java (4th Edition) by Bruce Eckel.  It's the first one that actually made object-oriented programming understandable for me.<br /><br />Contents: Introduction; Introduction to Objects; Everything Is an Object; Operators; Controlling Execution; Initialization & Cleanup; Access Control; Reusing Classes; Polymorphism; Interfaces; Inner Classes; Holding Your Objects; Error Handling with Exceptions; Strings; Type Information; Generics; Arrays; Containers in Depth; I/O; Enumerated Types; Annotations; Concurrency; Graphical User Interfaces; Supplements; Resources; Index<br /><br />I first got a copy of Thinking In Java back in 2000 when I was trying to wrap my mind around the language and object-oriented concepts.  I was fortunate to read it before taking a Java class at the Sun headquarters.  The person teaching object-oriented concepts was \\"less than stellar\\", but I was able to get my money's worth because I had been prepped with this book.  Eckel has the rare ability to explain and structure his content in such a way that you feel like you're getting a personalized lesson.  The diagrams and code samples work hand-in-hand to clarify each concept and to build your skill base step-by-step.  Once you get done working your way through the 1400+ pages (yes, it's big!), there's not much you won't be able to do or understand in the world of Java.<br /><br />Thinking In Java is one of two books I recommend to anyone looking to get started in object-oriented Java coding.  It will always hold a special place on my bookshelf, and I'll be forever in debt to Bruce Eckel for writing such an outstanding book.	2000-07-13
