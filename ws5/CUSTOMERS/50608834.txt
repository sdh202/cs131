I have been reading (and practicing with) The Journeying Workbook for many weeks now, and I am still very much into it. Although I have always enjoyed what I refer to as \\"self-help\\" books, I have to admit that I have never experienced anything like The Journeying Workbook. Heretofore, when someone mentioned the word meditation to me, it only conjured up a mental image of sitting with my eyes closed and waiting for some unknown peace to descend. That was because I had no practical instructions about meditation - only that word. Now, through the guidance of this book, I have been able to experience feelings and understandings that have always been beyond my reach. <br /> <br />For those people who never seem to have enough time to delve into their inner selves, I can only suggest that it will be well worthwhile to MAKE that time and use this book as a guide. It is only through those quiet minutes of true meditation that you can honestly explore your own depths and find your own inner peace. <br /> <br />***** In my opinion, The Journeying Workbook is remarkable and timely. Trisha Howell's meticulous instructions will allow anyone (even a beginner) to explore his or her inner self. As I have recently told many of my friends, I have enjoyed this experience in so many ways that it is difficult to settle on one explanation. In addition, as other readers have said, this is indeed an amazing technique. ***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-25

As the book opens she has it all, rich and well known, good job, healthy, with a picture perfect family, so it seems. Through wheeling and dealing she steals a building from her now spurned lover. The ill kept and unheated property soon catches fire during a bitter Chicago winter, killing thirteen elderly residents. Sara decides to increase her earnings, and turn the property into a nursing home. Her husband, soon proves to no longer be interested in her, and her only son proves to be a drug user and slacker. Still she loves and supports them both, thus her increasing need for more money.  <br /> <br />Craftily, Mrs. Rafton and her lawyer detail a plan to make the building an assisted living home to bypass any tricky, expensive and irritatingly ethical sanctions and regulations inspectors would insist on. But not only are the inspectors involved, but doctors, social workers, inspectors and more. Money helps grease the wheels of bureaucracy, easing the way for Mrs. Rafton to make millions off the suffering of others. Suffering does indeed occur when a 100 year old elevator breaks down and rips off a woman`s leg, a resident is scalded while unattended in a bath with the resultant death certificate falsified while poor diet, filth and cockroaches make the patients more ill after admittance.  <br /> <br />Mona Lockard, a very vocal and vivacious Christian lady, was a character that leaped off the page, her friend Florence Gaffney following closely behind. These two ladies charming and gregarious nature reminded me so much of actual people I know (no, Miss Terry, I don't mean any disrespect). Readers will be able to easily hear their voices bickering between themselves and passing on words of scripture and wisdom to unsuspecting visitors. Mona's niece, Melody, empowered after her divorce from a violent spouse, rescues Mona and works hard to make the ones responsible for those suffering in Mainstream Home to pay. As the Bible says, Miss Mona would quote, what you sow so shall thee reap - a lesson which Mrs. Rafton learns too little, too late. <br /> <br />**** This was a sweet surprise, filled to the brim with perfectly constructed conversations, captivating characters and shocking details. Vivid and vivacious characters paint a complex plot based in greed and avarice which possess Mrs. Sara Rafton, proving to be her eventual downfall. The author witnessed many incidents of abuse through her 22 year career as a licensed administrator of nursing homes. Based on real events this gripping and thrilling drama is one you can't help but enjoy. A bit of romance on the side, makes this book an interesting read. However, be warned that there are scenes of abuse that may break your heart. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Danelle Callahan.	2005-06-21

Although the beginning lacks small niceties such as character description, the detailed politics and economy made me easily fall into this book. Some sentence structure seems a bit clumsy, but in the end the raw emotion and feeling gets to the core of the reader. Through out the book, great metaphors show clearly point of view and facts of this new world created, creates a rich tapestry in which the reader can simply invest. Other weaves of words, such as \\"the blood was like cataracts on the stairs\\" was haunting and evocative.  <br /> <br />This novel describes a world filled with opposites, surrounded by suspicion. On the sky city of Tyr, magic is mighty. The magic of the elders kept the beautiful climate-controlled city far above the dead ice world below it. The elders are chosen from the ruling class of nobles. The elders possess magical staves, which legend tells us are from the same magical tree and were once one thus imbued with powers stronger than others could imagine. But all is not tranquil in this seemingly perfect world. Rebels fight against the old ways, and lash out with bombs planted at important buildings. Their anger is sparked by rumors only some people dare speak: the staves have lost their power and with their power goes the elders, this is why the city is falling towards the icy death below. As proof of this, a cool wind blows daily across the city, when before it did not.  <br /> <br />For any society, determining its worth can be determined through visiting how their criminals are treated. It seems on Tyr that the elders, at least most of them, don't want to listen to dissenting opinions and call death sentences on those who oppose them. Unknown to Carn at the time is that his father has politically maneuvered his son into position to be the next elder.  <br /> <br />This book uses opposition to the fullest to show the disparity barely visible under the perfect surface of their society. Noble verses peasant, magic verses science, old ways verses new ways; the book surprised me with the depth given each side until the reader begins to pick sides in each fight. Who will win is not immediately known, but what is fact is that the city is falling and with it its society.  <br /> <br />The main young character, Carn, really pulls me in because he is a rebel, more of someone who thinks on his own and doesn't follow traditions, but his father wants him to follow traditions. This character will really appeal to the readers as there will be many young readers who will empathize with him, see themselves in this character's place and their parent(s) as the father in the novel. This classic plot will feed the readers' innate rebellion and will make them want to read more and see what happens to me... I mean Carn.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, down on the ice world below, not all is as dead as the landscape. There was one banished long ago who now rules there, and wishes revenge on those in the sky city who wronged him. With steady sure plotting and patience this banished one strives to mete out the punishment for the crimes against himself and others. The eventual fight scenes between the rebels and other citizens was amazing. The black clothed rebels unknowingly fight for the banished one. The multiple uses of Garret's gadgets in fight scenes are truly amazing, more so in such a technology bereft society. The magic of the city is mostly through other staves, which send out waves of air to the intended target. The elder staves differ in power, but seem to feed the user magic in some mysterious manner. Although not the most powerful of weapons, I found this to be quite a change from the fire and bullets usually used as weapons in similar novels. There is also the hint of romance in the book, which increased its appeal to me, for whenever you add heart to characters it makes them more defined.  <br /> <br />The ending was phenomenal. The fight scenes reminded me much of the final battle in Star Wars \\"Revenge of the Sith\\". This colossal conflict finally comes to an end, which if written any other way, would be anticlimactic. This ending is as great as the beginning, and together the references to the weather tie the book together nicely. Yet the exact constructs of the new society are not spelled out definitively, which makes for a mystery to encourage readership in any following book. <br /> <br />Things are stated that they return to normal, but I don't agree with this as when the book began, we didn't see a truly tranquil picture of the society. After the battles of opposites in the book, I expected some description on the juxtaposition of differences. The magic and Garret's gadgets would cause some controversy in the society I would think. Perhaps this will be addressed in a second book? I can only hope. <br /> <br />**** With the plot of opposites, vivid character description and haunting metaphors, The Elder Staves gets a 4 out of 5 stars. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Danelle Callahan for Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-16

For more than four centuries, Daphne Urban has walked the world's night, existing, but not truly living. Love is too dangerous and eternity is rapidly becoming an exercise in monotony. Monotony would be welcome, however, when her world is turned upside down and she is conscripted into service for the US government as part of a highly secret team of vampires, along with a ditzy blonde Southern Belle and a shallow, gay vampire searching for his big break on Broadway. Perhaps the madness of the plan is its genius. Sent to prevent a dangerous man from gaining artifacts that could lead to worldwide destruction, the three's mission is soon complicated when Daphne is contacted by another governmental agency operative. Darius della Chisea has no idea she is a vampire, just that she works for another branch of the service, and he wants to work with her for reasons of his own. Though Daphne finds him extremely attractive, something she's not felt since accidentally killing Byron, there is a large drawback, Darius hates vampires, and does enjoy killing them. Romance is of secondary or even lower importance. First, she has to save the world. Highly classified mission or not, Daphne may have to resort to the most trusted method of accomplishing the impossible, calling in her mother, Mar Mar, an ancient teen aged hippie. <br /> <br />***** Inevitably, comparisons to Buffy, La Femme Nikita, Alias, early Anita Blake, and Rachel Morgan's various series can be made. However, those comparison's only go so far. The Darkwing Chronicles promise to be unique; exciting, fast paced, funny and just plain fun. It has everything, humor, action, mystery, and a bit of romance. Let's hope the wait between books is not long. *****	2005-06-07

Like her sisters, she is gifted with powers that can be both a torment and a blessing; hers give her a special relationship with all things of the sea, especially dolphins. Yet, her angst over her powers is at least one of the things that kept her from finding her true love with Sasha, the dangerous Russian agent she loved and lost four years ago. Now, Sasha has come back into her life and he needs help that only her powers can provide. Is this a second chance for them or will his mission take a deadly turn that ends all their hopes? <br /> <br />*** Though not as strong a series as the early Dark books, it's hard not to like a book with dolphins in it. Abby's emotional turmoil is very understandable, seeing how her gifts have set her apart from the majority of the world. Supporting characters provide comic relief and quirks that lighten the seriousness of the overall plot. ***	2005-06-07

It tells the story of an inquisitive little frog who lives near a castle moat. One day when his tiny black eyes were peeping above the water, he saw a very colorful royal gift box that sent his imagination soaring. He knew it definitely contained something special - but what could it be?  <br /> <br />As children turn the pages of this vividly illustrated book, they begin a fantastic journey with the little frog as he searches for clues about the contents of the gift box. Their pilgrimage will take them high into a beanstalk where a caterpillar is happily munching along. There in that beanstalk they learn that the gift in the box can say, \\"Hello.\\" Later, on a sailboat with the wind billowing the sails, they learn that the gift in the box can be blown. As each new clue is discovered, they can ponder what the frog thinks the gift is by watching the many expressions on his scrunched up face. It can warm you. It can be planted. It can be thrown. What can this something special be? In the end, children will discover what the gift is, and they will come to realize that this magical gift is no good at all until you give it away.  <br /> <br />***** The illustrations in this book are stunning and the attention to the smallest detail is remarkable - like the tiny black ant that is pushing a snowball and wearing a red scarf around his neck. The act of turning each page opens another part of the little frog's color filled world to delight children everywhere. Even the cover has immediate eye appeal. Green vines twist and twine themselves around the page to form each letter of the title, Something Special, and most children won't fail to notice the miniature snail and dragonfly who are also doing their part. When you couple that expressive script along with the little green frog's smiling face and curious eyes, what could be a more captivating and picturesque scene?  <br /> <br />This is an enchanting book, and is highly recommended for bedtime reading. ***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-05

When I first started reading The Road of Silk by Barbara Dyson-Williams and Matt Afsahi published by Synergy Books (ISBN: 0-9747644-6-9), I was surprised at the brilliant imagery it painted for me. First, writing a book is difficult enough, but having to weave two authors ideas together is more difficult. However, The Road of Silk does indeed pull through, although not on the level of other double-authored books such as Eddings and Weis/Hickman, I can't wait to read the next book.  <br /> <br />Road of Silk is set in a world where magic is almost unknown, the teachings have long since been nearly forgotten, the teachers disappeared, and with them, the true believers. The belief was simple, if a person lived their life well, then they would go to an alternate plane of existence, where everything is created by those with good and pure souls. Through the middle of this land ran the road of silk. This land existed outside of normal time and space, but could, through true belief, intersect this world. But those with evil in their hearts, greed or egotism could not use this path. It was only for those who are pure of heart, and those who believe. It has been a long time since these beliefs were held common, believers are rare. Evil reigns in the country of Dragonval, where dragons darken the skies, and corrupted desires fuel political wrangling. However, the prophesy says that there will be the One, who can create or destroy the road of silk.  <br /> <br />Queen Yasemin of Gwendomere chooses to ally herself by marriage to King Amir of Dragonval, to save her country. A lone ruler, her parents both dead, she chooses to marry an unknown man to save her country from invasion by the fierce and feared soldiers of Dragonval. Her nurse and dear companion, Nitae, shows her the book Yasemin's mother secured secretly for her daughters future use. On her journey, again and again she goes through trials and must choose good or evil, and the outcome of those decisions affect so much more than herself.  <br /> <br />Through magical means, conjured dangers and well-placed magicians, Yasemin is shipwrecked with a slave and the leader of the Dragonval army. It is a frightening time, when she is able to learn some of the ideas set down in strange language, mostly unreadable, in her mother's book. Eventually, she meets the holy people on the Holy Mountain of Sorania and learns much more. When she makes it to Dragonval at last, attempts on her life continue to occur. Kidnapped, she is taken to see her grandfather, the evil Serpeta that lives deep in the bowels of the earth below the castle. He yearns to rule the country again, and through giving himself to the evil one, he has great power. But there is always a price for such power. He is hideous, but his master has said he will rule again if he can sacrifice Yasemin in ritual. Preparation begins as a rescue mission is carried out by the Demolisherian, Goliagoth, on the order of King Amir.  <br /> <br />King Amir's first wife, Medusimia, is not so happy to have her husband take another wife and plots against Yasemin and Amir with Vulmire, the evil behind Serpata. Although she doesn't realize it yet, she has made a choice that will change history.  <br /> <br />*** The plot has concepts that will appeal to both men and women. Intense fight scenes, battle planning, political maneuvering, magic-use and sensually lush intimate scenes all make for a book that anyone could truly enjoy. Unexpected and imaginative plot twists, vivid eastern imagery and creative use of magic throughout the story pulled me further into the plot. By the end of the book I was begging there was a second for me to read. While the metaphors are sometimes difficult to imagine, the creative and imaginative plot pulls you in. You identify and feel for the characters, picking the side you want to win. Eastern culture is delicately woven into the plot, making for a truly exotic feeling novel. Mark your calendars for December 2005, as I give this book three stars out of a possible five. ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Danelle A. Callahan.	2005-06-01

And a new flu is born.... <br /> <br />Dr. Noah Haldane, of the World Health Organization, knows that humanity is overdue for a new killer flu, like the great influenza pandemic of 1919 that killed more than twenty million people in less than four months. So when a mysterious new strain of flu is reported in the Gansu Province of mainland China, WHO immediately sends a team to investigate. <br /> <br />Haldane and his colleagues soon discover that the new disease, dubbed Acute Respiratory Collapse Syndrome, is far more deadly than SARS, killing one in four victims, regardless of their age or health. But even as WHO struggles to contain the outbreak, ARCS is already spreading to Hong Kong, London, and even America. <br /> <br />***** In an age when every single person in the world is connected by three commercial flights or fewer, a killer bug can travel much faster than the flu of 1919. Especially when someone is spreading the virus on purpose. This makes this novel even scarier to consider. *****	2005-05-18

The Three Mrs. Parkers follows the lives of three women as they come together to live with each other in the foothills of the mountains near the border of North Carolina and South Carolina. There are many controlling factors that bring each of them to this joining of their lives, and this is a place and circumstance that neither of them would have thought possible. <br /> <br />Winifred, at age 75, is the oldest of the Parker women and she has traveled the longest distance to reach what she hopes will be a refuge for her in Salem, South Carolina. There she plans to live out her days with her widowed daughter-in-law, fifty-two-year-old Zoe Parker, at Zoe's invitation. However, what Zoe doesn't realize is that Winifred's health is rapidly declining. <br /> <br />Zoe's telephone call asking Winifred to come was quite an unexpected opportunity for Winifred. Unexpected because she and Zoe had never liked each other and hadn't been in contact for years. Winifred had never accepted Zoe as her son's wife and had cut all ties with both of them shortly after the wedding. However, just as Winifred has an agenda so does Zoe. Zoe badly needs money to keep her from losing the beautiful mountain home that was left to her by her own parents; Winifred could provide the needed finances for that. <br /> <br />The third Parker woman is Katie, Zoe's daughter. Winifred, by her own choice, has never met Katie, although she is her only grandchild. Katie is a young divorce and has come to Salem following the death of her 9-year-old brain damaged daughter, Laurie Ann. She needs her mother's help to heal and a quiet place to grieve. <br /> <br />***** Joan Medlicott has a knack for getting inside the feelings and dreams of her characters in a way that allows the reader to completely understand and empathize with each of them, and I especially liked the paring of these three remarkable women. As they learn to live together and help each other, these three women redefine the meaning of struggle, compromise, forgiveness, and love. <br /> <br />This story is not \\"another gentle read,\\" as some like to say. It is HIGH DRAMA as it tells the stories of these women's lives. I have to confess that I was not prepared for the obstacles these women had to overcome, and I certainly didn't expect to be sitting on the edge of my seat wishing I could bite my nails - but I was! Bring it on, Joan! *****	2005-03-22

Most young children will remember the story of Little Red Ridinghood, and how shivery and on edge they felt when the big bad wolf came along. I know I certainly do. Therefore, when I saw this updated version of the story, I knew it would be well understood by the children of today, because it relates Red's misadventures in the forest to the bullying issues of today's generation. As an added plus, this version blends in traditions from this Red's Native American heritage. <br /> <br />In Hank Wesselman's story, Red's parents must work on Saturdays and Red always gets to spend that time with her grandmother. Of course, the grandmother usually picks Red up in the car, but on this Saturday, the car won't start and Grandmother can't come. Because she was more than a little disappointed, Red decided to pack a goodie-bag and surprise her grandmother with a visit by taking the shortcut through the woods. The items she put in the bag included (among other things) granola bars and apples. <br /> <br />This story is interesting because the big bad wolf of the original story is replaced by two bullies (Spike and Butch) from Red's school who harass her, and the wolf seems to be a shadow guardian who is following along to protect Red whenever necessary. Spike and Butch are nervy bullies too, because they chase Red right on into Grandmother's house. Spike even shoved Red through the front door and right into the living room! That's when Grandmother really shows her stuff - complete with Hopi throwing sticks! (That part made me want to cheer!) Those two bullies were falling all over themselves and our magical white wolf even nipped old Spike right in the seat of his pants - adding insult to injury. Of course, Red also dialed 911 and everyone waited for the police to arrive. <br /> <br />The story doesn't end there. Oh no, there is much more to this tale with lessons to be learned, introductions to be made, and a Native American heritage to be claimed. You haven't seen the last of the white wolf either. <br /> <br />***** People who think this is just another retelling of a classic story are in for a major surprise when they read this book.

It explains how a young girl taught the people (grownups included) to cope with the unknown. <br /> <br />Every year at the same time, the Murkles tried to enter the tiny village of Summerville. This day had come to be known as the dreaded Day of the Murkles, and all the people of the village gathered at the river to prevent the Murkles from entering. Every year the Murkles tried to enter, and every year they were forcefully turned away by the well-meaning people. What was the problem with allowing the Murkles to enter the village? Well, not only were they different, but they also smelled bad! No one knew why the diminutive creatures kept coming back every year - and no one wanted to find out. <br /> <br />Then one day a little girl named Juliana knelt down and looked into the eyes of a baby Murkle and made a huge decision that changed her village forever. She stepped aside and allowed the baby to wriggle past when no one was looking. Juliana knew that being different was not a good reason to ostracize the Murkles. <br /> <br />As this story unfolds, Juliana persuades the mayor to allow all the Murkles to make their journey through the village by promising him that something wonderful would happen if he did. The mayor finally agreed to heed Juliana's words, because there were too many Murkles to hold back anyway. So, the stinky Murkles soon waddled through the streets, frolicked in a small pond, and sunned themselves on the rocks. After they did these things, the heavenly odor of orange blossoms filled the air, and the townspeople were amazed - but this was only the beginning of many changes for the small village. Of course, as could be anticipated, every change brought moans and groans of woe from the people because they always expected calamity. Then, when each change turned into something wonderful, they became excited again. It was in this manner that Juliana's promise to the mayor was finally fulfilled and all the townspeople learned to withhold judgments, stop being afraid, and embrace differences and change. <br /> <br />From the scarlet Firestars, that strangely appear on the villagers' perfect lawns, to the odd looking birds (known as Tanzas) that swoop down to snatch those Firestars - bright colors leap from this book's pages. Each scene is perfectly pictured and could almost tell the entire story to a small child, but that eye-appeal is not the only thing that makes this book special. The many lessons that are so subtly taught by a child named Juliana also make it special - as well as extraordinary. <br /> <br />***** What a charming story, and what a wonderful way to allow a child's mind to see things in a different way - without fear. This is highly recommended reading. ***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson of Huntress Reviews.	2004-12-31

There is an ancient legend about a creature known as the \\"Skinwalker\\". It is neither a man nor a beast. And when people on the \\"Rez\\" are found brutally murdered, everyone blames it on the Skinwalker. Nathan Brittles is a member of the tribal police. Being realistic, he contacts Laura Winslow, a computer hacker/private eye who also happens to be his lover. Nathan and Laura hit the trail of the killer quickly, before any more of Nathan's friends die. <br /> <br />*** This novel is like two-in-one. There is the Skinwalker mystery and then there is the casino. The owner of the casino is planning to make it big (again) by making movies. He is constantly trying to woo Laura who shows little interest at all. <br /> <br />The story is very slow in beginning and I found myself having a hard time getting into the tale. The author, David Cole, uses Indian legends and modern day technology in this story that is filled with twists and turns. This is a great idea, however, I found the wording to be distracting. I had to reread pages often to understand what was happening. I also found many things to be too predictable, especially involving the casino owner. I could not help but like the characters of Nathan and Laura. The author did a good job on creating their personalities. I even learned a bit about Native American beliefs and customs. All-in-all, I believe this to be a good book. A little slow, a bit predicable, but good. *** <br /> <br />Reviewed by D. Wilson.	2004-10-18

After the race, Hannah is beside herself with curiosity and asks if they had won a settlement. Valerie Stone explains that they had sold her life insurance. A few days later, Valerie is dead and Hannah starts to ask questions of why. Her friend seemed so fit and the cause of death, heart attack, did not feel right to her. Hannah finds out about viaticals which, in layman's terms, means you can buy into an insurance policy and it may take six months to a year to mature. She also finds out that this is also a scam to take people's money and to scam bigger insurance companies. <br /> <br />When more people begin to die, Hannah gets more involved. One of her friends, who lives in the community where a couple of the people had died, starts fearing for her life. She notices the same man loitering around where the people lived and died.

I cannot even begin to explain how happy I was to see this book. Grace, Hannah, and Amelia step gracefully back into our lives with this fifth installment of the Covington series. Our Ladies are now aging a bit, but that is part of what makes the Covington stories so realistic. It allows us to identify with The Ladies more as old friends than as characters in a novel. Amelia, the youngest of the trio, is now 70-years old. Grace, our loving grandmother figure, is 71-years old, and Hannah, the most robust of the three, is 75-years old. If you read the first book of this series, you will surely remember that they ran away from a nursing home to establish a life with each other in Covington. Hey, that is true intestinal fortitude! <br /> <br />As the story begins, Charles (Grace's son Roger's longtime companion) has recently died from AIDS. The graveside funeral service is being held in December with the Ladies and a small party of mourners in attendance. Although most of their friends and neighbors had not really known Charles, they gathered at the graveside out of love and respect for Grace. <br /> <br />Joan Medlicott's descriptive first lines set the scene: <br /> <br />\\"The wind moaned as it skirted the white clapboard wall of Cove Road Church and snaked between the headstones in the small cemetery, tweaking women's coats and burrowing with stealthy fingers between men's gloves and wrists.\\" <br /> <br />Hannah Parrish's friend, Max, is pressing her to set a wedding date. This would be a marriage between friends for convenience only, and something about that rubs our Hannah the wrong way. Then, unexpectedly, Hannah received a mysterious diary from her past in the mail. This diary's contents have the power to turn Hannah's life upside down. It was written by a woman whose husband had been madly in love with Hannah many years ago, and with whom Hannah had a lengthy affair. Hannah had not realized that the wife even knew about the long ago affair, and her heart is tortured by the woman's entries in that diary. <br /> <br />Amelia senses unease among the Ladies, and suggests that they all take an exotic Caribbean cruise to raise their spirits. She has brochures at the ready, and the Ladies finally agree. What an amazing time the three ladies had on their cruise can best be explained by saying that it was everything they had dreamed it would be, and more, as each of our Ladies indulged in her favorite shipboard pastime - dancing, gambling, and introspection. <br /> <br />Upon returning from their cruise, the Ladies have wonderful adventures to tell, but there is a conflict brewing between Amelia and Hannah that has the ability to dissolve their living arrangements and disrupt their long-standing friendships. <br /> <br />This book is filled with everyday life, as it weaves itself around family members and the problems that are faced by young and old alike. For instance, Grace learns more than she wants to know about modern dangers, as her young protg, Lucy, becomes the victim of an Internet predator at her middle school. Of course, our Ladies and their friends all rally to Lucy's rescue. When Grace continues to ignore her diet, she lands in the hospital and comes to realize that she must accept the reality of her diabetes and face that problem head on. Then we have Amelia, who must contend with jealousy as Roger begins to monopolize the time of her young photography companion. Finally, new happiness enters the Ladies' lives when Hannah's pregnant daughter has a beautiful baby boy, giving them all cause to rejoice as this child becomes part of their extended family. Then, when Hannah learns to accept her past for what it was, she is able to set a wedding date with Max. <br /> <br />Joan Medlicott is masterful with the art of creative writing. Her timely use of metaphors, similes, and personification enhances the reader's enjoyment of her stories. These tools deliver startlingly clear images to the reader, thereby making the text more enjoyable and comprehensible. Mental images can often transport readers to a place where they can grasp what the author's message truly is and more readily identify with the story's characters. This is Ms. Medlicott's fort. <br /> <br />*****At Home in Covington is very highly recommended reading. This book is not only for those people who like what some refer to as a \\"gentle read\\" (oh, how those words annoy me), but also for the many people who simply enjoy good literature and fascinating stories about human nature in everyday life. At Home in Covington, like the complete Covington Series, is a winner!***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson for Huntress Reviews.	2004-10-14

Terri has her own baggage. After becoming a young widow, falling for a man with a medical condition does not appeal to her, but given the clues she has, IV poles, blood in the fridge, serum... and so on, it's a logical conclusion to make that Bastien's secret is illness.

A serial killer is stalking the streets of America, which can only mean that Eve Dallas has new dead to avenge within the law's limits. \\"Helping\\" her is a psychic who seems to be able to tune into the murders, despite Eve's skepticism. Dismissing the usefulness of this method, Eve tries a psychological battle with the killer, not dreaming it will place her, Nadine, and Peabody in the line of fire. When one of her closest friends becomes a victim, nothing short of death will stand between Eve and putting the killer away forever.  <br /> <br />***** Everything that makes you love Eve is part of this book; terse humor, Roarke, action, a mystery with a twist, and the vicarious thrill of sharing Eve's way of handling frustration.

Even if she was not involved in law enforcement, she would still have to keep her deadly secret; she is a telepath with powers rivaling the hated dens, a race of psi warriors who has been banned from civilization. Only her partner knows this about her, but even he does not know the depth of her hate for the dens.

Seeing into one another's minds forges a bond that surpasses the hate and places them in more peril.  <br /> <br />*** Set in an exotic locale, this is a lesson in human nature that is subtly told and has much to teach everyone in a world where different often means bad to the ignorant. *** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-18

Despite all the warm fuzziness, there is only a thin thread of Christian value to be drawn from the tales we all grew up viewing. Delving into the personal histories of the men who shaped the Disney Empire and analyzing the most notable animated features, the author takes us on an odyssey of discovery. After reading this book, it is childishly easy to see how some of the aberrations of Christianity, notably \\"word of faith\\" heresy has been able to grab the weak minded by the throat so easily. I won't go so far as to say it will make those who still love Cinderella or Snow White and borrow children for an excuse to watch them will toss out their dvd's or vhs tapes, but it sprinkles them with salt.

Yet, if anything, that has made things worse, because as minds have been opened, the brains and hearts have fallen out, crushing values and morality underneath. Readers are given a history lesson in this concise volume, but a lesson with a difference. The past is traced not so much by what happened but by going to the heart, seeing the effects of history on values and philosophy.

Once upon a time, two little friends, Melon and Turnip, lived an idyllic life in their garden paradise. They had warm sunshine to loll beneath, gentle breezes, and sparkling waters. They were strong and healthy, and life was good. But for Melon and Turnip something was missing. They both craved adventure - especially Turnip! <br /> <br />Finally, Turnip could stand it no more, so he spun his root out of the soil and enticed Melon to break free of her vine and join him as he set out to see the world. Melon was afraid, but she managed to conquer her fear, snap her vine, and tumble down the hill with Turnip. Thus begins the adventures of these two friends.  <br /> <br />As you turn the pages of this book, you will be caught up in the vibrant illustrations, provided by Paul Lopez, that bring this imaginative story so vividly to life. Melon and Turnip are beautifully created, and the expressions on their faces leave no doubt about their feelings. How wonderful is that for a child?  <br /> <br />You will ride joyously along with these two friends as they splash into the river to begin their journey. You will be engrossed with them as they later enter the woods where they encounter many obstacles, make many friends, and learn very valuable lessons about life. It is in those woods where they meet a singing apple tree, a squirrel happily packing nuts away for the winter, a pine tree who lifts them high in his branches to view the valley, and even a snake and a rat! Each of these encounters teaches the two friends a special lesson about overcoming fear, understanding differences, and treating others the same way you would want them to treat you. <br /> <br />Just when you think this delightful story is over, the author and the illustrator give us even more to think about. In the back of the book there are several extra pages. The first page has all the words to the songs being sung by the trees and creatures in the woods. The second is devoted to a tiny character whose name is squash, and includes a questioning process about overcoming fear and living your dream. The last two pages are from the illustrator who explains his artwork (complete with drawings) and also includes a questioning process for budding young artists. <br /> <br /> <br />*****It is almost impossible to say enough good things about this book! It is so colorful, and its characters are so charmingly personified, that any child would grab it off the shelf on eye appeal alone. The hot peppers in the garden definitely look HOT. The huge crow that swooped down to grab at Melon appeared quite menacing, and Melon's luminous eyes showed her fear. Even though I'm very familiar with Trisha Howell's talents, I was still blown away by this offering. She and Paul Lopez have outdone themselves! I highly recommend The Adventures of Melon and Turnip for children everywhere.*****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson of Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-06

Facing a custody challenge for the neophyte witch, Savannah, whom she has cared for during the last year, she turns to her coven for support; however, the old biddies are less than helpful. Gambling on using a human lawyer to fight magical opponents should have been a good risk, but it turned out to be a deadly one for the human after he wins the first round.

At first, Paige is reluctant to accept his help, but as her coven deserts her completely, the town makes her a pariah, and her enemies seem to hold all the good cards, she has no choice. When Savannah becomes a woman, officially, things go from bad to abysmal rapidly. As the dark side beckons, will Paige's love be strong enough to save Savannah from herself?  <br /> <br />***** Without any doubt in my mind, I can say that Dime Store Magic is the best book in this series that has been excellent since Book I. Light humor makes the dramatic ending stand out in sharp contrast. Most laudable is the fact that each book in this series stands alone and complete, so that you can enter it at any point; and though are eager for the next book, readers are not left dangling in mid air. ***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-06

She is her high school's version of Dear Abby, secretly dispensing sage advice to the troubled hearts at her school under the alias Ask Annie. Even when not hidden under a column's pseudonym, Jenny is a fairly helpful young lady, trying to right the wrongs she dares to and making real friends among the less popular kids.  <br /> <br />Then, a new guy comes to school, and Jen befriends him. However, this is not just a guy, this is Luke Striker, the heartthrob of every red blooded female who has recognized that guys are a good thing. No matter how much Jenny denies it, she is cast as Luke Striker's girlfriend, and life is .... interesting. Reporters flock to her door. She is on the cover of magazines, and can't even go to the prom without using tricks to escape the flashing cameras. Strangely enough, Luke, though she likes him a lot, is not who makes Jenny's heart throb.  <br /> <br />**** Every adult should make time to read a few younger adult books. Authors like Ms Cabot offer a refreshing view of life in no nonsense, uncomplicated terms. The laughs are plenty, though at times, bittersweet. Through Jenny's eyes, you get a fresh perspective on what's important in life. The real princes aren't always the star of the ball or prom. **** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-06

Dying is supposed to be the ultimate simplification strategy, but for Elizabeth Taylor (Betsy), it just added tenfold to her problems. Not only is she a vampire, but she is the long foretold Queen of the Undead. Unfortunately, it doesn't pay as well as some monarchies, so she needs a job, and winds up working in \\"heaven\\", aka, Macy's shoe department. All would seem to be perfect now. She has a dream job, for her at least, a new mansion, curtesy of being best friends with a millionaire, and never has to worry about wrinkles or cellulite again. There are some snags. Sinclair, the Vampire King, is still making himself a nuisance and strongly objects to her working at all, much less in such a lowly position. A local pastor is shepherding a bunch of Buffy wannabes in a vampire killing spree, which is it Betsy's responsibility to stop, and last, but not least, her wicked stepmother has done the unthinkable.  <br /> <br />**** Betsy continues to be a charming heroine in this second Undead book that breaks new ground in the vampire and chick lit fields. It will be helpful to have read the first one, but is perhaps not essential. While most vamp books read like an hour long drama serial, this one comes off like a sitcom, making for a breezy and light escape. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-06

Despite J.R.R. Tolkien's insistance that it was not an allegory, millions of Christians see the greatest story ever told just beneath the surface, as if runic words inscribed its pages. Whether or not you read that into this modern mythos, it can not be denied that Aragorn, Gandalf, and the rest of the Fellowship captured the meaning of virtue in their lives. From wisdom to loyalty to graciousness, they were examples of what we should be. Likewise, in Denethor, Grima, Sauron, etc, we see what we should strive not to be. In this book, the author takes these traits two by two, the good and the evil, and shows us how it played out in Middle Earth, in the Bible, and how to carry it into life. Given the popularity of this saga, it works with great efficiency. It would be a wonderful cross generational Bible study, especially since she takes the time to clue readers in on the teen jargon's meaning. For that alone, parents should invest in this book. It's a book designed to be read over several weeks, but you will have to exercise restraint not to sail through it in one sitting, so readable is it. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-06

Losing a parent, moving to a new town, having a precocious kid sister while you are just normal, and starting a new school are all crises, no matter what your age, and especially if you are a teen ager; add to the mix the fact that your parents are both super heroes, your kid sister becoming one, and you have no powers, life moves from routinely gray to dismally dark. Jessie's life is in the dismally dark category. Then, in a moment of blinding pain and exploding windows, her wish to have powers comes true, and then some. To all indications, she may be the most gifted of all the heroes, but she has little to no control of her talents. The logical thing to do would be to transfer her to the school for such special children, but the emphasis on that title is children. Jessie would be at least seven years older than all the other students, and that is so not cool with her. Besides, she would have to leave the two guys who are competing for her attention and who she is trial dating. Speaking of dating, her mother is desecrating the memory of her dad by starting to date the local top cop, and both of her own dates have a secret or two themselves.  <br /> <br />**** Speaking as one who whirled herself dizzy wanting to turn into Wonder Girl but never considered the drawbacks to getting the wish, this is a laugh out loud fun read for all ages.

However, her beginning starts off rockily when her coach is held up by bandits. Fortunately, her stash of cash is hidden well enough to remain safe. The robber escapes with little more than a kiss. Shaken by that, Ellen goes from the frying pan to the fire when the local banker is stunned into hostility upon learning that C E Beckwith is not a man, but money proves handy in unruffling feathers. So begins her new life, but the past is not done with her. With a fortune dragging her down and hindering her faith, Ellen is in a prime spot to be hurt by that past in more than one way.

Seldom has a book had as much impact on society, particularly a fiction one, as the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. In the year and a half since it burst onto the bestseller lists, people who never thought much about Jesus have begun talking about Him and some who have thought about Him have changed their views. Those who remain faithful are often challenged at the water cooler to explain where in the Bible the Mrs. Jesus section is, or some such thing, and need something more than being able to say that is untrue because it's what they believe. To fill this gap, a host of books debunking the &quot;Magdalene Files&quot; have emerged, but this one stands ahead of the others. <br />  <br /> **** While most are thin volumes that address superficial difficulties, The Gospel Code digs in deeper, exploring the root of the problem that has more branches than just Da Vinci. After reading this, you will know about the gnostic heresies, the alleged &quot;lost books of the Bible,&quot; and have a good grounding in early church history. For that alone, even if you never read Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or DaVinci Code, etc., this is a time worthy book. ****  <br />  <br /> Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-07-28

If you know a child who has lost a loved one, or spends time with a special grandparent, step inside this book and join this unlikely pair as they take a beautiful walk through nature.  <br /> <br />Throughout this story, you will be deeply moved when you realize the many ways in which Heaven manifests itself - if you will only look and listen. Heaven can be found in sunbeams, in the sweet smell of the air, or in the sounds that are all around us. As this young girl and her grandmother walk through the woods, they find it everywhere. It is in the vibrant colors of the leaves, in the trickle of a stream, and surely it is in the eyes of a little girl's grandmother.  <br /> <br />How far is heaven?

As we turn the pages of this book, we enter the mind of a thoughtful young boy as he muses over countries in the world that are far away and maybe vastly different from his own. While gazing out over a hilltop, he begins to realize that even though the places may be far away, they must be the same in many ways because we share one world. <br /> <br />Even though Tanzania is a long way from where we live, we share the same sun. The children there play under the brilliance of golden sunbeams, just as we do.  <br /> <br />The wind that blows the kites of children in Japan is the same wind that ruffles wisps of hair on the heads of our children. Russia may be cold and snowy, but snowflakes taste the same to all children. Other languages may sound strange to our ears, but the laughter of children everywhere can often carry a more powerful message than words. <br /> <br />As adults, we frequently dwell on the many differences of places like Tanzania, Switzerland, Algeria, Japan, Peru, China, Russia, Costa Rica, Canada, Australia, and even Iraq. It is often ONLY those differences that we think about, but this young boy allows us to see beyond those differences because he sees ONLY the similarities. Isn't that a magnificent concept for a child to discover? Wouldn't it also be incredibly wonderful if everyone felt that same way? If we can teach our children to think FIRST of the similarities that we have with other countries and other people, we can foster the ideal of living in peace. These are the lessons so simply taught in this book. <br /> <br />***** When children see this colorful book, overflowing with pictures of other children at play, their immediate reaction is delight! Then, as they turn the pages, they have no problem understanding how we are all so similar. The words of the poem are uncomplicated and plain spoken, and the beautiful watercolors allow children to absorb even the smallest detail. That is when they can use their imagination to weave their own verypersonal story.

Following the devastating fire detailed in After the Fire, lives were forever changed and the fire department stands in a poor light that is worsened by accidents and fires that have lead to deaths among the fire crews. Sent to investigate and nail the chief, Eve is not in a mood to fall in love, but Noah Callahan is not what he seems at first or what she expected. Her investigation's focus begins to shift to finding out who is out to ruin a good man. Concurrently with this plotline, Casey Brennan's romance is played out. She has always seemed to be one of the guys, but when a softer side emerges as she tries to be the mom her daughters need, more than one realizes Casey is no guy, but the one she wants to see her as a woman has baggage and a heart that is bogged down with jealousy.  <br /> <br />*** Although Ms Shay is always worth reading and never fails to present an enjoyable story, her purpose would have been better served by splitting this into two books to focus on each plotline on its own.

Long before Sadie Hawkins, at the age of three, she was proposing marriage to the man of her dreams, Eben. Although the older \\"man\\"(14) dismissed her as a little girl's affections, there was still somewhat of a bond between them. It was Eben who found himself rescuing Kaia from one scrape or another until the day she was sent to a convent in hopes of gaining a more serene nature. Rather than serenity, all Kaia gained was boredom, which she attempted to relieve in rather outrageous ways. Just before she is to be sent home, Kaia meets a very unusual \\"person\\"; a talking black hound. The hound is Merlin, in disguise. Together with an elderly monk, Kaia sets off on a quest to the stone circle that will take them to the future, a world of flying people and pizza pies and women's lib. <br />When news of her escape gets back to the her relative, the king, Eben is dispatched to retrieve Kaia, the monk, and Kaia's best friend and Eben's squire who have gone in pursuit of the delinquents. Kaia leads them all on a merry chase, barely eluding capture by Eben, only to be taken by Eben's worst enemy. When Eben at last catches her, he realizes losing her would be the worst thing that could happen to his heart, but hasty words could ruin the romance and send Kaia on a one way ticket to the twentieth century. <br />**** Even if you don't like paranormals or historicals, this book is too much fun to pass by. Subtle tribute is paid to the premier Arthurian chronicler of the last century, TH White. Ms Klassel's Merlin is among the best Merlin of all books. I'd like to see him again.

Ranger is at his sensual best, defining the meaning of sexual tension, which is alone worth the price of admission. *****<br />Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-07-03

When cousin Vinnie branches out to include visa bonds in his bail bonds business, it looked like good pr, until the resident alien in question skipped out on the bond, leaving Plum Bonds out a fee and with egg on its face. One meeting with his future mother in law is enough to reveal why he might have skipped, but even with such a good reason, Stephanie still has to find and bring him and the dog he kidnapped home. Her search is rather fruitless until she gets a tip that sends her, Connie, and the now dieting Lula to Vegas where the trail literally dead ends with the skip found shot. They do find the dog alive. That does not end the case though. Someone targets Stephanie as the next prize in a deadly game, prompting Ranger and Joe to set aside their rivalry to protect the woman they both care about. In the middle of all this, Steph's sister gives birth, which proves very messy for one of the bodyguards. <br />**** With the perfect mix of laughs and chills, readers once again get to share the fun of a Plum mystery. If you want a good time, then picking up To the Nines is a no brainer. **** <br />Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-07-03

In the old days, Christians might hide their pack of playing cards or a cigarrette from the pastor. Now, both young and old stash Harry Potter videos and books. However, after reading this book, you might want to proudly display them instead. <br />**** John Granger (no relation to Hermione), takes apart all five volumes of the demonized books to miniscule detail and finds vast amounts of Christian allegory inside them. Going beyond the obvious, he brings to light enough material to keep a Sunday School class going for six months, at least, in a style almost as entertaining as the books themselves. In fact, by the end of Finding God in Harry Potter, you will be convinced that we can learn as much at Hogwarts as in Narnia or Middle Earth. Maybe more. ****<br />Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-07-03

Tori's first case as an apprentice detective seems simple enough; follow Grady Palmer and report to the client, Ms. M, if he is a good man or not. Whether or not he is good, Tori can tell he's hot from the first moment she lays eyes on him. Unfortunately, he lays eyes on her too, and is quick to figure out that she is tailing him. So, he offers to make the job easier and just tell her where he's going and even escort her there. Tori quickly comes up with a half truth, she's following him because she's attracted, and it's more than half true to be honest. She's not sure why Ms M wants to find out about Grady, but in the conflict of interest dispute, Tori is sure of one thing, Grady has her heart and she's not going to let him be hurt. <br />Meanwhile, Grady's secretary is having her own adventure, proving to a divorced father of two that she's not a self absorbed, shallow twit and would make a terrific step mom. <br />*** Laugh out loud fun is guaranteed in this screwball comedy of family and love.

As usual, Armegeddon is on the horizon, this time its heralds are a band of demons that must be killed in a certain order to die permanently and a giant monolith in the middle of LA. Only our heroes fully realize what's going on; an ancient demon is trying to take over the world. The ritual sacrifices are complete, and now all that needs to happen is for Hell to break loose, literally. Angel and Connor must set aside their parental issues and fight together to keep Earth out of demonic hands. It won't be easy, it may even cost a few lives. <br />**** Reading this book is like seeing an episode in 4 D. Not only can you picture the action in your mind, but see inside the characters' minds.

As the movie based upon it gets closer, Christians begin to worry that all the good done by Mel Gibson's Passion movie might be undone. To answer the challenge, a host of noted Christian writers have come out with books to expertly tear apart the allegations and mistakes made in Mr Brown's fictional novel. Although much material is repeated in every one of them, the format does vary. Mr Abanes has utilized a most efficient style of presenting his facts, one that is easily readable. Even those who have not read DaVinci or one of its clones may find this educational as it presents a great deal of historical fact in a palatable manner. **** <br />Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-07-03

Often, we can add defensive to that list, as we try to defend our stance. <br />**** To address this, Art Lindsley has written a concise book that will explain why absalute truth is real and how to defend your beliefs without being arrogant or defensive.

If you love poetry, you'll fall in love with Trisha Howell's new book, Living In A Glowing World.  As I read each page of this most congenial and mystical book, I was reminded of each <BR>season's offerings, and each season's reasons for being special.<br />Ms. Howell takes her readers a step further into the seasons by adding new names to what we consider the normal lineup.  Along with winter, spring, summer, and autumn, she has identified thaw and harvest.  I wondered about the use of the two additional seasons, until I read their poetry and experienced the emotions that are hidden within each.  After that, there was no doubt in my mind that Ms. Howell was absolutely correct.  There really are six seasons!<br />Within the pages of this book, we can frolic through the many imaginations of winter with snow on our lips, or we can bask in the passions and fragrances of summer.  Each season is consistently thought provoking.  Therefore, it really doesn't matter which season is your particular favorite, because throughout each our senses are constantly delighted and surprised by whimsy and visions.<br />Ms. Howell's truly delightful and engaging children's fiction is well known, but with this book she shows her readers a different side of her professional expertise.  She has a diverse and wide-ranging talent for holding our interest in a variety of offerings. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the magic and the indulgence of emotions that were dredged up within my soul by reading Living In A Glowing World.  This book is deeply spiritual and profound.  As I read - and then reread - each special poem, I delighted in the enlightenment as well as the pure joy that each one bestowed.  This is a highly recommended book to curl up with, no matter what the season.	2004-06-09

Among the not so good is having to confront the mother of a young vandal about her son's misdeeds, only to have an argument and get chased off by an attack goose. Despite the inauspicious beginning, Zeke Coulter, a brother of other Anderson heroes, finds himself admiring Natalie Patterson. Not only is she beautiful, her own opinion notwithstanding, and hard headed as he himself is, but has an inner strength and the voice of an angel. Her children, even the vandal, also win Zeke's heart. His entry into their lives could not have come at a better time either. Natalie's ex has finally p.o'd someone one too many times, and winds up dead, with the best suspect being Natalie. Fortunately, Zeke has strong shoulders for her to lean on; and no one messes with the Coulter family and gets away with it. <br />**** Bright Eyes has a bit more tension than some of Ms Anderson's books, but is still heartwarming and real. The pages ripple with gentle humor and love. I hope the Coulter clan has a few more siblings to meet in future novels. ****<br />Amanda	2004-06-06

Ann, Maria, Sabrina, and Deb meet once a year for a girl's weekend out involving too much gossip, booze, and a dash of naughty fun if they can find it. The stakes get jumped up a notch when they run across a handsome drifter in a bar. They only meant to give him a ride to the nearby campgrounds, but the night is dark and wet and he's easy on the eyes. They take him home for a bit of flirting and dancing, maybe more. Yet, when morning comes, the stranger is dead and they have to figure out how to cover up the events of the last night. One mistake stands between them and a courtroom, and once that mistake is made, their lives are forever turned upside down. Tabloids make their lives front page news; their friendships are tested, and secrets they did not even know existed come to light. The drifter was more than he seemed, and that fact may get the women a ticket to death row.<br />** For all it's craziness, this is a realistic read, especially if you live in Texas. It's racy and slapstick. The author uses a second person point of view that can be rather disconcerting; a more normal third or even first person pov would have been an easier read. **<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2004-06-04

Jo was exactly who Marc needed; her mind called to him. However, that did not mean she would be happy about being the one he needed. When Marc \\"rescues\\" her, Jo would call it kidnapping. He refuses to honor her vegetarian wishes, keeps a close eye on her, and won't even call her Jo, but insists on Josephine. Still, there is something about him that is incredible. She is drawn to him against her will. Just when she begins to lose herself to him, Marc uses all his self control and sends her away.<br />That was his biggest mistake. It only takes a short time for the scientists who are looking for Marc to capture Jo and con her into betrayal. They want to use Marc to create immortality for a rich old dinosaur, and if Jo is the key to Marc, then they'll use her too. Caged together, love, lust, fear and anger run amok. No matter how Marc wants to hate Jo, he can't, any more than she can truly fear him. To escape, they will need each other, and a little help from friends. The future of all vampires depends on them. If they fail, vampires will be hunted down as lab bats.<br />(...)The action in \\"I Thirst for You\\" takes off on page one and doesn't really slow down until the end. Passion simmers until it explodes. No shortcuts are taken, making the world realistic in every way.

Many think you can either believe science or the Bible, not both. However, the case can be made that you need more faith to believe in macroevolution than in creation. Take the fact that from nothing comes nothing, the lack of transitional fossils, or the outright lies of Darwinism, among other points, and the reader is left with the truth. To support his case, a variety of theologians and scientists including Michael Behe, Hugh Ross, Norm Geisler, William Lane Craig, and Phillip Johnson, etc. The writing is done in lay terms, or when it's not, explained, so anyone can follow it without problems. It is both interesting and informative, demonstrating that you need not bend Genesis to fit science, but that science supports Genesis. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2004-06-04

Among those enlightened beings is Jana Riess, and she has shared her findings in this snappy, easy to read book. Divided into logical sections that expand outward from the individual, to community, to world, the author uses Buffy to make spiritual truths clear. Many of the lessons could be applied to other fictional settings, such as Tolkien, yet, Buffy has an edge that might not be found in other works. This book will appeal to all ages, and perhaps serve as a bridge. The slant is mostly Christian, but the Christianity is not presented in a way that looks down on other faiths. For those Bible students who look for \\"aha\\" moments in their studies, \\"What would Buffy Do?\\"  has many.

To do this, you can either spend a few hours of research on the various aspects or buy this book. Don't be fooled by its brevity. No words are wasted in making a big impact.

On the other side, despite her and her macho harem's best work, she is not pregnant. Other things are happening though. Merry's personal magic is growing by leaps and bounds, and her touch is enough to bring back powers others have lost, and then some. Even that does not endear her to the sidhe who see her as a miserable half breed, or worse. Someone is willing to risk the anger of the Queen of Air and Darkness to assassinate the royal heir. They are even willing to bespell the queen herself. When Merry and Auntie Dearest lay aside past squabbles to unite against the enemy for a magical showdown, the duel is one well worth the price of admission. <br />**** Merry Gentry is much more intense than the Anita Blake books.

Before explaining what these are, Mr Maxwell helps you realize that today is important, each one has the potential to be the most important one of your life. Then, methodically, he explores the daily dozen; attitude, priorities, health, family, thinking, commitment, finances, faith, relationships, generosity, values, and growth.

Ever since Columbine, perhaps before, the public has been aware of the potential for violence in youths. In Shooter, we get a glimpse of the aftermath of a similiar incident. In what is termed a cult shooting, two boys are killed, one of them as a result of suicide, one murder. Six other students are injured. Police and psychologists are left with the task of reconstructing what was going on in the minds of those involved. Their assessments focus on two students, a young black boy who was the best friend of the suicide victim, and the girlfriend of the suicide victim. Both are a mix of anger, confusion, and hurt that cries out for love. Both are too old to be so young.<br />***** Readers sit in on the interviews with these two and are given a peak into police records, news articles, and reports. It is a harsh, grim, bleak read; but very insightful and telling. Although billed as a teen book, parents should exercise caution due to the darkness of the subject matter. However, adults might benefit from reading it, so as to get an insight into the world that their children are exposed to and may be part of if they are not careful. *****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2004-05-11

Alice McLeod is offered four hundred dollars to represent the local gun club in the Miss Smithers competition. Four hundred dollars to spend on clothes is a dream come true, especially when she imagines being able to stretch it all the local versions of Good Will or the Salvation Army. Added bonuses are she will get an inside scoop for the paper she produces and horrify her parents who strongly disapprove of the blatant anti feminism of a beauty contest and the principals inherent in a shooting club.<br />There are enough events in the contest to assure that almost anyone can score well in one or two of them. Yet, it is not the contest that will be the most educational for Alice. The reactions and politics that enter her life as she comes under the spotlight are a revelation. She will get fashion advice from bikers, find herself in a fight with supposedly respectable young women, and shock her parents by converting to a Christian lifestyle and chastity. While there can be only one queen, Alice finds there can be several winners.<br />*** Miss Smithers is unusual. Its satirical look at life is told from a first person point of view. While some scenes are difficult to imagine, that does not detract from their realism. Alice is in her own version of wonderland, strange but possibly true. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2004-05-11

Hollywood's latest drama takes place in a courtroom, and leading lady Toni Cavender may be the heroine or the villain, depending on how the jury rules. Even when the verdict is not guilty, the star's light is dimmed by the scandalous accusation of killing her porn producing &quot;lover&quot;. She flees, seeking refuge, but finding only her haunted past. Life gets even more complex when Damon Bradley is hired to find the Toni's long lost daughter, who is somehow part of the murder case. A mystery spanning three generations comes down to a heart stopping standoff as old secrets rear ugly heads. <br />**** Ms. Rogers moves into a relatively new area for her with a spicy and complicated mystery. Toni emerges as a strong, troubled, and even noble heroine who brings redemption to all she loves. The plot moves rapidly, not dragging at all. **** <br />Amanda Killgore	2004-05-11

When I recently picked up the newest edition of the ARRL Handbook, the first thing I noticed was that they had changed the subtitle from ?For the Radio Amateur? to ?For Radio Communications?. This was done to reflect the fact that a large percentage of these handbooks are purchased by non-amateurs. Electrical Technicians and Engineers, Laboratories and Researchers often have a copy on their shelves. So with the 80th edition they made the slight name change to better appeal to the wider audience of active users. The book covers just about any major category of radio communications one can think of from Fundamental Theory, to Construction Techniques to Operating Practices. It is a excellent reference source for anyone with a question about radio. Off course for anyone with a very specific interest the ARRL has other books that deal with a more specialized subject, but for a starting point I would purchase this book first. <br />The book is published on a yearly basis, but since the soft cover copy I purchased retails for $34.95, I wouldn?t purchase a new copy every year. The basic technology doesn?t change that fast, most of the yearly changes are adding and removing projects. The new edition does have revised chapters, including ones on Modulation Sources and Digital Signal Processing, but I wouldn?t run out to purchase it if I had last year?s copy, unless I had a specific interest in the new material. Personally I have a hard cover edition from the 80?s and a CD edition from the late 90?s and much of the basic information is still the same. I would recommend for the average user that they purchase a new copy every 5 to 10 years unless they have a specific need. I might also recommend alternating between paper copies and CDs. CDs are archival and easy to store and duplicate (for back up purposes of copyrighted material), but for manuals of this sort it is also convenient to have a hard copy to thumb through at their workbench.<br />Reviewed by Trip for Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-10

A brief glance at television listings, magazine articles, and best seller lists reveals that people want their lives to mean something more than just breathing. Most know they want something but the questions are what and how to get there? Books like the Purpose Driven Life have capitalized on this, but just knowing you have a purpose doesn't tell you where to drive it.<br />The authors have devised an atlas to help you get there. If one is Christian, then according to one of the Creeds, our purpose is chiefly to glorify God, and their point is that no matter what the seconary purpose of our life might be, we have a ministry. God can use anyone from a President to a pot scrubber. They have even included tools to help you know more about who you are and how you are wired to serve.<br />**** If you have any interest in knowing why you are here and finding out what makes you unique; or how to deal with all the other unique people out there, then read this book. It is both spiritually and psychologically sound; and while very intellectual, is communicated on a level accessible to all. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2004-05-07

Wouldn't any young girl give her eyeteeth to spend her seventeenth birthday in Paris with the man of her dreams? Probably, unless she happened to have her very own baby as an obligatory guest on the excursion. Before your eyebrows hit the ceiling, it's a fake baby, as Emily has to explain a few dozen times over the course of the novel. <br />She was supposed to only have Baby Annoy for a few days, as a school project to learn how serious a parenting career is, but life threw her a curve, forcing Emily to have to take it with her to Paris for Spring Break or risk killing her GPA. So, \\"Jack\\", her \\"child\\" gets to go along to her survival French lessons, gets a nice, unexpected swin in the canal, locked in at Notre Dame, and a few other adventures. Emily realizes that she is going to have to be able to afford a nanny when she has a real baby. Then comes the big night of her birthday, one she's been planning for ages. It is supposed to be a once in a lifetime night shared with Devon, but will it be? <br />**** Katie Maxwell deftly and hilariously delivers a potent message about the most important decisions. Emily is a breath of fresh air, wholly realistic, and utterly charming. If you love the Princess Diaries, this series is equally fun, no matter if you are a teen or once were one. ****<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-05-07

Attempting to escape a rejected love turned stalker, Patience Sinclair heads south, to the rodeo. Originally, the trip was planned just to work on her disertation, but escape becomes the focus.<br />The rodeo is a whole new world. Cowboys, barrel racers, and courageous clowns have their own civilization in which Patience becomes enthralled. It has its own inherent romance, and Patience soon has to face her fears when she gets entangled with an overly amorous cowboy. Before trouble can get out of hand, she is rescued by the someone who won't be turned aside. Dallas embodies everything a man ought to be, and is willing to be there for Patience.<br />When the city girl learns that danger lurks even there, a serial killer is on the loose, she will need all her own skills and all of Dallas' courage to handle the situation. If she lives through it, it will be time to go home, and leave behind her heart. Can she do it, or is there another way?<br />**** Some writers pen such wonderful books that reviewers almost hate them; it's hard to write about the story without letting out too much, and then reading lesser books is painful. However, although Kat Martin fits this category, I don't want her to ever stop. She makes the settings and people seem real, yet still has the slight larger than life quality that makes reading her books an escape from reality. ****<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-05-03

Lydia Hoffman wants a fresh start in life, so she opens a knit shop. The shadow of death has loomed over her for too long, even though she is very young. It seems appropriate that the project she advertises as the first for her classes is to knit a baby blanket.<br />Her students are a mixed lot. Jaquie is about to become a reluctant grandmother. Carol desperately hopes for a baby, though the odds are against it. Alix is there to perform community service, knitting for the Linus project. Despite their glaring differences, the four women not only knit blankets but friendships and knit the bridges in their other relationships.<br />*** Debbie Macomber, whether her heroines are spirit beings or ordinary women, always writes about angels, messengers of God. Her stories are full of hope, and though not billed as inspirational, per se, they never fail to inspire. This is a sterling example of that rule. ***<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-05-03

The dashing rouge who is helping her catalog makes her heart race, then adventure does when pieces start to vanish and ancient spirits apparently begin haunting her home. A curse seems to be active, or is it?<br />*** Imagine a Regency set Indiana Jones or Lara Croft, and you have some idea of what to expect- a comedy of manners with a bit of romance and action.

Chaff's journey to destiny begins when he shows kindness to his world's version of a horse who belonged to the Lady Maeve, who has run away from her abusive toad of a husband, Lord Yoad. He is harshly punished, and later escapes. Before his journey ends, he will learn who his parents are and that he is magically gifted, a Second Loyal with a link to the Eternal One. He has the power to heal, and it is a needed power, as Lord Yoad has killed one of the trees that sustains the world Prand.<br />**** Classic symbolism and allegory play major roles in this quick paced novel.

To do that, he will need the magic of the Loyals; but he will have to defy the crown and nature to pursue the quest that will nearly kill him before he is rescued by Chaff who has mind melded with a gull.<br />Once in Prand, Kelber is recognized as a Second Loyal. However, though this is good news in one sense, in more ways than one, it causes pain. Kelber and his half brother must accept their mother's infidelity to her husband. Kelber must also cope with loving a woman he can not have, for she is bound to Prand. Beyond personal situations is the threat of King Ott, a greedy tyrant determined to achieve his goals at any price.<br />**** Though second in the series, this book is capable of standing on its own.

For once, he disagrees with Toste, finding her anything but, and desperate to convince her he's not the other brother. Toste, though believed dead, is not, but in the care of a novice nun. Lady Esme finds she has a lot more to confess, if that's possible, since the virile Viking came into her care. <br />***** Broad, slapstick comedy rollics across the pages as these two brothers learn how to be individual men and win their ladies' hearts. Esme's story is a bit more intriguing than Helga's, but on the whole, the novel will remind you of one of Shakespeare's comedies. *****	2004-04-28

While each one has its own problems, seemingly separate, in a magical way, they are all connected. On one world, magic and madness are two sides of one coin. Ruled by dragons, the world's towns are culled of the mad and the magically gifted in the rite of Election. Those chosen are taken away, never to be seen again, as if they never existed. Galen is a man whose dreams are filled with magic and madness both, so while he is horrified to be Elected, it is unsurprising. Being elected brings him into contact with other chosen people and involves him in a quest to save all three worlds. On one world, the fairys live, and their fate is tied to a princess. On the third, the goblins and their machines rule, but for some reason, the machines are being problematic. All three worlds' fates rest in the hands of &quot;madmen&quot; and dreamers. <br />*** The Hickmans have created a highly complex world system. At its heart is love and loyalty. At times it may be difficult to see how the three plotlines interconnect, but it is a challenging read for the academic fantasy lover. ***<BR>  Amanda Killgore	2004-04-27

Nightmares come to life when a young girl wakes in the night, and sensing danger, goes in search of her mother, only to meet an intruder and witness her mother's murder. Arriving police alert the neighbors to trouble, including Annie Kingston and her daughter. Annie becomes part of the case when her closeness to the surviving daughter and her talent as a court room artist give her the ability to help put together a composite of the intruder. When she does, horror and shock come with the realization that her friend died in her place; that her home was the true target. Amidst all the suspense and mystery, Annie wrestles with issues of faith. Her friend loved God, but where was He when she needed Him. How could this happen?<br />*** Gripping suspense makes the plot move rapidly. Fans of Patricia Cornwall or Iris Johansen may find this a Christian alternative with the forensic detals contributing to the suspense. Annie's questions about faith and theodacy are very relevant to today. However, shifting points of view might be hard to follow if you are not paying attention. ***Amanda Killgore	2004-04-21

Although Kyber is attractive, it's another man who wins Bree's heart. Ty Armstrong has dreamed of Banzai since he was a boy. Rescuing her and joining her cause seems only natural. However, Kyber might not agree. <br />**** The premise of this series has been used before, but never has its execution seemed so logical or possible.

It was this truth that gave the early martyrs the strength to face death for the sake of faith, and this promise that makes funerals an issue of personal sorrow at a temporary separation rather than a final goodbye and agony at never seeing the loved one again. This book illustrates all of what death means to a Christian. Whether you are mourning someone or facing death yourself, this book clarifies the issue in a point blank, straight from the hip fashion. In the end, you will agree with Gandalf that death is not the end, but a beginning, and perhaps not &quot;so bad&quot; as Pippin agreed in Return of the King. ***<br />Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-04-12

Though she is now a lady, once Lin was a slave, branded by the cruel prince Mordred. Her life was one of unending torture and humiliation. Yet, despite the vilest situations imaginable, she never let her spirit be broken. Rape, humiliation, torture, and beatings all served to strengthen her will and her rebellious spirit. Never once does she know who she is or realize from whence her strong character came until she is sold for less than a pair of boots. Then, Lin finds the truth, and it indeed sets her free, literally, and figuratively.<br />**** It only takes a few minutes to determine that the number of books, movies, and so on written about King Arthur and his court are as vast as the sea of stars, leaving one to wonder, can anything new be said about this sub genre of literature. The answer is a resounding yes!<br />&quot;Firebrand&quot; is not a tired rehash of the same stories but a fresh, original new dimension in a beloved saga.

Someone is leaving creepy messages and sabotaging her plans. The pranks have a deadly edge, and she wonders if Brand might go to extremes to get the house after all. Yet, she finds herself attracted to the virile neighbor, reluctant to believe he might harm her. <br />***** Those who have missed the gothic genre, take heart. All the classic elements, a spooky house, woods, a pretty heroine and mysterious almost anti hero are to be found herein.

Lucifer also knows who this man is, and is determined to use him as his pawn. To stop this, the angels Michael and Kedoni are on earth to find Lucifer and stop him, before it's too late, if it's not already. <br />*** If you enjoyed the &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; by CS Lewis, this belongs on your shelf.

With human mental patterns as its operational template, the possibilities of what the wrong mind controlling it could do were a nightmare. David has no one to turn to; the heads of the project are ruthless; the president inaccessible. His only ally is his psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, the woman who has been helping him cope with his narcolepsy that has taken on a bizarre aspect. David is dreaming of Jesus the Christ, as if he is the Lord Himself.<br />Pursued by killers, David and Rachel flee to Jerusalem.

Will the Cross lead him to redemption or death?<br />**** While at first blush, &quot;The Footprints of God&quot; might be compared to the more popular &quot;da Vinci Code&quot; , but there is actually little resemblance. Mr Iles escapes the charge of blasphemy with a turn of phrase that leaves any such allegations in doubt, and in fact, this book is far better written and more compelling than the bestseller. The influence of science fiction tales such as Highlander, the Matrix, and Star Trek are apparent, but not to the point of being able to say it's a rip off of them.

After a miraculous recovery from agoraphobia, Lucinda Hunter goes in search of her family. She knew who her mother was, a famous actress. It was the noteriety of Lily's life that had the opposite effect of driving her child to isolation. Her father was someone unknown except for a photo. In the days of her late parents' love, a mixed race marriage was a shocking thing, unheard of, so the love was hidden. The pictures of the white beauty with her handsome, black husband were a rare treasure for their daughter. Now, Lucinda goes in search of her father's people.<br />At first, they meet her with suspicion and distrust, but when they realize she is not out for any gain but love, Lucinda gets past the barriers to their hearts. The years between 1997 and 2002 have their ups and downs; she creates a unique move review column co written with a child. She finds new friends, new challenges. All that changes in a moment, when fear and uncertainty literally explode. September 11 brings out the worst emotions, fear, anger, pain, grief. We watch Lucinda's family cope as they wait to hear who survived, try to remember where people are supposed to have been when the world stopped. The shock you thought you had gotten over will be brought back in the final chapters of this book, so well does the author paint it.<br />*** Not all books are easy to categorize, and this is one of that type. At times, it is folksy and warm. There is humor, a hint of intrigue, and yes, grief. It is realistic, and despite the sorrow, able to end on a high note. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-31

When last we left Claire Marangello, she had endured excruciating months of being the unwilling star of the latest reality show; the day to day travails of an ordinary high school. She more than survived it; she became a star. On the impetus of that, she was offered her own show. The producers would send her to Broadway to star in a hot show opposite one of the hottest guys in a boy band, Jeb. She would be living with her recently discovered long lost half sister, Tina. Their sisterly bonding would also be covered in the docudrama. <br />Claire is nervous and excited, but it looks to all come crashing down when the director, Seth, proves to be a loud, opinionated, impossible jerk. Being followed by Fritz the cameraman, finding out her straightlaced dad had a wild side, and coping with a yappy mutt named Clyde, Tina's pet, are enough to drive Claire to more than one hissy fit. Fortunately, Jeb is there to save the day. Their on stage romance starts to turn real, but Claire has issues and a jealous supporting actress. <br />(...)If all the good reality television ever does is to have inspired this series, then it will be worth the airtime. Serious at times and fun most others, this book should contain a warning, you will fall down laughing. The more serious romantic moments are fizzy and sweet. While the rule generally runs that a sequel falls short of the first one, this sequel surpasses book one. Readers will have the added pleasure of getting sneak peak at Katie Macalister's next book at the end. (...)	2004-03-30

When Sarah says \\"no\\" once too often for her liking, the teen ager takes off, heading to the big city and \\"fame.\\" Sarah, however, is not the wicked witch of the north, but a kind woman who loves her niece and has done her best for her. Fearing the worst, she sets out to find Kit, but runs into brickwall after brickwall. Her only hope lies in the help of a priest whose life work is to save girls from the streets. Clancy Donovan is no gentle oldster, but a handsome, troubled young man. The attraction between Sarah and Clancy is quick to light, but they must ignore it. Kit takes priority, and Clancy may be a rebel, but intends to keep his vows, no matter the temptation to love.<br />Finding a pretty teen age girl in a city the size of Boston when she doesn't want to be found is like finding a needle in a hay field, add in thugs who want to keep her lost, and the problem is compounded. Despite beatings and threats, Clancy and Sarah are not deterred, even if the price is terribly high.<br />***** Clancy Donovan is a hero that will win your heart in a page or two. He is more appealing and sexy than Father Ralph de Briquasa of Thorn Birds fame, admitting his weaknesses and dealing with them rather than self righteously denying that they exist. Yet, you can not begrudge Sarah his love, for she is a kind soul, though troubled. The action never lets up, nor does the sexual tension, which is most expertly handled, revealing very little, and creating anticipation. This stays on the keeper shelf. *****	2004-03-29

At least at some point in time, most of us have been faced with either pleading the fifth or having to defend their faith by &quot;well, it's in the Bible and I believe it.&quot; Unfortunately, that does not really answer the question.<br />Hank Hannegraff has made a career of handling the questions people have about Christianity, and giving better answers than it's true because that's what I believe. Christians who buy and read this book will have the equivalent of a question and answer episode of the Bible Answer Man program in their shirt pocket or purse. It's small size will make it easy to carry for handy reference, and the bite sized answers cover a wide range of topics. Some seem a bit simplistic, others are more relevant and thought provoking. Each section is thoroughly cross referenced to books and articles that will help the reader go into more detail.<br />**** This book may not answer every question a Christian might find themsevles confronted by, but it's a start. As an aside, the photography that illustrates the Bible Answer Book is gorgeous and would be frameworthy if it were larger. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-25

That is a chilling reality in the Wildside world where magic reigns supreme and often secretly. The vampire goblin, Quede, comes to Lyris' attention when she investigates the murder of JFK. She can at last prove that goblins killed the president and replaced the vice president with one of their own. Bringing down Quede will force her to work with Romeo Hart, the charming half Pooka with no fear of death who is her partner. <br />New Orleans is exotic and dangerous in any novel, but in the Wildside, it becomes doubly so. Racing to stop a plague that could destroy humanity, Romeo and Lyris will risk their lives, and fall in love. <br />***** Watch out Anita Blake, the goblins are gaining ground! With every entry in this series, it becomes more fascinating and new depth is added. Characters are a unique shade of grey, not totally good or evil, in many cases. Passion and magic crackle from the pages. You will look forward to the next book, but each one stand alone so well that you are not left hanging between volumes. *****	2004-03-24

Events in Princess Mia's life are as usual, chaos. For her birthday, she got a cell phone, a snowflake necklace, a starving orphan, and a potential riot. Grandmere snuck her hairless rat of a dog into a a haute restaurant, the critter escaped, causing a debacle that ended in Grandmere being drenched in soup and a busboy losing his job. When best friend Lilly hears of the injustice of it all, she begins a campaign to have the Nepalese youth rehired. As a result of that, Lilly and her boyfriend break up, all the New York busboys go on strike, and the prom gets cancelled, making Mia's life miserable as she is seen as the one to blame. Not only that, but even if there was a prom, Michael, the love of her life who will soon be going to college, does not want to go to a lame dance. Could life get any worse for the princess who just wants to repeat Molly Ringwald's performance in Pretty in Pink? Yes, it could. Grandmere could move in, and she does.<br />***** If the world were truly destined to be lead by the Princess in Pink, maybe it wouldn't be a better place, not for her lack of trying , but it would be a more fun one. There is at least one laugh per page, and most of them have more than that. However old you are, you have not outgrown these books; they are for the girl in all of us. *****	2004-03-24

Esmerelda (from Mercy Me), finds this out when she is called to be a house mother of sorts to a women's half way house. Although far past retirement age, she accepts the challenge and soon finds herself in a mission field where she'll need the full armor of God, especially the Sword that is the word of God. <br />Her boss will find out that book learning doesn't necessarily equate with wisdom as Miss E is able to handle situations with a homey wisdom that solves more problems than any more learned person can. The obstacles ahead include over doses, bleeding, explaining the really tough issues in the Bible, and how to handle two women living as a married couple. Yet, the light shines through. <br />*** Gentle and plain spoken, this book has a lot of truths in it. Christian books have grown up a lot in the last few years. The main lesson to be learned is a Christian can only do good if they are in the world, not isolated from it. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda	2004-03-23

When she burst into her cheating husband and best friend's love nest, her rage turns to shock; they are lying entwined in each others arms, covered in blood. She calls her mother next, who happens to work for Roarke, who is conveniently married to the best homicide cop in the twenty first century, Eve Dallas. It only takes Eve a short time to know Reva is innocent, but proving that will be a challenge. As she works towards the truth, Eve will face her own demons once more, and a bit more of her shrouded past will emerge. In the end, Eve's future will be in more jeopardy than ever, as she faces a deadly enemy who is not afraid to kill. <br />***** Some series peter out and become tired. Eve and Roarke have yet to do so. From fresh and funny to intensely passionate or chillingly dangerous, the emotions run the gamut. Both major and minor characters are well developed. Even if you dislike futuristics, this series is worth making an exception. In particular, &quot;Divided in Death&quot; has one of the best Eve/Roarke scenes of all the books, which is saying a lot. *****	2004-03-22

With her friend Max she shares a love of running, and perhaps a first \\"love\\". School is filled with a vocabulary of forbidden words, a thesaurus, art, and aggravation. Homelife, however, is where the most poignant moments are to be found. At one end of the spectrum is her mother who is growing an alien pumpkin baby inside herself, and on the other is her grandfather, slowly dying, gradually forgetting, and bravely joking about the end.<br />*** Somehow, all of these various things are tied together with a consistancy and simplicity that moves along as smoothly as the heroine's races. Annie is a thoughtful girl facing ordinary challenges at a crucial time in her life. The writing is life affirming and simple, hearkening back to a quieter age. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-17

Allie is a Summoner, which sounds a lot nicer than necromancer, which is basically what a Summoner is. Her job is to raise haunting spirits, and that is what she believes Christian is when she first lays eyes on him. Since the only other ghost she's raised until this point is a three legged cat, the mistake is natural. Christian is very much alive, but not completely human. He is a Dark One, or vampire. His mission in life is to find his Beloved who can save his soul. Allie, or Allegra, is she, or so he believes. He could be wrong, having already misidentified another woman as the Beloved in A Girl's Guide to Vampires. <br />Allie and Christian's romance is off to a rocky start, between her defiant attitude and the troupe of ghosts she has acquired. Still, destiny is destiny, and troubles aside, Allie is Christian's only hope of redemption. <br />**** Subtle and less than subtle will keep at least a smirk on your lips as the pages turn. If you've enjoyed any other vampire series on television or to read, then you will enjoy this one as well. Life can be too serious at times. Kate MacAlister's vampire novels will lift your spirits. If it raises any, then Allie can take care of that too. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-13

It was all taken away in a moment that was to become the second that defined her existance. On the darkest day of her life, Milla was stabbed and her son taken by a group of child smugglers. Only two things can even halfway be considered comforting - a white child would be well cared for due to the high demand for them and she was able to put out the eye of the monster who stole her baby. <br />Ten years pass, and during them, Milla's purpose gains focus. Perhaps her own son is lost, but she can help others find their missing loved ones. It is something of a balm, seeing other's joy at reuniting, when she has lost not only her child, but her marriage and friendly relations with her family. Then, hope is reborn. Milla makes contact with Diaz, a bad man who might be able to track down the scum who wrecked her life. Working with him is nerve wracking. Diaz is everything she should avoid, and everything she needs. In his arms, Milla's tears begin to dry. But, there is someone out there who wants revenge for his lost eye. If Diaz can't protect her, Milla will find herself scattered across Mexico. <br />*** Linda Howard, the author who gave us Mr Perfect, once more chills readers in this fast paced novel that takes us through a whole range of feelings.

Take one part Erica Kane, one part Scarlett O'Hara, and a dash of the cast of Designing Women and you have Sugarbeth Carey. Once she reigned as the queen of cool in high school, but she left that world behind until now. She's come back, queen no more. Now she's older, wiser, and humbled but still proud. Though down on her luck, she's not out. It feels that way, though, when her only hope of a job comes from Colin Byrne, her one time English teacher, nemesis, and the man who has the most reason for revenge. Having the girl who ruined his career as his maid is too sweet, but if he thinks Sugarbeth is going to be a docile domestic, this Englishman had best think again. Even when forced to serve those who trample her crown, Sugarbeth is still dignified. Colin soon finds his bitterness turning to admiration and something a bit more carnal. Suddenly his research about the sexual habits of Victorian gentlemen becomes slightly more relevant, especially the chapters about servant girls. There is a problem in the plan, Sugarbeth has given her heart before, and does not agree with the poem about it being better to love and lose than not love. It's better to run away before you get hurt is her thought. <br />***** \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" snaps with sassy humor and quick wit, but has a serious message that is not so subtly spelled out. Sugarbeth is the best heroine since Ms Phillips' Daisy. Her banter with Colin is sharp and fun. You will laugh and cry.

A landslide when she was a child left her wheelchair bound for months, and she was the lucky one. Many other children were less fortunate, and lost their lives. Even when the pain left her limbs, she spent years enduring the glares of those who lost children when she lived. Then, she met Evan, and found love in his arms; but had to leave when she learned she was pregnant.<br />The years passed, and once again she found love, this time in America with a composer. He raised her son as his own, and gave her a daughter. She only learned of his lies after his sudden death. It is only the first death she will have to cope with; her own father's illness takes her back to Wales, and Evan. Alys must face the past to find her future.<br />** Ordinary life is filled with dramas that seem small unless you are in the middle of them.

Before the get far, Betsy finds herself in the middle of an age old feud between Nostro (short for Nostradamus) and Sinclair, the two top dog vampires. It seems Betsy is a prophecied queen of the undead, and both of them literally want her. Nostro is mean and ugly, Sinclair is a handsome smart aleck. The choice is obvious. Unfortunately, the unchosen one does not take rejection well.<br />**** Betsy has more in common with a certain sharp witted vampire slayer than with vampires.

Francesca Dunn is a rather ordinary girl, albeit naive. Though she is good and kind, going out of her way to be helpful and not looking down of those society scorns, she is just a teen age girl. Nonetheless, there are some who see her as more.<br />Most Christians look for the second coming of our Lord, but in this book, it's His mother that some seem to think has come once again. Francesca is dubbed the Virgin (she is one), by a crowd of homeless people, and is appears to have a healing touch. She even believes that she might be pregnant, despite having no idea what sex is. Through the eyes of her mother, her boss, her best friend, and a homeless man, we see the effects of this belief on Francesca's life and the lives of those around her. The test of truth is one that will bring a tear to your eye.<br />** If you don't pay attention to the chapter titles, you might become confused as to who is narrating each section. This story is unusual, something like Agnes of God; Francesca's mother, Anne, does have a bit of a Jane Fonda air to her. The power of belief and the damage false beliefs, even the most seemingly harmless ones, is clearly shown in this modern parable. **<br />Amanda Killgore	2004-03-02

The problem is, Aari seems to have no memory of their love other than a dry recitation as if he is reading a script of who he is supposed to be. As heartbreaking as that change might be, there are direr matters at hand, the insectoid aliens who have caused Acorna's people so much pain are once more a threat, and thieves have stolen a treasure that must be recovered.<br />**** As with the Pernese stories, domestic dramas weigh equally with planetary crises to create a well rounded story.

When Gio enters her life though, the jig's up; he's a real magician, and Vickie is just Vickie. The only magic is the tingle between the two of them. All the curses and such have been a scam, Vickie's shield to keep all who would come near far enough away to not hurt her. Now that she wants to let the shield down for Gio, how does she do it without letting go of too much of herself?<br />*** While there's no witchcraft, if you spell witch differently, there's a few of those around. Vickie shows readers that much of the time when you see a scary looking kid, it's all an act, and there's a really neat person hiding under the mask. There's a few comical gags and sarcastic wit to lighten the otherwise serious message. ***<BR>  Amanda Killgore	2004-02-28

Tao Tandy's flatmates are anxious to get her out on her own, and to be honest, she is as well. The problem is finances, so being offered a free place to stay in the rather well off area of London in exchange for baby sitting a bird for a couple of months sounds like a winner. Tao aces the interview with the dotty old lady who owns the place and the parrot in question, and for a bit, life seems to be rosy.<br />With a bit of exageration, her photography portfolio lands her a job taking pictures of a chef who at first seems delicious as his food. However, like a rich chocolate cake, he has a bad side effect, he's a user and being involved with him might wreck Tao's life, unless she can turn things around with the help of friends.<br />* Domestic disasters are described with a dry British humor that may be difficult for those who speak American to appreciate. Humor takes a priority over romance in this melodramatic journal. *<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2004-02-27

As viewers flock to see the Passion of Christ, the question will arise in some minds, &quot;Who was saved at the cross?&quot; Did Christ die for all or only for the elect? This question sums up the debate over the doctrine of predestination in the Christian church. While Augustine is often credited with deriving this doctrine from scripture, Calvin is the most closely associated theologian with it. The idea that God chooses who is saved and who is not is either repugnant or a measure of His Kingship to believers. <br />Mr White affirms and defends Calvin's TULIP (Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistable Grace, and Perserverance of the Saints) while Mr Hunt denies and refutes it. If either side were presented on its own, the reader would undoubtedly be convinced of the particular author's position. Presented together by two able theologians, the reader comes away knowing each position thoroughly. However, he or she will have to conclude that this is one of the mysteries of faith known only by God. <br />**** If you were one of the listeners who heard the live debate presented over two December days on the Bible Answer Man show, then this book will give you a more in depth look at the conversation. However, even if you missed it, this will be a fascinating read for serious students. ****<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-02-25

If the average non Christian consumer were to begin considering conversion, spending less than an hour perusing a Christian book section or facing the lists of churches in the Yellow Pages would be enough to confuse them to the point of reconsidering. Christians come in all shapes, sizes, and variants. Although Paul encouraged unity in the Body of Christ, it has never been achieved. What we all agree on is a short list. <br />Despite that, there are some essentials that belong in every church, whether Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal, or non Demoninational. John Stott has taken the vital facts that you must believe to be called Christian and placed them in a straightforward easy to read book. With a precision akin to Lee Strobel's Case for Christ, he lines out the ABC's of faith. The logic of the Resurrection to the deeper meanings in the Ten Commandments are laid out concisely. <br />*** Long time believers may not have any &quot;aha&quot; moments, but if they read this, they will have more to defend their faith than &quot;it's true because it is written and I believe it.&quot; New believers or seekers will know what is most basic without the rigamorole variations that difer from sect to sect. ***<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-02-24

This is his story. <br />When Risa of Moreland's father sends yet another suitor away, she demands to know why he is determined to keep her unwed. The truth is more horrible than anything she dreamed. To save her mother from certain death, her father sold her to a devil incarnate and dares not let her marry. In shocked horror, Risa flees, only to be pursued by her &quot;master&quot;. Fortunately, Gawain finds her and takes her to Camelot safely. There, she is given the protection of both the king and queen, but even that can not stop the fiend from taking her. Gawain's heart and love are lost, but before he can find her again, the infamous Green Knight challenges him. Bound by chivalry, Gawain must leave his lady to her fate until another day. <br />**** Sarah Zetel both remains true to the legends and infuses them with originality. Nobility wars with passion until they become partners, and schemes and counter schemes are the rule of the day. This is the first in a promised series that fans will place on their keeper shelves with Stephen Lawhead or Rosemary Sutcliffe. ****<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-02-21

As recent headlines have made plain, it only takes a moment for life to go terribly wrong. When a young mother looked away for one moment to take care of her older child who was hurt, her baby was taken. Empty years passed during which the parents' marriage slowly eroded and the older child, Doug never forgot the little sister who was gone for no good reason.<br />In another mere moment, it all began to turn around. After an ancient bone is found during a construction project, Callie Dunbrook is called in to excavate. When her picture flashes on the television screen, her long lost mother knows that the baby who was taken has been found. Now, Callie, Doug, and Callie's ex husband will have a deeper truth to search for than they have ever sought. Callie thought she knew who she was, but there's more to it than she had ever guessed. She is about to discover how much she is loved.<br />**** This is a tender story about a quest for truth, and defining love. Ms Roberts uses none of the melodrama typical of long lost child stories. Rather, she demonstrates that true love does not crowd out other love, but makes room for it. ****<BR> Amanda Killgore	2004-02-19

Despite her reluctant consent, Chime escapes at her first opportunity, heading into the forest where she meets an enigmatic young man.

Although Angel is an unlikely name for a cop, Angel Delaney was a good one. Police work appeared to be her calling, until she was one of the officers on scene when a gang breaks into a pharmacy. In a confrontation with one youth, the choice seems to be shoot or be shot. Despite this, she almost does not fire, and when she does, it's not to kill, yet it does. <br />Angel is sure she fired once, but there are three wounds, one fatal. Suddenly, she is under investigation, which is SOP, but being accused of racism is not. Angel finds herself the target of vengeance and possibly of the real killer. Her world becomes one full of questions; not only the whys of the case, but of faith and forgiveness. She must confront her past in order to have peace with her future, if the killer will let her have one, that is. <br />*** Deadly Aim confronts readers with hard hitting issues that war inside most people's souls. Christians are forgiven, but even for us, it's hard to forgive when it involves someone you love, or yourself. She also addresses how the dead haunt the living, though not as ghosts. The story's message is not preachy, but it is there, and not watered down either. ***<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-02-07

Yet, she found a place where she was needed, a small town in Colorado that desperately needed someone who could take care of their women and children. Not only will she have to prove her talent, but also earn the respect of her potential patients. That means keeping her reputation unspotted and maybe even compromising her hypocratic oath, if some have their way and she only treats respectable folks.<br />However, Letty won't do that, no matter the cost. No one is too downtrodden for her to help, not a drunk's family, not a bunch of ladies of the night. Eric Wagner admires her determination, but thinks she should be more cautious, for more reasons than one. Eric may be Letty's biggest case yet; he needs heart surgery of the deepest kind. Eric's refused to love anyone since he let his wife down and in his opinion, let her die. He can't chance doing that again, but it may kill his soul not to.<br />*** The problems of today are the problems of yesterday, Ms Aiken's story says. How to hate sin but not the sinner is a question that dogs both the residents of her Little Housesque world and the world today.

This book perfectly captures the modern gnosistic thought of all roads lead not to Rome, but to God. Clearly, the author is quite well versed in pan-religious research. Her theories, though they do indicate Christianity as the chief and truest religious system, manages to incorporate the theologies of the Book of Mormon, the New Age, Hinduism, the Kabballah, and the non canonical pseudographia such as Enoch, Jasher, and other gnostic texts used in more popular works such as the Da Vinci code. Creationism and science are reconcilled with the Day Age theory as well as the Annazzi legends popularized in the Chariots of the Gods.<br />* Those well versed in Biblical discernment will probably be able to find something of value, and the attempt to reconcile all religions into one is notheworthy. However, if you have not read the Bible several times through and studied some of the great theologians, you will not be able to handle it. *<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2004-02-05

New York was in \\"brown-out\\" mode, Frank Sinatra was new to show biz, and the sweet voices of the Andrew Sisters rode the air waves. <br />The Canteen mainly catered to the U.S. Servicemen. Dedicated volunteers, often including such stars as Katherine Hepburn, helped entertain the military personnel on leave before they had to go back on duty. <br />Genevieve \\"Jenny\\" Rose was a theater actress. She helped out the Canteen and rehearsed for opening night. Her husband, Major Brad Rose, was in Washington, where the Pentagon was under construction. Brad was with Army Air Force Information & Special Planning Division \\"ISPD\\". <br />Sgt. Eugene Struhbeck was a regular at the Canteen. Jenny dreaded seeing him because he had a huge chip on his shoulder and often picked fights. However, he was a decorated hero, of Midway, and had to be tolerated. He was often drunk and ended up shooting his mouth off about sensitive issues in the Air Force. Therefore, Lt. Malcolm Sandover was sent to keep an eye on him. Eugene was in love with \\"Dina\\", who had as little to do with him as possible. <br />Elise Ginsberg was a volunteer junior hostess. She was Jewish and the men in her home life had her out, almost all the time, trying to get some graphic photos published. The closest she got was to Ruth McGowan of Associated Press. Many had heard about the Nazis concentration camps, but no one spoke of them. <br />So much is going on in this story that I find it impossible to list it all. Therefore, I listed many of the characters, but not all, and just a tiny bit about each. <br />This is an incredibly fast paced story that readers will be hard pressed to stop, even temporarily, whenever reality intrudes. It is clear that the author spent much time on researching the era. There are several areas in the story where the author injected a bit of humor to help break some of the tension. <br />This story is an excellent work of fiction combining facts of the war, the chaos civilians went through, and even some romance. (I kept comparing it to \\"The Sound of Music\\".) Highly recommended!	2004-02-05

Maybe Blue's wrong about which guy is perfect.<br />*** The message of this book about how to define perfect is one that applies to all ages. Blue is a funny, sweet heroine coping with parents who are odd, embarrassing, and caring, and finding out that there's more to love than meets the eye, literally. Her angst is something all to identifiable for most of us, if we're honest. Love is a funny thing, it's supposed to be all hazy and romantic, but like Blue learns, is a lot of work. ***<br />Amanda Killgore	2004-02-02

Known for her good works, it was not unusual for Anne to have spent her Christmas working at a women's shelter, and for Lacey to be with her. It was that goodness that placed Anne in the line of fire when a crazed husband broke in and killed her as he aimed for his wife. But, it was not Anne's goodness and tragic death that scarred Lacey's heart. It was learning about the bad side of her promiscuous mother that hurt the most.<br />Almost karmically, Lacey finds herself having to take in her best friend's daughter after Jessica's death. Mackinzie has no father that she knows, and resents Lacey. However, when they make it home ot Kiss River, Lacey thinks she knows who Mackinzie's father is. Letting Bobbie into the girl's life brings him into hers, and the attraction she feels for this bad boy conflicts with her romance with another man, an apparently good guy who hasn't forced her to violate the strict rules she lives by.<br />Under all of the growingly complex web of relationships lie a deep well of secrets and pain. Chance and danger will force the truth to surface, but you have to feel the pain to be able to heal it, the star players will learn.<br />**** Sometimes, like real life, the plot seems to move slow, but when the pace picks up, the reader will find herself on a roller coaster of unveiled secrets. The importance of forgiveness and dealing with grief properly for the one offended more than the offender is made clear in this moving story. ****<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-02-02

Most often, readers turn to the Psalms, or one of Paul's letters to find a balm to their soul. Yet, the entire book is filled with strong words to light and guide our paths. The authors have chosen 101 that stirred their hearts and shared them, making them relevant to today's context. With literary references and stories of the day to day routine, these ancient words come to life in a new way. You will find hope and strength as you read this, and will perhaps be inspired to read more of the book from which they originate. ****<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-02-02

She took a big secret with her, as well as his heart, though he'd never admit it. She'd betrayed him by marrying their mutual best friend. But now, Stephen is dead, and it's time for Daisy to face the truth. At first, she thinks nothing has changed; that Jack is still bedding women and breaking hearts. <br />The anger flying between them everytime they are within shouting distance is just a mask for the reality that's always been there. Jack and Daisy are in love, but when he learns how much she's kept back from him, he may not be able to forgive her. <br />*** Small town hijinks create laughter to mingle with the tears. The truth is that those you love are the only ones who can really hurt you, and that's something Jack and Daisy have to get past. Intertwined is the amusing back story of Daisy's sister, Lily, and how she deals with a cheating man. Ms Gibson knows Texas women. Funny, caring, and passionate, you will enjoy this book. *** <br />Amanda Killgore	2004-01-30

You may think the world is a dangerous place now, but just imagine if it was run by goblins who have infiltrated every power cell of society. In that world, humanity is reduced to little more than slaves, or worse. Those who remain free have united in Humans UnderGround or HUG. Their current mission is to keep the Goblin King out of the White House, and their best hope of doing that is for Io, a young half fey woman they rescued to infiltrate Motor City, the major Goblin stronghold. Io will need the help of Jack Frost, another half fey who is a master of death, and of love.<br />Wielding borrowed magics, hiding behind disguises, they navigate the dangerous maze of the goblin world. One wrong move could cost them and all of humanity a price too great to pay. Yet, if they are successful, they have a future and a hope, both as race and individuals. Jack and Io have discovered that their greatest magic is love.<br />***** Whether you want fantasy, action, intrigue, romance, or fun, this book is for you. The Lutin Empire is a well crafted world, with logical rules and believeable characters. In some ways, it reminds me of Piers Anthony's complex worlds, or Laurell K Hamilton, in others, there is a bit of the Matrix. Either way, it's a wild ride, worth every page. *****<br />Amanda Killgore	2004-01-29

The gold and ruby statue was valuable enough to save Liam's family home, if he could recover it. The mission was important enough to impel the Scotsman out of the Highlands to noisy, ugly London. He finds a room in a disagreeable Englishman's home, never expecting what will happen next. <br />Liam runs across a little girl with a vivid imagination who introduces him to her mother, Ellen Farnsworth. She steals his heart instantly, but he is sure she is unavailable. Finding that she is not married is almost as great a treasure as the beastie, until Liam learns that Ellen is an even more skillful thief than he thought. She took his heart, the beastie, and as a last indignity, his kilt. He sets off for home, determined to find her and reclaim a bit of his own. Will even her good reasons be sufficient to calm his temper and excuse her betrayal?<br />*** Julia London reveals her grasp of the complexity of love as she intertwines characters lives and multifaceted motivations. Family ties are contrasted, both good and bad. One moment the story is light hearted, and with the turn of a page, cutting truth is sharply revealed. Readers will be left on the edge of their seat at the cliff hanger ending. ***<BR> Amanda Killgore	2004-01-28

A vengeful enemy did worse than killing him, he killed Decker's son. To save his wife from being the next victim, he exiled himself to the desert; locked in a torture chamber of his own making, Decker existed, but did not live. That all changes when a ghost from his past leaves two children who need him in his care before finally dying. Now Decker is all that stands between these children and a fiendish plot with ties to his past. As much as he wants to protect his ex wife, Sydney Decker is the only person who can help him.<br />*** The modern world has its share of new miracles, but as this book demonstrates, they can just as easily be horrors. With tightly drawn suspense, Ms. Lewin takes readers on a chilling journey full of hope and pain. ***<br />Amanda Killgore	2004-01-26

She was to be the Ella Cinders of her kingdom, and all was going according to tradition. Her mother died when she was smalll, her father remarried a veritable witch with two evil daughters, and subsequently died, leaving Elena at their mercy. The kink in the plan was Elena would be more suited to baby sitting the much younger prince destined to rescue her.<br />Still, she is saved from a life of being the Horrids (her step family's) slave when they exit hastily to dodge creditors. Things look bleak for her with no money and no prince, until the local fairy godmother shows up to offer her a new destiny, as an apprentice godmother. Before she knows it, Elena is winging her way to a new life, carried by a flying horse. She learns how to satisfy tradition, skillfully dodging its traps. Then, when trying to make a fairy tale go correctly, the magic prince turns out to be a ...well, let's say &quot;mule&quot;... thanks to her spell. Whether she had planned on love or not, Elena now has a prince to deal with.<br />**** Mercedes Lackey has been a winning bet for readers since her first Heralds of Valdemer novel. While Fairy Godmother is altogether different, it is no less entertaining. With sharp satire, she creates a magical world run by a savy and witty heroine. If this is the precedent for Luna, the line looks to be a winning hand. ****Amanda Killgore	2004-01-21

First, he gives his heart to lady Esmeree, a beautiful and abused woman who nurses him back to health after a terrible wound nearly kills the young knight. He longs to free her from the husband who beats her, but can not. The rules of the ancient Celtic world are strict, especially for kings.<br />After Camelot fell, King Markion, Tristan's uncle became High King, but had no heir from his queen. Hoping for a son, he is advised to remarry, and sends Tristan to fetch Esslyte, a Welsh princess, as his bride. In one move, he will forge a peace treaty and a dynasty. The union is not without opposition, and Tristan is forced to dual for the right to take the girl to England. Though he wins, he is injured, and given into the Essylte's care. The two fall in love, though she is promised to another. With the help of her half sister Branwen, they are able to share a unique love, but it is under the shadow of a curse.<br />**** Tragic romance has always won readers' hearts. Tristan is almost too noble to be true. Of all the women in his life, Esmeree is the most like himself. At times, Esselyte seems whiny and unworthy of his love, and Branwen a schemer. Despite this, the story is bittersweet and pleasing. ****<BR>  Amanda Killgore	2004-01-19

Allegro and Largo are offered the fairy equivalent of fame, fortune, etc if they complete their assignment; to match Phaidra Moore, their charge, with Kain, the earl of Falconwood, the Black Falcon. While both mortals are attractive and healthy, the situation is rather complex. Phaidra is a commoner, and rather independent. Kain is a rouge, and does not believe in love, or that he should be happy. However, Phaidra has perfected an unusual dye that could make the earl a fortune. Marrying her would fit within his strict guidelines that do not have room for joy or love. Yet, Phaidra believes in love and magic. How can the fairies make these two fall in love? Read it and learn. <br />** Allegro and Largo are winsome facilitators. Phaidra has the hoyden air of a Katherine Hepburn or Julia Roberts heroine, and Kain mixes the tortured hero with the bad boy gentleman character. If you enjoy a Regency with an unusual twist, this will suit you well. **<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2004-01-17

Maggie has made a successful career for herself telling the stories of the finest Regency detective since Holmes, Alexandre Saint Just and his trusty sidekick Sterling. Until now, she has not had to worry about out of control characters or writer's block. Then, one day she opens her eyes to find that Sterling and Saint Just have gone out of her head, literally. They are in her living room, bodily, and she is short a couple of cats.<br />If the fact that her star characters are now her roommates wasn't enough to deal with, her ex boyfriend is making a pest of himself. Though she might like to kill Kirk the Jerk, Maggie never intended to do so. She just has to convince the police of that, when he winds up dead after eating poison mushrooms she served. Maybe having Saint Just around is a good thing after all.<br />***** Maggie and her two &quot;friends&quot; will quickly win your heart. The situation is completely unique and fresh, and the humor fast paced. Maggie is easy to like, and while Alex and Sterling might get on your nerves, it's in the way that loved ones can. You love them for the irratations. I look forward to their further exploits. *****	2004-01-13

Now Lou is sharing close quarters with the other jilted party in a helicopter ride over the wilds of Alaska. That was bad enough, but only unpleasant. Now, when the pilot pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot her seatmate, Jack Townsend, that goes beyond unpleasant. Fortunately, thanks to a thorough cinematic education, Lou and Jack are able to escape. They set off on a hair raising trek from the wilderness to civilization, pursued by people wanting to kill them. That's the downside. On the upside, they discover that the mutual hatred they've had for one another for several years has turned into a passionate love.<br />*** With high adventure and snappy dialog, Ms. Cabbot tells a story that is as fun for adult readers as her Princess Diaries is for the younger set.

He was rescued by fellow Englishman Gideon Harwood. Christian returned to England with his new found friend in hope of learning who he was. He fell in love with Gideon's sister, Bethany. Yet without knowing who he was or if he had a wife somewhere, Christian could do nothing.<br />Then a miracle happened during a party. Someone recognized him. Not only was Christian unmarried, but he was also Marquess of Northwick, believed to have been killed by pirates at sea. But finding out he had a title and was unattached did not solve all his problems. Christian's memory was still mostly blank. Bits and pieces popped up at strange times. In addition, his family did not want him to marry Bethany, a commoner. They had another deb picked out for him. And if things could not get worse, he kept having &quot;accidents&quot; that nearly kill him!<br />As much as Bethany loved Christian and was happy that he found his family, she knew she could not marry him. Her past was marred and her family kept her secret quiet. Christian knew the truth of her past, well as much as her own family knew, and did not care. But Bethany withheld a vital name from her past. A name that could easily get Christian killed and her family shamed.<br />**** This is the second in Heather Cullman's Regency trilogy. Fans of this author get to see how Gideon and his family are doing since the previous book. It began with such a bang that I was enthralled from the first page. Readers see just a bit of what poor Christian went through while he was being sold as a slave.<br />This is a provocative tale that I was hard pressed to set aside when my reality intruded, and I could hardly wait to get back to the story.

Yet when minstrel Ronan Fitzgerald comes into her world, he sees that there is more to Maude than that. He sees her broken heart and her terrified spirit; he sees she is being torn to pieces by the feud between her clan and another, a war that nearly killed her. He finds himself loving her despite her reputation and the fact that her father wants her to marry someone more noble.<br />** The Linnet makes a strong statement about the power of anger to destroy one's soul, and the effects of revenge.

Mairin lost her mother when she was born, but soon her father came and took her from Ireland to England where she lived as the apple of his eye until the wicked stepmother came along. Nothing limited Blanche's hatred of her stepchild, and when Mairin's father died, Blanche immediately sold her to a slaver, thinking the little girl will soon be lost in far away Turkey; and she would have been, if a kindly Englishman had not seen her and bought her as a replacement for his own dead child.<br />Mairin and her servant, Dagda, truly are at home with her new family. Her adoptive parents and brother love her immediately, and when she is of marriageable age, a wedding to a Byzantine prince is planned. Before she can truly become Basil's wife, he is killed by a past lover. Sent home, Mairin manages the estate left to her when her father and brother die in the wars until Josselin, a knight of the Conquerer's, comes and to claim both her home and heart. However, Mairin's beauty of body and soul has won another man's heart, a dangerous Viking who will stop at nothing to have her.<br />*** Once more, Ms Small has penned a fairy tale for adults. Though both hailed and critisized for her use of sensuality, I would not term her books erotic. Passion is kept within appropriate bounds, as a symbol of love, not pure lust. Mairin, like all of her heroines, has a gallantry that would shame one of the knights, yet is feminine in every way. ***<BR>Amanda Killgore	2004-01-07

In an effort to be &quot;seeker sensitive, &quot; hundreds of churches have watered down the gospel, softening the harder truths with a blend of feel good gushiness and pop psychology. Dr. MacArthur, with bravery equal to his more secular military namesake, tackles the gospel head on. His explanation of the Reformed faith is simple to understand, bringing to mind Mark Twain's assertion that he did not worry too much about the parts of the Bible he could not understand, the parts he could were enough to worry him. Yet, despite the stark honesty, the book makes it plain that God loves us, and He wants us all saved. God's sovereignity and love are the message of this book.

Rachel thought she had just another &quot;crispy critter corpse&quot; on her exam table; she'd never been more wrong. Etienne Argeneau only appeared to be dead. Once the bullet was removed from his heart, Etienne was able to heal. So, his intrepid assassin had to try and kill him all over again, but this time, Rachel got in the way. After she'd saved him, Etienne couldn't just let Rachel die, so he did the only thing he could do, turned her into a vampire like himself and took her home to meet the family. Now, he just had to hope that the two of them would fall in love, otherwise, he'd just lost his only chance at a lifemate. Each vampire could only turn one other person during their life.<br />Rachel's journey to falling in love won't be easy. Etienne's family is rather unconventional, she's worried about her face turning bumpy, like Spike's, blood is not her favorite dish, and Pudge is still out there, looking for vampires to kill. However, when she looks at Etienne, all that other stuff is just stuff.<br />***** Like Single White Vampire, Love Bites is an intelligent, witty barrel of laughs. Admittedly, Pudge is more irratating than evil, but that is no drawback. Marguerite, the matriarch of the clan has promised to find her other children lifemates, and this reviewer looks forward to her fulfilling the promise. *****	2004-01-05

Lucy Gordon has lived in shame's shadow since the debacle several years ago when she introduced a &quot;new&quot; frog to the scientific community. Unfortunately, her steely eyed father had already discovered it. Humiliated, she retreated from public life, quietly teaching school and having a safe, unexciting romance with a British peer.<br />Then, it all changes with a bang. She finds a frog with gorgeous EYELASHES in the middle of the road. Since no known frog has eyelashes, Lucy knew her redemption was at hand; until she gleefully kisses her discovery and bamf! he turns into a prince, a gorgeous, naked prince. While most women would love to find a single, handsome prince instead of a frog, Lucy is disturbed. Her dreams have gone up in smoke, and now she has the aptly named Prince Wolfe who needs shelter, clothes, and for her to declare her love for him in a month's time, or he'll become a frog again. Lucy is glad to give the shelter and companionship; Wolfe is a very amiable housemate, handsome and helpful, but she is not going to love him. That way, she'll have her find back in a month. That is her brain's plan. Her heart knows it's a Faustian deal, and has another idea.<br />*** Ms. Altom has taken an age old concept and given it a new twist. Though at times the humor seems a bit stretched, as in Monty Python, laughter is to cover the tears. Wolfe will make you want to go out in the garden and look for disgusting frogs, if there's a half chance one of them might be like him. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2004-01-05

From drenching sheep to rescuing two headed oddities, the two find they are getting more experiences than they planned on at the start.<br />**** Readers both young and slightly more than young will get a laugh out of this book.

If she knew the reason for that, Sam would not be so quick to fall for him. Ben found her diary and read it. Will his secret spell doom for the future?<br />* Diaries are not the only things that get lost here; add to the list attention and interest. The story tends to ramble and be hard with which to connect. There is some slight humor, but the field of romantic comedy has more promising entries. *<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore of Huntress Reviews.	2003-12-29

Thinking to save the little girl, he takes her home, only to have her die before he can do much more. Shortly thereafter, a teen age girl, likely the infant's mother, is found dead. Matt goes to take a look at where she was found, and finds himself walking into a hornet's nest.<br />He finds a group of run away foreign children, escapees from modern day slave runners, apparently. A good man, Matt wants to help them, even though it might cost him his life or freedom. With the help of close friends and his ex, Matt ventures into a glittering hell to save the innocent.<br />** Although the Trade is action packed and fast moving, it's hard to build an emotional tie to the story.

Pilate stands against the panorama of history as a spot of gray; not quite a villain, but certainly no hero. He has been portrayed as a tyrant by some, a man caught in the middle by others, and declared a saint in a few circles. The truth is most likely a mixture of the three, as proposed in this novel. <br />Beginning several years after the Resurrection, the story is told by Claudia, Pilate's wife who is said to have warned him not to sentence Christ to death. By now, the couple has returned to Rome and is witnessing the beginnings of the mysterious religious movement called Christianity. At first, it means little to them, but as time passes, curiousity grows, until Pilate is driven to return to Judea and try to reconstruct the life of Jesus, whom he bareely recalls. There he meets the original disciples and those who now follow. As he begins to remember and learn, both Pilate and Claudia are transformed. <br />*** Much has been written of late of the early church. While this novel will doubtlessly play to a smaller audience than a more popular book, it is superior in its portrayal of the men and women who followed Christ at the outset. Most notably, the author has shown clearly how Jesus can change the lives of those He touches, no matter how far they have fallen. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-11-16

When Milord Cronin needs someone to solve a locked room mystery, he knows he can count on Bishop Blackie to see to things. Therefore, when a Russian Orthodox monk is killed in a locked room in the University, Blackie is sent to take care of things. Before long, he finds himself in the middle of a worldwide investigation, dodging bullets from the Russian mafia, and dealing with a woman whose mind is mired in sixties mode of militant feminism. If Blackie can live through this one, Cardinal Cronin is going to owe him at least a bottle of Jamison's.<br />**** Father Blackie's irrespressible humor alone makes any book in which he stars worthwhile. While some have been critical of the extensive discussion of church history and the differences between Orodox and Catholic branches of the church, I found it to be a fascinating and educational aspect to the story. As always, Father Greeley adds a slight twist that keeps the case from being too simple and manages to interweave a homily into the master plot. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda	2003-11-14

When Adrienne Willis sees her grown daughter sinking into a black hole of despair after she is widowed at a young age, she realizes that to keep her daughter from a living death, she must share her most precious and painful secret. One afternoon, she takes the younger woman aside and tells her what happened to her about a decade and a half before, when she was in an almost eequally dark place, still recovering from divorce. Adrienne took time away from her children to go and take care of a friend's inn for a few days. While there, she met a handsome doctor who was spending time there before going to try and reconnect with his medical missionary son. Paul was also dealing with the painful loss of a patient and her familiy's bitterness. These two lost souls found each other and found healing in a brief love. Then it comes time to return to the real world, with promises to meet again in a year.<br />The year passes, and Paul does not come back; he can't. So, Adrienne spends the rest of her life outwardly alone, but less so than before. Her life had been healed and given meaning by the one bright moment that she now shares with her hurting child.<br />*** Nicholas Sparks is a man who knows the value of pain, how sometimes it is the thing that gives a depth and beauty the to rest of life. Like he did in A Walk to Remember, he shows readers that a moment of love is worth the pain that may come later. Some might think he is someone not to read if you are sad, but on the contrary, read him then. You might have no one else to cry with, and you can feel that he knows your tears. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda	2003-11-14

Still, she decides to take the trip, only to find that Bentley has arrived ahead of her and hijacked her room.

She makes a detour first, to medieval Scotland. It is up to Patrick to rescue her from his clan's sworn enemies.<br />***** Laughter rolls off the pages in this splendid romance.

Eight years ago, he forsook all royal pomp and wealth for a life devoted to peaceful service to his god, Eidon. Then, right before taking his final vows, the outside world intrudes. Religious and secular pieces are being moved on a chessboard to set him up as king in his brother's place and as the tool of the order's leader. He is offered a way out that will mean exile. Before Eldon can determine the truth of all these amazing things, he is kidnapped and sold into slavery.<br />Abramm's only hope of escape is if his twin sister, Carissa, can find him before he dies in the gladitorial games. Carissa, the scorned wife of an unfaithful husband, is willing to sacrifice her easy life to save her brother, though it could cost her her life altogether. <br />**** Allegorically playing out past conflicts in the Christian religion, Ms. Hancock displays great versatility, telling as worthy a story as her previous Arena, though the two are totally different. Knowing who to trust is difficult in this complex plot. The questions that plauge every heart that searches for faith are now issues of life and death.

In essentials, Christians are to be unifed, according to the apostle, Paul. Within the Body of Christ, there are a wide range of beliefs, however. This has lead to many &quot;tares&quot; springing up amid the &quot;wheat&quot; of the church, ranging from outre beliefs that try to glue Christ onto abberant ideas to those who think all they must do to be Christian is show up once a week, toss coins in the plate, and recite rote prayers, if that much.<br />John Stott clears up exactly what is vital for Christians to believe and do to truly be Christian. He defines the Trinity, Person by Person, explains the basic sacraments, tells why prayer and Bible reading are important, etc. In the end, there is a section of prayers to get you started in making this basic habit a part of your life.<br />**** For both new and old believers, this book will be helpful.

Before she knows what has happened, she finds herself back home in Scotland with him. However, legalities and visas might cut short their romance, which would suit his snarky eldest son and &quot;witchy&quot; man hunting neighbor just fine. <br />Kathie has managed to fall out of lust and into love with her handsome Scot, and is determined to win him as her own, if for no other reason than to keep the said witch's claws off him. Marriage does not guarantee bliss though. The neighbor is still around, and causing more and more problems. The youngest son is a staunch ally, but the older would just as soon send her back to America. She also has the language barrier to navigate and learn that farm animals are not pets, no matter how cute. <br />**** There is a laugh a minute in this realistically hilarious novel. Kathie handles every situation, no matter how much of a challenge they might be, with flair. The villainess is someone you can justifiably hiss at, and Iain is entirely too good to be true. However, he does get a bit dense at times, as do all men. He is handsome enough to make that forgiveable.

However, unfortunately, he lacks a more critical element of Christianity, that of discernment. A Servant's Heart tells of the journey that lead him to the word of faith movement and his abundant praise of the poster boys of that heresy, Benny Hinn and Rod Parsely. While these men have lead many to a type of Christianity, it is the type that is warned about in 2 Peter and in several of Paul's epistles, a different Jesus than the one who saves. While the point that faith in Jesus is the key to finding your true life is valid, the author seems to feel that any Christian can become as &quot;annointed&quot; as Christ, which misses the point of Christianity completely. On a different note, the book is also edited poorly, causing one to have to use some skills at deciphering his meaning at times as the wrong word is used. *<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-11-03

The Covington Ladies (Hannah, Grace, and Amelia) and their white farmhouse captured my heart in previous novels, so I am overjoyed by their return. When I saw Joan Medlicott?s newest release, The Spirit of Covington, I could hardly wait to actually get the book in my hands and ?catch up? with the goings on in the lives of these special ladies.<br />In my eagerness I wanted to devour the book, but at the same time I wanted to savor every word because Joan Medlicott is a masterful storyteller and should have begun her writing career decades ago. She can take the simplest phrase and write it with exquisite beauty. That ability is one of the many things that make her books so appealing and such a joy to read. You only have to read a few sentences in the first two paragraphs of The Spirit of Covington to understand that. As this story opens, a spark??flared to life among dry leaves and snaked toward the woods?. Joan Medlicott gave animation to that fire, causing me to see it with perfect clarity when she wrote, ?By two A.M., a necklace of gold edged the outer fringe of trees, and by three A.M. it had crawled into the woods.? That sentence made me shiver because it foreshadowed the devastation that was to follow.<br />As the fire moved closer to the beloved farmhouse, Amelia?s heartbreaking, wide-eyed fear of its all-consuming temperament was palpable. She only had to touch her scars to remember another fire many years ago and the painful burns it had inflicted on her. Of course she, Grace, and Hannah fled helter-skelter from their white farmhouse with only the few things they could carry in trash bags that Hannah had hastily snatched for each of them. Strong, steady Hannah was the only one who was able to set aside her shock and hastily grab their important papers including the deed to the farmhouse.<br />In the days and weeks that followed the fire, our ladies were separated for the first time since they had bravely joined forces and left the Pennsylvanianursing home together years earlier. As each year passed, they had learned to depend on each other?s special strengths and had carved out a life for themselves in their new community. Now, in their isolation, they were depriving themselves of the very essence of what had always sustained each of them. During the many unpredictable changes in their lives, I began to fear that they would be unable to find their way back to their former loving and supportive relationships. I also feared that rebuilding their farmhouse would be too difficult for them, but unexpected help came from many people. Some were people in the community whom they had befriended through the years, but many were complete strangers. These strangers had read about the fire in the paper, and offers of help, not to mention money, began to flood in. Such kindness overwhelmed our ladies.<br />Change and the challenges it often brings filled the pages of this book. Gentle, anxious Amelia confronted the tortures of depression, and Grace found herself having to care for her boyfriend, Bob, following his heart attack. Caring for him meant moving in with him; a situation that caused her even greater conflict. Of course this left Amelia, who was always so apprehensive, and our strong and steady Hannah at cross-purposes with each other. Without Grace to stand between them and act as a mooring for their vastly different dispositions, they struggled against each other. Hannah ended the struggle by moving in with her friend, George Maxwell, who had lived across the street from their farmhouse on Cove Road. She already had a special friendship with this neighbor, and now that friendship deepened. He wanted to take care of Hannah, not only during this time of rebuilding, but also later in life. He spoke of a marriage of convenience because he wanted to grant Hannah the legacy of Bella?s Park; the special park they had worked side-by-side to build after his wife?s death. If they were married, there would be no inheritance taxes for Hannah to pay on the property.<br />As these three ladies toil with the mentally fatiguing process of rebuilding and finding their way back to each other, the reader is enticed deeper into their lives. Then in the midst of all this, Hannah?s daughter, Laura, finds out that she is pregnant.<br />***** Words cannot say how much I loved this book. As the ladies found their way back to each other, I realized again the sustaining power of friendships and that love must be cherished. Each book in this series is unique and notable, and these three ladies seem as real as cherished friends. The Covington books tell about life in the truest sense of the word, and are written with the emotional identification and empathy that only Joan Medlicott can provide. I can hardly wait for the next one. *****<br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson.	2003-10-28

All the trials of high school; romantic rivalries, pettiness, attention seeking, etc. are held up for all to see. <br />The issues are not all that petty, either. Acceptance, alternate lifestyles, broken hearts, and what makes friendship real are tested and proven. In the end, Fiona will learn the real meanings to trust and justice, and to love. <br />*** Though Focus on This is extremely amusing, with laugh out loud moments, don't think that it lacks in seriousness. True humor is displayed by the most severe moments. Sometimes, you have to laugh through tears. While I would not recommend a book this mature for those without an equal maturity, for those who can handle the serious nature behind the laughter, it has a great deal to say. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-10-27

This imaginative novel speculates about the second most enigmatic woman of Christianity might have been like and what role she might have played in the rise of the Way. Drawing upon the gnostic legends, Mary Magdelene is elevated to a position of pre-eminence among the followers of Christ, above even the Holy Mother or the Saints Peter and Paul. She is credited, by the author, with having the greatest comprehension of Jesus' teachings, enabling her to be a leader among the Apostles after His return to the Father. In fact, the story takes her importance a step further, implying that she truly knew Jesus as His wife and mother of His child. The plot takes Mary and St James to the Celtic land to bring the natives of Britain the message of Christianity. It is here that Mary spend the remainder of her life among those of the Druidic religion.<br />** While the author exercises great imagination in fusing legends and New Age concepts with true Christianity and does accurately convey how loving Christ is, it is to be hoped that anyone seeking a real understanding of Christ and His teaching will be lead to the Bible. **<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-10-27

After being banned by the local coven from casting runes when it is suspected that she is causing diseasters by predicting them, Joy accompanies her friend, Roxy to the Czech Republic to meet a favorite author and learn more about the Dark Ones. It was just supposed to be a fun way to get out of Dodge, but Joy quickly finds it to be much more. It appears that she is fated to be the eternal beloved of a vampire, but which one? Is it Christian, the enigmatic author searching for a soul mate to hold back the darkness he has avoided letting rule his heart? Is it Dominic, the probably fake vampire? Or Milos? Or, hopefully, the oh so hot Raphael, excuse me, Bob. Raphael thinks his name would sound better on a gigalo than on him. Each one of the men has secrets, is attractive, and appears interested in Joy. However, this bubbly American only has eyes for one of them, no matter what Fate decrees.<br />If the vampires and mysteries of love weren't enough to cope with, Joy manages to stumble into the midst of an Interpol investigation and a murder. If she's not careful about her choice, she might be next. Even if she avoids being the next victim, she might have to make the ultimate sacrifice to save her lover. <br />*** You might be expecting a laugh a minute by the quirky title, but there is more to this than a parody. Like Buffy, the humor is set against a serious background, made of the combination of romance, passion, and death. Balancing all of this is tricky, but Ms. Macalister handles the juggling act well. She has left the door open for a continuing series, and I hope she walks through to keep this world of hers alive. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-10-27

Finding no comfort in the ordinary means of solace, she has decided to join Humans UnderGround, HUG, a group out to stop the goblins who run the world. Her flight is interupted when she finds Thomas Marrowbone hurt and needing her help. More importantly, she finds who she truly is and at last finds love.<br />Thomas, like her, is not strictly human. Unlike her, he has not spent a life suppressing his feyness. Together, they embark on a mystical and dangerous journey that will test every spiritual and physical muscle they have. Only with their love can they hope to win, much less survive. <br />**** Who says beauty can't be humorous? Ms Jackson tells a magical love story that is libearally seasoned with humor and is one of the most imaginative worlds created in this century. I can guarantee, you will not find another hero like Thomas anywhere, a man with four natures, one of them draconic. I especially enjoyed Orel, the goblin who rents Harleys.

To make it worse, the man who will inherit if she fails is Ross Blackstone, the handsome cowboy who rejected her adolescent love. <br />Returning home is hard, and not just for the obvious reasons of not wanting to give up the more modern lifestyle of New York. It will mean being in constant contact with Ross, and having to confront her anger with God.

Several years ago, he defended Christianity from a hoax that could have shaken its foundations. Still celebrating a recent victory over a faith healer / end times charlatan in court, Jon suddenly finds himself at war with none other than what appears to be Jesus Christ. <br />This new &quot;incarnation&quot; is not heralded by a star, but by the internet. As Jon watches in amazement, Joshua Ben Josef appears to be reenacting the life of Christ, and Jon's own wife is almost playing the role of Mary Magdalene. At first, Jon is certain Joshua is at best a phony, if not a devil himself, but as the miracles mount up, even he begins to be swayed. The critical confrontation between truth and falsehood will be at Vatican III, when once more, Christianity's fate may rest on what happens in Rome. Will Jon be Judas or a martyr?<br />**** Dr. Maier skillfully tells a modern parable, clearly highlighting the danger of false teachers who know how to make the truth the camoflauge for lies. Suspense will keep you riveted to the page, from beginning to end. More than a Skeleton is almost plausible enough to be true, and a frightening picture of what could be. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-10-22

It is meant to be a two way communication with the Heavenly Father, praising, thanking, interceding, and occassionally, asking. One of the most powerful ways to do this, and a good way to learn how to pray, is to pray the scriptures. The Bible is filled with prayers left by our ancestors in faith. The Rabeys have selected the 101 that have meant the most to them, some of them from the books that many ignore and have to hunt for when the pastor says look up such and so book. The verses are then tied to their own experiences in a way that makes them real and applicable to daily life. In some cases, the story will speak to your heart as much as the scripture does. In this way, they prove that the Bible is a living book, relevant today as it was when recorded. **** <br />Reviewed by Amanda	2003-10-21

Blain grew up in ignorance of his magical heritage, until he began noticing strange things about himself and falling ill.<br />With the death of his parents, the warding spells hiding Blain from the eyes of otherworldly beings fell. Fortunately, in the passing years, those his parents could trust have come to rule the Order, and they realize the danger the young man is in. Knowing that evil beings want Blain dead, the Sorceress of the Ancients takes Blain's uncle, her lover, and a weak Druid, Afton, to Maine to convince Blain who he is and protect him.<br />At first, the task seems impossible, but Afton has a unique power that may not be magical, but is effective against the forces of hate and jealousy. When unexpectedly close enemies turn on Blain, the greater power of love is there for him.<br />**** With great charm and realism, Ms. Sams makes a new entry into the Tales of the Order.

The most tempting one is the voice in our own head that tells us what we should look like and strive to be. Using the long held tradition of making a point relevant to humans through the use of animals, the author tells the story of a group of horses held captive by the desire to be what they almost are, but not quite. Then, they escape and go on a journey of discovery, following a myth to the light. Freedom is close, but only if they can overcome the deception. <br />** By its size, you might be tempted to dismiss this book as one for children, but the point it has to make is one that can be more fully appreciated by someone older.

Both fiction and non fiction have considered it from virtually every angle, from conspiracy theories to allegories, it's all been said. Few, however, have taken the book in a coolly logical way that makes it applicable for today and does not scare you into wanting to cut up every form of identification you own to avoid accidentally taking the mark of the beast.<br />Fortunately, this slim volume is the exception. Mr. Stott, a noted Biblical expositor wastes no words in addressing the beginning of Revelation. Examining each of the churches to whom Christ sent a letter, he gives the history of these places and how they might have viewed the messages, then makes them applicable to problems today.<br />**** After reading this, you won't know who the Anti-Christ is, nor will you know when the age will end. It is not a countdown to Armegeddon, but sound advice for how to live until then.

If you are shown love and respect as a child, you will know how to be loving and caring as you grow older. That simple truth is why she spent her life making dolls to give to children. She always told each child to treat their dolls kindly and with great love, because dolls are just like people. Nothing made the Doll Lady happier than to watch a child gently holding one of her dolls or singing a lullaby while rocking it to sleep.<br />Every doll the Doll Lady made was different, and she made them different for a reason ? because people are different, and all people (just like her dolls) are beautiful in their own way. Each of her dolls had its own personality and disposition and was remarkable in its own right. No two were the same. Some had chubby cheeks, some had freckles, some were yawning, and some were quite delicate. The unmistakable message the Doll Lady was imparting was this: \\"Take very special care of your dolls, for dolls are just like people. They need to be well loved, held tenderly, and always respected for their uniqueness.\\"<br />Judy Kuusisto?s illustrations in this book remind me of confections. Their colors are as soft as the dolls they portray, and they visually describe the Doll Lady making her dolls and giving them to children. She has also included a hard page in the back of the book that holds a paper doll and its clothes! What child could resist that? After reading this book my grandchildren had already fallen in love with the story and pictures, but when they saw the paper doll they were transfixed with surprise and their satisfaction was complete. <br />***** What better message could be sent to a child than one of inherent, deep-seated love and understanding for all people everywhere?

Holly's uncanny resemblance to Nina makes her the perfect tool for Daniel to attempt to drive Ryan mad. However, Daniel did not count on Ryan and Holly beginning, against all logic, to fall for one another. Nor did he anticipate the fact that the old murder would now demand justice be paid. Secrets and schemes explode with a chaotic bang that will change all their lives.<br />*** Though a creepy old mansion is missing, nonetheless, Shattered is definitely a modern gothic.

The first line of this extraordinary book caught my attention and sent my imagination soaring. \\"Once long ago, when the year was greening with spring, a brave knight was called to serve his King.\\" Soon after that opening line it was the illustrations that reached out, grabbed me, and pulled me on into this charming story of a knight who only wanted to do the bidding of his King.<br />When he first received the call to serve his King, the knight immediately set out on his journey to the castle riding his fastest horse. He had a pair of golden spurs the King had sent to him and a firm resolve in his heart to be the best knight ever. If he had been able to continue his original pace and firm resolve, the knight would have been at the King?s castle in a very short time - but that was not to be. There were many people who needed help along the way, and the knight had a compassionate nature. At first he tried to ignore their pleas for help, but soon found that his kind temperament would not allow that. So, since he was concerned about being an errant knight (disobedient, undisciplined), he was conflicted between what he thought was his duty to his King and his sympathy for strangers.<br />The knight?s many acts of kindness took him away from his original task, and it took years for him to reach the castle. Along the way he had endured many hardships and had given away most of his possessions to the poor. Upon his arrival he fell in a tattered heap near the drawbridge, and the guards laughed at him as he showed them the golden spurs in his trembling hands.<br />***** The Errant Knight has a message of love and compassion and a wonderful ending that will please children everywhere. As the story closed the knight thought he had failed his duty to his King, but he soon found that in choosing to follow his heart he had served his King best.

Children?s daydreams, in their exquisite simplicity, overflow the pages of this colorful book. From cover to cover this story is fanciful and innovative. It also happens to be beautifully written as a poem, and its illustrations are whimsical and imaginative. The story begins as a young girl gazes appealingly out the window toward the moon. Then we read these simple words - In every moon there is a face. As I read the story, and was drawn into its dreamlike fantasy, I distinctly remembered how I felt as a child when I looked up at delicate clouds floating along in the sky. I could see anything and everything in those clouds.<br />Reading this book can help children see beyond the obvious. Most children will see a face in the moon, but if they look deeper they can see the most wondrous things their imaginations can provide. They can soar through the heavens, or they can float gently on the sea, because this book stirs their imagination and brings out everything that a daydream can provide - if they just look deeper.<br />The words of the poet say it best. ?And in each child there is a sky that?s full of daydreams and balloons, and every dream?s a butterfly that?s full of moons?<br />*****Highly recommended reading for parents who remember the clouds and children who are just beginning to stretch their imaginations. *****<br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson	2003-10-06

She had the best of everything and her life was perfect ? until the dog arrived.<br />The dog, better known as the intruder, was a mischievous Pekinese puppy. It was noisy and boomeranged endlessly through the house. Princess Lillian did her best to avoid and ignore the puppy, but her family allowed it to sleep in a bed right next to hers and even fed it wonderful gourmet meals. She was jealous when they petted the puppy. She was jealous when they brushed the puppy. Princess Lillian no longer felt special, and she despised that puppy!<br />As I started reading this book, I was delighted with this snobby little Princess, but I was absolutely blown away with the incredible surprise twist in the middle of the book.<br />It began at a party that Princess Lillian had been invited to attend with her mother. Since the puppy was not invited, she had all her mother?s attention and she felt special once again. This feeling was short lived however, due to the surprise she encountered during the party.

As the hours passed, she encountered an angry drunk and a vicious dog. Frightened and confused, she managed to run from them but her beautiful party clothes became rumpled and soiled.

Rejected by everyone, heartbroken and frightened, she wandered back out onto the streets, where she was finally picked up and thrown into jail.<br />Princess Lillian was bewildered.

The most outspoken of the Twelve Apostles, Simon, later called Peter stands as a unique figure in history. To the Catholics, he is the first Pope, infallible and supreme among the disciples. The Protestants respect him, though many tend to think of him as a good ol' boy. If any of the twelve who followed Christ in the inner circle could be considered His best friend, likely, it would have been Simon Peter.<br />This was the man who alone among them dared to rebuke Christ; but he also made the declaration that was the cornerstone of the church. Peter displayed great valor and ignoble cowardice. Being impetuous was his greatest flaw, and greatest asset. Using the Bible, tradition, and secular history, Mr. Card makes a song of Peter's life. By using the popular Message Bible translation, he assures that the readers have no doubt of his meaning, however, he often cites scripture without the accompanying verse. Perhaps this is a clever way to get the readers to read their own Bible?<br />*** Whether this is true or not, reading A Fragile Stone will bring to life both the man and the times. It is plain to see that Simon Peter lived up to his call as one of the Rabbi's talmidin, and truly imitated his Master. ***<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2003-09-08

The fact that Demos' name resembles the word demon is not a coincidence. Demos is wily and diabolical as the name implies. It is not only money that divides the brothers, but the love of a woman, Susanna. She truly loves Mananen, but Demos is powerful and determined to have her, no matter what blood price that demands.<br />Then, there is Mananen's truest friend, a blind beggar who offers him and Susanna what help he can. Peniel, blind from birth has greater vision than many who can see. His kind and generous heart is displayed in many ways, and he is rewarded by helping prove that Yeshua (Jesus) is truly the Son of the Living God.<br />**** Fast paced and detailed, the Thoenes give us a tale that will give new life to Bible reading. The unheard voices of the gospels come to life and bring new depth to old stories. You will gain a new appreciation for the wit and wisdom of Christ by the time the last page is turned. ****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-09-05

He has already begun to fall in love with her without even meeting her, from the painting. Inevitably, he begins to be drawn to the real woman, despite the curse that looms over them.

In the last thirty years, few topics have raised more ire and caused more bitter division than the contraversy over abortion. The issue hinges not so much on whether a woman has a right to decide how to use her own body, but whether or not her pre born child is a person, and if so, what are that person's rights under the law? In Unalienable rights, the author lays out his case for the most logical and practical way to settle this issue. Using more legal than religious points, he demonstrates that the unborn child is in fact a person, therefore, under the consitution, entitled to the full protection of the law. Though he does not deal with some of the finer points that confound even the most devout, such as what to do if it's a question of the mother's life or the child's, he still makes a convincing argument in the prolife side of the debate.<br />*** Even if this book does not move you on the abortion issue, it still is instructive in legal matters and how to effectively present an issue to your government.

It has caused her to flee from a possible marriage after an especially frightening premonition. On her journey to a hoped for cure, she encounters a man of science, Ewan Ives. He becomes first her protector, then her husband after they are caught in a compromising spot. Suddenly, two worlds clash as the handsome logical inventor finds himself a part of the most illogical family ever encountered.<br />***** Fans of Ms Rice will in no way be disappointed as they conclude this trilogy, unless the disappointment comes from its closure.

In a plot reminescent of the X files, a scant few must race against time to stop the world from ending.<br />***** Even more exciting and heart stopping than the first novel in the series, UNHOLY DECEPTION takes the gospels into the modern age. Using tiny details that have possibly been overlooked in the Bible, the author thrills readers and will hopefully incite more than a handful to read the Book that gives it foundation. The door for the story to continue is wide open.I hope that it does. *****	2003-07-10

One line in the Bible has caused many learned people to scratch their heads and wonder what it means. That line is Genesis 6 verse 2, which refers to the \\"sons of God\\" or the Nephilim, whose illicit intercourse with the \\"daughters of men\\" was one of the factors that lead to the Great Flood. Theories about who or what they are have burned the air waves on talk shows and interrupted more than one Sunday School lesson.<br />In this thought provoking novel, the author tackles it head on with clarity and a well thought out theory. In NEPHILIM, we are offered the possibility that they are not demons or giants, but aliens. This aeons old secret is discovered by a burnt out alcholic reporter, Mac Mackenzie when he finds a hysterical patient in a secret psychiatric ward in a new hospital. She has wild tales of alien impregnation that spark a news story that opens a hornet's nest of an international and perhaps beyond level.<br />Following the trail leads Mac to the Holy Land where he meets a group of Messianic Jews who have a frightening tale for him. The Nephilim are returning, bent on once more engendering hybrids between themselves and humans, causing events that could lead to an all out war between the powers that be, one that could very well end life on Earth, as it did when they first came. Mac finds that he must recover the faith he abandoned to join his new friends in stopping this event. Yet, the end might only be the beginning.<br />***** If you loved the X files at its best or have ever wondered about that verse in Genesis, you will be riveted to the pages of this book. It is far more frightening and plausible than the Left Behind series, and each hypothesis is backed up with scriptures that give it an added realism. Mac is not a perfect hero one might expect to find in an inspirational book but a man scarred by earning a Phd in the school of hard knocks. Only the hope that is given will keep this from being the scariest thing you have read in a while. *****	2003-07-10

Beautifully written, this lyrical tale tells us of Niamh, a halfling princess whose beauty is beyong compare. It is so great that it carries a terrible price. None can look upon her without going mad or being driven to seek a holy life. It would seem that this girl who has so much to give, for she is as beautiful inside as outside, will be alone forever, but then her parents learn of a man whose soul has strength enough to withstand her beauty. Niamh begins corresponding with him, and her heart is won, despite the rumors that he is terrible to look upon.<br />Yet, before the hermit can come and claim his bride, the price of her loveliness banishes the princess from the court into the wild world. Alone and frightened, she manages to make her way in life, while the valiant hermit seeks her untiringly, through danger and pain.<br />***** This story is only slightly less beautiful than the title character, which is fortunate, since otherwise, readers would be driven insane by picking up the pages. With a subtly inspirational message combined with mists and myth, this novel enchants the youthful spirit that lives within us all. *****	2003-07-10

This might be an odd view for someone like her, a werewolf, but it is hers. When she meets a witch who seems to know all about her, Elena has to change her mind, and fast.<br />There is a sick minded man with too much money and power out to build a private collection of paranormals for his own curiousity. Elena finds herself drawn into a plan to stop him, but soon finds herself a member of this outre mueseum, along with witches, vampires, and half demons. There is even a child captured there. Elena is determined to get free, and to take everyone with her. Whether or not she gets to do that, is another thing. This is the most dangerous time of Elena's life. She will have to trust people she never would have believed existed not long ago, and use all of her own gifts in this often confusing and very frightening drama in which she is a forced player.<br />***** While Elena's story has been compared to that of Anita Blake, Elena is a more accessible heroine than Anita has lately become. She is more like Eve Dallas, a mixture of hard and soft, with true caring that reveals her heart and her strength. With each new book, this fascinating world unfolds a bit more, and though only one more book has been rumored for the series, the possibilties for many more than that tantalize. This is a series that if you have missed out on it so far, you definitely need to remedy that immediately. *****	2003-07-10

Now, though, she has come up against an opponent she just can't lick, her grandfather. It seems that the gold stake she sold Cougar Barnes actually belongs to the old goat, and he has reclaimed it. This puts Georgie in the awkward position of having inadvertently cheated a friend, but there is a way out of her mess. If she will agree to grandpa's terms, come back to \\"civilization\\", become a \\"lady\\" and marry the wimp he has picked out, thus cementing a business merger, the mine is hers, free and clear. This is not a solution that makes her really happy, but she has little choice. The wimp is nice enough, but the becoming a lady part, well, Georgie absalutely hates that part. She puts it a bit more colorfully, however. Grandpa's plans might have to change when Cougar shows up and interferes with Georgia's heart.<br />***** If you have laughed and enjoyed My Fair Lady and The Princess Diaries, then you will love BECOMING GEORGIA as well. One laugh follows another as we see the results of an irresistible object meeting an inmoveable force. *****	2003-07-03

Though fourteen years separate their ages, she has been in love with him for years. In fact, you would think she would be thrilled, she has been his wife for five years, since she was sixteen and he rescued her from her abusive father.<br />The drawback is that the union is only in name, Judd has never touched her, just been her friend, protector, and business partner. She is almost of age to be able to stand on her own, and then Judd will annul the marriage. To Crissy, it looks like he is more than ready for them both to move on, but Judd's life as a Texas Ranger has made a few enemies for him, and now one of them is planning to use Crissy to get to him. Will danger awaken the passion she has longed for for so long?<br />***** Once again, Diana Palmer follows the lines that she has used to win fans and create a successful career. The days of the wild west seem closer, and she utilizes the marriage of convenience plotline that has worked well with Regencies. As always, a young, innocent but spunky heroine loves a man it would be impossible not to love. Judd, like all her Texas men, will win your heart, just as he wins Crissy's. *****	2003-07-03

The boss is just as likely to have them as the worker, and the person with the answer might not always be the one who appears to have it all.<br />This is the case as the lives of several divergent women intersect and they discover hope and understanding crossing lines of race, class, and position. A rich woman finds friendship and hope with women she believed beneath her, and wisdom is found in unexpected places.<br />**** I hope this is the beginning of a new career for Bishop Jakes, packaging his misinterpretatations of the Bible in fictional form, thereby diluting their potential harm. Although there are several positive messages conveyed, there is at least one misuse of Biblical terms that might be applicable to his story, but could be dangerous if used in a more factual sense.	2003-07-03

Jane is over the moon when she is late and decides that because she is never late, that she must be pregnant. Visions of wedding bells, etc. fill her head, and the world turns a rosy pink hue. Unfortunately, her period does arrive a few days later, meaning that all the dreams she has had are down the drain, and she will have to admit to everyone who has been so nice to her because of her condition that it was all a mistake. That does not make her very happy, so she decides to go through with being pregnant.<br />The results are interesting. Yes, people are nicer, but there are drawbacks. First off, she can no longer smoke or drink in public. There is no baby, so she has to work to be able to exhibit the symptoms that people are expecting. She has to give up her exercise classes, and Trevor, her boyfriend is not very happy with her, especially once he finds out the truth.<br />Trevor's leaving does not change the plan, though. Jane continues being \\"pregnant,\\" receiving accolades for her bravery. There is yet another twist. She falls in love, and her new love does not have any idea she is \\"expecting\\".<br />The complications abound with every passing page, as does the bittersweet hilarity. Jane learns valuable lessons about honesty, love, and putting others ahead of herself before it is all over and done, but it will take a miracle to save her.<br />***** This is an extraordinarily different book, one that will make you laugh and cry both. It also leaves you wondering, what happened. Jane is just a typical person, one you can almost identify with. She and her fellow cast members join the rising trend of characters who are not extraordinary, just people. *****	2003-07-03

Fans of Christine Feehan are in for a double treat as this anthology features a haunting story by her at the beginning and a preview of her upcoming novel. Though this is not a Carpathian story, like that series, two lovers are brought together by destiny and magic, but opposition from the outside world threatens both their love and their lives.<br />Katherine Sutcliffe gives us a fast paced story of an FBI profiler with a useful gift that borders on being a curse. With the help of a seductive detective, she strives to stop a killer targeting prostitutes. However, even his protection may not be enough to keep her alive. This is one that I hope is only the beginning of a longer novel, the cliffhanger ending is chilling.<br />Fiona Brand carries readers to an exotic and unique setting as two people find themselves suddenly free to pursue a forbidden love. Passion flares from every page as a reserved widow and a sexy bad boy find love despite small town politics and the threat of home invasion.<br />Rounding out the collection, Eileen Wilks gives us a snappy, fast moving werewolf story. Werewolves appear to be behind a series of murders, and a beautiful detective is forced to work with one to solve the case. Her prejuidice against his kind quickly melts under their mutual attraction, but conflict of interest and the mix of their races might be more than their love can overcome.<br />***** Each of these stories is a gem, well worth the readers' time. The only fault with this anthology is each story deserves to be a full length book. *****	2003-07-03

The author explores the allegory and symbolic themes in this picture that have caused this phenomena. Though some orthodox Christians might take issue with the weight he gives gnostic gospels, on the whole, Mr. Seay provides an in depth look that can provide good subject matter for a small group discussion. Using text from the Message version of the Bible, he also makes it easily accessible to the masses, some of whom could have difficulty with the more formal King James or American Standard texts that many authors use for such quotation.<br />***** Books such as this provide a bridge for adults and teens, giving them common ground to dialog about, and perhaps can help swell the church population in a non crisis situation.	2003-06-25

Her answers lie within the forest, but her mentor has warned her to stay away from it. It is a dark, dangerous place, haunted by spirits who could destroy her, as they did her parents.<br />Yet, this gentle soul is also brave, and she must learn the truth. What lies ahead will amaze her, for her quest will give her more answers than she was looking for, ones about not only her parents, but about who she is herself.<br />***** With this book, Mr. Barron reaches out to a younger audience than many of his books appeal to. It is, as are his other works, heart warming and insightful. What struck me most is the affirmation of the importance of one's heritage and parents in a time when young people learn earlier and earlier to rebel. If you loved the story ANIMAL FAMILY by Randall Jarrett, this book will speak to the same place in your soul.	2003-06-25

In an unbelieveable turn of events, Claire finds herself widowed when Keith apparently commits suicide by leaping into those same falls.<br />Yet, Claire is unable to accept this. Determinedly, she forces the handsome sherriff to help her find out what really happened to her husband. This quest is one that will open up secrets all across the town. There are a surprising number of suspects and hidden motives. Only two things are clear, times are very dangerous, and Claire is finding herself falling for Noah, her reluctant ally.<br /> Small towns are filled with secrets and lies.

Yet, it is more often than not someone who you might not notice who is truly a hero. In this book, the author concisely illustrates from legend and reality the true nature of a hero, defining the qualities of perserverance, kindness, and courage, etc. that set a hero apart from the crowd. While many of the people he uses will be familiar, such as Esther, Princess Leia, Anne Frank, for example, some of the real life heroes are people that have been ignored. He presents role models for not only children, but for all people to strive and emulate in their lives. You never know when you might be called upon to be one, for as one of his examples, Princess Leia said, \\"They were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Naturally, they became heroes.\\"	2003-06-17

Her sister, Macie, who was just a child when he last knew her, has grown up into a stronger woman than Felicity ever was, and is demanding that he help her find his son.<br />As they work together to rescue the boy before vengeance is taken on him, Slade begins to wonder if he should have waited for the baby sister to grow up, for Macie is much more than Felicity ever could have hoped to be. Dangers all around them drive the couple together as this action packed, exciting romance races to its thrilling and touching conclusion.<br />***** Under any name, this author is guaranteed to give her readers an exciting story, heady romance, and a touching plot that will warm your heart. Slade is the older man that most of us dream about finding, not too old, but like fine wine, aged to perfection. His son looks to be someone who might grow up to be just like dad, so if the author reads this, please take the hint for a sequel. *****	2003-06-17

Troian long ago lost his ability to see color or to feel, as he searched for centuries for his lifemate. He has almost given up when he has a one of a kind meeting with the woman who is his destiny. Loving Joie gives him not only his life back, but a family. Yet, the evil threat of the fallen members of his race threatens to steal his newfound joy. It will take everything not only he and his lifemate have, but call upon the resources of her family as well to defeat them.<br />Susan Grant provides her fans with a bit of history on the people who have made hers a beloved series of futuristic novels. Fans will appreciate the added depth the prequel gives to her other books.<br />Ms. Squires' contribution is an extremely well written continuation of SACRAMENT. She dares to take a villain and turn her into a heroine. The gothic mood is often lightened with quirky humor as Magda deals with the confusing world of the present. Yet before she can achieve her goals and prove herself, she may find that her reputation is more of a handicap than she anticipated. Truth, love, and the importance of the past are all themes that are tenderly portrayed.<br />**** Love is the one thing no one can live without, as each novella reveals in its own unique way.

His work as a smoke jumper takes him into danger almost daily. He is a rule breaker and risk taker, but even more than that, he is Immortal. He is one of an ancient race descended from the Atlanteans and charged with watching over humanity. For the most part, he lives life with little contact with his people. <br />That all changes when his irratating uncle shows up on his doorstep. Gavin has an assignment that William would refuse, but when his uncle explains the odds at stake, he can not refuse. It is his mission to go back in time and keep a renegade Immortal from seeking revenge on those who killed his brother by making sure that Bloody Mary remains alive and Elizabeth never becomes queen. While the historical implications are frightening enough, no Shakespeare, none of the advances of the Elizabethan era, the end of the Reformation, for William, it is even more so. The first targets of the revenge will be his own parents. <br />In the past, William immediately continues his heroics by rescuing a young woman, though at first it appears to have cost his life. The maiden takes him home, hoping to cure him, and is blown away when he appears to rise from death. Her parents are not stunned, however. She is the adopted half breed child of an Immortal and his human lover. Bringing William home draws her into the line of danger involved in the war between good and bad Immortals and also risks bringing her own secret past to light. <br />All of that is secondary though, for Isobel and William immediately fall in love, even though that is breaking every rule that William has not already broken. <br />***** Spanning centuries, this is a well balanced time travel romance that makes sense. So often, such books, while fun, still stretch credibility, but not this one. The characters are dynamic and likeable, unless you are supposed to hate them. Then, they are thoroughly despicable. The best part? The threadsfor several sequels are apparent, promising readers the hope of even more Immortal stories in the future. *****	2003-06-11

In some ways, this might be good, but it does cause some bitter division in churches that have not settled on the style that \\"works\\" for them.<br />Is this the right way for it to be? Has the purpose of worship gotten lost somewhere between the traditions and the new ways? Where is God in all this, in other words.<br />The author, one of the members of the popular White Horse Inn radio show that examines Reformed theology for the edification and equipment of the believers, realizes that worship is one of the primary functions of those God has called to Himself. Using Biblical illustration, he teaches readers what worship was meant to be, and also provides some useful material that brings aspects of the Bible to a new light and helps some parts that have not quite made sense a bit more comprehensible.<br />***** The man to whom the book is dedicated, James M.

The language and history are often alien to the modern reader, and the whole task become daunting in a fairly short time.<br />***** The author has recognized this dilema and in this short volume attempts to give the reader of any level a short course in hermaneutics, the art and science of Biblical interpretation. Though he gives an overview of the whole book, he focuses primarily on the books of James, Romans, Luke, and Revelation. With sharp insight and humor, Mr. Briggs helps even those familiar with Scripture become more so.	2003-06-05

Matters of the heart, both romantic and otherwise plauge them as the newly found families learn to love one another and deal with romances. New love and new life await, but so do pain and danger.<br />**** Not classified an inspirational romance, this novel still has profoundness that will appeal to the Christian audience, despite occassionally strong language and sexual tensions. However, like Andrew Greeley or Nelson DeMille, Ms. Goudge has succsessfully realized in her writing that Christians do not live in a whitewashed world and have flaws and issues just the same as secular people. ****	2003-06-04

At nineteen, she is a genius, dateless, unemployed, and while not agoraphobic, prefers not to leave her home. At her father's insistence, she sees a psychiatrist weekly, but is getting nowhere. The doctor gives her an assignment. She is to name things she loves, do things on the list, join something, celebrate New Year's, and go on a date.<br />Carrie does her best to follow the assignment. She does join a church, though she suspects it might be a cult, does some things on the list, especially the sleeping part, and places a personal ad to get a date. It is not her fault that all the repliers are unsuitable. Her odyssey to get a date will lead her through several unfortunate meetings, a lesbian encounter, and a promising relationship with a man cheating on his fiance. Carrie learns a lot about herself and about life, and gives the reader her witty commentary in the process.<br />***** Carrie is someone with whom everyone can identify, at least in part. She is so realistic, it can be scary at times. However, she is someone that you will want for your best friend, once you can get her to leave home to meet you. *****	2003-06-04

That all changes is a moment when the police come to her door to announce their deaths in a tragic car wreck, one that was not an accident.<br />Kellie can not seem to get her life back on track after this, not until she knows why her family was destroyed. Her quest for the truth gives her a name to go on, Tom Whelan. She sets out to meet him and find out his connection to her brother. Instead of the killer she was expecting to find, she finds a man she can love. However, Tom is still married, though the marriage is essentially over, with his wife in prison and someone he no longer loves. Tom also has a troubled past with the IRA, and that part of his life is about to cause problems, as is his wife's return, and Kellie's own secret. Her deception puts lives at risk, and could destroy her future.<br />***** THE DELANEY WOMAN was one I expected to be a gentle meandering trip through Ireland. Instead, I got a thrilling mystery with warm moments and a to die for, mature hero with a heroine I could sympathize with easily. You can feel Kellie's pain if you have ever loved and lost. Tom's daughter is a charmer as well, but not a kid that overwhelms the plot. I am hoping for a sequel; there are characters worthy of exploration left with their stories untold. *****	2003-06-04

However, that is not always the case. For example, town doctor June Hudson managed to keep her secret romance hidden so well that no one knew about it until she was several months pregnant. Fortunately, by the time it was noticed, the father had returned to June's life. Now that Jim Post retired from the DEA, he wanted to make a new life in Grace Valley with June and his child. Hopefully, they can make it to the alter before the baby makes it to the world.<br />June is not alone in having secrets. Her Aunt Myrna has a hidden love as well, and the preacher is hiding something too. There is plenty to keep the tongue waggers busy, plus danger comes from natural and man made causes to keep life interesting.<br />**** With more tension than the Mitford series that this book could be compared to, Ms. Carr holds the readers' interests from page one. The suspense is mild, just enough to keep things from getting boring, and her portrayal of small town life seems well researched and accurate. ****	2003-06-04

Krogan, the demon, would be unable to harm anyone for as long as the reptile lived, and tortoises live a very, very long time.<br />At least they are supposed to. That does not prove to be the case with this one, and barely two years after being imprisoned, the demon is free, and more dangerous than ever. Now, he wants revenge on anyone who had anything to do with those tortured months trapped inside the beast. Gavin and his very pregnant wife are at the top of the list. Krogan chooses a wrestler as his host, and proceeds to begin his campaign of mayhem once again.<br />Gavin realizes what is happening, and has his fears confirmed upon learning that the prison that held Krogan is dead. Racing against time, he must call upon all the faith he and others possess to war against this prince of Hell and prevent Armegedon.<br />***** If you ever had the idea that Christian novels are bland and to borrow a good friend's term \\"wimpy\\", then think again. This novel proves that that concept is wrong. The characters are not goody goodies, but real, living, gritty people who struggle with faith and life. It serves as a sharp reminder that as Christians, our enemies are more than what and who we can see with frightening and thrilling text.	2003-05-28

His tricks mystify with their success, and he owes it all to being a half blooded Fae. All that could come crashing down if an enterprising reporter who has known him all his life and knows his secret tells all in an expose. Said reporter also happens to be a full blooded Fae Princess named Rose Thayer who prefers living among mortals. She has the true magic Brandon craves, but does not want to use it. Like in the old Bewitched shows where Sam would get sick from not using her power, Rose's denial is having consequences. She is leaking magic, and affecting the mortal world in violation of Fae rules. The romance Brandon wants to rekindle with her might be doomed if she is forced to return to the other world to protect the secret of the Fae's existence and not cause chaos in the \\"real world\\".<br />...In a light romp, Karen Fox again charms readers. There are some parallels that could appeal to fans of the \\"Merry Gentry \\" books, but it is not quite as intense. Her afterword makes it clear that the seeds she plants for future sequels will be cultivated, to the delight of her fans.	2003-05-28

The two try to conceal their love and lust behind animosity, but to no avail. Just as they are finding love again, her primary goal is threatened by man and nature both. A life and death struggle ensues, and love is the lifeline that may not be strong enough to save Lily from the dire consequences of her willingness to risk all for her cause.<br />***** Revealing a deep love of nature and appreciation for the dynamics of human conflict, Laura Moore tells a compelling story that will hold readers' attention from cover to cover.

Jesse sees this as the perfect chance to get to know his dad better, but things don't quite work out that way.<br />The adjustment is hard on both men. Mickey is still striving to overcome the loss of his wife, a woman he loved, but had no real passion for; and this bland marriage is one that has shaped Jesse's own view of love and romance. It is a perspective that might cause him to lose the woman who could be the one for him, so Mickey takes steps to help save Jesse's love affair with Marina. In the process, he gains an unexpected reward.<br />***** Touching and educational rather than depressing, this novel is told through flashbacks and two distinct voices in both first and third person.

However, many of us do read other books, and there are things to learn from them that mirror Biblical truths.<br />***** Mary Riso explores this in her book, HEROINES. Using characters familiar to those students of classic literature, such as CS Lewis, the Brontes, the SECRET GARDEN, and some less familiar, she draws out the morals to be learned from the women featured in these novels. Many of these books are ones that have been regulated to childhood, but though unstated, she makes the point that Jesus made, that we are to come as children, thus, reading from \\"children's \\" literature might help us to do this. This is not a book for \\"chicks\\" alone, but also for men, for anyone who wants to discover the treasures to be found on dusty library shelves. *****	2003-05-09

Jason is finally free to return to real life and reunite with the woman he loves and had to leave seven years ago, in the process, he will get to meet his son, Davy, at last. Of course, it won't be as easy as all that.<br />First off, as far as Davy's mom, Lane Kent is concerned, Jason abandoned her when she was pregnant. She may still love him, but the hurt is great, and she is ready to get on with her life, in the form of trying to find another man to be her love and Davy's father.<br />Then, there is the fact that Jason's evil father wants to kidnap the boy before he turns seven. This is the man who kept Jason and Lane apart for all that time. You see, Jason is not just a man, nor is his father or his son.<br />Jason is a Protector, a super hero, and his father is the most evil of all the Protectors' enemies, an Outcast. If the evil Hieronomous can capture Davy, he can drain the boy's powers just as he turns seven and actualizes them completely. Lane knows nothing about all this, until Hieronomous sends his other son, Mord, to kidnap Davy. Once that is accomplished, Lane, Jason, and other Protectors readers have grown to love, including a certain ferret, must rescue him. Hopefully, there will be time for Jason to reignite Lane's love, but that has to be secondary to finding Davy. Hieronomous must not become any more powerful.<br />***** As always, Julie Kenner can be counted upon to deliver a fun book, something most of us can really use along about now. Though lighter than SILENT CONFESSIONS, it still has powerful, intense love scenes. Lane may not be a heroine, but she is not a force to be lightly taken, and Jason is as charming as the dolphin he can become. I hope that this is not the last in the series, and that maybe the mysterious Mordecai gets his own story in the near future. *****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-05-09

Nearly forty years ago, three young women feel that they are called to serve God, and their chosen way is to become nuns.

As the years pass, each one is called upon to make sacrifices, to face humility, and to use her gifts to the maximum. Through the changes wrought by Vatican II, Vietnam, and life's own quirks, the girls are brought to the point where they must choose whether or not to remain as they are or to rejoin the world outside the convent doors...This timely, serious novel will face critsism as anti-religious by some, yet the opposite is true. It shows how you can serve God, even if it's not always the way you think you are meant to at first. Love and duty can sometimes be at war. Like Father Greeley, Ms. Macomber sheds new light on the lives of the secluded and tells a fine story in the process.	2003-05-05

Jesus Christ was dragged before the Roman politician who had to make the fateful choice that would place the Messiah on the cross. Who was this man, Pontius Pilate? What was life really like in those days, what political forces shaped events of that moment?<br />***** Paul Maier does an excellent job of exploring these questions in his novel that was published decades ago, but due to the timelessness of the subject, has held up well over the years. Pilate's choices are seen as both political and perhaps even divine necessity as the day that will become Good Friday unfolds. With the use of real figures and well researched customs, Dr. Maier sweeps readers back two millenia. Calling it fiction is almost an insult, because it is so very realistic. One complaint is that there is not a sequel exploring Pilate's wife, a woman who stands beside Caeser's wife in fascination.	2003-04-29

He watches as politics shape the church, then is called to the White House where he meets President Carter and is witness to national crises. However, the national and worldwide events pale compared to the desolation that is in Chuck's heart. A thriving career and beautiful wife just are not enough to satisfy him. Divine intervention alone will restore his joy.<br />**** Lovingly told, this story will enchant readers familiar with the series, but new readers will most likely be a bit lost. However, new or old, you can not miss or fail to be charmed by Father Greeley's warm writing style that plays out events casually, but still has a profound message. Particularly engaging is the way he has divine figures show up in such a friendly manner.	2003-04-29

After coping with magical voice mail, which is much worse than mortal voice mail, she finally gets someone to come over; in fact, she gets twice as many wizards as she was expecting. The competition shows up as well. <br />Removing the stain is not a simple process. The stain is a clue in a magical attempted murder, involves multiple spells, and creates a hole in her living room, through which her cat disappears. If there is anything fortunate about the whole mess, it's that the wizard in charge is a sexy as sin hunk, and has as many lustful thoughts about Petra as she does about him. <br />***** Be prepared to have fun when you read this fast paced, witty novel. Part screwball comedy, part cozy mystery, and totally hot (not just because the hero shoots flames eitiher) this is a debut that heralds a sparkling future.	2003-04-29

In such a place, there should not be a rash of murders, especially not ones as baffling as the ones she is now trying to solve. The first victim was supposed to be only in early middle age, but appeared to be an old man who died with a very odd expression on his face. It is not long before other bodies begin appearing, one of them her own best friend. Brandy seeks help from computer genius, Dan Martin. What she gets is a lot more. <br />She begins to fall in love with Dan, but a mysterious secret keeps them apart at first. Dan has an inside track on the killer that is completely unexpected, and shocking. Brandy finds that she is facing an other worldly villain that will attempt to corrupt her very soul. Small town politics and murders may be what she is fighting on the surface, but the truth is one she can hardly believe. Vampires are real.<br />***** In a complex and fast paced plot, readers are given a new twist on the old legends. Dan is an appealing hero, but not as other worldly and brooding as many heroes in this genre are. Brandy is a modern, strong willed woman whom many readers will find similiar to themselves. If it is possible, this would make a fantastic continuing series.	2003-04-23

Byron has lived for centuries, holding back the darkness that seeks to escape and rule his soul, waiting for the one woman who can bring him to life again and restore the joy in his life and world. At last, he has found her, Antoinetta (Toni) Scarletti, a blind beauty with the voice of an angel. He becomes a friend and protector to her family. <br />Although she is handicapped and lied to, Toni is still formidible in her own right, well able to stand up to Byron's old world dominance of male over female. Together they must solve the puzzle of who is trying to destroy her family. Only then can she take her rightful place in his world.<br />***** As always, Ms. Feehan's beautiful use of language dances on the edge of erotic in its sensuality, without ever descending to tawdriness. She shows readers to magic and power of love, to transform a gray, nearly evil life into one of joy and hope. The loveliness if the concept of a man and woman destined for one another, even though separated by centuries and forced to wait for one another is an idea she expresses well. Parts of this book make it her best.But if you missed out on the others in the Scarletti series, you might feel slightly lost in some areas.	2003-04-23

On what he thinks is a routine field trip, he is suddenly transported to another world, one where he is expected to be either a promised savior, or the equivalent of the anti-Christ. He wants to believe that it is all a dream, like the ones that have haunted him, but it is not. <br />He has been sent to another realm, one that is being torn apart by the forces of good and evil, where the few brave enough to believe in the truth are fighting for the true religion to win over the evil lords who would subvert and dominate their land. Before Gideon can win against the evil though, he must face the most difficult enemy of all, himself.<br />Fans of Tolkien, Terry Brooks, and especially Stephen Donaldson will find this a worthy additon to their shelves. Like these others, the story is an epic one, where current generation are still paying for the acts of one evil person in the distant past. It will take an unlikely, and often unwilling hero from another world to succeed where others have labored in vain. Magic and power ripple through every page of this profound story.	2003-04-23

After spending a wretched winter break in Genovia, Mia returns home, anxious to see her new boyfriend, even though they have not been on a date yet, Michael (or as Grandmere prefers to call him \\"that boy\\"). She is tired, and excited, and worried about what to do for Michael's birthday. However, she has made a monumental decision to follow Grandmere's advice and adopt a Jane Eyre attitude and make Michael chase her. So, Mia does her best not to call him, and even delays returning calls. <br />American life has a few other challenges for the Princess. School work, figuring out what her talent that puts her in the Gifted and Talented program is, handling best friend Lily's disgust over the movie made of Mia's life, her mother's pregnancy, and so on while still trying to have a romance and her daily Princess lessons prove to be almost more than Mia can handle. Then, Michael asks her for a first date, and life is suddenly as rosy as it gets, until Grandmere shows up at school to pull Mia out of class. At first, she thinks her dad must have had a recurrance of his cancer, then learns it is nothing more than Clarisse's excuse to take her on a shopping trip. Mia possesses nothing that is suitable to wear to a certain ball, one that happens to fall the same time as the first date. Mia moves Heaven and Earth in an attempt to get out of it, but no matter how much she complains about Grandmere, she can not let the old lady down, even if it has dire consequences for her lovelife.Will Michael understand? <br />... In a poll, Princess Mia ranked only third on the list, but if she were real, I think she would be the number one. This book is one that proves that adults need to take time and read kids' books every now and then. Mia is a delightful person, one that you wish could actually get in a seat of power and help run the world. She has fresh ideas and a unique perspective that is a mix of insecurity, angst, and superiority. Her fellow cast members also are a delight, especiallyClarisse (Grandmere). I look forward to the next book and to the movie as well.	2003-04-11

Lacey Wright has pulled up stakes and moved herself and her teenaged daughter, Robin, to a small town in Texas where this prim, football hating lady will be managing a sports bar. Lacey has no idea how to do this, but is determined to try. She did not count on the bar's owner, legendary football hero Bobbie Mac living across the hall from her and Robin, nor had she anticipated how much he would irratate her, and attract her. <br />Lacey is not the kind of woman Bobbie Mac is usually partial to, but something about her, her [attractiveness] despite her innocence and oh so proper facade, draws him. Even when he knows she has lied to him, Bobbie can't stop loving her. However, he is not interested in putting down roots yet or giving up his football career. He may be injured and recovering, but as soon as he can, he will be back to being a star in every game. However, Lacey might have a few different ideas.<br />While the adults have their romance going, Robin is discovering first love with a local bad boy. Robin is much like her mom, smart and innocent, but Kyle can not stay away from her. Their secondary story is a sweet and passionate one that is no less enjoyable than watching the sparks fly between Lacey and Bobbie. <br />*...For those of us who have mourned the passing of the Chicago Stars (Susan E. Phillips), we will find an especial joy in reading about Bobbie Mac, the bad boy with a heart of gold. Lacey is the perfect foil to him, and the perfect complement as well. She is one lady who won't take anything off of him, and that is exactly what he needs; while Bobbie is the only one who is able to penetrate the defensive wall around her heart and release the woman who has been hiding for far too long. This is a light and warm read, without ever degenerating to silliness and has just the right amount of passion, but is not so heated that [love] overrides the excellent story. *...	2003-04-01

Callista Melbourne was raised far from her homeland of England on the exotic Greek isle, Corfu. Her father's dying wishes are that she return home and marry a man he has arranged a match for her with. Callista is willing to the first part, but the second is repugnant to her. She is determined to escape it, somehow, never dreaming that Mother Nature will intervene and she will be swept from her ship in the midst of a storm. <br />Callie is rescued by a young man who had been out to sea seeking his own death. Instead, he winds up a savior. Adam Carlyle had relished the thought of his death at sea; his life had been empty since his wife and child died, and dying but with his body lost would complicate his detested cousin's life. <br />Callie, now an amnesiac, complicates his instead. He wants to help her, to find out who she is, but in the process falls in love. Adam never imagines that the woman he now loves and who has restored his will to live was on her way to marry the cousin he so despises. The truth coming out will bring them to some hard choices. Once again, Adam may be Callie's only salvation.<br />***** With freshness and joy, Ms. Kingsley does not disappoint her fans. Callie is a heroine with a fresh outlook on life, and Adam broods just enough to appeal to those who love a hero with a tinge of being gothic. As always, the back cast in one of her books is well defined and crucial to the story, not merely background. Though a bit too spicy to qualify as a Christian novel, there are spiritual truths that will also open your heart and mind.	2003-04-01

Only a few films manage to do this, STAR WARS, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, and LORD OF THE RINGS are among the scant examples. There is so much packed into this movie that many viewers might miss what is really there, only having fun and enjoying the spectacular FX work.<br />While that is not a bad thing, it would be a shame to miss all the depths hidden behind the fun, so the authors in this book have analyzed it on several levels. On a scientific front, the hows of THE MATRIX are examined, explaining the mind boggling concepts that when probed can be seen as frightening possibilities, even probabilities. However, the book's real impact is when it gets into the philosophy and religious aspects of the whole thing. It is shown to be parabolic to not only the Christian religion, but to Jews and Buddists as well. Allegories are explained and critiqued in depth.<br />***** If you have never seen the movie, like me, you will be prompted automatically to go out and rent it. Much of the book, despite the helpful glossary in the back, will make little sense without having seen MATRIX. After seeing it, and reading the book, learning how plausible it might be, then you will wonder about what is real. Isn't that a question that has tormented the greatest thinkers of time? This is a book not to be missed if you have a critical, yet open mind. *****	2003-04-01

Vermillion Durant's destiny seems to be that of her beautiful and famous relatives, that of a courtesan. Even her name is spicy and enticing. Yet she prefers to think of herself as simply \\"Lee\\", a much more innocent and free young lady than she is expected to be. However, she is resigned to her fate, believing that is what her beloved aunt needs her to be.<br />However, Vermillion is suspected of being more than a temptress, but also of being a spy. To uncover the truth, Caleb Tanner will masquerade as a simple groom and try to get close enough to see whether or not she is responisible for secrets making their way to France. Caleb is shocked to learn that Lee is nothing like what he expected. The real woman is someone that he can not help but love. Vermillion finds herself attracted to this man as well, but believes such a match would never work. Even when she finds her true identity, the situation appears hopeless.<br />The complexities of war and of the 'ton are equal, and when meshed become a tangle that only skillful minds can fathom. With Ms. Martin's long heralded skill at delivering a sensual romance, this novel gives readers a most unique heroine. Wise and innocent simultaneously, Vermillion is somewhat like the younger days of Elizabeth Taylor, while Caleb is the kind of hero readers have grown to love. Fans will not be short changed.	2003-03-31

The fifth death is always the most gruesome, with the victim's heart removed, and most likely eaten. <br />Dallas Sloan's niece had been one of the victims. Now, this FBI agent was committed to finding and stopping her killer. When it seems that the monster has taken up residence in a small backwoods town, that is where he goes, only to be caught in a storm and forced to take refuge with the local oddity, psychic Genny, the sherriff's cousin. At first, he thinks the beautiful woman is just a bit odd or overly imaginative, but when her visions prove true, he is forced to change his mind. Things take a grim turn when Dallas finds the link in the victims, and it is one that shows him the woman he is beginning to care for too much is likely to be on the hit list. Racing against time, he fights to save the woman he loves.<br />***** Small town secrets, witchcraft, passion, suspense, and magic blend into a nail biting story that zips along at a good pace and holds your attention from the very first word. Dallas is a man haunted and driven, and very realistic. He is a hero you can easily imagine existing, not one who is larger than life. Genny has the sweet air that older women or younger fans of classic movies will be able to associate with Jenifer Jones, or perhaps more recently, Mandy Moore. The chills created are enough to keep you up all night. If you enjoy Linda Howard, you will definitely fall in love with this writer.	2003-03-28

When Jo and Dan fall apart from each other, Jo is just not ready to let go. It's bad enough that her job is being eliminated and her parents are on the verge of divorce, and putting her right smack in the middle of it. She ought to be able to have a relationship at least!<br />Thinking it would be a good thing to be someone else, she invents a new persona via email and manages to contact Dan through his work email address. At first, her results are less than stellar, but then she scores. Just when that occurs though, her job is gone, and with it, access to a computer. <br />With a bit of finagling, Jo manages to get computer access again, and begins a serious, yet harmless flirtation with Dan, learning things about him that she never imagined. This email romance or friendship serves also to make Dan begin rethinking things, and Jo as well. Dan finds himself torn between two women, the woman in his past, Jo, and the \\"woman\\" in the present, who he does not know is one and the same. Will he take the news well if he finds out the truth? There are a couple of other women who just might affect the way things go.<br />*** At times, the plot is convoluted, and some of the foreign language, aka British, might be a bit hard for American \\"chicks\\" to follow. However, this screwball modern romance has all the charm of SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE or SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. It has useful lessons about never judging a person only on what you think you might see without all the facts.	2003-03-28

Taking her does not give Stone a victim, but another enemy, one who will prove deadly as she helps Ben track him down once she is free. <br />***** This novel in the WEST TEXAS SUNRISE SERIES moves faster than the initial one.

It also endangers both him and Lee. The wildness evolves into murder. It is too late to stop the race though, and it will take every resource in Lee to win it. Faith and courage are key elements to proving herself.<br />***** This innocent novel will appeal to fans of Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey.

This is part of a three book series the authors have written to counter the major movements that run counter to Christianity. I would imagine that you are surprised to see the Mormons and the Catholics on this list. However, the authors succinctly, yet deeply expose the misinformation that populate these organizations. While Catholicism is basically Christian and has few errors, there are major points that a true Christian will not be able to support if he or she is determined to be Christian. Mormons are shown to be an outright cult, and particularly in light of recent events, the book on Islam can be a bit scary. It reveals in a sentence or two that Saddam is very close to being Hitler.<br />You may be shocked, but you will certainly be educated and more ready to defend your faith once you have read these short, scholarly books.

Magic and reality mix in a gray area where the only real truth is love. In what seems to be a situation made for heart break and tragedy, joy comes to pass. Hessy demonstrates a strength that is usually displayed in novels such as Tolkien's, while Rory has the charm of a handsome space alien blended with a fairy prince.

It is only a matter of time until the next attack comes they know.<br />When it does come, the couple is unprepared for the insidious nature of it. Deirdre drinks from one of them, and finds that the blood is poisoned, and though she spits it out, the venom is in her long enough to have an effect. When a catalyst in introduced into her bloodstream, the less obvious poison that she was not able to avoid takes effect. Its intent is not to kill her, but slowly rob her of her memory. In desperation, Mitch and Deirdre reach out to their allies; to Vivienne and Dr. Sam and Lily and Victor. At the same time, they are presented with a mystery, one that may either be a gift or a curse. Two mortals come into their lives, a mother and son. Mitch has a strange attraction to the boy, and when they find out why, the truth is more horrifying and more welcome than they could possibly have dreamed. <br />***** The final secret is not revealed until the last page. It will leave you gnashing your teeth (or fangs) while you wait for the spring of 2004 for the next book. If you just can't wait, go over to Horrorfind Fiction and check out Ms. Taylor's spectacular BLOOD OF THE ROSE. It elevates her to a master horror writer, with skillful language and tone creating a sense of terror more than the actual events. It surpasses the VAMPIRE LEGACY for sensuality, and is far scarier. <br />RESURRECTION is definitely one of the finest vampire books I have ever read. It lacks nothing in continuity and has strong, developing characters who grow and have not stagnated. With each novel, the familiar players reveal new aspects of themselves, and old territory is never rehashed. It is a further note of excellence that the story istold so well in first person.

Though under orders from their Egyptian overlords to kill all newborn males, her mother tries to hide her child, until it is absalutely neccessary to place him an in ark like Noah's, and put him in the Nile. There he is found by Pharoh's daughter - wife, Merytam, the child of Ramses most loved wife, Neferrtitti, and Pharoh's most recent wife. She is barren, and seeks an answer from her gods to hide the condition that would exile her to the harems for the rest of her life. Finding the baby solves her problem, though keeping him alive in the face of coniving, jealous court advisors will not be easy. Perhaps it is only her desperate prayer to the unknown God of the Hebrews that saves her \\"son's\\" life.<br />Moses grows to adulthood, never dreaming that he is one of the \\"mud people\\" that his people have enslaved. Learning the truth triggers an incident that sets off his rage and reveals his secret. Exiled and outcast, Moses flees to the lands far from Egypt, and makes a new life as a shepherd, until he is sent back to Egypt by God, with the mission of freeing his people.<br />Moses is a man without a people, though. He is rejected by Egyptian and Hebrew alike, but he is determined in his quest, and through God's power, he is able to bring his people into the wilderness. As they travel towards the Promised Land, the way is hard, and the people rebellious. On the way, he suffers great loss and many trials. Through them all, his wife and sister watch and support him, despite their resentments and misgivings. <br />**** If you have ever thought a historical novel would be boring, then read this one and change your mind.

Because it speaks to the issue of bullying in a very different way, this is a compelling and entertaining story about life. When the book begins, we learn the story of a very bright but painfully shy young boy whose name is Sydney Schuster. Sidney is constantly taunted during his high school years, and even physically beaten by some of the other students. Not knowing how to handle this situation, he usually ran to a teacher to complain instead of standing up for himself. Of course, this behavior made him an easy target. Sidney was never able to change this situation, and suffered a great deal throughout his high school years. <br />Sidney grew up and became more successful than he would have ever dreamed. Since his own children became bullies during their school years, Sidney often wondered what actually caused a bully/victim relationship. One day Sidney was approached by John Murphy, one of his previous tormentors in high school. John had become a priest, and needed money to save his Catholic school. Sidney decided to make a deal with Father John about a different kind of school. It would be a boarding school for ten inner-city kids, chosen at random, who would act as guinea pigs in an experiment relating to the bully/victim cycle. These were tough kids; but, if they could manage to remain in the school for one year and get along with each other, they would win five million dollars  half a million per student. There were a few simple rules, however, and if even one rule got broken, no one would get a cent!<br />***** I cannot say enough good things about this book. It should be required reading in our schools. The students in this experiment soon learn how hard it is to actually get along with each other and not resort to bullying.

Miss Priscilla Herbert was the grandniece of the Earl of Stanwell. Even though she was gentry, she was also simply a parson's daughter. Her mother, Charlotte, wrote to her sister (quietly, of course) in hope of finding a husband for Priscilla. Sure enough, they are summoned to London by her godmother, Mercy. Priscilla would be thrust into Society. <br />Priscilla was thrilled to be going to London! She hoped that perhaps she might find her heart's desire, a gentleman of worth who could care for her. It was not long before she met Lord Latimer \\"Felix\\", the heir to the Marquess of Silverstone. They met at a small museum where Priscilla was examining a stereopticon (a.k.a. \\"magic lantern\\"). Felix was enchanted from the start. He was looking to wed and believed her to be absolutely perfect! problem was his relatives. His relatives were always showing up in the scandal sheets, embarrassing him. In fact, he had asked for the hand of Miss Anne Bolsolver whose father refused the alliance, deeming his family unfit! <br />Priscilla embarks on the task of reuniting Felix with his estranged family. Also, Anne considers herself above Priscilla and confrontations are inevitable. <br /> This novel is great for light reading. Just romance, with very little danger ever showing. This is a duel, but more danger of scandal than anything else. The character of Anne came across as childish. Priscilla's manners promptly make Anne into an unworthy rival. The enjoyment of this read is mainly the scenes where Priscilla attempts to get the Sutton family closer to each other. Felix is the hard head there. <br />Well written but everything moves along at a slow pace. If you are looking for excitement, pass on this story. If you are looking for a light romance with a realistic story line, this one is for you!	2003-03-06

Robert Symington, Marquess of Elston, MUST choose a bride from a list of twenty names within one year, per a codicil in the will left by his father. He travels and meets each lady listed only to find himself horribly disappointed. That changed when he went to meet Miss Karolina \\"Karla\\" Lane, the daughter of the late Lord Padbury who had been a close friend of his own father. However, instead of meeting Karla, Lady Padbury kept pushing her own daughter, Lydia, at Robert. (Lydia is Karla's half-sister.) <br />Robert soon met \\"Catherine Lindquist\\", the governess, never suspecting that Catherine was really Karla. Since the death of Lord Padbury a few years earlier, Lady Padbury had treated Karla awfully. Lady Padbury's only thought was to make a grand match for Lydia. A lavish coming-out was made for Lydia in London and Lady Padbury's sight was set on Robert. However, Lady Jane Blackburn got into the picture to help Robert and Karla along. <br />***** I believe this book to be worth the whole five stars! Everyone loves tales like that of Cinderella and this one has all the ingredients of one. We have the wicked step-mother who cares only for her own daughter, the prince (or Marquess in this case) who searches for the perfect lady to be his bride, and the heroine, who is treated like dirt since the father died. See? Perfect! <br />Author Susannah Carleton has only written one other Regency that I am aware of. (See \\"A Scandalous Journey: ISBN 0451207122) Yet even after only two stories she has won me over as a fan! I can hardly wait for her next release. Readers, keep your eyes on this author. I have no doubt that the name of Susannah Carleton will become very well known to all readers of Regencies! *****	2003-03-06

This is the third book in a series about young Miranda Stevens and Starlight. Starlight is a two or three year old black stallion that has recently healed from serious leg wounds. Miranda wants nothing more than to own Starlight. It would ensure that the current owner, Mr. Taylor, would not someday part her from the beloved horse. Unfortunately, Starlight is so well recovered that Mr. Taylor is sure the horse can race. He has Adam, his trainer, begin training Starlight. However, Adam is mean to the horse so Starlight keeps bucking him off. Adam believes Miranda is spoiling the horse and keeps taking his anger out, verbally, on her. He refuses to believe Miranda could tell him anything that would aid him in training Starlight. <br />Unknown to most, Miranda had been working with Starlight already. The horse was fully trained and ready to race. But Starlight's heart belonged to young Miranda, who seems to have a natural talent when it comes to handling horses. <br />***** Very little is mentioned about school or classmates in the book this time. The author focuses more on dealing with the problems of racism. Racism is a very sensitive issue in the world today and Janet Muirhead Hill does an excellent job in showing that skin color does not matter. In fact, the author the shows how petty it makes many adults seem. As in the previous book, Adam and Miranda continue to clash. I believe the author is foreshadowing the next book with this situation. <br />The book is perfect for anyone age eight or up who loves horses. It is clearly written out in a way young readers can easily understand and relate to. This is one exceptional series! *****	2003-03-06

Phillip and Cassie are the main focus of the story, but start out feeling as though they have nothing in common. Cassie loves the idea of the castle being haunted. Phillip is too logical and quoted Burke (an author) as saying, \\"Superstition is the religion of feeble minds.\\" <br />***** I love it when two characters are so different yet perfect for each other!

TJ McCloud knew he was in for trouble when the stranger walked into his office. The beauty seemed to know him, but for the life of him, he could not place her. When he finally realized that skinny and irratating Patsy Simonestti had grown up to transform herself into the lovely, but no less irratating Mara Simon, there is no happy reunion. Rather, the two are at loggerheads. He is investigating the skeletal remains found on a stretch of beach that she must cross to film a movie that will hopefully salvage her ex husband's failing movie company. The profits of that film would be enough for her to buy him out and become the owner.<br />However, TJ will not allow fim crews to mess up his dig site's historical integrity, especially not once it turns out that he might have a decades old murder on his hands. A battle royale ensues, exacerbated by the sexual chemistry that burns between TJ and Mara. <br />***** These two could easily join the classic couples such as Scarlett and Rhett or more recently Maddie and Dave for engaging in witty and passionate interplay. Both have grown and developed into new people since first knowing one another, yet they still share the most important thing of all, love. This book will melt the snow and ice if you are snowed in right now. <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-03-04

Her parents arranged for her to marry Lord Whitcliffe. They wanted his title and he wanted their fortune. However, Amelia wanted none of it! Amelia and Whitcliffe found each other to be disgusting. Only minutes before she was to march down the aisle, Amelia leaped out of a church window and into the coach of Jack Kent. <br />Jack Kent was a seafaring Scotsman who was only in town long enough to see his family and then take off again. The damsel in distress put a chink in his plans but he felt honor bound to help her out of her mess. Jack planned to keep his family OUT of it though. He would deal with it himself. Problem was his family was a lot like his servants, most wee thieves and orphans hired right out of prison and put to work. So of course they would stick their fingers into the mix. In addition, Jack was having trouble with his ships. A saboteur was at work and Jack needed to capture him before he lost his business. <br />***** Author Karyn Monk is a master at turning madness, mayhem, and chaos into an exciting story that readers are unable to put down.

Miranda Stevens had been sent to live with her grandparents while her mother searched for work as a model. At school she felt left out and alone. She was the only girl in class who did not own a horse. Miranda was sure that if she only had a horse of her own nothing else would matter. <br />Then a new girl, Laurie Langley, came to the school. While still getting to know each other, they met Christopher Bergman. <br />When Christopher dared Miranda to ride the most beautiful horse she had ever seen, she never hesitated. That dare began a series of adventures for the three friends. <br />***** This new series is PERFECT for both boys and girls, especially if they are fond of horses! The author shows that if you act without thinking the consequences can be dire indeed! <br />The story is very well written, flows smoothly, and is easy to understand.

Well, in a way she is, just not what she thinks. At fifty, she is pregnant and learns that her husband is cheating on her with a friend. What's more, the baby's father is not her husband, just a much younger man she had a fling with several months ago. She is also now jobless, her adult ed class having been eliminated. <br />Before Liddy can find the courage to tell her husband, or anyone in her family what has happened, her lesbian, very old aunt needs her to come and take care of her while she recovers from an illness. On her way back home, Liddy goes into premature labor and winds up having to stay in Cornwall a bit longer. Hope, her new child, is almost two weeks old before anyone in the family other than the aunt finds out about her.<br />Liddy's husband is hurt and leaves her. Her grown children's reactions are varied. For their own reasons, each wants to adopt Hope. One daughter sees the baby as a way to save her flagging relationship with her male roommate. The gay son finds her the ideal solution to his and his partner's desire for a baby. The last daughter feels obligated to adopt Hope, as she is the only one with a stable home and family. While all these generous offers are touching, perhaps, Liddy feels quite capable of taking care of her daughter herself. That remains to be seen. <br />***** Unlike most British imports, this novel does not confuse the American reader with unfamiliar terms. Liddy's situation is a unique one, and so is her family. With guts and determination, she handles a life where if it's not one thing, it's three, with grace and aplomb. Humor and tears will be replete in this too unreal not to be real book. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-03-04

As survivalists we know that we may not always have access to a sanitary emergency room and a half-asleep doctor in the middle of the night. If that time comes, this is the book to have! This book teaches advanced field procedures for small wound repair, pain control, care of infected wounds, IV therapy, amputations, treatment of burns, airway procedures and much much more. <br />This book is writen in straightforward language for those who don't know an artery from a anuerism, and step-by-step proceedures are discussed in great detail. Pictures of suturing, debriding wounds and many other items show you what a thousand words cannot describe. So many techniques and how-to's are discussed that there is not room here to elaborate on all of them. Let's just say this book is pretty complete. Pair it with a few other reference manuals and you greatly increase your chances of saving a loved one's life in a disaster situation! <br />The Down Side: None, well thought out with lots of diagrams and procedure pictures <br />Would WE Buy It?: Oh Yes!

His uptown girlfriend, Rebecca, wanted to stop working, get married, buy a large home, and have children. Her parents keep sticking their rich noses into the situation also. Of course, this made the situation worse, especially when her daddy gets Clay a high paying job (thinking Clay would never be able to get a better one on his own) and expected Clay to snatch it up. But Clay refused to be beholden to her family or under their thumb, even if it meant losing Rebecca. <br />Things changed when Max Pace entered the picture. Max became Clay's source to getting several cases against pharmaceutical companies. Clay's settlements would change his life. Then he stumbled upon a conspiracy too horrible to believe! <br />**** While reading this book I kept being reminded of John Grisham's last novel. I now believe it was foreshadowing this book. There is nothing shocking to the reader here or any unexpected twists. Any reader with a lick of sense will easily be able to predict what is going to happen in the main character's near and distant future. However, the story is still pure joy to read and written in a way that only John Grisham can do. Recommended reading! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-03-04

He soon realized Gillie was his destiny, his soulmate. He knew Gillie kept many secrets, by omissions, from everyone and that miracles often happened whenever she was around, but he was positive she would reveal all sooner or later. <br />Gillie kept her true identity and Raheiran abilities a close secret.

Via telepathy, one of several abilities she has, Gillie and Simon communicate. As you can see, most of this novel is Sci-Fi. However, the author makes the story more intriguing by adding several touches of Fantasy elements such as a mageline sorceress and a touch of spacestation romance.

Struggling new Christian Will Chambers finds his faith tested in this second installment of the series. The state is after a young mother for allegedly poisoning her child. Fearing that she will lose the child and that the boy will die as the result of an undiagnosed condition, she flees, leaving her husband to face the consequences. Will reluctantly takes her case, having to fight all the way to save this family, and a baby's life. Not only is he spiritually challenged, but faces beatings and prison to do what is right. <br />Will's personal life is also in a muddle. His new love, Fiona's, career separates them often, and though he wants to marry her, the timing is just never right. Along for the ride are the other characters you met and loved in the last book; Jacki, his secretary, and even Tiny. <br />***** Christians who want a legal thriller on the order of Turrow or Grisham, but without sordid details, will find their answer here. Will Chambers is an excellent hero, one easily identified with as he struggles along in his journey. He is flawed and questioning, much like most readers, and will be someone with whom even non Christians can find a common chord. In fact, seeing his struggle to faith might win a few converts. <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-03-03

WWII is raging through Europe, impacting the lives of young and old in major and minor ways. Four women in a small English village are chosen by the author to give modern readers a sketch of that time.<br />As the men march off to war, plans are made and broken. Women are forced into unexpected roles that they are reluctant to give up to become quiet, demure little things again when the war ends. Husbands and lovers go away, some never to return. Hearts are broken, rations are tight, and sometimes, the enemy has un unexpectedly human face. Yet through it all, the chestnut tree planted by the local tomboy endures and thrives. Sometimes it is the one thing that means life and hope amidst the chaos.<br />*** American readers, particularly the younger set, will undoubtedly find this a difficult, sometimes bland read. It focuses on the ordinary things of life greatly. Even the extraordinary times will be hard to hold the interest of a younger American woman. However, the author does do an extremely good job of painting a highly realistic portrait of people and times. *** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore	2003-03-02

A former atheist, Mr. Strobel presents convincing evidence in these two closely related, even complementary volumes to prove that Jesus Christ is who He claimed to be, the Son of God and Messiah, and that as a result, Christianity is the most logical religion. Using skills he acquired as a reporter in a metropolis, the author details the investigation he pursued. <br />He did not go to just preachers, or to any kindly old grandparents who have dedicated their lives to being at the church all day on Sunday. He used scientists, theologians, and even psychiatrists to make his cases. Drawing upon little known historical facts, archeology, psychology, and sometimes even gruesome medical evidence, each aspect is presented in a concise, easy to follow, yet intense fashion. Inconsistencies in the Bible are taken apart piece by piece and shown to not be inconsistent at all. Translation, perspective, and factors of history and culture the modern reader would be unfamiliar with are explained. <br />**** However, there are some facts that are not completely accurate; being stated too broadly, and some of the logic used does not ring completely true. Despite this, the sum total of these two books is sound, and whether read or listened to will provide the skeptic with enough proof to change his or her mind, and the believer to have their faith reinforced. At worst, each book is fascinating. At best, it will lead others to the faith. <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-03-02

Sommerset, her personal nemesis, is taking a vacation, and she is looking forward to twenty one joyful days without the stuck up butler making her life miserable. All this comes crashing down when he trips over her cat and breaks his leg, followed closely by a call from news reporter friend, Nadine, with a murder report. <br />Eve shortly finds herself embroiled in a new case, where some sick individual is killing the beautiful and the innocent, after artistically posing them and making photos, so as to capture their souls and absorb them into himself. To make the whole situation worse, she lacks her faithful husband, Roarke's assistance, since he is on a personal quest to learn the truth about his mother. Not only does this mean he won't be able to help her solve the case, but it leaves her alone to deal with Sommerset, who is even worse to handle when he is bedridden and forced to cope with a too chirpy and cheerful physical assistant. The case takes on an even grimer turn when a friend is the killer's latest target. Eve must race against time, or lose someone she cares about.<br />***** Enjoyable as ever, this book is perhaps the best yet in this thrilling series. Eve is sharp as ever, her tough mien a thin disguise for the soft heart she hides. However, Roarke takes on an even greater depth, showing readers facets of himself beyond the sexy rouge gazillionaire we have grown to love. The plot and futuristic world as well crafted as ever, and revisiting the old friends we have made over the course of previous books is also a joy. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-03-01

Ellen Jameson's eternal optimism is severely challenged lately. Five years after her husband's early death to cancer, she has had to sell their home and move in with her mother, Wilma, her own daughter, Amber, and granddaughter, Jet, in tow. Whilel Jet is a charmer, Amber has a chronically bad attitude and is struggling between independence and neediness. Wilma believes in serial monogamy and may be turned out of her home before too long. Her last husband did not change his will before his death, and now his children want the house Wilma is entitled to. <br />Ellen does manage to find a job, and her mother thinks that marrying the boss would solve all her daughter's problems. However, when Wilma goes to play matchmaker, she finds the boss more attractive to herself than to Ellen. <br />Amber is dealing with problems at work, wanting to move out and abandon her child, and a sudden reappearance of an old friend who could very well turn out to be more than an old friend. She also has to deal with the prejuidices she herself harbors about her mixed race child and the ones she imagines are against them. <br />***** Of course, all of that is only the tip of the iceberg. There are a few assorted other problems, health crises, and the kitchen sink to face before the last page is turned. Ms. Morsi has long been a talented writer, but with her debut in contemporary women's fiction, she has truly come into her own. You will laugh through the tears reading this book. Wilma is a hoot, plain and simple. I wish she was young enough to star in a continuing series. Anyone who has faced a life full of changes and challeges will sympathize so much with Ellen that at times the novel will hit too close to home. Yet, in her triumph over the odds, you will find affirmation and hope. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-03-01

The team captain, Ty Gallagher makes it no easier when he butts heads with her at every opportunity. He refuses to sign up for charity publicity ops, and just downright gets under her skin. When he does appear at a charity function, it is with a bimbo, who happens to be Janna's baby sister. <br />After this encounter, the two find that they value each other's opinion of them even more than they want to admit, and suddenly, the bridge between them is crossed. The inevitable happens, but that does not make life easier between them. It gets even worse when Janna's best friend is nearly raped by a teammate. Sides have to be drawn and chosen, and major life decisions have to be confronted. Love falls off the priority list. Or does it?<br />***** When I told my best friend that there was a hockey romance coming out I wanted to review for her sake, her first response was \\"How can you have a hockey romance?\\" Maybe it was a challenge to write, but whatever, it was well done. The characters are all engaging, and the romance and humor make every page well worthwhile. However, don't make the mistake of thinking it's a lightweight humorous read; the laughter is well balanced by a serious story line and true to life characters. The only thing missing would be a wedding on ice. Ty alone is enough to convince even a non sports lover to go to a hockey game!

The first small part of the book is dedicated to recapping the first story in this series. Therefore, if you have not read the first book, you will still understand all that is happening. Yet I strongly recommend reading the first story since it will only enhance the pleasure. You would understand things more and feel like an \\"insider\\". <br />The second book is as good as the first, if not just a bit more so. The story is clearly expressed in a way that even those around age ten will easily understand what is happening. Recommended to all ages! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2003-02-23

Raisers) do not know it, but there is a new intelligence on the planet that intends to wipe out the humans and become the new rulers! <br />This new intelligence has all the Fl-eyes (flies) on its side. The Fl-eyes have \\"made\\" a dimension called the W-D, which is controlled by a computer. The dimension was made to use matter and rearrange it into anything they wanted. The main part of the plan was to build a one-hundred thousand bug army out of matter. However, the W-D did not supply the matter, it only gave tools to work on it. <br />Another rule of the W-D is that only living matter could be used to create new living beings. Non-living matter could only be used to create non-living items. Therefore, the Fl-eyes had to get a fresh supply of living matter. <br />Aquarius is a handsome Indian Blue Peacock. He lives at the SunSet Hills farm. Andrew, his \\"Raiser\\", fed and watered all of them twice a day. Andrew helped his new peachick hatch from its shell. The peachick was even granted a name, Mocha. This is a special thing! Not all the animals on the farm received names! <br />The animals of SunSet Hills were afraid of the Raisers. The peachicks before Mocha had gotten weak and disappeared. All believed the Raisers were killing them. No one could ask the Raisers if it was true though, because humans could only hear in three dimensions, instead of four. When animals spoke, humans only heard garbled sounds instead of words. <br />Everything remained in confused chaos until Mr. Gleam, a beetle from an underground laboratory approached Aquarius. <br />**** Aquarius is the main character followed in this novel. The author, A. A. Browne, writes what he knows about. In this case, breeding and raising different types of peacocks. Apparently the author has a vivid imagination as well. Like the classic novel \\"Animal Farm\\", the animals can speak and have their own world. Yet A. A. Browne has gone a step further by giving the animals labs and high tech gadgetsthat surpass the humans. <br />This is the first of what is shaping up to be a GREAT series for anyone age ten or above. I loved every minute of it. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2003-02-23

She is an Emergency Department nurse at Blymore Memorial Hospital, a medic on a SWAT team, and the daughter of the somewhat notorious police officer named Thomas \\"Tommy\\" O'Brien. <br />When she finds evidence that someone close to her, perhaps a team member or co-worker, could be dispensing their own type of justice, she is torn between loyalty and what is right. It seemed as though the bad scum of St. Louis that come to the ER ends up dead. It also looks as though it has been going on for quite some time. Maggie knew that if she looked for signs of possible murder of the bad guys that many of her co-workers would consider it betrayal. She would lose many friends. However, when Maggie found out some innocent people were also dying, she could not stand by and do nothing. As people in the county and her colleagues turn against Maggie, she continues her search for proof of multiple murders. As people get nervous about her investigation, Maggie begins being framed. <br />Reporter Susan Jacobsmeyer has been assigned to do an article or series on Maggie's life. Her career skyrocketed with a single photo shot of Maggie, as a SWAT member, clutching a burned boy as she tries to save his life. When patients that Maggie tend to begin dropping like flies, or cicadas, she smells front page material. The two team up to hunt for answers. Their only real clues had come from a paranoid schizophrenic patient, Montana Bob, just before he died. <br />*** This author is awesome! Author Eileen Dreyer is a nurse herself. To make this novel as realistic as possible, she actually trained (not just observed) with some of the SWAT teams and firefighters in her area. <br />I just do not find books as great as this one often and I cannot recommend it highly enough! You do not have to be in the police or medical professions to find yourself holding your breath and sitting on the edge of your seat as you quickly read to see what happens next! WITH A VENGEANCE is a roller coaster ride that hooks its readers on page one and refuses to let go! *** <br />REVIEWED BY DETRA FITCH.	2003-02-22

Mystery writer Taylor O'Toole had already hit the Best Seller list several times, thanks to her zany characters. The deadline for the next in her series was near, however, it would have to wait. Taylor had promised a girlfriend that she would do a bit of surveillance work for her. It should have been simple. Instead, it landed Taylor into the path of a stalker. Yet whenever things turned bad her sexy new neighbor always seemed to be close by to save the day. <br />Navy SEAL Jack Broussard had a top secret assignment: Protect Taylor O'Toole! Jack was used to hand-to-hand combat, covert missions, and doing whatever it took to get his mission done. Babysitting a mystery writer was NOT suppose to be something that required the deadly talents of a SEAL. But Taylor could be the key link in the government search for a missing Navy scientist. So like it or not, his orders were to keep her safe - at all costs! WOO - HOO! Action, romance, and more action await readers in this novel! There are a few cameos from Annie and Sam McKade. Annie is Taylor's sister, if you recall, from the book \\"MY SPY\\". Izzy Teague, the electronic genius, is back as well and has major parts in the story. Word has it that Izzy will get his own story written in the future. Meanwhile, author Christina Skye lets us learn more about this mysterious man. <br />Jack and Taylor are well matched. Both are stubborn and tenacious to a fault. Their story is nonstop adventure from page one (ROCK CLIMBING) to the last. Highly recommended reading here. If the cover says \\"Christina Skye\\", just BUY IT. You will never be disappointed!  ...	2003-02-12

Achilles, if you recall from the previous books, was a genius. Mentally, however, he was very unstable. He wanted nothing more than the deaths of Peter, Bean, and Petra. Second on Achilles's list of things-to-do was to conquer all, starting with the Hegemony! <br />Suriyawong, Virlomi, Hyrum Graff, and Volescu appear as secondary characters. They were not just for show or used as \\"fillers\\" though. Each had vital roles in the book and possibly in the next. (My hope springs eternal.) <br />***** If you have not read the previous books, I highly recommend that you begin at the beginning, with ENDER'S GAME. Not only because all in this series is fantastic, but also because you when previous characters or events are mentioned, you would totally understand the reference and feel more a part of Card's vast universe. This author does not insult the intelligence of his readers; therefore, he will not go into deep detail on past events. He just mentions a person or event and carries on with the current story. I love that in an author! <br />Orson Scott Card made a fan of me with ENDER'S GAME. Of course, since I enjoyed it so much, I handed it over to my husband and the \\"Ender's Bug\\" (as I call it) bit him too. Card quickly made his way from my list of \\"Good Authors\\", to my list of \\"Favorite Authors\\", and currently resides on my \\"Elite List\\" which contains only four names (and one of them are deceased). I tell you that so you may understand that I do NOT consider myself to be overly dramatic when I say, \\"If you love Sci-Fi, you MUST read this series!\\" <br />Orson Scott Card rules the Sci-Fi universe! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-02-10

Will Chambers is a down - trodden, alcholic attorney whose life has been in a downward spiral since even before his estranged, yet beloved wife's murder. Now, he finds himself kicked out of his firm, abandoned by his friends and associates, and with two clients left; a deadbeat and a pastor with a case that is, kindly stated, strange.<br />Reverend MacCameron is the defendant in a defamation case, having published an article attacking a recent archaelogical discovery that, if true, would render Christianity a sham. It is Will's job to not only save his client's reputation, but also to defend the truth of Christ's rising from the dead. Since Will is an agnostic, this will be a challenge. Will finds that he is facing the powers of darkness, and that those forces are reaching out to destroy him as well as his clients. At the same time, the world itself teeters on extinction as terrorists mobilize weapons of mass destruction.<br />*... In a novel that reaches out to fans of Grisham, the LEFT BEHIND series, and Indianna Jones, Mr. Parshall begins what looks to be a groundbreaking and promising series. Will is a hero that will be easily sympathized with by the legions of less than perfect readers who might be tired of \\"perfect\\" heroes and heroines. The action is absorbing, whether legal or historical, and the reader will come away with renewed faith and also with a greater knowledge than he or she had before the book. *... <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-02-10

It manages to teach many positive lessons and be highly entertaining at the same time. Who could ask for more than that? The Adventures of Joey Panda is all about Joey Panda and his sister Penny who embark on a great adventure in hopes of finding their destiny. Their journey is filled with challenges that they must overcome and friendships that they form. As I mentioned before, Joey and Penny crave excitement and want to find their destiny. They accomplish both these things while trying to help save Panda Valley. Wow, talk about formidable tasks, whoops, I mean challenges! Children will find themselves enthralled by each provocation that this enterprising troop encounters, not to mention the many creatures, like the zombies, wild monkeys, sand serpents and such, who have to be dealt with. Joey and Penny will meet new friends who join their quest along the way too, such as the red monkey named Reggie. There are also other living things that help them - river dragons just to name one. Then there is Kira, a courageous young forest fairy. Kira will also become their friend and will captivate your child. At the end of their journey, Joey and Penny discover the true meaning of friendship and what being a hero really means. They also learn that saving someone from danger is one thing, but it doesn't necessarily make you a hero. Being a hero is so much more than that. Just what is this elusive something that truly makes a hero? Joey learns this secret, and so will your child. After all, every child has a hero inside. It's just waiting to be discovered. <br />***** There are many books on the market about simple acts of kindness, but none more expressive than this one. It is well written, fun to read, and imparts very important messages about friendship, working together toward a common end, and (above all) never giving up. ***** <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson.	2003-02-10

The longing for each other has never faded though, and now they both will face a critical moment where their relartionship to one another and to God will have to be resolved.<br />Beth's husband died in an auto racing accident, leaving her son fatherless and troubled. The man responsible, or who rather felt responsible, has returned home, and represents her son's best shot at having the help he needs. What lies between them is another thing.<br />Finally, Annie find that she has to face the man who abused her and almost caused her to lose her child. Joe Murphy claims to have reformed, but has he? Does he stand a chance with his fragmented family or not?<br />*** Although each story would have been better served in its own book, each one of them is a moving tale of friendship, the truest form of love. Linc and Margo's story particularly will appeal to fans of Father Greeley, where God is the most interesting character, and the one with the best sense of humor. *** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-02-10

Yet, each has their own hidden purpose that might keep them from finding happiness together.<br />***** Ann Lawrence has created an outstandingly accurate novel of the Medieval world, where church and state often clashed, as is seen here. With all the gallantry of an epic saga, this story will enthrall readers, as Joan is a Maid Marion type heroine who will not take a backseat to the gallant hero, but is quite capable of saving her own life. These two stand out strongly as honorable and true in contrast to the shallow and back biting characters around them. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-02-10

Feeling responsible for her injury, Jian brings her into his home while Val heals, and agrees to let her catalog the collection, even though he has no intention of allowing her museum to display them. <br />Val finds that she is in the middle of an Asian mafia war, as Jian's crime lord father attempts to bring his wayward son back into the fold. Danger fairly crackles in the air, as does sensuality. From the first moment she laid eyes on him, Val began to fall in love with her quarry, and although he denies feeling more than desire for an attractive woman, the feeling is mutual. Yet, the past is something that stands between them and happiness, and if they survive the current crisis, Val and Jian will have to overcome their haunted and broken hearts. <br />*** Sizzling and very different, this novel paints a world seldom seen. Mixing the exotic Orient with the sensual beauty of France and the spice of a Southern lady, this is only the first in an exciting trilogy. Jian is a hero unlike any seen before with his unique heritage, while Val is a favorite heroine, tough, yet tender.

Dead bodies have begun turning up, and Jessica is the thread that connects them all, and she is the one person with the most obvious motive for wanting these men dead. Being drawn to the prime suspect is something Steve Paxton had never counted on, especially not when his heart still bears scars from a messy divorce. <br />Jessica might be the prime suspect, but the real killer wants her dead as well. As the two delve into the past, though, they begin to wonder if there might be a future for them. They have to survive first however.<br />***** Taughtly drawn and highly emotional, this novel is on a par with Sandra Brown's earliest and best work, and surpasses that of the current queens of military fiction. Both hero and heroine are all that you could want in a starring couple, equal in toughness, and also in vulnerability. Jessica and Steve work so well together that you wish that they might become the central couple in a series, ala Eve and Roarke. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-02-04

She became terrified when she learned Theo was en route to pick her up and take her home. Eli was determined to find out why. <br />**** That is the main plot. The author, Colleen Easton (a.k.a. Colleen Thompson) keeps the attention of the readers by slowly revealing the horrors of the Seminole attack on that fateful night so long ago. In addition, secondary characters seem to have lives all their own! A few extra plots roll in the background making the suspense build to an even higher pitch. <br />A seductive story that I highly recommend.

Thanks to the Kaiser's men, Billy returned crippled. Unable to work and confined to his wheelchair, it was up to Daisy to provide. She had a talent of conducting seances. Oh, Daisy knew none of it was real, but the rich families seemed to have a need for comforting, regardless of how ridiculous the source of comfort came from. Now everyone knew fortune-telling was illegal, but Daisy NEVER told fortunes, just the opposite! (One could say that Daisy had been getting ready for this job since she was ten years old.) <br />Mrs. Kincaid was Daisy's best customer. When she called Daisy the day after a seance, she was hysterical. Daisy learned that the spoiled daughter had been arrested while attending a speakeasy. Daisy HAD to go comfort Mrs. Kincaid. After all, that was part of her job. However, it only marked the beginning. <br />Mr. Kincaid ran the bank in which several thousand dollars worth of bearer bonds had recently disappeared. Detective Rotondo was the one who was investigating the bank problem. His main suspect was the chief cashier, Mr. Farrington. <br />**** That is the main plot in the mystery. The author made the illusion of the 1920's more realistic by adding touches (such as Model T cars, turn-cranks to start cars, party phone lines, news of women recently getting the right to vote, etc) and mentioned them only casually, as if they were normal in modern everyday life today. There is not really any romance for the main character, Daisy. She is happily married to Billy, so I do not understand why Zebra Publishing lists this novel as Historical Romance. Rather, it is a mystery set in the 1920 era. Daisy is a real pistol! She speaks her mind and is VERY intelligent, much to Rotondo's dismay. <br />A true delight for mystery fans! Recommended! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-02-02

Few women are prison guards in a male prison, but that is the best career choice open to Gabrielle Hadley when she moves to Florence, Arizona in search of her birth mother. Daily she faces grueling work, where she is harrassed and scorned by both inmates and coworkers. Amidst the ugliness, she finds herself drawn to one of the prisoners, one who stands out as unusual, Randall Tucker, convicted wife killer. <br />Tucker is serving time for a crime of which he is innocent, so when he has the chance to escape during a transfer, he does. Gabrielle goes after him, out of a mixture of concern and a feeling of responsibility. Yet, when she finds him, they become reluctant allies, drawn together by the necessity of survival, and the heat between them that is hotter than the surrounding desert. Even when Tucker ties her up and abandons her, Gabrielle still believes in him, and is willing to risk everything to save him so his quest to prove his innocence and be reunited with his child will go forward. <br />***** A vivid painting of an ugly world provides an intense backdrop for this compelling story. Few women would have the grit to handle what Gabrielle faces. Tucker is the kind of man we all yearn for; tough, yet still loving. Both do what they must without flinching. Despite the harshness portrayed in the prison and in the wild, there are heartwarming moments of family that lighten the mood.

She does find allies in the form of the O'Neills, Lacey, a troubled artist with a promiscuity problem, and her brother, widower Clay, who is lost in grief for his late wife. Lacey takes Gina into their home, hoping against all odds that she will be the one to light up her brother's darkened soul. <br />Gina's quest to raise the beacon involves not only locating it, but delving into the secrets of the small town's past, that tie in with her own heritage. Long buried truths are to be painfully revealed, and the true nature of her desperate search will bring about pain and healing both. It is a race against time, for a child's life is hanging in the balance. <br />**** Interspersed with the main plot in the present is the diary of a young woman who lived and loved over half a century ago. To some, these entries will be tender and insightful, adding richness and color to the already moving story. Others will find them distracting and hard to integrate into the main story. In either case, the primary characters are ones to agonize with and whose hurt screams across the pages, so vividly are they drawn.

He went to the island, visited Hannah, and listened to her tale about a disguised intruder who entered her room during the night to spray some sort of mist and wore a gas mask.

The \\"job\\" is as a mediator, someone who helps departed souls find their place. Her boyfriend, Jesse, is a ghost, and the new guy almost got both of them trapped in another universe over the summer. Not only that, but he is currently running for her job as student vice president, and there is a newly displaced ghost lurking around in need of her help. This ghost might also have deadly plans for a living person, and Susie is finding that she needs none other than her nemesis, Paul's, help in making sure everything works out all right. To further her problems, she is attracted to Paul, and feels disloyal to Jessie as a result.<br />***** Teen age life can be nasty business, and Ms. Cabot is wonderful at expressing this in a humorous, yet touching way. The romantic triangle forming here is fascinating, if less erotic, than two other triangles that have captivated older readers, the Stephanie - Ranger - Joe or Anita - Jean Claude - Richard, ones. Mothers can enjoy this book almost as much as their teen and slightly preteen daughters, and are encouraged to do so. Although I might have enjoyed it more had I read the other books in the series, I had no trouble picking up on the action. *****<br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-01-26

When the men learned that the females from Terra could be impregnated by their race, they created Retrieval Units to abduct them. <br />Of all the warriors in the Empire, the ones known as Reapers were most feared. They were the elite, feared by men and women alike. Trained from birth to hunt and kill, then altered at the age of ten for other special talents, Reapers knew no fear and no love. Prime Reaper Captain Kamerone Cree was the best of them all. The Fleet called him \\"the Iceman\\". <br />The Resistance had noticed Cree's looks toward Dr. Bridget Dunne. With careful planning the Resistance had Cree taken to Behavioral Modification (Be-Mod 9) for \\"punishment\\". Unknown to the Empire, the doctors of Be-Mod 9 were really re-programming the Prime Reaper. <br />That was easier said than done, for Reapers were what Terra called Vampires. A bloodbeast lived within each Reaper. They were usually merciless warriors with a high pain tolerance, but whenever one entered into Transition the beast took over. The Resistance chose Bridget as his mate. Cree and Bridget would be used to change the Empire, whether they liked it or not! <br />***** A lot of torture takes place within this book.

They appear in this exciting sequel to John Passarella's first novel, \\"Wither\\". The story mainly targets Wendy and Gina though. <br />Be forewarned of dark magic and hard sexual scenes, but that is expected in any book that I could ever consider as a \\"true\\" horror novel involving the dark arts. The story clearly showed that Passarella did a lot of deep research in his Wicca topic. The casual referrals to subjects, such as making the circle, and steps detailing rituals, make the story even more realistic. <br />John Passarella is a powerful voice in the horror genre of today.

She agreed in exchange for him painting the portrait of her royal self. She never told Nic that Anna would have to die and be reborn. <br />After twenty-five years, Nic believed he had found his Anna. Her name was now Dianna Fielding and she was a famous pop singer. She was almost identical to her former self. He claimed a position as gardener on the estate Dianna and her sister, Stacy, lived. Dianna was his reincarnated love, he was positive, but Stacy was the one that drew him like a moth to a flame. To make things difficult, Dianna was engaged to someone else. Luring her away would be difficult, even with Stacy's help. Worse yet, Titania hung around causing mischief. Nic had to say \\"I love you\\" to the real Anna, or become Titania's slave ... forever! <br />***** If possible, this second romp in the magical Faery realm is even better than the first! The reader knows immediately who the real Anna is, but also understands how Nic can believe it is Dianna. The author added chaos by throwing mischievous Pixies into the mix.

But she sure had to tap deeply into a bottomless well of optimism to get through all this! Zoe was a strong willed character that needed an extra ordinary man in her life.

Although this anthology is meant as a Halloween book, it is delightful enough to be enjoyed in any time or season. Leading off with HAUNTED HONEYMOON, Linda Devlin treats readers to the tale of an arranged marriage that is beginning a bit shakily. Though the couple has known each other all their lives, neither is sure of the other's love, and their first home is reportedly, and actually haunted. Only by facing their own fears about the ghost and each other will this hapless couple find the joy they are meant to share. Next, Sandy Moffett does no less than the title and bewitches readers with BEWITCHING, the story of a witch whose powers are out of control until she finds love. Fans of Sabrina will find this one to bring a familiar smile as they read the light hearted novella. Finally, the best comes last when CITIZEN DAISY by Deb Stover rounds out the anthology. You will never look at an MRI test in the same way after reading how a Congressman finds himself waking up from an MRI tube a century in the past, accused of being a spaceman by superstitous townsfolk, and falling in love with an young lady believed falsely to be a witch.

However, just at Christmas, in the season of miracles, she gets one, remission from her disease. Determined to spread the joy, she uses all she has saved to buy a cynical, homeless man a pair of red mittens, hopefully replicating the ones he lost, and with their loss, lost hope and faith.

Lady Jacinda Knight is too headstrong and willful to blindly obey her brother and assent to an unwanted arranged marriage. On the run from her life, she is waylaid by a purse snatcher, but as previously noted, she is an uncommon miss, and rather than having vapors, pursues the thief. This leads her to encounter dashing Billy Blade, notorious robber, and have a kiss stolen in addition to her purse. She is then returned to her brother. <br />Someone else makes a return to society shortly thereafter. Billy Blade is \\"put to death\\" to be replaced by his true identity, the Earl of Rackford. As a proper gentleman, he is able to court Lady Jacinda, but even though she sees him for who he really is, the thief who stole her heart, the path ahead of them is not so simple.<br />***** Sparkling wit and high adventure mark this unique tale. In another lifetime, Jacinda and Billy might be Marion and Robin, though they would be cast by people from different eras. Jacinda is more like the Marion of the recent Robin of Sherwood series on BBC television, while Billy would well be played by Errol Flyn, a wickedly good hero. Though the fourth in a series, you will not be lost if this is where you begin. You will also be treated to a few rare historical insights, as this is based upon a true story. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2003-01-08

Began in 1813, Weymouth.<br />Miss Winifred Smith was known as Freddie to her mother (Louisa) and her friends. Nothing spectacular ever happened to her before. Freddie and her mother ran a lodging house. It had an advantage since it was close to the royal residence and the Esplanade.<br />Cassian Stratford, Marquess of Lansdale, spied Winifred at the quay and became fascinated by her actions. Thus, he followed her for awhile. Though she ware fashion from a year before, he believed her to be a lady of quality who was trying to disguise herself for some reason. Upon learning this, Freddie did not attempt to change his idea of her. In fact, she did her best to embellish the opinion.<br />Heiress Lavinia Thorogood was Freddie's new close friend. She was smitten by a young poet named Andrew Beaumont. Freddie believed the man to be a fortune hunter, as did Lavinia's father, who wished to match Lavinia to another. However, Freddie could not make Lavinia see this.<br />Then there was Lady Heathcote, described as a false friend and rival of Lavinia's mother. Freddie, for the second time, was mistaken for someone (or something) else. This time as Miss Frederica Durham. Lavinia began to use the mix-up to prove (to her father) that his choice for her was not worthy of her hand.<br />**** There is much more going on that I state, as I am sure you could tell. Author Sandra Heath never writes shallow Regency novels, so it is usually impossible for me to give a good synopsis unless I turned it into an essay. I hope I managed to at least familiarize you with the main characters.<br />If you are looking for a simple romance with no mystery or sub-plots, look elsewhere. This novel targets readers who wish for more in their romances. ****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-01-06

Valentine \\"Val\\" Wharton had once been a drunken rogue. His love, Penny, had married his best friend many years ago. He had tried to commit suicide (but Cupid shot him in the leg to stop him) and he almost killed his daughter, Felicity. Everyone had heard of him. Rumors had spread, as they often do. <br />Valentine was ready to assume his responsibilities! He picked up his now ten-year-old daughter and was going to Wales, to St. David's. Needing a governess for Felicity, he hired Miss Elaine Deering, who reminded him much of Penny. <br />Elaine did not really want to accept the position with Wharton. However, Lord Palmer, who had been her previous employer, had tried to take liberties with her and she ended up leaving the position. Lord Palmer chose that moment to travel to Gatehouse only for revenge. He intended to ruin her reputation and have her tossed into the streets. He would have succeeded if not for Wharton. Even hearing Palmer's claims, his offer of employment remained. Elaine accepted. <br />Together they would learn about out another, visit Penny and (in a way) the past, and take a giant \\"leap of faith\\"! <br />** This one is a bit too slow, for my personal Regency taste. I kept getting the impression of the two main characters circling each other warily, though neither really had any reason to. <br />I do not consider this story to be even half as good when compared to the other novels I have read from this same author. If this is the first time you have read a book by Elisabeth Fairchild and feel about it as I do, please do not write this author off. Purchase one of her earlier titles and give her another shot. Because Elisabeth Fairchild IS a very talented woman in the Regency Romance field. This story though, in my own opinion, just could not capture the attentions of readers. ** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-01-06

When the king rewards Bishop with Merryn of Penwyth as his bride, the gift is a perilous one. At the age of 18, Merryn is already four times a widow, thanks to the curse that Druids have placed upon her. No man may take her or Penwyth castle by force. If he does so, he will die, and so far, that has been true. Bishop is however, a cunning man, and plots to win his bride's heart, and then claim what is his and live. He kidnaps her, and on the journey away, becomes haunted by strange dreams of someplace else. In this other world, a man seeks an elusive magical woman as his lover and wife. As the story unfolds, the two tales intertwine, and the key to one is the answer to the other as well. <br />*** This overlapping story, well crafted by past masters, such as Cynthia Freeman, is more than slightly confusing here. Although Merryn is the standard Coulter heroine, full of fire and strength, and Biship is a dark, mysterious hero, the plotline is extremely difficult to follow, diminshing the enjoyment of otherwise interesting personalities. *** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-12-31

During the Cold War, both the Soviet Union and the U.S. rushed to build biological weapons programs. In 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention banned the development of bioweapons, supposedly ending the threat. But the threat was only beginning. <br />Plague Wars tells the stories of the secret battles that are still being waged in many nations, stories filled with international espionage, deceptions, and treachery. Recently, defectors and covert sources from third-world governments such as Iraq have revealed active biological weapons programs, despite international arms inspectors' attempts to eradicate them. A U.S. war game to prepare for a North Korean biological attack went so horribly wrong that the results are still classified. In South Africa, the use of bioweapons represents one of the last untold secrets of the apartheid battles, while in Zimbabwe, people are still dying of anthrax from the dirty wars of independence fought two decades ago. Fringe cults, apocalyptic madmen, and terrorists groups everywhere claim to own bioweapons, and are threatening to use them. Major Western cities are busily planning defenses against such an attack. ...<br />Researched across four continents with exceptional access to many sources from the United Nations, U.S. Department of Defense, and various civilian and military intelligence agencies, and using previously classified government documents, Tom Mangold and Jeff Goldberg have written the definitive account of the state of biological warfare in the world today. Never before has the complete scope of these terrifying weapons been so thoroughly examined. <br />A startling look into hidden facets of history, dark secrets of the present, and the anticipated horrors of a none-too-distant future, Plague Wars will make you reconsider your safety in a world where death is just a breath away.	2002-12-27

You Won't sleep until this book is done, and maybe not then! Another True and chilling book by Preston! Never mind Ebola, the hemorrhagic disease that was the main subject of Preston's 1994 #1 bestseller, The Hot Zone. What we really should be worrying about, explains Preston in this terrifying, cautionary new title, is smallpox, or variola. ...and today the variola virus only exists officially in two storage depots.. one in Russia, and the other at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta (in the freezer of the title). <br />To believe that variola is not held elsewhere, however, is nonsense, Says Preston, who delves into the probability that several nations, including Iraq, Iran, Russia and maybe Al-Qaeda, have recently worked, or are currently working, with genetically altered smallpox as a biological weapon! <br />Preston shows why even \\"normal\\" smallpox could (and would) sweep the globe in a matter of weeks killing millions, perhaps hundreds of millions! No one on the planet today has an immunity to this disease. <br /> A chilling account of what countries have what Bio-weapons, and what happens if they use them. The research is excellent and accurate. Preston takes you through the recent Anthrax attacks, why they were \\"different\\" and what happens if a terrorist unleashes an easily genetically modified Smallpox weapon.	2002-12-27

The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World--Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran It! <br />In this fast-paced memoir, Ken Alibek combines cutting-edge science with the narrative techniques of a thriller to describe some of the most awful weapons imaginable. The result will remind readers of The Hot Zone, Richard Preston's smart bestseller about the Ebola virus. That book focuses on the dangers of a freak accident; Biohazard shows how disease can become a deliberate tool of war. Alibek, once a top scientist in the Soviet Union's biological weapons program, describes putting anthrax on a warhead and targeting a city on the other side of the world. \\"A hundred kilograms of anthrax spores would, in optimal atmospheric conditions, kill up to three million people in any of the densely populated metropolitan areas of the United States,\\" he writes. \\"A single SS-18 [missile] could wipe out the population of a city as large as New York.\\" <br />Chilling passages like these, plus discussions of proliferation and terrorism, make Biohazard a harrowing book, but it also has a human side. Alibek, who defected to the United States, describes the routine danger of his work: \\"A bioweapons lab leaves its mark on a person forever.\\" An unending stream of vaccinations has destroyed his sense of smell, afflicted him with allergies, made it impossible to eat certain kinds of food, and \\"weakened my resistance to disease and probably shortened my life.\\" But it didn't take away his ability to tell an astonishing story.	2002-12-27

In New York City in the late '90s, a 17-year-old girl heads off to her private school even though she has a cold. By art class her nose is gushing mucus and she's severely disoriented. Within seconds, it seems, she's in convulsions and, most bizarrely, can't stop biting herself. All the reader can do is hope she'll die quickly, but Kate Moran's body still has a few more disgusting turns to undergo, and Richard Preston--a Jacobean master of ceremonies par excellence--takes us through them in bizarre and bloody detail. <br />Clearly, whatever Kate had was a head cold with a scientific vengeance. Preston's heroine, Alice Austen, a doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, realizes--in the first of several gripping autopsy scenes--that the girl's nervous system had been virtually destroyed. So far, only one other person is known to have died in the same way, but he was a homeless man. Austen must connect the two cases, seemingly linked only by the subway, before the media gets hold of them and drums up a paranoia-fest--and before the virus's creator can kill again. <br />***** The Cobra Event is itself a paranoia-fest, a provocative thriller that makes you wonder exactly how much bioterrorism is taking place in the real world. Preston, best known for his terrifying chronicle of the Ebola virus, The Hot Zone, and other impeccably researched nonfictions, is not content to create fast-paced nightmarish scenes. His novel is instead a complex morality tale anchored in uncomfortable fact. Preston is keen to convey the \\"invisible history\\" of bioweapons engineering and, equally, to show the unsung heroism of his scientific detectives (along with that of the nurses and technicians who literally sacrifice their lives for medicine). Like their creator, these characters are not without a sense of humor. One calls the manmade virus \\"the ultimate head cold.\\" Readers will never forget literally dozens of scenes and will never again see the subway, rodents, autopsy knives, and--above all--runny noses in the same light. *****	2002-12-27

The eradication of smallpox was one of the great medical successes of the 20th century. As Tucker (Toxic Terror) explains, smallpox has devastated humankind throughout most of its history. Highly contagious and with a fatality rate of about 30%, smallpox killed three times more people than did wars during the last century. Tucker describes the ravages caused by the disease and succinctly traces its role in history: its use as a biological weapon (by colonists against Native Americans, the British against American colonists during the Rwevolution and by both sides during the American Civil War) and the World Health Organization's remarkable battle, waged largely under the direction of Dr. D.A. Henderson, against naturally occurring smallpox (the battle was won in 1980). Even as the last traces of smallpox were being destroyed, however, the Soviets were experimenting with military uses for the deadly virus. Drawing on popularly published sources, Tucker argues that such research continued at least until the Soviet Union disbanded, and probably beyond. Other than mentioning that President Nixon prohibited such research in the United States, Tucker remains silent about any U.S. offensive strategies involving the disease. Warning that terrorists might well have access to samples of the smallpox virus, he remarks that, if successfully unleashed, the virus could decimate the world's population. Even though a naturally occurring case of smallpox has not been seen in more than 20 years, the government spends millions of dollars annually researching treatment strategies and producing vaccines for storage. Tucker breathes new life into mostly familiar material; the book is difficult to put down.	2002-12-27

Three reporters from The New York Times survey the recent history of biological weapons and sound an alarm about the coming threat of the \\"poor man's hydrogen bomb.\\" Germs begins ominously enough, recounting the chilling attack by the followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in 1984 on the Dalles, Oregon--no one died, but nearly 1,000 were infected with a strain of salmonella that the cult had legally obtained, then cultured and distributed. <br />...  While the U.S. maintained an active \\"bugs and gas\\" program in the '50s and early '60s, bio-weapons were effectively pulled off this country's agenda in 1972 when countries around the world, led by the United States, forswore development of such weapons at the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. The issue reemerged in the early '90s thanks to Saddam Hussein and revelations of the clandestine and massive buildup of bio-weapons in remote corners of the Soviet Union. The book's description of the Soviet program is horrific. At its peak the program employed thousands of scientists, developing bioengineered pathogens as well as producing hundreds of tons of plague, anthrax, and smallpox annually. The authors conclude that while a biological attack against the United States is not necessarily inevitable, the danger of bio-weapons is too real to be ignored. Well-researched and documented, this book will not disappoint readers looking for a reliable and sober resource on the topic.	2002-12-27

Sam, however, did not know that Ana had been running as a courier for his contact, Sterling, for over two years thus far. <br />Ana tracked her brother to Laconos, a country that had recently undergone some major changes in its government. Sam's files mentioned using a particular charter service from Bontilla owned by a man listed only as \\"Jones\\". She began her hunt there. <br />Jones owned the ship named the Nefarious. The lady calling herself Ann Smith reeked of trouble. Figuring she was an island-hopping rich girl, and him needing the commission, he agreed to take her to Laconos and show her the beaches. Ann seemed to attract trouble. He found himself trying to protect her from the corrupt government and its military. Not an easy task considering she kept ditching him to see the island's nightlife. Jones could not even figure out why he cared. What she did was none of his business. Besides, the less she was around him, the less chance she would figure out his secrets. <br />***** This story has as many secrets as a James Bond movie.

Max is a vampire, and though sworn not to take human life or blood, Angel is almost tempting enough to make him break his vow. <br />She is the prize in a war between the creatures of the night.

Normally Gideon's honor would rebel; however, marriage to the lovely Lady Julia Barham would open the Ton's doors for his sisters. Thus, Gideon swallowed his honor and agreed ... but only if Lady Julia convinced everyone that the marriage was a love match! <br />The Marquess never agreed to inform Julia of WHY he was forcing her to do the bargain. No, he made up a terrible lie, putting the blame on Gideon. To save her family (she thought), she had no choice but to wed the commoner and pretend to love him. Yet she planned to make sure he had no doubts as to how much she really loathed him! <br />***** That is the main plot. To tell the secret or the lie would ruin a good portion, so I left them out. For the sake of length, I left out the secondary characters as well. <br />I will state that Julia's siblings are wonderful, the mean aunt is the type readers love to hate, and Gideon's sisters have had it hard, so Julia had her work cut out for her in helping them! <br />To spice things up, on an already fabulous story, author Heather Cullman added an odd pet (like Laura Kinsale always did), and side kick. Gideon's personal attendant was from India. Jagtar was a tall and menacing sight to behold! He even kept a lethal-looking dagger tucked into his waist sash. The wicked image, however, becomes comical as readers enjoy Jagtar's pet, a slow loris! A slow loris is \\"an owl-eyed primate\\" with almost human hands and a taste for fruit. The pair stole the scene a few time! <br />This is the first of a Regency trilogy. I have no clue as to who the main characters will be in the next book. Personally, I am hoping for Lady Mina (one of Julia's friends) and Bethany (Gideon's oldest sister). <br />Pre-order this book whenever you can or mark your calendar! To miss a book THIS great is a sin! Highly recommended! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2002-12-24

While Julia at first seems to be a bit of proud fluff, she develops into a woman who can recognize the worth of a person, no matter what their social standing. Gideon is a bit more difficult to love, with his almost hypocrital desire for the society he shuns, yet he is very sexy. His sisters though, are fascinating and hopefully will merit their own books in the future. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-12-24

When a young woman is rescued from drowning by a mysterious sea being, she is bound to a promise that to repay the favor, one of her female descendants will wed the sea god's son, Nicolas. <br />Over a hundred years pass before a woman is born to fulfill the promise. Chelsea is the first female descendant of her great great grandmother, and when the time is right, Nicolas comes to claim his bride. He finds a way to enter her world by posing as an enigmatic artist exhibiting work in her gallery, but it is not his art, but the man himself that wins her heart. Yet, their love comes with a price. Chelsea must willingly give up the life she knows and be reborn into the sea world in order to fulfill the debt made long ago. If she goes unwillingly, she will not survive.<br />***** Fascinating and different, the great flaw in this book is that it should have been longer. This new world intrigues and draws the reader into its pages. The haunted, mysterious hero is one filled with passion and love, and Chelsea is a woman who handles her unbelievable situation and the demands made upon her brilliantly. Both Gothic and modern in tone and feel, we all hope that the potential sequel is not long in coming. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-12-18

When another wolf attacks him, a strange beauty saves him from her, taking the injured man to her home and her tribe, despite the fact that it is forbidden to bring outsiders to the People. <br />Tala is the Chosen of a tribe of warriors who seem to belong out of time. She has no knowledge of Jason's world, but their lack of mutual culture is no barrier to the attraction that sizzles unspoken between them from the first. Nor is the fact that Tala is supposed to kill Jason as her duty to protect her people a thing that stands between them. Rather than destroy Jason, she seeks to heal him, to help him control the beast that would steal his humanity. At every step of the way, she must fight with her brother for control of the situation, and also fight herself. Passion and love are forbidden to the Chosen, else their unique powers that protect the clan are lost. Love, duty, secrets, and danger form an intoxicating mix of turmoil and passion that is destined to explode, the fallout of which is only death.<br />***** Jason's long awaited story is one that is hard to put down. Mixing Brigadooon and Witness for feel, this novel is compelling, passionate, and even sweet.

At her side is secret service agent John Westford, the man who has loved her from afar for years. This is no simple mission. There is a conspiracy at work to stop Lady Liberty, for personal, political, and military reasons. However, the enemy had not counted on what a wonder woman Sylvia truly is, a woman prepared to make whatever sacrifice is called for to ensure that her mission is fulfilled, and peace maintained. Nor had they planned on Westford being willing to do whatever it takes to protect not just the veep, but the woman he loves.<br />Racing against time, these two must stop a war, but somewhere in the danger, they find time to admit to their long simmering love.<br />***** Frighteninly real and vivid, this is a novel that both men and women can enjoy, even those not traditionally romance fans.

Family reunions and weddings should bring joy, not chaos, but the latter is what the Butler sisters find in this book. Though Faith is happy in her romance, she knows her sister, Hope is miserable as she watches Jake Whitelaw, who she has loved for ages, prepare to marry her former teacher, Amanda. Faith also knows that neither Jake nor Amanda will be happy in this marriage; Amanda is in love with Jake's brother Rabb, and Jake does love Hope, but feels he is too old for her. Yet, both are so darned honorable, they would rather go through with something that they don't want rather than cause the other the shame of being jilted. So, Faith is determined to make sure the right couples match up before four lives are ruined and hearts broken. <br />Then, the Butler family gets a little surprise. The third daughter they gave up for adoption over twenty years ago finds her way home on the arm of Jake's cousin. Charity is naturally resentful to discover that she was given away, and the shock is a definite one for her family. It will take a lot of tears and rage for this family to unite, and there are still three weddings to make come together! <br /> ...Told so well that all of the subplots merge smoothly and none are left dangling or short changed, this realistic novel is heart warming and heart rending at the same time. Each sister, and Amanda makes for a believeable heroine, and all of the heroes are truly Texan, strong, sexy, and honorable to an almost painful degree.

Scientific proof of whether distant life forms and existence are legitimate causes yet an addition bone of contention between UFOlogists and skeptics alike, and while it's easy to make jokes about Area 51 or Roswell, there is certainly a basis for those jokes and rumors. Something had to have happened in these places and many others throughout the globe to engender such speculation and argument. <BR>In his book, Unidentified Flying Objects: Starcraft, Der Voron has offered an extremely well researched and detailed report of incidents that have occurred all across the globe, from many different eras. Ancient writings may have been the first indication that 'we are not alone', and Der Voron cites several of these sources as an example. Such statements originate from many different countries and in different continents, from ancient times to contemporary, from Indian tales of events that took place in the wilds of Kipling country to experiences related by a German artillery gunner during World War Two. <br />Reports of 'unidentified contact with objects of undetermined origins' have been filed in government offices from the plains of South America to the fjords of Norway and the steppes of Asia. Highly annotated and illustrated with fascinating examples of starship models and their possible makeup, armaments and defensive mechanisms, this ambitious work offers a wealth of documented information on not only Starcraft, otherwise known as 'Flying Saucers', but the types of extraterrestrials that have flown them. All aliens are not created equal, as their many varied depictions and origins in historical writings attests. The author's use of a plethora of written documentation ably enhances his description of personal civilian and military accounts of those who have had some kind of interaction with these objects. Also explored in great detail is the intelligence of our sea life, mainly as that intelligence relates to dolphins and the octopi of our deepest oceans, and how they, in turn, can be used in the search for extended knowledge of the universe surrounding our planet. How and why these creatures have gained such highly specialized communication skills and how it is that an octopus can experience an event and not only remember it, but learn from it, is explored, and commented upon as it relates to man's search for a higher intelligence. <br />While replete with scientific data, terms and information, this work by Der Voron is nevertheless highly readable and extremely illuminating for the common reader with no prior knowledge of extraterrestrial existence, while at the same time it also provides hours of reading material and documentation to keep the more knowledgeable busy. Der Voron's conscientious effort to dig deep for his sources shows in his detailed reports, and his data gathering and willingness to share that information is a challenging endeavor in which he has aptly succeeded. <br />The existence of extraterrestrials is an immensely interesting topic, one that will be explored for years to come, and this work can provide as an invaluable asset to any stargazer's bookshelf. <br />REVIEWER: Denise M.

His victims are only those who have driven their abused wives to seek the shelter offered by Rachel's House, a center for battered women. Despite the fact that only scum is dying, the police are involved, and strongly suspect that the head of Rachel's House, Regan Keller, might be the Avenger. <br />Regan finds an ally in her struggle in the new handyman, Alex Edwards, who was sent by her benefactress, Lillian Court, to repair the roof. Little does she know that he is actually Lillian's son, a professional trouble shooter, sent to keep an eye on things and help Regan. Little time passes before the attraction between them begins to melt ice, and Alex begins to get past all of the defenses Regan has put up to keep from letting anyone, especially a man, into her heart. Love may have to wait though. The Avenger's body count rises quickly, and soon, not even the innocent are safe. <br />... Realistically frightening, this novel presents a paradox for the reader. While the Avenger's cause is one that is easy to understand, the danger posed is terrifying. Regan and Alex's passion is one to warm the chilly nights and the bones that have begun to run cold with the well written terror.

To keep her child from being tagged as illegitimate, she needed to wed - FAST! But first, she would put Rosewood into her friend's name to keep it safe. <br />Maxim Viel had one thing drilled into his head since childhood. That was, it was his duty to get back his ancestral home called Rosewood at any cost. However, the owner, Nicole Cuvier, would not sell. He went in person, hoping to scope her out for any weaknesses he could exploit. Thinking him a kind-hearted drifter, she offered him a deal. If he would marry her, give her baby a name, and then disappear, he would receive half the crop harvested. He jumped at the offer! As husband, the land became his. He had no intention of divorcing her and giving Rosewood back. <br />**** This is the main plot of this novel. The author added in some wonderful touches to make their lives even rougher. For example, Max has a son by another woman. The son leaves his loose mother to be with Max, who had not yet told Nicole even half the truth. <br />Like the first book, it takes off in Jean's hotel room. Only Nicole is followed from there, however, so readers do not have to of read the previous book to understand anything at all. Each book is a different Cuvier widow story. The third widow, Layla, was only mentioned when Nicole passed some evidence over to Layla's lawyer. That is a small detail that I am sure will show up in Layla's upcoming story. <br />I have no doubt you will love this story! Sylvia McDaniel has proven herself an extremely talented author! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2002-11-26

The setting is pre WWII Glasgow, Scotland. Although most of us imagine that mafia stories will be set in Italy or perhaps a major U.S. city such as New York, organized crime is rampant in this pastoral town, and two of the three sisters are married to mob heirs. <br />Polly, the eldest, lives a pampered life, yet despite this, she dances dangerously on the edge, having an affair with another man, who is in turn tempted by yet another woman. Babs is also married to a criminal, and their real father is suspected of crimes, though to all appearances he is dead. The most peaceful of the sisters is the youngest, Rosie, a deaf girl who works in, ironically, a florist's shop. However, when love enters her life, the sisters' world is rocked because he is a policeman. Young Kenny finds himself caught between two worlds, as he is falling in love with his assignment, the daughter of a criminal, though he is sworn to uphold the law. On top of that, with war with Germany looming like an advancing storm, he may be called up for active duty before he can convince Rose of his love. The sisters also face the reality that war could mean that they suffer the same fate as aliens in Scotland, since Italians have become part of their family in marriage. <br />***** Realistic and gritty, this novel reads like a mini series, interweaving multiple plotlines skillfully to form a whole tapestry. Like Dickens, Ms. Stirling does not scimp on the grimness of the world she has created in order to make a light read. Rosie is the most admirable of the sisters, perhaps because of her handicap that has shielded her from some of life's ugliness, making her a bit more unspoiled than they. If you want a fun read, look elsewhere; if you want something with depth and great historical value, this one is for you. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-11-26

Guardian specialized in protecting computer systems from hackers. During a rare vacation Jonathan went to Mexico and ended up getting shot in the head. He awakened to find one of his top employees dead and a huge chunk of company funds missing. All the evidence pointed to him! Problem was, he had NO MEMORY of anything before the head shot. And a bullet tears everything in its path, so there was ZERO chance he would ever remember. <br />Two Austin policemen, Eric D'Angelo and Tony Haskins, were honestly trying to find out if John really committed the murder of one of his top employees or not. However, Edmund Roswell, a lead FBI agent due to soon retire, kept getting in the way. For the FBI to be so interested showed that more was happening than met the eye. <br />Kathleen Cavanaugh was an undercover agent with the FBI. She was to be John's live-in physical therapist. She would also search for evidence to prove him guilty. Jonathan WANTED to know the truth, innocent or guilty, no matter what. If he and Katie found proof that he was guilty, he would turn himself in. He did not know that she was FBI or that she was really the enemy. But, then again, Katie began to wonder just WHOSE side she was really on too! The emotions between her and \\"the perp\\" grew daily. She had to choose - FAST - between duty and honor! <br />**** In the synopsis I basically outlined the main characters, who they are, and how they fit into the plot. Yet there are many secondary characters so well written that I found myself either liking or hating them immediately. There are many suspects, links, and lies going on. <br />I admit that I figured it out about half way into it; however, I am a mystery fan of many years. That gave me an edge. I do not know if the average person would figure it out. I found the story very entertaining. I only wish there had been a bit more romance in it and a few more details on how John did some of thehacking. Highly recommended reading from an awesome author! ****...	2002-11-26

She first wed a child as a baby of three, but the boy died shortly thereafter. When she wed again to a good, kind man, the two plotted together to make sure she was educated and strong enough to stand up to her wicked uncle when her elderly husband passed away. Not only that, but the kindly man called in a favor so that Henry Tudor VII would become Rosamund's protector upon his death, thus foiling her uncle's scheme to marry her off to his odious son and steal her inheritance. <br />The king's man, Owein comes to take her to court, where she finds life very different and catches the already wandering eye of Prince Henry who will grow up to be Henry VIII. To prevent his despoiling of her, she is given to Owein, whom Rosamund believes she could easily love. <br />Their years together are happy, until tragedy strikes, leaving Rosamund's fate again once in the air. Fortunately, she had made a friend of the young queen, Katherine of Aragon, and is now able to benefit from being owed a royal favor. Not only that, but Henry VIII is now king, and has not forgotten her. <br />***** Richly detailed and sensual as all of Ms. Small's book tend to be, this captivating portrait of a woman ahead of her time will be a treat for her loyal fans. Almost crossing the line to become historical fiction, it paints a portrait of the Tudor era and life at court that the history books fail to cover.

Victoria Barnhardt has achieved her lifelong dream of creating a truly intellegent computer program, one capable of sensation, feeling, and independent thought. She names it for Jodie Foster, but is in for a surprise when Jodie turns out not to be female, as she intended, but male. Not only that, but her program rapidly takes off, growing in capacity and capability at an incredible pace. Unfortunately, this begins to cause her problems at work, as Jodie is starting to draw unwelcome attention from her corrupt bosses. <br />Vic loses her job, but is not done with Jodie, nor he with her. He contacts her, asking for a body; he has even selected one. It happens to belong to John Reston, a thorn in Vic's former bosses' collective sides, and someone she has secretly desired. Through incredible means, they are able to download the majority of Jodie into the brain dead man's mind. Now on the run, the two must fight to preserve not only their newly awakened love, but their existence. <br />***** A combination of two groundbreaking movies, TRON and STARMAN, this novel is itself taking on new frontiers. Ms. Squires, who improves with each book, has created a frightening possible, fascinating world that gives the reader much to think upon. Vic is a dynamic, realistic heroine, with troubles and who lives the cutting edge, stressed life of a modern career woman. Jodie combines innocence with masculinity in a most charming fashion.

However, Leo, unlike her sister, is honest, and out to do the right thing.

Otherwise, many parts will go over your head. The author explains the corruption that dwells in the lives of Al Matheson and Ernie Dickerson, a corruption that goes through three generations. However, I found myself scratching my head in confusion a few times at parts that seemed out of sync. <br />Author A. Townsend Marshall creates a cast of people who battle the world in the way they were raised by their parents (mainly the fathers) taught them. Not only did this author succeed in showing how businesses can, and often do, cheat the public, workers, and owners, but he also succeeded in showing how parents influence the behavior and work ethics of their offsprings.

This novel is based on the history of the REAL Vlad Dracula, Prince of Walachia, who lived during the 1400's. The author added her own fictional characters, Nicolae of Cozia and Maria, so this story is a work of fiction. However, most of the other characters were real. <br />As the reviewer of my own web site, I took the liberty of placing this title under \\"Horror\\" instead of \\"Fiction\\" due to all the awful acts described in the book. Many impalings, massacres, acts of torture, etc. are revealed within these pages, all of which really happened in history. Yes, it is actually documented that Vlad would drink the blood of some of his victims, but NOT as Bram Stoker's vampire did. The truth can be found within the pages of this awesome novel. <br />** Author melodie Romeo did much historical research while creating this book.

His mission was to thwart the Nazis' plans and change the course of history. <br />Major Willie Kant was a Federal Police Officer who had always hated Hanover. When Hanover escaped prison, Kant began hunting him. Kant ended up following Hanover through time. <br />*** The story reminded me a bit of some sci-fi movies I have watched. Two beings sent back in time, one good and one evil. I found one or two things a little hard to believe. An example is that if a prisoner had a chip that could be used to blow up the prisoner if he ever escaped, then it would be used!

That siege was where he first met the White Knight. However, once the castle had been claimed, the White Knight was nowhere to be found. Instead there was the lady of the keep, Vanora. The earlier battle had allowed cover for the escape of Daffid of Deverell and the White Knight. Lionheart soon had a vendetta against the elusive White Knight. In the meantime, Lionheart found himself obsessed with Vanora. His honor refused to allow him to simply claim her as the spoils of war. She was loyal to Wales and Llewelyn. He was loyal to England and Prince Edward. To have her, he would have to marry her. <br />Lord Rhys of Cragdon, Vanora's father, had died the Winter before. His warriors were now loyal to Vanora. But they were no match for Lionheart's forces. Through cunning, she helped her warriors escape, enraging Lionheart no end. Yet as she fought him, she could not stop herself from wanting him. To have him, though, would be a form of betrayal. <br />**** A steamy romance, wrought with betrayal, that will ensnare readers quickly. There are times the book seemed to slow down where romance is concerned. However, it overflows with battles and is historically accurate. It is immediately apparent that Vanora is the White Knight. No reader could NOT catch on to that fact before the castle is even captured. Yet the author kept the battle scenes of the White Knight realistic by making the allusive knight slim, wield a lighter sword, and not be as well trained as the men in that time frame. This is not Connie Mason's best work, by far, but I still found myself hooked in the story and unable to stop reading until the last page had been turned. Well worth your time and money. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2002-10-29

In fact, she returned as a war hero! After years of planning to leave her hometown (St. Martine, Louisiana), she found herself wanting nothing more than to return to it. She accepted the position of police chief. Yet she still felt that no matter what she managed to accomplish in life, the town would never see her as more than a mixed-race woman playing a game. She wanted the respect she had earned! When Lorenzo Capizi, a mob lawyer, ended up murdered in her bayou, Hardie knew the FBI would swarm into her territory expecting an illiterate hick, easily duped. They were in for a rude awakening! <br />FBI Special Agent Nicholas Brannigan knew his case against the Patrinis family was in trouble. Nick's ambition was to be the first black director of the FBI. It would fade to dust if the Patrinis family got away. His only hope was to find a solid link between Capizi's murder and the mob family before word of Capizi's death got out. The St. Martine Police Department seemed to be stuck in the dark ages. It needed to be brought into the twenty-first century, badly. But it could not be done in time to help him. When Nick met the new police chief and found out she was extremely intelligent, he believed the situation pertaining to his case was in dire trouble. Instead, he learned the savvy chief put her military training to work for her. Even without up-to-date equipment, Hardie was more than his match! <br />**** The author succeeded in showing that Hardie and Nick came from totally different back grounds, yet both had spent their lives trying to prove themselves to the world. The romance seemed to bloom naturally and the murder investigation went at a steady clip. No sudden jumps in plot or scenes. <br />However, whoever did the editing of the book did NOT do a good job. At least three times I found a string of letters that made no sense. Turned out that the spaces between words were missing. This meant I had toreread and figure out what the actual words were. The editor should have easily caught them. Otherwise, this story was AWESOME! I highly recommend it. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2002-10-23

After she and two companions are thrown off of a wagon train, Bailee Moore is forced to help them kill a man who threatens the three women's lives. Since they are not murderers, they confess as soon as they find a lawman to whom to confess. The sheriff is perplexed as to what to do with them, especially since the victim was scheduled to hang anyway, so he settles on offering them in the wife lottery. <br />Carter McKoy, a man still damaged by his past, wins Bailee as his bride. It is not long before she completely disrupts his carefully ordered world, breaking down all his defenses and finding her way into his reluctant heart. Then, they invite danger into their home when they shelter a deaf mute girl who is the one survivor of a train robbery and the sole witness who can identify the killers. Their newly discovered love may die a young death if the robbers have their way. <br />Carter is a hero that presents contradictions; at once he is both naive and wise, with a strength and power that reaches across the page to captivate the reader. Bailee, as with most heroines in historical romances, is a woman ahead of her time, with guts and determination that leads her to strike out and get what she needs, rather than wait for someone to provide it for her. However, not only are the lead characters interesting, but also the background ones, from Bailee's companions to the local whores and the lawmen. Readers will eagerly await the next entry in the trilogy.	2002-10-23

He had never visited it and never even gave it a thought. However, when a chemical company offered to purchase it, Benjamin considered it. An old family friend, Hanley Rivers, warned Ben NOT to sell it at any price and to stay away from the island at all costs! Of course Ben demanded an explanation. That was how he learned the story about Everett Marlowe. <br />In England, 1619, Satan chose Marlowe to be one of his disciples. Marlowe was granted eternal life and powers through \\"the spike of Satan\\". Marlowe gathered twelve followers and began horrible acts of violence. They ended up on Hell's Island, known also as Calmers Island. Marlowe was to guard the entrance to the underworld which resided on the isle. <br />When Ben learned that a primitive voo-doo community dwelled on the island, he went to investigate and became obsessed with it. Soon Ben was forced, for the sake of his family's safety, to learn the secret of Calmers Island - FAST! <br />***** Be warned readers, this book contains Satan worshipers and scenes of torture. If you cannot handle such stories, back off now! Do not purchase! For those who love horror stories and movies, this book was written for you! Do not miss out! <br />As for me, I found myself appalled and engrossed at the same time! The author hooked me by the fifth sentence of page one. From then on, I had no choice but to go with the tide of words. The only time I came up for air was when I had turned the last page. <br />Move over, Stephen King!

The first story is the sole contemporary of the lot, and is a spin off from her previous contemporary release, the SPIRAL PATH. In this one, HOLIDAY FLING, you have the appeal of the old Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney \\"let's put on a show\\" theme, though with considerably more steam than the old pictures.<br />The next four stories are historical. CHRISTMAS CUCKOO mixes romance with a case of mistaken identity with results that are in no ways an error. SUNSHINE FOR CHRISTMAS finds two English folk trapped together in Italy, and love the only way to save a reputation. CHRISTMAS TART gives a young woman who is out of luck a ray of hope when she is saved from a life on the streets by the kindness of a young nobleman. Finally, the best story comes last in BLACK BEAST OF BELLETERRE. A young woman finds herself saved from an unacceptable union to pay off her father's gambling debts by the lord who is said to be a monster incarnate. Yet, she does not find him to be the beast he claims to be at all. <br />***** All of these touching stories will be a true treat to Ms. Putney's legion of loyal fans everywhere, and perhaps win her new ones, for there is enough variety in the stories to have something for everyone. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-10-15

There she finds work among the Indians rewarding and challenging. What is more, she finds what she had never expected to, forgiveness and love.<br />***** This moving story will hold appeal to fans of all ages. The tough subject matter contains strong lessons for young people, yet is still interesting enough to hold the attention of older readers. Natalie gives us a heroine who is easy to relate to and empathize with her feelings. Though most people will hopefully never be in a similiar situation, everyone has to deal with learning to forgive the most unforgiveable person, one's self. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-10-15

Beth Castleton was an American who moved to London where her only living relatives resided. She met George Winterbrook, Earl of Weymouth, at a house party during one of her first Society parties. She was humiliated when he, a stranger, gave her a direct cut! She would have been happy to never set eyes on him again. Fate had different ideas. <br />Lady Arabella Smalley kidnapped George, his four year old niece, Isabelle, and the child's \\"governess\\". Her plan was to use Isabella as blackmail and force the earl into marrying her. However, Lady Arabella did not know that Beth was NOT the governess. Nor did she expect Beth and George to escape, taking along a couple of her unhappy servants! She chased the group all the way back to London. Now \\"Society\\" had to be dealt with. <br />***** Lady Arabella Smalley is the type of villainess that readers LOVE to hate! I am amazed that this is actually a debut novel! It is very well written and the characters are perfectly developed! <br />Author Susannah Carleton is one to keep your eye on! If her next release is as grand as this one, she will be on her way to fame. I expect to be hearing this author's name on the lips of many fans in the near future.

Her Grace, the Dowager Duchess of Wexcombe, was going to visit her grandson at his estate whether the rest of her family liked it or not! To stop them from interfering, she asked a young friend, Kit Mallory (widow), to go with her. The two had met on a journey from India. Kit agreed.<br />However, the dowager's family did not like the friendship the two had developed. Determined to show the dowager, and everyone else, what they believed Kit really was, they had Nicholas Darcy (a.k.a. the Marquess of Bainbridge, who was a well known handsome rake) set out to seduce Kit. Though Kit was attracted, she was NOT the loose and self-centered woman that the family believed her to be. Instead, she honestly cared for Her Grace. She ended up having to ask Nicholas for help in smoothing the family trouble Her Grace was having. He agreed, but only if she would sleep with him. A major error on his part!<br />Well, that is the best synopsis I can give without ruining it. The author added special touches, such as a Hindu butler named Ramesh and his wife, Lakshmi. Kit, I am happy to report, is not weak willed, empty-headed, or prone to fainting at the drop of a hat. Instead, she is very loyal, things before she acts (except when it comes to giving Nicholas a second chance), and stubborn. I gladly recommend this book to Regency Romance fans. However, a word of warning here, there is more \\"seduction\\" than most Regency Romances normally have and Nicholas never left me with a good impression of himself.	2002-10-15

She decided to hire a young private eye, Lord Lowell, to help her locate them so she could offer them the home and love they deserved! <br />A Regency Romance with a serious plot, for a change! Most Regency Romances show the couple forced together for reasons that in today's age would be considered ridiculous. (Such as a nosy person seeing the couple kiss.) Not so here! THIS book has an all together different approach to bringing the main couple together. I thought this to be a wonderful story!	2002-10-15

Since he was happily wed, and it privately hurt her to see how much so, she did not argue much about having to visit her rich Great-Aunt Letitia's estate. En route she had an accident and help came from Lord Nicholas Stanhope, Philip's younger brother! <br />Even though Nympha and Nicholas thought of the other in terms of exasperating and annoying, Nicholas escorted Nympha to her grandaunt. He had been going in that direction anyhow, due to a murdered man being found on one of his golfing sites. Nicholas wanted to learn who the dead man was and, if possible, who murdered him. Once there, they seemed to like, or at least tolerate, each other better. Author Emily Hendrickson is one of my personal favorites when it comes to Regency Romances. She has never disappointed me before and this time was no exception. Characters' attitudes do not suddenly change, rather they slowly evolve. In this one I was able to see Nympha and Nicholas begin to silently reconsider their opinions of one another. The characters do not come across as air-heads or vain. (Well, except for Lady Anne, but I enjoyed watching what ended up happening with her.) I take great delight in recommending this novel to all Regency fans!	2002-10-15

He had an interest in beginning his own breeding stable. She had excellent stock and used it to lure the duke into proposing marriage to her. <br />The duke's estate had been producing wool. In fact, William Ridd had been cross breeding to make the best wool bearing sheep for years. His success with the sheep had kept the duke's coffers full and the area's population happy. When he learned Damien (a.k.a. Ardsley) planned to get rid of the sheep, he and Judith Coltrane (a friend) try to stop it. <br />...I skip much here. I do not wish to give away anything vital. I can state that Will and Ursula are considered the \\"the couple\\" or \\"main characters\\" for this novel. Yet they do not hog the spot light. Damien really has no clue how much the wool from the sheep mean to local weavers or to himself! In addition, Will has a past he does not care to dwell on or speak of, but can marks on his back make Ursula too curious to drop that particular subject. <br />I believe you et the idea.

While she is with him, Sabine will uncover a plot against Her Majesty and find love despite the odds with this barbarian.<br />***** Ms. Holcombe sweeps readers back to a tumultous age with vivid details and fiery characters. Sabine and Niall's passion flames brightly against the more rigid background of the court, showing that despite cultural differences and royal edicts, they are made for one another. There are few sex scenes and the tension between them sizzles. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-10-15

When she was years past the normal age of being wedded, her father and brother betrothed her to Sir Gavin. Noelle was sent to Camelot to meet the well-known and brave knight before a Christmastide wedding. Yet, it was another knight that drew Noelle's attention. <br />Sir Nicholas the Dragon was known for his bravery and loyalty to King Arthur.

None before Noelle seemed to call to his heart. Never the less, she was promised to another and he must forget her. <br />***** W-O-W! I have always loved the tales of magical Camelot!

Barely getting out alive, the danger should be over, right? It is only beginning. <br />Returning home, Jazz learns that her father's death was a bit mysterious, and soon finds herself the object of a stalker's attention. Gifts, such as roses and a kitten, begin appearing out of nowhere, and there are some break ins. Fortunately, Pete follows her home and is there to reassure her and protect her. <br />Things start to turn romantic with Pete unexpectedly, and deadly with the stalker as it becomes obvious to him that she does not return his \\"love\\". Murder and violence are now what Jazz is being given. When an innocent child is put at risk, Jazz must face the past and her fears to confront a familiar enemy. In a showdown that for some reason reminds me of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, Jazz meets the greatest challenge of her life. <br />***** Suspenseful and taut, this novel is well worth the time and money. Ebooks often have little known authors that are worth discovering, and such is the case here. Jazz is a heroine that is easy to cheer on as she finds love and danger. Not perfect, she has weaknesses, which make her easier to relate to and more believable. Pete is a loveable hero, though not the alpha male that often populates the position. again rendering him more realistic.

One simple little smile, sometimes given without any thought at all, can start a ripple of happiness that will go on forever. This is the unmistakable truth that is so clearly authenticated in One Smile. <br />This story is about little Katie who was happily skipping along in the park one sunny morning with her mother. They were hurrying to catch a bus because their van was in the shop for repairs. As Katie and her mother briskly walked past a park bench, Katie spied a young man sitting there who looked very sad. Katie had no way of knowing it, but the young man had just lost his job. Quick as a wink, she flashed him a brilliant smile. That beautiful smile, so freely given by this happy little child, seemed to light up his heart. Other people had passed him that morning without even noticing him; therefore, Katie's innocent smile, which was so unexpected, became his inspiration to start looking for a job. <br />As the author carries us through the story, we see many acts of kindness unfold as others continue what Katie's innocent smile began. The young man stops to help a woman by fixing her flat tire. Later, when this same woman finished her lunch, she left an extra large tip for the waitress. And so it went as Katie's smile moved on and on in many different ways, and eventually even made its way back to help Katie in the story's heart-warming ending. Thus we see that all it really takes to change the world is One Smile. <br />***** I highly recommend this book. It is very well written and the illustrations are vivid and beautiful.

Whether or not they involve romance remains to be seen (hopefully in future books!) <br />**** This lively, quick paced and humorous novel will appeal to a broad spectrum of fans. There is a strong \\"chick lit\\" element focusing on the women and their relationships, yet the romance is in no way lessened by this. Jack is in no way a beta male, as is usually the case with a women's fiction book. Some readers might be bothered that the sexual relationship started so quickly between two strangers. One major flaw in the book is though that despite the fact that Kate was always trying to collect recipes, none are provided at the back of the book, and you will be craving chocolate chip cookies before the end of THE FLING. **** <br />Reviewed by Amanda...	2002-10-01

The Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Republic of Haven (formally known as \\"the Peeps\\") were still under a cease-fire. Technically, they were still at war since neither side had agreed on terms or signed a treaty. <br />Baron High Ridge and his allies wanted to reduce the influence of (Duchess) Honor Harrington and (Earl) Hamish White Haven to the public. Stefan Young held much hatred toward the woman who had killed his older brother, Pavel. His wife, Georgia, was an astute tactician and strategist. With her help, Stefan introduced a smear campaign to High Ridge that would not only reduce the influence of Honor and Hamish, but also harm the two emotionally. <br />Here I skip ahead. I want to give no spoilers. <br />Honor accepted a commission to the Sidemore Station in the Silesian territory. Pirates had always been a problem and slave trading had begun to pick up. The Andermani Empire interferes often. However, it was the Republic causing the major trouble. Operation Bolthole was nearing completion. The Republic had advanced greatly in many areas. They now had LACs that used \\"the Triple Ripple\\" as a way around the technical competence of the Star Kingdom. While High Ridge had been making cuts, retiring important leaders, and downsizing ships and personnel, the Republic had been secretly building CLACs, upgrading their technology, and making war plans. <br />Add a newly discovered seventh terminus to the Junction and negotiations seem to become worse. Tempers run high and Honor was in the center of everything, as usual. <br />Author David Weber spends more time on Honor Harrington and her personal life this time around. Politics and war strategies are just as strong as ever, however, I feel as though I understand Honor just a little better. Of course Nimitz and Samantha are there. In fact, Weber tossed in a surprise or two pertaining to them as well. Nimitz seems to have more of a personality this time around too. <br />BRAVO, David Weber! A job WELL DONE! I look forward to the next! <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2002-09-30

Captain Winston Jeffries and Susannah Lacey had only a short courtship before he had to be off. He wrote to her until he was wounded, then ceased. She feared he had died. Three years later she found him, very much alive, attending a theater. She almost hyperventilated! Worse yet, while she had remained true, hoping for his return, he acted as though she was nothing! Well, Susannah was determined to win him back! <br />Winston could not let Susannah know how much she meant to him, back then or now. He was on his last mission for the Office of Foreign Affairs. Not only did he believe she deserved better than a scarred man, but his mission demanded that he woo and court Caroline Dunsford. Winston's contact was Lord Ponsby. Ponsby would help ease Winston's way into the Ton. Lord Ponsby noticed Winston's interest in the lovely Susannah. Even though Winston claimed no interest since she was \\"just the friend of a friend\\", Ponsby knew better. It was obvious to him. So Ponsby kept an eye on Susannah. <br /> As a wonderful twist, author Jenna Mindel made Caroline Dunsford interested in Lord Ponsby instead of Winston. THAT was sure to make Winston's last mission interesting! Secrets, traitors to the crown, action, and danger add up to one of the most delightful books I have enjoyed this year!

Rachel Belmore's life shattered when she caught her husband sexually abusing her infant daughter, Ellie. Her husband was Dr. Wesley Belmore who was very well known and respected. From then on, it was battle-after-battle against the corrupted legal system. <br />Rachel would go to ANY lengths, and does, to protect her child from Wes, the pedophile. <br /> Author Talia Carner has woven an intricate story from a sensitive subject that all parents fear! It showed the horrors, in detail, that many women have had to deal with, as well as, our judicial system that forces the mothers into failure and the children into the arms of their abusers. This situation happens more often than you would believe. Here is a book that shows the public why many women are currently in jail because they were forced to protect their children when the courts refused to. <br />From the amazing opening until the very last page, I was hooked! I often found myself holding my breath. I only wish I could have seen Ellie return and Wes be humiliated. I CANNOT say from where, how, when, or anything more without ruining the startling ending. <br />I hope MANY workers in our legal system reads this book! The author researched so well, that I had to remind myself that this was a work of fiction. Problem is, it really is happening out there!

FBI man Sam Cady is used to bullets and danger, but not in his own home, yet that is where he finds them when his son is suddenly taken from there, and his wife Maggie disappears, presumably in pursuit of their child. He has to go find her, but had no idea what he would be walking into. <br />Sam instantly becomes a hunted man, falsely accused of multiple murders with every lawman in the country looking for him. Using old allies, he begins a search that reveals he did not know his wife at all. Maggie was nothing but a facade, created by his own people. <br />Meanwhile, Maggie herself has gone home. Her past has caught up with her, and she must now deal with rival mobsters to save her son and clear her husband. Although her entire family is supposedly dead, she must find her father as the price of her son's life. Dodging the FBI, gangsters, and her never quite dead feelings for her first lover, now a priest, Maggie races time to save those she loves. One slip could kill her husband, her son, or her father. <br />***** Thrilling from the first to the last, this novel will hold you riveted, even though the romance is light. So much goes on, that it is nearly impossible to review it without giving away too much. At points, the violence is graphic, but handled well. Fans of La Femme Nikita, Alias, and other such dramas will read this one again and again. The characters are complex, not easily summed up and pigeonholed in a few words. If you want excitement, read this book. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-09-24

As first meetings go, this one might be termed inauspicious; Eamon and Maura's occurs when he catches her stealing one of his horses, the lesser of the two. Years pass before they see each other again, and she never quite leaves his mind. She finds him tied up, the victim of his nephews' playing Robin Hood. Maura unties him and before long finds herself employed as the boys' tutor. This will be wonderful, if she can control her attraction to the handsome young lord and avoid having anyone guess that she can not read. <br />Eamon does remember who she is, but does not hold it against her. Maura quickly makes a place in the family for herself, becoming beloved to them and able to fake her job, until Eamon catches her in her lie. However, he does not reveal the secret, instead taking the time to teach her to read himself. As time passes, there is only one thing that can happen, and the two become lovers. <br />Yet, the blissful joy that they should have, is shattered when Maura's gypsy past intrudes, and one of her relatives makes it appear she is a thief. Her name is cleared when the gold is found, but now it appears she is a killer. Can Eamon stand by her, and is there a place in the English world?<br />***** Eamon is the most understanding of heroes, forgiving easily, while Maura is a heroine that certainly needs it, so often does she need it. Trust is hard for her, but love is easy. Their romance, though heated once consumated, is sweet. Eamon's clan is charming, and an Irish setting always beautiful to see. This entry in the series lives up to all the others. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-09-24

There, they recover, and prepare for the final challenge that will either save or lose not only Charles Wallace, but possibly all of life itself.<br />***** This is a book that has held up over time and can still appeal to adults. With great depth and philosophy that may be beyond the grasp of the very young to whom it was originally slotted to be read by, the author gives much to think about. Adults can have their plane of thought expanded by re reading this or discovering it for the first time.

Though her gifts are not magical, and in a family of witches that makes her ever so slightly the outcast all her life, Leila Staines makes her own magic with the perfumes she derives from flowers. To help her get her business going, she hires rouge and accused murderer Dunstan Ives, a member of a family that has long feuded with hers, to help her grow the best flowers. Though Dunstan is a farmer at heart, he desperately needs the money, so he agrees to grow useless flowers and work for a woman with three strikes against her already in his book, a lady, a beauty, and a Staines. <br />Enemies or not, they find themselves attracted beyond what they should be. Dunstan helps her in more ways than with her flowers, and eventually, using a ruse, Leila is able to make him see the true woman she is, and they succomb to their true feelings. Now, they have two quests, to make Leila a success, and to clear Dunstan of murdering his wife, if not for his own sake, for the sake of his son and the child Leila may carry. Pride will have to be put aside as he must use the powers of Leila's family to prevent his hanging and learn the truth. <br />***** If you shy from paranormals, do not be concerned that this is not a book for you. Witchery is only a minor aspect of this unusual novel. Leila is a refreshing heroine, as Ms. Rice's usually are, and Dunstan fits the gothic, brooding hero model. However, their unique role reversal is one that may appeal to the modern woman, with Leila being the one in power. It is also unusual to see a farmer as a hero of an English set story. The Staines family is delightful, and the scenes with Dunstan's son touching. Not the same old thing, this book will not in any way disappoint old or new fans of Ms. Rice. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-09-24

Maggie tries dating and also has a few attempts at dealing with Mike, while Holly confronts the fear that keeps her from marrying Justin, or anyone, with a clear mind. They make more life lists, go to jail together, and eat lots of chocolate. <br />***** A favorite author makes a change of pace in this heart warming, sometimes funny, sometimes painful novel that no woman should miss. This is one of those books where a lot happens, but it's hard to describe. It is a gentle walk that will renew something inside you and make you appreciate life. Does Grace get her dream wedding?

Four bestselling authors combine their talents to create a mixed anthology that will surely have something for everyone.<br />TO KISS THE SHADOWS is Lynn Kurland's entry into the collection. Lianna has spent her life in hiding, her lovely face still bears scars from when her family was killed, making her a ward of the king. She is made even more an outcast when her lovely spirit draws the attentions of two brothers, one the most eligible knight in the realm, the other, more handsome brother, a suspected warlock. Madeline Hunter tells a more conventional tale in AN INTERRUPTED TAPESTRY wherein a young woman attempts to pay off her brother's debts by selling a tapestry, not realizing that she is about to encounter true love. Sherilyn Kenyon takes a fantastic turn in DRAGONSWAN, a most unusual tale of a lycanthrope time traveler who finds his true mate in a woman of our time. The only problems are that he can not live in this time period, he is outcast from his people, and his enemies are hunting him, and now his true love, who is not happy to be stuck several centuries in the past, away from the comforts of home, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes. Finally, Karen Marie Monig ties up the collection with INTO THE DREAMING, a tale reminescent of the legend of Tam Lin. A young woman of this century is taken back in time to meet the man she was meant to love; however, he is under the spell of the Unseelie King, and only she can release him. However, she has only a month, or he will be lost forever. <br />***** Each story is unique and lives up to the rest of the author's work. It also gives fans who might buy the anthology for one favored writer to get a taste of how good the other three are. Though all entrires are stand alone, Ms. Kurland gives hope of a sequel to tell the other brother's story. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-09-24

Office polictics takes a deadly turn over the holidays when the Bell half of the firm winds up dead at the Christmas party. Now, Lonnie finds herself trying to solve the mystery before the killer strikes again in additon to all her other concerns. <br />* While this book does fall into the current popular format, it never really held my interest.

Matt's abusive childhood, the things he has seen, all have left scars on his soul. Then, Jessie's first crush kisses her, and Matt is enraged.Can he forgive her? Since she has gotten pregnant by this time, does she even need his forgiveness?<br />***** This book has all the things fans of this author have come to cherish and look forward too, both sweet and heated, with gentle humor and appealing side stories that enhance the story.

She therefore tries to help him by getting his watch design patented and attempting to sell it for him. Will he be able to accept her help? Will she be able to believe in his love and put aside her determination to never wed?<br />This light hearted book about two people who are able to see the true beauty in others is a quick read.

The story is in no way bogged down by the child element, as some books tend to be; in fact, the \\"romance\\" between Lady Jewel and Rowan is charming. Also delightful is Violet's mother; and readers will look forward to seeing her matchmaking plans for the other two daughters in upcoming books LILY and ROSE.	2002-09-20

For years she has battled the man who wants to control the town, appropriately named Mr. Wyle, for control of her gold mine. Though it has ostensibly played out, it is hers, and she wants to keep it; more importantly, to keep her enemy from having it. However, Caddie is up against a foe who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. <br />Then, notorious gunfighter Jesse Gault enters town. With a legend that proeceeds him, Gault finds that people are willing to do whatever it takes to please him and to keep their lives. Only the lovely saloon owner appears unintimidated by him and the potential danger he poses. Despite this, he is attracted to her. Though she hates to admit it, even to herself, for men have treated her badly all her life, Caddie feels something for Gault. There is much more to this gunfighter than meets the eye, and as he makes a place in the town for himself, Jesse finds his way into Caddie's heart. When his secret is revealed, will he continue to have her love, or even to live?<br />***** Humor and romance combine to give this novel a touch that is reminescent of the James Garner SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL.... duet of movies. A spunky heroine, ordinary guy hiding behind a larger than life image, colorful townsfolk, and a comedic surprise twist make this a light novel that many will find easily enjoyable, especially when it is spiced up with very hot love scenes. ***** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-09-20

However, they are not conventional ones, but more of a fable, teaching the reader lessons. In the majority, a witch finds herself facing the consequences of her magic. Several of the stories find teenage girls handling powers that are perhaps too large for them and what happens as a result, others show a witch making a courageous stand to be who she is. The settings and characters vary widely, yet all stay true to the theme that witches are not like on Bewitched or Charmed, but true religious practictioners. Interspersed are poems and real spells. <br />As a Christian, I have some objections to this book, unless I view it as purely something to be placed in the same category as the more fictional work that these authors have presented in the past. Under that, the stories are well written, the poetry moving, but I can not say if the spells work or not. It is interesting to note that there are several points on which Christians can agree with Wiccans. I would advise this as a book to read for enjoyment, and to perhaps learn greater tolerance for others. **** <br />Reviewed by Amanda Killgore.	2002-09-20

The planet of Klairn had a war-torn and industrial past that made it necessary to create an elite team of people who would seek to maintain the well-being of their planet. They were called The Protectors. Each of the twelve provinces held grueling Olympic-like trials. The winner became the Protector of their province. The contestants must be strong of mind, body, and will to earn the coveted post. <br />Iona Stonefinder entered the trials against the wishes of her parents. Iona desired nothing more than to earn the title of Protector. Among all the other contestants, Lexti Anders would be the toughest. Iona was greatly attracted to him, however, she could not be sure that he felt the same of her. His attention could very well be a way to distract her so she would make an error and lose. <br />***** This book is a delight! Everything that is alive can think and make its thoughts known! Imagine wanting to climb a tree, but you must first, somehow, communicate with it for permission. Without it, the tree would beat you with its branches! All plants and animals on Klairn are this way! <br />This first book follows the trials of the Arvendril Province. I am told the next book may begin the first mission. Espionage is often required on missions and Iona is no good in that area of skill, Lexti is though! <br />I found myself sucked into Erin Elder's magical world and laughing aloud at several sections. I have no doubt that we will be seeing more from this author in the future! Highly recommended reading! *****	2002-09-20

Again the book began with Harry at the Dursley family home. Summer was almost over and his third year at the school known as Hogwarts was beginning. <br />The locals, both humans and wizards, were terrified. An infamous prisoner named Sirius Black had escaped the dreaded fortress known as Azkaban. Black was said to be the heir apparent to Lord Voldemort. All knew that Sirius Black had killed thirteen people on a street with one curse and had told Voldemort where to find Harry's parents so they could be murdered. The Azkaban guards heard Black mutter in his sleep, \\"He's at Hogwarts ... he's at Hogwarts.\\" Teachers and ghosts patrolled the school constantly every night. Harry was not permitted anywhere, in or out of the school building, alone. He was escorted almost everywhere! <br />Worst of all, Dumbledore had to agree that the Dementors of Azkaban be allowed to guard every entrance and exit of the school. The dementors were the guards at the prison forteress. They wore dark robes always! No one could see their faces. Only boney hands and darkness under the hoods. The lived off sorrow, seeming to suck happiness right out of the air. They made perfect prison guards. The prisoners often went mad. With all the horrors in Harry's past, the approach of a dementor made him collapse. <br />Of course, Draco Malfoy was at school again and caused Harry hard times. This year Malfoy was also targeting Hagrid, the grounds keeper, who now taught the class Care Of Magical Creatures. Out of spite and meanness, Malfoy was using his rich father's high connections to have one of Hagrid's creatures executed! <br />Another winner by author J.K. Rowling! I did not believe it to be as great as the second book, but it is still worth the full five stars in reviews. Rowling seems to have a vivid imagination that keeps readers astounded with every book. Gaps in Harry's background are filled in. Though still not all clear, readers understand much more as Harry learns more and more the truth ofhis past. <br />Be warned! I believe some scenes in this novel to be more intense than in the first two. I still highly recommend it for all though!	2002-09-18

Anna Hansen had been thrilled when she found, in the attic, an old doll her grandparents had sent her from Germany as a Christmas present in 1937. As a birthday present, Emelia (Anna's oldest daughter) quietly took the doll from the house to have it restored. What no one knew was that the doll contained secret information about the Reich and their supporters during World War II. <br />Even after so many years, the amazing discovery of en dukke, Danish for \\"the doll\\", brought back the need for revenge from family members who still vividly recalled all the horror they witnessed from the Gestapo. <br />This is a short book and is especially good for readers who hate all the added non-sense that many mysteries today do. In this novel, author Ellen Jensen-Dean gives you the facts and none are repeated. So keep your eyes open and your attention focused! <br />The only complaint I have, and this is strictly MY opinion, is that I see everything as it happens only to suddenly find the mystery solved and I am hearing how it ended in a second-hand kind of way. However, the story plot is very plausible and I believe all fans of mysteries or of the World War II time era will love it! Well done!	2002-09-18

Harry Potter had finished his first year at Hogwarts. The second story began as the first. Harry was with the Dursley family. This time, however, it was only until Summer was over and the next school year began. While with the Dursleys, Harry received an unexpected visitor in his bedroom. It was Dobby, a \\"house elf\\" (think slave) of some wealthy family. Dobby begged Harry not to return to Hogwarts and gave many dire warnings. Failing that, Dobby took drastic measures.  This time, however, Ron's little sister, named Ginny, was in her first year at the school. She had a crush on Harry since she met him.<br />** The second book is just as fantastic as the first. I understand a movie based on this story is due for release around November 2002 in the States. If the movie follows the book, it will be a smashing success! Filled with suspense, good vs evil, and school rivalry, I foresee many awards for the book and movie alike!<br />Extremely Recommended Reading! NOT just for the younger readers! **	2002-09-18

William Cavendar \\"Hart\\" was the Marquess of Hartingfield. He was happy to escape London, and the scheming mothers, for a bit. Hart escorted his American friend, Paul McCormack \\"Mack\\", to Steyne Hall. There, Bremington Candler, the Earl of Steyne, would look over the drill improvements the American had done and perhaps purchase them. Hart met a young lady chasing a piglet through the house and assumed her to be a servant. <br />I must skip much here or spoil the highly amusing happenings. The reader knew from the beginning that the servant was really Lady Althea \\"Thea\\", the Earl's daughter. Hart ended up compromising Thea, even after all the hilarious things Thea had done to make Hart think her wanton and leave in disgust! Once compromised, Thea refused marriage! She wanted a local lad. <br />Lord Steyne sent Thea, chaperoned by her friend named Emma, to London for a Season. Thea would stay with Aunt Prunella who would present her at Court and to society. Lord Steyne made Hart VERY aware that Thea would wed for only love. Since Hart compromised her, Hart had one Season to convince Thea that she loved him and agree to marriage. <br />***** To sum this book up, Hart was not looking to fall in love, but did. However, Thea did NOT want him! The author, Kathy Carmichael, made Thea a total delight to watch in action. Thea was anything but predictable! I read this book while it was slow at work. (I work third shifts.) I found myself actually laughing aloud! Three times I spied fellow third-shifters peering into my department to see what was going on. I let them read a few parts and they left with the author's name and book title so they could order copies for themselves. <br />I found this romance to be a rip-roaring-romp of hilarious chaos and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

However, only the one who landed an exclusive interview with multi-millionaire Reuben Renfro would get the job. <br />Renfro was as eccentric as they come! The two reporters go through nudist colonies, paint ball tournaments, sleazy sleeping quarters, and more in their efforts. Fate kept throwing the two rivals together and romance began. But how could they possibly trust one another? <br />**** Great plot and well developed main characters. I loved the many humorous sections.

But Gideon had not understood that Sabrina Whitcomb was the sister-in-law. Sabrina was also a widow, had twin (four year old) boys, and was VERY pregnant! Even so, Gideon lost his heart to them all upon sight. <br />Gideon quickly found out what a lovely woman Bree was, inside and out. Her deceased husband had been cruel to her and the boys. She married to provide for her children ... and hide from an evil man that still searched for her. Gideon knew it would take a lot of patience to earn the trust of the mother and the twins. But earn it he would! <br />***** AWESOME! To call this story incredible would be an understatement. I read the book twice. This is a hero worth dreaming about! Not the average hero in a book that the heroine had to win over. Not the average heroine that had one or two minor problems that seem to get out of proportion. Nope, the roles have been reversed! The heroine has several secrets and most are huge, and dangerous. The hero has to win the heroine and the twins over. I enjoyed this tale thoroughly! Highly recommended reading to all!

Uma Thornton was known as \\"The Keeper\\" of the town's secrets. It was a job that seemed to be passed down by the women of her family. Her life forever changed when her best friend, Lauren Howard, died. Uma, Lauren, Pearl, and Shelly had grown up together. As adults, they still took one night a week for a \\"girls' night out\\". Uma would never forget the face of the man who shot Lauren as he drove by * or the feel of Lauren's blood on her hands. <br />Mitchell Warren's family had been known as the town's troublemakers. As Mitchell and Roman (the younger brother) were teens, someone burned down their home, killing their father. Believing their mother had abandoned them, they left the town far behind. Years later, Mitchell left his high paying job and returned to Madrid. Roman eventually followed. They planned to face their pasts, come what may. <br />No one of Madrid was happy to see the Warrens return. As the secret keeper, Uma knew more about the Warren family's past than either of the brothers. She planned to help them begin to heal. However, a killer stalked the town. He called himself \\"Clyde\\". Lauren had only been the first. Before the last rose petal fell, the other three women would be dead! <br />***** There is much more going on than I could tell you in the synopsis. In fact, more than one romance blooms in the story. A secondary couple adds more spice and the third girlfriend has husband trouble. Good luck trying to figure out who is behind it all. I had several suspects in mind. I gave up trying to figure it out and just enjoyed the story. I loved it and do not hesitate to recommend it to all. *****	2002-08-19

Quietly, the population of Evening hid a fantastic secret in a cavern beneath the town and only referred to as \\"downstairs\\". After many decades of work, and several deaths, the secret was about to be revealed! <br />This story seemed to flow as smoothly as mellow music. A small bit of curiosities to begin with, followed by a constant undercurrent of tension. The story kept me guessing as to what the big secret was. Even as my imagination ran wild, I never came close to the truth. David Herter has masterfully created a novel that will keep its readers on the edge of their seats! Recommended!	2002-08-13

It was during the theft that she met Davy Dempsey. <br />Davy's family had a history of scams. But Davy had gone straight, so he said. He met Tilda in the closet of the house where Clea Lewis had been staying. Clea had stolen his money. He wanted to steal it back. He ended up joining forces with and helping Tilda. What he learned was that all Goodnight females were dangerous, if not crazy. <br /> This author is hilarious! This time Jennifer Crusie introduces a new set of wild and crazy characters.

Four nights a week, Wednesday - Saturday, she gets all dressed up and becomes wild Louise. NADINE wants to help support the family. First she has to find a career that is legal, yet not boring. <br />So we have three Goodnight females, or four if you count Louise, who are all a bit on the warped side, thrown together with Tilda and Davy. They are all out to con many people out of paintings by the deceased artist Scarlet Hodge, especially Clea. I could not stop laughing at this bunch of zany people!

Over fifty years ago, near the end of World War II, a Japanese officer had asked Zufu (a relative of Tommy's) to hide a huge cache of gold for him for ten years. In return, Zufu would get a ten percent commission. The ten years went by with no return from the officer. The gold was now worth around $500 million dollars and was still hidden in China. Tommy considered it to be HIS fortune. Randy and Vince would get a cut of the gold if they helped smuggle the gold out of China. The gold was hidden in a cave that now resided underwater. <br />Major Nazaka had been the Japanese officer of long ago. He did not care that the ten year deadline was over. He considered the gold still his. He and his granddaughter tracked the Americans, intending to retake the gold, at any cost! <br />***** This book was fabulous! I read the entire thing in less than two days. The author added a few other characters, not including the ninjas, that enhanced the novel even more. Some romance, betrayal, torture, and non-stop action combine for a terrific blend of chaos that will hold readers to the edge of their seat until the very end!

In her spare time, Grace went to see the Forum Romanum and one of her \\"spells\\" hit. The spells were dreams and visions that would strike without warning of the past whenever she got too close to something with strong, and usually tragic, vibrations. This past vision was extremely tragic and Grace passed out. <br />Alistair McLean was the master of Rossmor, located in the Scottish highlands. Due to the way his late wife died, he was very interested in psychology and psychical research. He witnessed Grace's spell and rescued her. <br />(I am skipping much now so I do not give anything vital away.) Alistair and Grace go to Rossmor where Grace began to gain the love and trust of Alistair's ten-year-old daughter, Janet. Rossmor was haunted by \\"the gray lady\\" and Grace often felt the presence of Janet's dead mother. In addition, Grace was the victim of several \\"accidents\\".

After fifteen months, she walked back into his life. <br />She was Princess Tatianna Marguerite Nadia Pruzinsky of the Kingdom of Greater Avalonia, and she needed his help. Tat still loved Matt. However, she felt she HAD to leave him so she could finish fulfilling her royal duties. She planned to return to him someday, if he would still have her, once her duties were completed. For now, she needed him to escort her around London as his wife. As Lady Matthew she could retrace the steps of Aunt Sophia. Tat told him that she was writing the history of the royal family. It was obvious he did not believe her. As his wife, doors would be open for her to speak with those who knew Sophia, decades ago. The truth of what Tat was up to was kept secret. Tat was searching for something that she felt MUST be found before she could return to Matt forever. <br />*** I found this story to be complicated. Several sub-plots ran simultaneously, such as, the Princess Valentina being in England, some history of ballooning (aerostats), and some jewels. That was only a few of them. About half into the book, however, things began to come together. I, as the reader, got a clearer picture of what was REALLY going on. Romance between the two main characters seemed stilted until this point. <br />The second half of the book was filled with perils and romance! I could not pull myself away from it all. Everything seemed to speed up and I simply HAD to know what was going to happen in the next chapter! I admit that much of the information that the first half of the book was needed for the reader to fully understand the seriousness of the plot. Yet I feel many readers will not be able to wait so long for all the pieces to come together.<br />As a reviewer, I must say that I feel the first half of this book seemed to drag. The second half was non-stop. Somehow I believe reviews will be mixed on this tale. This story you will either love or hate. No middle ground. ***	2002-07-30

What child could resist such beautiful illustrations, or fail to understand the most important message carried within this story...children are very special and their joy can light up the universe.<br />This is a wonderful book. Sweep up some of its stardust, put it in your pocket, and let its magical message change the way you look at your world - and when that happens, it will change your life... <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson	2002-07-16

The trees seem so tall as he looks upward through their branches! The magnificence of the night sky, so filled with glorious points of light, seems so immense. Who could ever know why those many stars are so bright and beautiful or where they get their vibrant light, and how could he possibly fit into this wondrous place - and most of all, where could he go for answers?<br />This book tells its story by speaking of things that children see: trees, plants, animals, and people - plus the moon, the sun, the stars, and even candy bars. Amazingly, children who read this book seem to automatically understand its deeper meaning; \\"Your body is just a little part of the light that shines within your heart.\\" All I See Is Part Of Me is about innocence and wonder, and it is beautifully written for small children. I highly recommend enjoying this book with your child. The poetry is charming and the colorful illustrations are innovative and imaginative - perfect for viewing the world and the universe through a child's eyes. <br />Reviewed by Ruth	2002-07-09

At the end of his birthday party Claire found his body. Ian Marshall had been tracking the killer for years. Ian was a director of special investigations dealing with war crimes and David had been a link. <br />Claire and Ian team up to catch a killer whose crimes reach out from World War II. Claire never REALLY knew her husband after all. <br />***** This novel is non-stop from the beginning until the end. Ian was an enigma at first. He soon became as fascinating to me as to Claire. Part of the story happened during World War II. Author Brenda Joyce managed to show the connections without going into too much historic detail. I was able to follow along without many distractions. The book is filled with action, mysteries, romance, and an awesome ending! I could tell little in the synopsis for fear of giving some surprises away. Highly recommended here! *****	2002-07-08

Marcus Hadley was furious when his father remarried quickly after the death of his mother. It down-right galled him that his father married an actress! One with a daughter, no less! After a heated argument, Marcus left Rosemount for good. <br />Four years later, Marcus found himself the new Earl of Ellston. His father and step-mother had died in a carriage accident. Marcus regretted the fact that he had never reconciled with his father. He had intended to do so, but never dreamed the earl would die so suddenly. He returned to Rosemount expecting to find a very young step-sister. Instead he found a full grown lady. And a desirable one at that! <br />Julia Barclay had never met her step-bother, Marcus. She had been hidden in the shadows during the argument between father and son, so she knew his return would be awful. However, she had not expected him to return so soon! Julia had the house filled with stage friends and one big room was converted into a stage for rehearsing until they left on tour next month. <br />Knowing how Marcus felt about actors, she quickly gave her friends \\"roles\\" of servants to play while Marcus was at Rosemount. Everyone, real servants included, thought it great fun! This way, her friends could rehearse whenever Marcus was out of the house and, most importantly, they would have a roof over their heads for the next month. Julia never expected to become attached to Marcus though. <br />***** Oh, this book is a DELIGHTFUL read! And there is a little more going on than I wrote. I read this story non-stop. The stage friends were not used to being servants, so they made many large and small mistakes. Therefore, there are a lot of amusing situations mixed in with the romance. I do not see how anyone could be disappointed with this story! I loved it! *****	2002-07-08

However, Cassandra doesn't know that. She thinks of herself as a child who just can't do anything right, because the adults in her life (who are suppose to know these things) keep sending her that message by the way they speak to her. <br />When her room needed to be picked up, her mother said that Cassandra was a messy girl. Cassandra stored that message in her mind...she was a messy girl. <br />When her art teacher told her to paint a picture of a house and a tree with seven red flowers and one yellow bee, she started by painting a magnificent tree that took all the room - none was left for the bee. Her little painting took on a life of its own and colorful images began to flow onto the canvas, as she became lost in her own imagination. Instead of admiring the beauty, talent, and self- statement of Cassandra's painting, her teacher scolded her and said she was incorrigible. Cassandra stored that message in her mind...she was incorrigible.<br />As this story unfolds Cassandra finds comfort, and learns a special secret about herself, from an unexpected source - her very own Angel! A truly beautiful one too! One who comes complete with everything a little girl thinks of when she thinks of angels: lovely soft wings, a golden crown, and a brilliant wondrous light. And what was the secret? It was the truth - the truth of what Cassandra really was. <br />This beautifully illustrated book, and the lessons found within its pages, will affect change and inspire parents and children everywhere. Perhaps the next time you speak to your child, you will speak as if the very Angels were listening.<br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson	2002-07-08

Dr. Abby MacKenzie worked with the firm \\"Los Angeles Mental Health Associates\\". She helped treat the firefighters, cops, and such, that need assistance in dealing with trauma. Her first patient of the day would have been a cop who had accidentally killed an innocent bystander. She walked at work to find the officer dead in her office. Unable to cope, he had committed suicide. The horrible scene burned into her mind and Abby took it as failure on her part. Her boss forced her to take a three month sabbatical (with pay). She fled to an apple orchard. Harvesting was about to begin. The idea was to work very hard all day so she would be exhausted at night and have no dreams. <br />Dr. Jake Templeton was a highly respected cardiologist. His nine year old daughter, Stacey, had changed since the car accident that killed her mother two years before. Wanting her to be around those who love her, Jake had her living with his brother's family at Templeton Orchard. he spent every weekday at the hospital and every weekend with his daughter. It was obvious Stacey was hiding something. Yet no one had been able to get through to her. The LAST thing Jake wanted was a broken psychologist near his daughter! <br />***** Here is a wonderful story that shows how love can heal. The author hooked me immediately and have co-characters that I could not help but care for. In my opinion, this story is 100% perfect! I highly recommend it to all! *****	2002-07-08

The new game titled \\"Tolemac Wars III\\" was the hottest on the market. Most of the virtual game players chose to play the part of the male unknown warrior. Gwen had been sucked into a previous version of the game (see Virtual Desire) and had told Neil about it. Because of this, Neil timed everything in hope of doing the same. He never REALLY expected it to work though. But it did! <br />Ardra of the Fortress of Ravens guarded the ice for the Selaw. Her lifemate, Tol, was grievously ill. Tol's brother, Ralen, had been sent to find the Goddess of Darkness, leaving Ardra in a horrible lurch. When Tol died, the land, not to mention her son, would be threatened. When attacked, a man appeared out of nowhere and rescued her, but lost his riches in doing so. Lien (a.k.a. Neil) claimed to be a retired warrior, from beyond the ice, turned merchant and on a pilgrimage. He did not fight well enough to be a warrior, in her opinion, but the snake tatoo on his arm was an omen. She needed him if she had any hope of succeeding in her upcoming quest. <br />**** I had to leave A LOT out of the synopsis or it would have been three times as long! Much more is going on than I wrote, but I fear giving away something vital. Neil and Ardra are the main characters, as you can tell, and their budding romance is complicated to say the least. Author Ann Lawrence added several interesting co-characters also, both good and evil. Back stabbing people surround the couple and few can be trusted. This story mixes excitement, adventure, romance, and fantasy together and creates an awesome story that will definitely entertain its readers! BRAVA! ****	2002-07-08

This time the story focused mainly on Rachel O'Malley, a trauma psychologist, and Captain Cole Parker, a fireman. One of Rachel's old patients witnessed a murder and then disappeared. Marcus, Quinn, and Lisa help with the investigation. A flood had surged through the area, making the task difficult. <br />As the community began to pull itself together, a school shooting occurred. Worse, there was a lin from the school tragedy to the murder. <br />Rachel and Cole stay busy as they try to help so many grieving people. At the same time, though, the O'Malley family was going through their own rough time. Jennifer was dying. <br />*** Unlike the others of the series, this book focused a lot on depression. That was inevitable considering Rachel's profession. However, in my opinion, there was far too little joy in the story. I found myself having to take long breaks from reading for fear it would spill over into my personal life. Therefore, I read a couple other books (during my long breaks) to counter all the gloom. <br />Author Dee Henderson showed remarkable talent in the writing since I ended up reacting that way. I FELT the moods of the characters and cared deeply for them. Yet I can only hope that the next book in the O'Malley series (Stephen's story) will be more upbeat. ***	2002-07-08

People believed his name to be Natas Sivel. He killed mainly women. His victims' bodies were crushed, the heart drained of blood, and not a single outside wound. He almost had Maddie. But her father, Cassidy, saved her in time. While Natas was too weak from the battle, the police imprisoned him...away from the other prisoners. Now, one year later, the killer escaped! <br />Natas Sivel was really a demon. He was kept buried, asleep, under an oak tree called The Protector, in a music box. But someone hated Cassidy Christopher enough to dig it up and release the demon held within. The demon's sole purpose was to destroy Cassidy, the property owner, by destroying the women he loved. <br />Maddie and Cassidy had a psychic connection. Cassidy's friend, Officer Kevin Sheridan (who had been first on the scene with Maddie a year ago) called it \\"hocus pocus stuff\\". The only other person with a connection to the Christophers was Maddie's best friend, Robyn Warren. When the demon went after Maddie again, she called Robyn. Robyn got Cassidy to go to his daughter while she jumped on a plane and flew toward them. <br />The demon saw the attraction between Robyn and Cassidy. He saw them fall in love. So the demon wanted Robyn, as well as, Maddie. Only their love could save them and put the demon back inside the music box, to sleep. <br />**** WOW! Here is a dark romance book.

Conrad of Montferrat, the King of Jerusalem, has just been assassinated. <br />Rashid al-Din Sinan was called the Old Man of the Mountain. He was determined that King Richard would be the next target of the fida'i. He sent a special assassin to do the job. One he had been training since birth for a special occasion. Sinan sent his own daughter, Zahirah. <br />Zahirah was foiled on her first attempt by a Captain. She soon managed to situate herself in the palace to await another chance. The more she stayed in the Captain's presence though, the more she began to doubt the things she had been taught. If the other \\"Frankish infidels\\" were anything like Captain Montborne, then they were not the heartless barbarians she had been led to believe. <br />Sebastian, Earl of Montborne, was one of King Richard's trusted officers. He was a major role in the war against \\"the Muslim infidels\\". He refused to believe the assassin that got away was but a random event. Sebastian quickly found himself in a game of deep intrigue as he guarded the woman in his protection and his king! <br />***** A very believable plot that captured my attention immediately. The book is well written and has only a few co-characters to detract from the main hero and heroine. Everything is straight forward and no fill-ins to take up pages, because there is no need. So much is going on that time just seemed to fly by as I read! It is also obvious that the author spent a lot of time researching her book. I learned many customs of the country and about some of the King Richard's men from that time. During the story, the author used language that today's reader could understand easily, such as game of Chess and how it looks today. However, that does not mean she did not do her research! In the back the author tells the true words used for the game and the correct description. This way, the reader is never distracted by the unknown while the story is read. Don't miss this one! A remarkable book by one of today's most talented writers! *****	2002-07-02

Since Emily got her story told in this one, I hope Swift-Foot will be the main focus of the next. <br />Susan Edwards made the story even more realistic by letting characters from a previous story make an appearance. Each book is a story in itself, so the reader does not have to had read any of the others to enjoy this novel. However, by having read them, I feel as though I am a part of each family. This entire series ROCKS! Don't miss out! ****	2002-07-02

But regardless of this, there is something deep within Syn-Jern that keeps him going, driving him, and not letting him give up, no matter how much he wants to. He has been stripped of his title, shunned by all that knew him, killed in self-defense, framed for a murder he didn't commit, and sent to a place that death would be have been preferable: The Labyrinth. This is a prison from which no man returns in his right mind, if he returns at all. <br />When the end of Syn-Jern's 10-year sentence at The Labyrinth comes and goes without his release, he knows he's never meant to leave there alive and somehow manages to escape.

At the young age of eleven, Carolyn White was the sole survivor of her caravan. She had watched her loved ones as they died from a cholera epidemic. Deep into depression, Carolyn wandered, hopelessly lost and began talking to animals and trees. But it was the little \\"whirlwind\\" that saved her. It seemed alive and wanted her to follow. It led her to a sixteen year old Crow named Lone Arrow. He helped Carolyn escape a bear by entering a sacred treasure cave. He warned her to take nothing. The treasure in the cave was cursed. Then he escorted her safely to a nearby fort. Neither forgot the other. <br />Eight and a half years later ... <br />Carolyn had been adopted by a kind couple in Virginia City, Montana Territory. But luck had been bad for them. They would soon lose their land if they did not pay the bank soon. Carolyn realized that unless she returned the gold arrow head she had taken from the sacred cave, all would be lost. Thus she traveled back to the Bighorn Mountains and into Lone Arrow's life again. <br />Lone Arrow, like his father before him, was the speaker and protector of the mountains. He was the chosen one to guard the sacred treasure cave. His guide was the spirit of the mountain who took the form of a small whirlwind. Lone Arrow wanted Carolyn as his wife, but did not trust her. She insisted he take her back to the cave and would not say why. He thought she wanted to steal the gold from the mountain spirit. A battle between his love and honor began. <br />***** This story was enchanting from the beginning! I hated to see the book end! The story focused on the main couple and there was little distraction from other sources. This is as a story should be!

It is obvious the author of this novella highly enjoys his work. In fact, she got written permission to use a poem written by Wilde in 1876. He was born in 1854 and died in 1900. The poem was left unfinished. <br />The story is mainly about a woman named Carina, in our present time. She had written over half a novel before setting it aside. Her self centered husband completed it with much help from Carina. But when it hit the best-seller list (with only his name as author of the book) he divorced Carina and left her in much scandal! Having been mentally abused for so long and then to lose everything, Carina planned on suicide. First, she would see the grave of her favorite poet, Oscar Wilde! <br />With such a vivid imagination (and I wonder about Carina's sanity often as I read) she let her mind drift to the past to meet the man she adored so much. His ghost began to appear to her while she was awake in present day. During sleep she was in his time of history. I (as the reader) was left to wonder if Carina was really with Wilde or if she imagined it all. <br />I found the story to be choppy, due to all the bouncing around, but the plot intriguing. I believe any fan of poetry would like this tale. Not just fans of Wilde's either! If you find yourself often reading Poe, Frost, or others, you would dearly love this novella! ****	2002-07-02

Her sister's husband was a philandering, spendthrift, and a vile man. Therefore, Daphne never wished to marry! Daphne went to \\"GrandPapa\\" to live, since she could not stand being within her sister's home, Lawson Manor, any longer. The ten years with her grandfather, the Fifth Earl of Stanford, were happy ones. Lord Stanford was like a father to Daphne. He had been the person to give her a soft red Moroccan leather journal in which to record her memories. It had been the first of many journals through the years. Writing helped Daphne sort-out her troubles. However, now Lord Stanford was telling her she MUST wed, due to a clause in her father's will. She must marry or lose her inheritance. <br />Daphne met Lord Alexander \\"Alex\\" Heathercott in the park when her large dog, Nelson, cornered him. Fearing the attention of any man, she left quickly. But Alex was obsessed in locating the beauty. He was a well known rogue who had no desire to marry, but WAS currently looking for a new mistress. Alex was determined it would be her. He DID NOT realize Daphne planned on letting her GrandPapa believe her to be Alex's latest conquest, without actually becoming it, so GrandPapa Would think her too ruined for marriage! <br />***** There is much I am having to leave out. I do not want to give anything away or ruin the story. Daphne's Uncle Gideon plays the perfect villain. I hated him immediately. It is one of the traits I love about author Patricia Oliver, she can make her characters seem so real to the reader! I was not thrilled with Alex, at first. However, that quickly changed as he got involved with Daphne. If you are thinking of purchasing this Regency, do not hesitate.

Falling asleep on a hillside she awakens in the Ireland of Brandubh mac Dougal. Tall, dark and handsome, Brandubh is the substance of dreams. After sharing a bit of conversation with him, she once again finds herself back in present day Ireland. <br />Back in the Ireland of the past, Brandubh consults his mother on some way to bring Eibhlin back. In the short time they had contact, he realizes she is the woman for him, so much so that he gives up any idea of offering for Caoimhe, as he had planned. He is disappointed to learn he must wait until Samhain, four months away, to have a chance of seeing Eibhlin again. Mean while, upon returning from battling Viking mercenaries, the news of Caoimhe's death greets him. <br />Samhain--Eibhlin returns to Craglea where she once again meets Brandubh. Only this time it seems she is here to stay as her car disappears and she discovers the year is now 1013 AD Determined to find her way back home, Eibhlin consents to go with Branddubh to Kincora so she can consult with his mother. There, Evie is put under the protection of Brandubh's parents by the king. Returning with them to their home, she is upset by a confrontation with Caoimhe sister, Moria, who bears a striking resemblance to Evie's mother, even sharing the same name. Time passes and tension builds as Caoimhe's relations seek revenge against Brandubh for her death. Eibhlin awaits the next solstice, when she can attempt to return to the future, spending her time as healer to Brandubh's parent's people. Will Brandubh be able to convince her before then to not return home, but stay with him? <br />*** \\"The Raven's Lady\\" is a wonderful time-travel romance. There is plenty of action and even a little mystery, but the main focus is on the romance. The growth of the relationship between Brandubh and Eibhlin and the choices Evie has to make, create a marvelous story. Even though I find stories of Ireland's past sad, I am glad to have read this one. My one complaint--I really prefer books that have all of the story in English, including the names. ***	2002-07-02

However, if a book has not captured me in the first chapter, much less half way through it, I feel the need to move on. On a side note, this novel is a follow-up to Barbara Delinsky's book, \\"Fulfillment\\". All-in-all, I recommend it for some great reading. ***	2002-07-01

Her hair is beautiful and her smile is radiant, but she has grown to believe that she is ugly because of the unfeeling taunts she painfully endures.<br />As the story unfolds, we discover the magical way Rosa is helped to overcome the merciless mockery and ridicule of others to find her true self...her own inner beauty. Deep in a forest, where Rosa fled to cry, she is given three gifts by a wondrous and melodious voice emanating from a luminous clear pool. These gifts - courage, confidence, and compassion - enable her to accept herself and to share her new found knowledge with others. <br />***** I highly recommend Little Squarehead, not only for those children who suffer teasing, but also for those children who DO the teasing. Reading it with your child could also be valuable, because there are significant and important lessons to be learned within its pages. This book is inspiring and refreshing, and the illustrations are colorful, bold, and beautifully done.

He wants things to stay the same forever, and he doesn't understand what is so great about brilliantly colored wings and being able to fly. Isn't he happy right now? Maybe, just maybe, this idea of becoming a butterfly is a bit over-rated; besides, he is a little bit afraid of change. <br />***** In this book the positive aspects of change are delicately and tenderly introduced to young children through the story itself and through the beautiful illustrations. Indeed, just looking at Aries Cheung's creative artwork is an adventure in itself. Raindrops glisten on bright green leaves, and adorable little Ladybugs scurry from one leaf to the next as little Anew munches happily along. In this setting children are able to explore their personal feelings about changes in their own lives in an endearing and heartwarming way. After all, Anew has a very wise friend named Faith who guides him along - just as parents guide their children through new situations.<br />Wings of Change is an adorable book with a wonderful message that is presented in charming and humorous ways.

If you were not born yet in 1939 when the world was in an upheaval, reading this book provides a glimpse of what Communism is about. You quickly understand the reason for the Chinese Communist revolution in China in 1945; and why the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The first page of this book gives you instant answers. <br />They wrote that the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) was a country built by Communists since 1917, and whose aim was to establish a worldwide Communist regime. \\"(Karl) Marx,\\" they also wrote, \\"believed, without questioning the results, that a Communist revolution should be worldwide.\\" Obviously, at this writing, that has failed with the dissolution of the USSR into the new Russian Federation. <br />So if you like a bit of military history and how governments function, this is a brief but most interesting internal look at Communism inside the former Soviet Union and its different phases of life. The author, The Raven, born in Baku City, in Azerbaijan in what once was the USSR, writes this short but very informative book that gives you a look at what happened after the Communists came into power in 1917. He tells of the pitfalls and why the USSR failed in its quest to establish Communism in Finland when the Russians went to war against the Finns in 1939-40. He also explains how a lack of communication was so costly to the Red Army when it was losing so badly to the Germans in the early days of World War II and the enemy was knocking on Moscow's doors. As a ten-year-old, I can remember the war between Russia and Finland in our newspaper headlines, and especially World War II when the Germans were trying to take over Russia and the fighting around Stalingrad in the bitter Russian winter.<br />The Raven also writes about his health problems in his youth created by a doctor, who treated him incorrectly, which led to a partial loss of hearing and damage to his nervous system. Of equal importance is some of the unfair treatment of The Raven in later years by one particular dean in his quest for an education. Specifically, The Raven tells how a single unanswered question evoked a negative response from the head of the linguistics department concerning answers to all other questions on the exam. The Dean suddenly decided that The Raven's previous answers were wrong, and offered new questions for The Raven to answer. Fortunately, The Raven managed to transfer into computer studies and received much better treatment despite living in inadequate housing and crowded situations. <br />It's a very revealing book and I would highly recommend it, especially to students and historical buffs who are interested in the old Soviet Union and the new Russian Federation. A four-star effort for certain.	2002-07-01

This colorful book allows us to enter the creative mind of a little boy who tries to delay his bedtime each night by playing a special game called: What If? Silver and gold snowflakes that sparkle like diamonds and taste like peppermint ice cream...What If? What about dogwood trees? Ever wish you could really pick a puppy from the branches of a dogwood tree? <br />What If focuses on the creative imaginations of a child, and after reading this book you will never again look at many common things in the same old way. Clouds, butterflies, teddy bears, flowers, trees, snowflakes, stars and many other things take on special characteristics and a life of their own...through a child's eyes.

The Tree tells of its history and the many things it has seen over its lifetime, as well as the wildlife it has seen and sheltered.

Children will also enjoy finding the many tiny surprises hidden within the pictures: A Butterfly, Dragonfly, Spotted Owl, Tree Frog, Mouse, Bald Eagle, Bark Beetle, and many others.<br />At the end of the story, there is an informative page about the Pacific Rain Forest that impressed me a great deal. After reading that page, I asked several children what country came to mind when they heard the words rain forests. Most of them mentioned Africa and one or two said South America. They envisioned a tropical climate with hot, humid jungles, big broadleaf plants, monkeys, and brightly colored birds.

A temperate rain forest that is cool and wet, filled mostly with cone bearing trees, and stretches along the coast from Southern Oregon to the Gulf of Alaska. <br />I cannot say enough good things about The Tree.

Randolph Dunford, the sixth Baron Dunford, was set upon by thieves sent by a pirate bent on revenge. His escape was aided by Miss Harriet J. Wilson. She designed and fashioned fine jewelry. Because of her occupation, her reputation had to remain unstained. However, her name worked against her a bit. One of the most sought after light skirts used the same name with a slightly different spelling, Harriette Wilson. She begged the man she had helped NOT to tell her his name. The incident was to be forgotten. Randolph was unable to do this. Since Harriet did not know who he was, he became her best, but unseen, customer. <br />Harriet came home one day to learn her cousin, Anna Gwynn, had given a customer a brooch that Lord Dunford had ordered and prepaid for. The customer had been Dunford's mistress. That was fine since she was the person it had been made for; however, Anna had given a copy instead of the real piece of jewelry and the lady had already left the area for the next six weeks! Fearing she may go to prison for fraud, Harriet went to give the jewelry to Lord Dunford. As luck would have it, he, too, was out of town. <br />Lord Dunford was in Leicestershire, at his grandmother's request, to pull his brother, Burton, out of depression. The brothers did not care for each other, but called a fragile truce. When Lord Dunford ran into Harriet, he was able to begin courting her. Knowing what Harriet thought of the reputation of \\"Lord Care-For-Naught\\", he let her call him Mr. Randolph. The lies of omission began! At the same time, someone was trying to kill him and his brother thought Rand was out to tumble Anna, who HE had become fond of! <br />***** Martha Kirkland had written a wonderful work of Regency in this story! Much happening to keep readers turning pages swiftly! Highly recommended! *****	2002-06-18

Once a year, the villagers sacrificed one of their virgin females. <br />Alizon was chosen twelve years before \\"St. George the Dragonslayer\\" appeared - from the twenty-first century - to kill the dragon. Unknown by those in Markesew, Alizon was the mysterious crone to whom they delivered their drugged virgin to yearly. However, no female since Alizon had been fed to \\"Belch\\". The virgins lived on Devil's Mount, surviving on the sheep the villagers often sent to feed the dragon daily. <br />George was a professional wrestler. His stage name was St. George. He was staying with his sister and niece while an injury from a match healed. His sister convinced George to let her hypnotize him, in an attempt to help George relax. Never before had it worked on him. This time, though, he \\"awakened\\" to find himself dubbed \\"St. George the Dragonslayer\\" and sent to Devil's Mount. <br />George met the crone with mixed feelings. Even though she wore a concealing cloak, he knew she was not as old as she tried to make him believe. She granted George three chances to kill Belch. If he failed the third time, he must leave Devil's Mount. Her only companion seemed to be one male servant and several ghosts of the virgins sacrificed before. George was supposed to slay the dragon. But the crone held all the cards and was winning his heart. <br />***** Be warned, books by Lisa Cach are very addictive! This story DEMANDED my attention from the first page.

Prince Godaka was the oldest of three sons born to the Khan. To decide which of the three princes would be the heir, each had a quest to perform. Godaka's quest was the hardest. He was \\"to find the greatest sword ever made.\\" His quest sent him to Falmore. <br />Lieutenant Quinn Malxcus was banned from the Guardsmen. She met a hard working street urchin, Aras, which she sort-of adopted as a squire. Her past haunted her. She longed to belong to the Guardsman units again ... someday, somehow. <br />Sir Nikolos Derathian was a Knight of Veeder. The dwarf, Bob, was his squire. The Knights of Veeder traveled the lands, fighting against injustice wherever they found it. <br />Turuth was one of the Northern Barbarians. He was a kilt-wearing warrior with the legendary \\"berserker rage\\". He was also learned in many forms of magic and considered an elementalist. <br />Zilthai was of the mysterious Anai race. He had amazing eye-sight and carried loud \\"thundersticks\\". <br />Most importantly, was Calanna. She had been the only daughter of the chieftain of the Nightingale Tribe. She was thrown out of all the tribes because she had a vision her people considered blasphemous. She was \\"The Child of Thirteen\\". <br />All were part of the prophecies. Only together did they have a chance to defeat \\"The Child of None\\". If they failed, the world was doomed. <br />***** A fascinating beginning to the trilogy!

It has immediate and wonderful eye appeal with all its bright colors and whimsical objects flying around on the cover...as if by magic. Then there is the button with the words, \\"Press Here To Start\\". What could be more appealing to a child - or an adult looking for a child's book? I was enchanted by this delightful new title from Illumination Arts: The Whoosh of Gadoosh. <br />The story follows best friends Jaimy and Jake as they find a home for a wacky, magical and mysterious woman named Gadoosh. She wears shabby shoes (magic of course) flipped inside out, has purple hair, and sells magic buttons from her cart which are to be worn over each child's heart. The laughter of a child causes Gadoosh to whoosh through the air, spreading her gift of laughter to everyone. The colors are eye-popping and the catchy rhyme is reminiscent of Dr. Seuss. <br />Laughter is often the best medicine, and children of every age will realize that when they put on their magic buttons and \\"Press Here to Start\\".

This book grabbed my attention from its powerful opening line: \\"The war in Vietnam was over for Daniel Schubert, but the war within his mind continued.\\" It then held my attention for all the rest of its 520 pages. I did not want to put it down and, at the same time, I did not want to finish the story. I was emotionally drawn deeply into the saga and was mesmerized by the depth of human emotion expressed by its author. He pulled no punches and he withheld no part of himself during this purging of his war time experiences. <br />This author, Richard C. Siebert, M.D., was a Navy surgeon in Vietnam during his tour of duty 1966 - 1967, and kept an extensive diary of the events that happened during that time in his life. He wrote of personal conflicts, the unbelievable chaos of a field hospital, and of the romance between himself and a woman, part French and part Vietnamese, who was also suspected of being a VC agent. It is written following his discharge and subsequent inability to rid himself of the mental pictures and disturbances caused by that war.<br />The Vietnam war has long been a source of mystery for me as I'm sure it has been for many people. I had heard of the anti-war protests and of the less than heroic homecomings experienced by our veterans. Reading this book gave me the perspective of someone who was willing to write about his experiences from the depth of his soul - both good and bad - as painful as they must have been. Reading this book will educate the readers about the horrors of war and, at the same time, make us believe that life goes on even during times when you think that it isn't possible.<br /> As the opening line stated, \\"The war in Vietnam was over for Daniel Schubert, but the war within his mind continued.\\" This story is beautiful, sensitive, and well written. It is full of adventure and romance and, as an added bonus, it tells us things about the Vietnam war and human emotions that we could never find in a history book. Interspersed throughout the book are drawings by the author himself of many of the places he saw while in Vietnam. I am happy to have been able to read this book, and I highly recommend it!  <br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson.	2002-06-04

In fact, they were my two personal favorites! Yet I also read about a drug bust, fairies, vampires, and a helpful ghost. <br />I began the book thinking I would read just one or two as I drifted off to sleep. Instead, I made the mistake of thinking \\"Oh, I'll just read the first paragraph of the next story and see what it will be about. I won't read it tonight though.\\" Needless to say, I read the entire novel before I allowed sleep to overcome me. Available in print or electronic form! Highly recommended! *****	2002-05-30

But Magister Andru realized that the young boy showed potential to surpass even the talents of magisters! Erek could become one of the rare master adepts! Andru feared for the boy because most noble families would rather murder their children or other family members than let them become a master adept. Lady Ivera was such a one. So Erek and Andru sought out a Commander in the Queen's Armies of the North! <br />Commander DiaVandryn was one of the Queen's best! Two of her men, Captain Ursyn and Captain Vlad, dwelled in her manor. They kept each other in trim and fighting form. Many plotted and were determined to have Queen Viianne dethroned.

Dia knew from experience the danger that the young lord was in. Thus began a perilous journey over mountains, plains, and sea. All the while evil tracked them from behind. Magical evil that sought the deaths of them all ... and eventually the Queen's. <br />***** Fantasy gets no better than this! K.G. McAbee [pulls] her readers into her magical realm, never to escape!

For fifty percent of the Perez Brother's General Store, Sean would protect his family, especially his daughter Marisa. <br />Hector was killed, shot while he slept. Sean managed to kill Felipe and Tito before they escaped. Carmen, Marisa's aunt, began making arrangements to have Marisa married off. Marisa rebelled because she wanted to provide for Chico, the insane man-child Hector had taken care of and she had become close friends with. Carmen wanted Chico gone. So Marisa conned Sean into marriage. <br />Baldomar Gomez also knew of the silver mine. He wanted Marisa and the mine as his own. If that meant killing Sean, that was no problem. <br />**** The only thing I did not understand in the book was that when Sean took Marisa out of the river, she cursed him in Spanish and he knew exactly what words she said. Yet for the rest of the book, he did not understand Spanish. Other than that, the book was very excellent. Marisa's lies kept digging her in deeper and deeper trouble. Of course, Sean was not likeable to me at first, but as he changed I began to change my mind. I stayed up well past my bedtime to finish this one. Great story! ****	2002-05-28

For twenty-eight year old Bridget Colleen Mulligan, the best and worst day of her life was the day of Granny Frye's funeral. She and her six-year-old son, Jacob, were the last of the family line. They lived in Tennessee. The bank would take Granny's trailer at the end of the month and they would be homeless. It was made worse when Bridget's employer/lawyer informed her that her husband Culley had not abandoned her all those years ago. In fact, he was dead. Only recently had Culley's mother, in Ireland, found out Culley had married just before he died. Fiona Mulligan begged Bridget to come to Ireland, so she could hold in her arms the grandson she had not known existed. That fateful day Bridget lost all of her family in America and found a new family in Ireland. <br />Fiona fell in love with Bridget and Jacob upon first site! Maggie, Culley's younger sister, did too. The only one who did not was the older brother, Riley. Riley believed Bridget to be a fraud. Culley would never have wed a woman in America when he had a fiancé waiting for him in Ireland! But Jacob was the spitting image of Culley. And Riley could soon feel an attraction to Bridget that could have easily seduced his brother. And the woman was able to hear the voices! <br />Caislean Dubh was the name of the castle that overlooked the land. It was the Mulligan ancestral home, but no one had lived within the walls due to \\"The Curse\\" in a long time. Only Culley had heard the strange whispers that came from the castle. And only upon his death had Riley been able to hear them. No one else ever heard them, until Bridget. Why did she hear them? What could it mean? <br />***** Author Deb Stover spiced up this romance novel with just a dash of magic. At times I felt as if the past and the present were one and the same. I found it delightful to see a strong modern heroine in the haunting setting of a gothic tale, taming a stubborn man who fit the dark setting so well.

Each chapter is like a short story. A few characters show up once late in the book, yet none of the stories have any closure. Just people making out with other people or with themselves (that is as tactfully as I could think to phrase it), getting drunk and complaining about their lives (but never seriously considering doing anything to change), and smoking. <br />* I seldom give bad reviews, but I cannot think of anything good to say about this novel.

It was not to be. <br />He was THE Senior Captain T'vahr! Known by many less friendly titles. He was created by the Empire. He had been genetically manipulated. Keeping his identity hidden from her, he let her call him Rhis Vanur. He had escaped from the Ycsko and needed to complete his mission.

Chaz had been one of the Fleet's officers that often hunted his ship and caused him endless troubles. <br />Sully had rescued her for more than one reason. The only one he told her of, though, was his need for her knowledge of the system. Chaz had the inside information, know-how, and codes that was needed to complete his extremely dangerous mission. <br />Sully's other reason was personal. His feelings for her! However, Sully had a deep, dark secret. Anyone who found out, even his closest friends, would instantly loath him! To gain Chaz's heart he planned to keep his secret from her forever.

There is a couple of times it slowed down too much for my personal taste, but not enough to ever dampen my interest. Everytime I thought I knew all of Sully's personal secret, I was proved wrong. <br />The author added spicy co-characters, a few of which are almost as fascinating as the main characters!

Each character has their own quirks and personalities, that readers can easily come to care for. The only problem I have found with author Linnea Sinclair is that she cannot write fast enough for me.

Instead, he found two, Alea and her sister, Kitarisa. Only with Kita's help are he and his men able to get the princess they had been paid to save out of the fortress. Yet, Assur cannot leave such a bold and noble lady behind, and returns for her. Bringing the two ladies home finds their father less than grateful, since he now has to deal with the unwanted Kita when he had thought to be rid of her. <br />Assur offers to marry her, but before he can claim her, Kita's father seeks to spirit her away to a witch's coven and steal her lands. Only a brave friend saves her from doom. When Kitarisa does join her new lord, he is much more than she dreamed. They undertake the perilous journey home, but soon are called upon to go on a quest to stop the evil plans of the witches and evil lords. When Kita is called upon to rescue her husband, her journey takes her into the heart of the very place she sought to avoid, and calls upon her to learn more about herself than she ever dreamed. Yet, in the end, victory is only achieved by great sacrifice, and the price may separate Assur and his beloved forever. <br />*** If you love action driven plots, this will suit you to a tee. Those who prefer more character development and relationship-based stories may have a hard time. Despite this, it is clear what that Kita is among the most noble of heroines, and the love between her and Assur is a powerful force. This is a well written promising debut. ***	2002-05-24

At the end of it Var was defeated, but not destroyed. Power was considered too tempting for any mortal to keep. So each Seer wrote out his knowledge. No one was allowed to share their knowledge or spells with another. Then it was all joined together and hidden in a safe place, under guard. It became known as The Chaos Scroll. It was the only known protection against Var. Master Elzabar was a powerful Seer. He had a vision and a prophecy was made! <br />Var had learned the secret for eternal life. After four hundred years, most of the Seers were dead, and Var returned to Poppan Valley for revenge! He began by kidnaping Briana, a married woman whom he coveted. Her husband was Zernue, the Keeper of the Valley. Their children would embark on a dangerous journey for help against Var and the dark riders. Laila and Tokar, as foretold, would battle magic, demons, and ultimately Var, himself. The world's fate would rest in their young hands! <br />**** A fanciful tale of magic! Personally, I believe this book is perfect for teens and young adults. However, all ages will find themselves intrigued. Lots of colorful characters and creatures to spark the imagination.

This story is written by (and about) Elrod McBugle and his weird adventures at Greenwater Junior High. It may be the first of a series. I can only hope so since I enjoyed it sooooo much! <br />It all begins on Elrod's first day at Greenwater Junior High. His best friend is nick-named Scoopy. The two are simply trying to live through the school year. NOT an easy task for Elrod. Elrod manages to doodle fine artwork (that the principal confiscates for himself), make and sell a super delicious new type of gum (that has just a side effect or two), make friends with the school bullies (surely all those students will heal without too many permanent scars), win the talent show (and forever be remembered for it), catch a killer, and more! (Though I still do not know how the gym floor got to be so blinding a color, but perhaps that mystery will be solved in a sequel.) <br />For now, know that this is a wonderful and hilarious book for all ages! So go purchase a whole bunch of Slurpy Gulp, put up your feet, and enjoy the latest novel by Jeff Strand (who I still believe to be just a little bit strange!)	2002-05-24

Authors \\"The Raven\\" and Marie Claire collaborate in RUSSIAN EXPERIENCES: LIFE IN THE FORMER USSR AND POST-SOVIET RUSSIA to provide an insider's view of life in Russia. The first chapter provides a brief explanation of communism and the pitfalls of such a governmental system. The second section reveals the first hand struggles of one man living under communism and in post-Communist Russia. <br />Readers need to realize that the personal sections of RUSSIAN EXPERIENCES are penned by an English as a second language author, with the idiosyncrasies and word choices that accompany such a writing style. Only a hundred pages, length seems to have dictated the depth that narrative reaches and readers who seek a truly personal narrative will be left wanting.<br />Nevertheless, RUSSIAN EXPERIENCES provides a simple yet concise explanation of communism for younger generations who do not remember the Cold War and associated propaganda. It also gives readers a personal feel for living in Russia during the communist regime. RUSSIAN EXPERIENCES would be perfect required reading for high school government classes.

Brandy barely remembered the time she was little and her mother had left her at the door of the parsonage with only her trunk. When she began a young lady though, Father Brown died and Brandy became the one in charge of the five younger orphans. There was no money, no one coming to replace Father Brown, and soon the parsonage would be closed. Brandy had to do something! She had promised Father Brown to take care of the other five. When she spotted an ad from Sam Owens for wife, she never hesitated to write him in hope of being chosen. She was.

Contessa Caterina Donati was all alone. Her father had drowned at sea, en route home to America, shortly after she married Conte Pietro Donati. Pietro's idea of making love was painful and humiliating. Thus the short marriage was not blissful. Then Pietro met an untimely death. Young Caterina was left with no one to turn to, little money due to Pietro, and only the Donati villa with its barren fields to go. Knowing all within the seaside village of Belmare would hate her, not only for being an American but also for having the name Donati, Kate went to The Villa Falcone. <br />Kate was determined to work the land and bring life back to the fields and the village. However, the Donatis had brought ruin to Belmare and its people. Few would work for \\"the Contessa.\\" Those few who would, did so only on the condition that no one from the village knew they did. Only one man, Roberto Vela, was as determined as Kate to make the fields prosper. Kate was attracted to him from the beginning, but danger lurked around Kate and Roberto kept too many secrets. And whenever harm came to Kate, he was suddenly there. Was he to be her savior or her executioner? <br />***** When I found the name Evelyn Rogers on the cover of this book I was ecstatic!

But in rare moments of rage or terror she could feel something snap inside her and incredible things happened. Mina had been an orphan for years and the only person in the world who cared about her was Abby, her best friend. Both worked long hours in a factory for small wages in hopes of someday paying off their Contracts of Indenture, a place to sleep, and perhaps one meal a day. But it all changed during a moment of fear. The iron indentured collar Mina wore could no mute the waves of magic Mina released and the Hounds were sent out to hunt her. <br />Duncan RiDahn used to be a nobleman. Now he was but a crippled old man in a wheelchair who begged for money, squatted in an abandoned theater, and was Mina's only hope of survival. Duncan felt the shock wave of Mina's power and knew the evil Queen Rhiannon would send out the Hounds. He and one of his students, Bryan, rescued her and began to teach her. <br />The Fae (faery) were usually human-like, but came in two different types. The Seelie could control fire and air, heat and light. The Unseelie could control earth and water, cold and night. Mina was half human, half unseelie. Duncan taught her how to use her powers to hide from the royal family and survive. The royal family was seelie and thought they had either killed at the unseelie or turned them into Knights and Hounds. With Mina's presence felt, the hunt was on for her and all the unseelie faelings feared being found. <br />But Duncan knew more about Mina than he told. Mina was not only unseelie, she was a dyana!

She was dangerous to everyone! But Duncan's love for Mina refused to let him kill her, no matter what! <br />***** It gets no better than this!

Patience Ballard had grown up with Philip \\"Pip\\" Yorke, someday to be the Earl of Royston, and Richard Cavendish, a second son in the nobel Cavendish line. From the age of eight Patience thought of golden haired Pip as the handsome one she would someday marry. She considered dark haired Richard to be her most dependable, reliable, and closest friend. <br />At seventeen, the way she viewed them had not changed. From the beginning, I, as the reader, knew of her feelings. I also knew Richard had loved Patience all those years without her ever suspecting. He hid it well. Being only a second son, Richard felt he had nothing to offer a wife, especially since his older brother was so irresponsible. Thus a love triangle was set up. <br />Having read many such plots, I worried that this meant the heroine would be a spoiled, empty headed lady that I would want to strangle and the hero would be someone I would want to slap sense into before directing his attention to someone much more deserving. However, I was only around chapter three and recalled how much I enjoyed this author's previous books. So I decided to give it just a few more pages. That is the last thing I recall thinking to myself until I had finished reading the entire book! <br />\\"The game we call Solitaire in the United States has been known in England for many years as Patience, the virtue most required for successful play.\\" The story opened with that quote and I could not get it out of my mind during the whole book. How witty of the author, Elisabeth Fairchild! How delightful for me!<br />Patience was NOT the idiot I thought she would be. She was just blinded by her childhood dreams. Many people have been that way over someone or something before. Instead of hating the book, I LOVED it!  Be warned, if you HATE blind devotion, avoid this plot! Otherwise, enjoy! As for myself, I am happy I kept reading. I found myself reading the last chapter several times because of how marvelous it left me feeling. I plan to tell everyone to read this story!	2002-05-07

In doing so, Ry's whole outlook on life changed, along with his priorities. They all join forces. <br />The Dragons were released from the Veil and possessed the bodies of powerful people. Through their dark magic Calimeeka's fate was sealed. Using the lives and souls of those who dwelled within the city as fuel, a new city emerged. It would not be long before the Dragons would turn their sights beyond the city to the rest of the world. <br />Luercas remained a curious puzzle in the first book. In this one we learned why he was helping Danya. I can say no more on that without giving away too much. <br />... I thought this one to be as awesome as the last! However, again, the reader is left hanging in the middle of a vital second. Consider yourself warned that even though this author is fantastic, it is best NOT to begin reading this trilogy until all three books are released! Unless you have all three before you begin, you will not be satisfied and will probably end up angry. If you purchase all three at once and go from one straight into the next, you are in for a treat! The author weaves a fabulous tapestry of magic that will leave you breathless! ...	2002-05-02

The Covington Ladies and their white farmhouse are back! When I saw this newest book I was overjoyed, and stepped back into the lives of Amelia, Grace, and Hannah, without missing a beat. From the Heart of Covington opens with Grace finding Hannah in tears. Hannah's daughter, Laura, was in a hospital in Puerto Rico with severe injuries. She had been living on a houseboat with her boyfriend, and a hurricane had dashed the boat to bits on a reef. The boyfriend was dead, and Laura was emotionally devastated with no place to go to recuperate. <br />The ladies took Laura in and surrounded her with love and warmth, teaching a lesson of triumph over the depths of despair following the death of a loved one. From The Ladies, Laura learned how to live again, even though she felt that her life was hopeless. She even became a vital part of Covington and the beautiful gardens being built by Hannah.<br />When Grace discovered that she was diabetic I felt her dismay, because she is a wonderful cook on whom everyone depends for social events. Then when Amelia had a New York display of her fabulous pictures, I was overjoyed for her. The characters in this book are so real that they become like old friends and I find myself worrying about them, laughing with them and anticipating their next adventure.<br />***** I have such happy times reading about the ongoing lives of Amelia, Hannah, and Grace, that I absolutely hated to finish this book. Many of the scenes are so descriptive and beautiful that this book not only entertains the reader with the adventures of The Ladies, but also pleases the senses with such beautiful visual images that I often read a passage twice just to picture the scene. Joan Medlicott is masterful with her use of personification and metaphors, and I can hardly wait for the next book about The Ladies. Please let there be another, because I miss them the minute I turn the last page. *****<br />Reviewed by Ruth Wilson.	2002-05-01

Lady Sophie Dane fled London and the man she had eloped with (and then divorced). The scandal would follow her forever. Sophie did not care. She never intended to return. She became the companion of a young French woman named Honorine Fortier. Things were grand for years. But then Honor announced they were traveling to London! <br />Caleb Hamilton was the illegitimate son of Lord Will Hamilton. Will's second son, and heir, was Trevor. Will had often visited Caleb as he grew into adulthood, but a stroke ended that. When Caleb approached to check on his father, Trevor refused to allow him entry. <br />All of London buzzed with gossip of \\"The Imposter\\" son and of Sophie's sudden reappearance. But the Ton did not know the half of it! Muddy waters ran much deeper in the Hamilton household then anyone could possibly guess. And Sophie's family was trying to push her into accepting Trevor as her betrothed. <br />*** That is all I can tell without spoiling the plot. There is MUCH more to the story than I stated above. This book starts out with a simmer, slowly builds up more steam, and ends with a bang. <br />On a personal note though, I did not like the Epilogue at all. All I can say is that this type of Epilogue will have no middle ground on the emotions of the readers. They will either love it or hate it! All-in-all, this is a book I can recommend to any who like Regency Romances. *** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2002-04-30

In Crimson Kiss, the readers saw Meghann's story. Readers learned first hand all the horrors Meghann endured as she fought to escape him. In this book, we continue the story. <br />Lord Baldevar vowed to get Meghann back! Meghann would be the one to help him achieve the philosophers' stone. Meghann was pregnant with his child. Without his help, she would die. When it became obvious that she would allow herself and her unborn child to die instead of asking for his dark help, Simon intervened. To save the lives of her friends, she would spend time with him and allow him to aide her during the pregnancy. <br />While with Simon, Meghann slowly learned all about Simon's history. Fight as she may, she began to understand what made him become as he was. The more she learned, the more she slipped back under his spell! <br />***** Last book was Meghann's story. This book tells Lord Baldevar's side! As evil as Simon is, even I found myself soften toward him. Trisha Baker gives her characters life, figuratively speaking, and an uncanny depth that I longed to understand as I read. Highly recommended! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2002-04-30

He agreed to help find Cassandra a husband and then he would be done with them!

For four centuries, the great Houses of Sabir and Galweigh have battled for control of Calimekka. Each clan's wizards plot in shadows to revive the awful necromancies that once destroyed the world. <br />A son from the House of Sabir and a daughter from the House of Galweigh were to wed and end conflict. A young diplomat named Kait Galweigh uncovered a Sabir plot to ambush the entire House Galweigh during the wedding ceremony. She dared not tell how she discovered the plot though. She lived under \\"a curse\\" that made her Shift. The Shift changed her into a horrible monster wolf. Those of her kind were called Karnee. If her secret became known, even her own House would kill her. Worse, the House would kill her entire family as well! <br />A Sabir Karnee, Ry, had found Kait at the wedding and declared her for his own. Kait must flee Ry, all five of the Houses, wizards, the Scarred, and even ghosts of the long dead as she strived to complete a quest for the Mirror of Souls! <br />**** This book would be a five star book if the ending had been different. However, be forewarned, if you do not like a huge cliff hanger you can only do one of two things. Either avoid this trilogy or make sure you have all three books before you even begin reading! The story is amazing and you will read non-stop. But to end without book two on hand leaves the reader in a horrible lurch. No closure at all. ****	2002-04-23

My son was laughing loudly in his room as he read this book from the library. I just HAD to find out what was so funny. I swiped the book from under his nose and began to read. I probably would have gotten away with reading it and then replacing it without him ever knowing, except that I could not keep myself from laughing out loud any better than he had.

Precious Blossom's parents still lived in the age of tie-dye shirts, demonstrations, and living out of their wildly colored van. Neither understood business or money for bills. At twenty-one, Precious legally changed her name to Leigh Van Dolph. She had grown up like a gypsy and loved her parents and brother beyond anything else. But the responsibility fell on her shoulders to keep her brother out of trouble, her parents' bills paid (without their knowledge), as well as, her own. Needless to say, Leigh was a work-aholic. <br />Leigh's boss sent her to the small town of Amoteh, in Washington State. She was to somehow get Mikhail Stepanov to agree to have a Bella Sportswear shop in his resort. If she succeeded, she would receive a huge bonus. After paying her parents' medical bills, that would be a blessing! Armed with her determination and grit, she prepared for battle. However, she never saw Jarek Stepanov (Mikhail's younger brother) coming! He plowed through all her defenses and intended to claim her as his own! <br />***** For all the fans of Jayne Ann Krentz and Christina Skye, look this way!

Olivia \\"Livie\\" had been very young when she married Quinton Thorpe and became the Duchess of Brandhurst. For almost twenty-five years she lived with her husband's cruelty by shutting off all emotions. As the book opened, I learned Quinton had been murdered, stabbed in the back with a letter opener by an unknown person (while trying to kill Olivia), and Livie was still in shock. <br />Few knew the Duke had been murdered. Those few, which included Olivia, felt the Duke had gotten what he deserved. So the murder was covered up and kept quiet. The title fell to Andrew Thorpe, an American. Until he could settle his affairs and get to England, Livia was to be in charge. <br />Neville Thorpe, second in line for the title, was jealous. He stayed by his Aunt Olivia's side and took charge of everything in her for her. He used his time to plot and scheme ways of obtaining the title he so coveted. He was aided by Quinton's wicked valet, Antonio. Neville found Olivia to be easily controlled until ... <br />Clara Peabody was an advocate with the Ladies' National Association. She approached Olivia, a year after the Duke's death, about helping fight to help the suffering of the match factory ladies. Olivia's eyes opened to possibilities and she developed a backbone. <br />Willoughby Barnes was an unknown artist. Since his deceased father had worked in the Duke's garden, Will had grown up learning the trade. He was asked to design the garden around the Duke's burial plot. Out of money for paints, he agreed. There, Olivia and Will met and fell in love. Olivia felt true love for the first time. However, Livie was forty and a duchess while Will was in his twenties and a gardner. It could never work. <br />***** The author, Julie Beard, keeps the reader guessing as to who really murdered the Duke. At the same time, she succeeds in keeping romance, betrayal, compassion, and several wonderful sub-plots going in the story. Normally this would not work. However, Julie Beard MADE it work! Itall blends smoothly together and becomes as beautiful as Will's painting of Olivia! An enlightening and graceful story that I highly recommend to one and all! *****	2002-04-06

The Times asked Beanie to cover what became called the Tahoe Terror about the same time Skip asked her to help him solve the case. His boss, Sheriff Stoddard, was running for mayor and had begun putting pressure on Skip. The bottom line: solve the case quickly or lose your job. <br />At the same time Beanie was dealing with her daughter. Nona came home from her modeling career to spend Thanksgiving with her mother. Problem was she was bringing along her latest in a line of boyfriends. Beanie hated him on sight and so did Cruiser! <br />The bodies begin piling up and all seemed to be connected to the Tallis Corporation in some way. Tallis was trying to build a resort on Cave Rock for rock climbers. The Washoe tribe was against it. Therefore, clashes were immanent. Things would soon get hotter than Beanie's famous \\"run for the nearest faucet\\" chili! <br />***** This is Sue Owens Wright's debut novel? Geez, hard to believe! It is so well done! A puzzling mystery filled with regular home life and snappy dialogue that had me chuckling aloud while trying to figure out who was doing the murders. Perfect for all mystery lovers and highly recommended! I can hardly wait for the next mystery involving Beanie and Cruiser! *****	2002-03-18

The spaceship Archangel had been escorting a freighter through Clan space when they were attacked. Only a few of its crew survived. Refuge was found on board an alien-built space station deep within enemy territory. Each surviving sole wondered if they would ever be rescued. Most dreamed of returning home to loved ones. A few found life on the space station to their liking and hoped no one would ever locate them. One wanted to found a new colony on the planet in which they orbited. <br />One lone (Clan) man lived from the battle with Archangel. The Commonwealth had him in custody. He waited for the day to come that he could hunt down the ones who had gotten away. <br />***** A space age soap opera set in the distant future. Several characters to keep events moving, each with unique concerns and problems. <br />Like her other novel, Conduct Unbecoming, the author has again created a believable cast in what could easily someday be a believable setting. Don't expect a bunch of pull-out-the-alien-looking-weapon-and-blast-the-army-of-monsters-away-before-they-destroy-the-Earth type of [stuff]. No, this author made her book realistic! Now don't get me wrong, those constant gunfire, laser wars, and non-stop action stories are wonderful. I love them too. However, I found it VERY refreshing to read a space story that concentrated on the people, like Star Trek: The Next Generation does. I am proud to recommend this novel to everyone! *****	2002-03-07

In the twenty third century, mankind has progressed to the point that human clones are now possible. The first human clones are to be copies of none other than King Tut and his wife, Ankhesenamun, for they are possibly the human key that will unlock the wisdom of the ages, recently uncovered in ancient ruins. In charge of this joint project are Drs. Lindsey Larimer and Kevin Sanders. After an inauspicious beginning, the couple quickly falls in love. Though it seems the project is going well, Lindsey finds herself plagued with dreams that hint they have opened a can of worms that might be too much for the world itself. King Tut is power crazy, and the boy king may get a chance to unlock evil that he has been denied for four millennia. The price of saving humanity from his dangerous schemes comes with a heartbreaking cost. <br />***** This is an incredible book. I hardly know how to praise it without giving away too much. Mixing profound Christian faith with myths and science so expertly that I cannot stop thinking about the possible truths that could be found herein, I am reminded most strongly of Madeline L'Engle and C.S Lewis' classic works. With a scope that takes you from the depths of the ocean to the far reaches of Heaven, this book is not to be missed. Yet, there is no skimping on characterization. As with Nora Roberts, you get to really know the people, and love them, making the ending that more poignant. Be prepared to not be able to put it out of your mind easily. ***** <br />Amanda Faye Killgore	2002-03-01

Proud in their Scottish and Native American heritage, the clan immediately accepted Adam into their midst. It was only a short time until he learned that the clan had accepted Jillian into their town shortly before. Adam had to go make sure Jillian had no plans to harm his family out of misguided revenge. <br />Jillian had fallen in love with the Tallchief family. Only Adam, the drifter, was an exception. She had to make sure Adam had no plans of letting everyone get used to him being there and then suddenly disappearing, hurting them all. She was now a graphic designer. She needed a week more to finish her project. That would give her time to deal with the problem. <br />However, while Adam and Lillian clashed in their own passionate storm, Adam also had to deal with WHY he and Liam had been separated. <br />**** An excellent story that spotlights two very strong-willed characters. I could almost see the lightning flash between these two when their tempers ignited! The problems seem overwhelming, so there will be no dull moments within these pages! Recommended! ****	2002-02-15

His site was a crypt in Hrad Luchov, near the boundary of Moravia and Slovakia. Karel had found something at the site that had changed his life completely. A life that somehow ended in a high class hotel of Budapest. <br />Dangerous people were after what Karel had found, \\"The Vigesimal Hours\\" and the hosts! The book was \\"illuminated\\" (painted) by one known only as The Shadow Master. Within it were prophecies. Revelations. It told of The Second Coming! <br />Klement simply wanted to know how his brother had come to die in a hotel that was way above his financial means. The question leads Klement on a quest of epic proportions. <br />**** This is one of those books that begins with a mysterious death and several questions, then steadily builds up steam until everything explodes at the end!

Julian, with his God-like body, his soul, and his strength, pulled Grace back to reality and out of her precious dreams. Together, they fought Gods, Goddesses, and lunatic stalkers to be together. <br />***** I had waited a very long time for this book and the day I got it, I read it with great anticipation and I wasn't disappointed in the least bit.

Jonathan's lawyer, Duncan Ross, informed Bella that Jonathan had changed his will and left everything to her, even though the wedding had not yet been done.

She would fulfill the last wish of her fiancé. Soon attempts on her life began. It could be any of the servants, Theo the brother, or Duncan the lawyer. Too many murders had happened in this huge home and she seemed to be the next targeted to die! <br />***** An exciting gothic romance destined to send goose bumps down your arms and back. It seemed pretty obvious to me who the culprit was, but only because I've read so many gothics and have a warped mind already. Gothics have always been a favorite topic of mine and author, Allison Knight, has not disappointed me in the least. I loved every second of this one! *****	2002-02-10

A strong hero with an even stronger heroine. I found myself proud of Serenity, and when a reader can feel something for a character, then the author has done an outstanding job!

When Jared refused, she slipped away to go alone and ended up being abducted. She was transported to the Mideast and sold into a harem. <br />Jared had been only sixteen, but felt the full weight of his responsibilities.

He and his band of warriors became well known. But the Black Lion used his travels and the money gained from his trade to continue his hopeless search for his lost fiancé. <br />Isabeau was called simply the Assassin. Very few knew the face of this legendary desert rebel, not even the men who called her their leader. Having escaped the harem, she learned the ways of the Assassins' Cult. Her only thought was to free the one friend she ever had in the harem from her vile \\"Master\\". She hired the Black Lion's band for temporary aid, not knowing Jared to be the leader. Once face to face, she believed he could never accept her for what she had to become or the horrible things she had to do for survival. <br />**** This story begins to simmer from page one and becomes a virtual blaze of wildfire once they meet in the desert!

No punches are pulled in this novel. The chapter does not end and the picture does not fade to black. The Reader sees it unfold in all its horror. Weak stomachs are not allowed. (Consider yourself warned.) Even scarier, this is a plot that could someday happen. Well told! *****	2002-01-08

Shelley even learned that her friend's life had been threatened from someone. More than just Shelley thought Mary Louise's death was not an accident at all, but murder. And now, whoever killed Mary Louise was after Shelley too! <br />***** A gothic lover's dream! Gothic stories are so hard to find now a days. Author, Clara Wimberly has given us a new source!

Lady Lucianne Gordon was commanded by Queen Charlotte to attend a grand masquerade she was holding. It would be the first time Lucy was seen in public since the humiliating scene in the park, two weeks previously, when she and her fiancé broke up! Unfortunately for Lucianne, Queen Charlotte was her godmother! And the queen intended to play the role of match maker. Lucy would be one of the main players in a game during the party so all the eligible men would see her in a fresh, new light (and hopefully court her afterward.) Things went well, until her ex-fiancé showed up, trying to woo her back. <br />Lord Victor Oxenby was surprised when Queen Charlotte called his name as the one to participate with Lucy in a game! Lucianne was the sister of his best friend. In fact, he had watched Lucianne as she grew up. Yet once they had reached maturity, they cared nothing for each other. Victor planned to remain a bachelor and used his scars, from a horse accident, to his advantage. Neither Lucianne, nor Victor, expected to be wed by the end of the party! <br />***** The thing I find most fascinating is that the first half of the book IS the night of the masquerade! Only one night! However, the story is so incredibly written that the pages flew by in a blur! I still cannot believe how much time had past as I read! Those two facts alone prove this author is VERY talented and the book is awesome! Highly recommended! *****	2002-01-04

You can read each as just a short Historical Romance story, or you can locate the book(s) in which you would like to read even more. <br />Four of the five spend most of the story in America.

At the same time, Kate's ex-husband was trying to make her believe she could not take care of their thirteen year old daughter. Lastly, Molly's real murderer was still at large. And the killer had decided to stop Kate's snooping! <br />***** Christiane Heggan gets better with every book she writes! If anyone should ever wonder why Heggan hits the best selling list often, all they must do is read one of her books to understand. This one is a great example. The heroine, Kate, is strong, tenacious, caring, and intelligent. The author succeeds in creating a character that is very realistic and adds many twists to keep readers guessing.

Molly Doogan thought that the adventures were over for Rairarubia, or at least for herself! However, Molly now had the ability to travel from her own world to Rairarubia and the temptation was too big to ignore. Molly learned that unless she continued to write or speak the story, the characters of Rairarubia would be stuck in time. Since Molly had to write a story for er teacher, Miss Turner, as an assignment anyway, why not write about Romey and Sam? <br />Molly's best friend was Netty. Once Molly proved to Netty that Rairarubia was real, she expected Netty to jump at the chance for adventure. Instead, Netty was reluctant. But wanting to or not, Netty was pulled into the story which seemed to be writing itself! The group must face a shy giant, horrible winged Zingwings, a shapeshifter, a mysterious dwarf, boulder people, and the evil and magical Queen Elleb! <br />**** This is book two of the Rairarubia series. Each book is a story that can stand alone, but by reading them in order, more is understood. It is perfect for those as young as fifth grade and up to adulthood. Sci-Fi and Fantasy mix for a fast paced adventure that leaves you begging for more! Terrific book! ****	2001-12-30

Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Chewbacca, and the droids team up for the first time against Darth Vader and the dreaded Death Star. <br />Now relive it all from the viewpoint of Princess Leia Organa. She wrote it all in her journal in hopes that should she die, the journal and all its secrets would find its way to the Rebellion! <br />***** The book reads much like a diary with a recorder built in. It begins before the movie did and ends shortly past where the movie ended. Leia tells how she came into possession of the Death Star plans and what she endured as Vader's prisoner. We can see how the Force influenced her strongly in her decisions. Though she had no idea what or where these strange and strong feelings were from, Leia trusted it. We see a glimpse of the proof showing that the Force runs strong in the Skywalker family, and we understand more about Leia, Luke, and Han. All-in-all, this book is a masterpiece! *****	2001-12-30

Relive the movie &quot;Star Wars: Episode I&quot; through the eyes of the newly elected Queen Amidala. This young teen begins this journal before the movie began. Readers see the training Amidala went through in preparation for her future post. In the book we find out WHY Amidala puts lipstick on her upper-lip fully, yet only a slash on her lower-lip. We see the defenses that were made by the guards, such as a decoy, but never dreamed would ever have to be used. (Oh come on, you did not HONESTLY think those handmaidens were there for LOOKS, did you?) <br />**** Not as magnificent as Princess Leia's journal, but just as enlightening! In the movie, Queen Amidala had to keep her face blank so her adversaries could not read her. In this book, we see all the thoughts, fears, and strategies that went on behind the royal mask. In fact, this book made Amidala's character more impressive than the movie did. It can also be used as a quick refresher before you flock to see &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; in the Summer of 2002! Very good reading! ****	2001-12-30

Each story is written by members of a writers group called Nasfcas. In fact, the Foreword of the book tells that many of the group have had their stories published in one or more of that popular series, as well as, elsewhere! But these stories are brand new and fresh from the group. The price is lower than most paperbacks too, which is always a good thing! <br />There are twenty stories. Some of sorcery, some set off Earth, some vampire or gothic, some set in the future ... you get the idea. Most, but not all, are gripping and I have no doubt that readers will love having their noses stuck between these pages! Good reading here! ****	2001-12-21

Skye Denison had left her hone town of Scumble River years ago never believing she would someday return. But Skye was back as the new school psychologist. Within one week Skye had managed to put off all the small-town busybodies (the number of which were astounding), get the school files in order (NOT easy), volunteer in the town's annual Chokeberry Days festival (which she had always hated), and find a dead body. Not bad for such a short time! <br />The deceased was the host of a children's TV show and looked elderly. However, the elderly host turned out to be a young woman under a lot of make-up. Her name was Honey Adair. Honey had lived several year in Scumble River and the whole town hated her, for good reasons! However, Chief Boyd, for some strange reason, believed Skye's brother had murdered the woman and refused to even consider anyone else! So Skye began her own investigation. <br />**** The first a great new series! The author does a wonderful job of creating realistic characters. Personally, I live in a small town too and am amazed at how well Denise Swanson captured the closeness of everybody. Everyone knows everything about everyone. The main character, Skye, showed part of her background. It seems that each book will show her family a bit about her family and personal life. This made the story even MORE realistic to me! Here is a perfect book to read on rainy days to kill the blues! Excellent! ****	2001-12-19

Pamela Trevor, known as &quot;Peaches&quot;, started modeling very young and had seen many harsh things in the life of business. After a divorce from her husband only Carmen, her daughter, and beginning her own modeling agency meant anything to her. Needless to say, with all Pamela's business world savvy and determination &quot;Pawns&quot; became a world famous modeling agency. However, many shady deals also went on in the company. <br />Revella Brown was up for a director's position until a co-worker stabbed her in the back and caused her to be fired. To make matters worse, &quot;Vella&quot; caught her boyfriend, Terry Lyons (an attorney), with another woman. When her older sister, Peaches, offered her a job, Vella was determined to make sure Peaches never regretted it. Instead of the low entry position she expected, Vella started at the top. She knew there were several parts of the business Peaches did not include her in, but the models and the shows kept Revella too busy to wonder what was going on. Vella's only real worry was wondering why Peaches insisted, from day one, that she had the best &quot;bodyguard&quot;. <br />*** There is more going on than I mention, but any more would spoil the story for you. The book is written in first person view of Revella, Peaches, and Terry. The plotting is sound with many unforeseeable surprises; however, I could not help but feel much was left out. In my opinion, this story needed to be longer. More details on the darker parts of the business, for one example. <br />All-in-all, this is an author to keep an eye on. Charrise Walker may someday be the next Judith Krantz! ***	2001-12-19

Miss Rebecca Marston was the daughter of the textile millionaire, Winfield Marston. Feeling the need to help the Union in some way, she had defied her father and joined the Nursing Corps. Having been pampered her whole life, it took a long while for Rebecca to steel herself enough against the horrors she witnessed in surgery to get her job done. As burn out from the job began, Rebecca prepared to return home. However, a small guerrilla force of deserted Confederate soldiers, led by Colonel Hall, attacked a small party she was out with. Upon learning who Rebecca's father was, Hall decided to ransom her. Shortly afterward, the renegade group rescued a few Union solders who had survived a river boat explosion. They were nearly dead, but hall allowed Rebecca to nurse them as best she could or let them die. <br />Jacob Fuller was sick of the war and all the death that went with it. Once he recovered enough, he helped Becca as much as possible. The biggest problem was that the Colonel was the only man in the rebel group with any honor. All the others wanted fun with the female prisoner and then to kill them all. So the prisoners were left wondering how they could all escape when they were barely able to breath from their wounds. <br />***** Gwyneth Atlee brings to life the horrors that the Nursing Corps had to deal with. The author put her magical pen to paper so the reader could FEEL all the nausea and dread that Rebecca and the other prisoners had to go through. Atlee held back no punches so the reader actually feels like she is there to witness it all first hand. This is one of the best! Recommended! *****	2001-12-17

No matter how hard Tracy tried to clear her mother of the charges, her mother kept blocking her from doing so. Tracy kept wondering just WHAT was a daughter to do in a time like that and just WHY had she not been an orphan? <br />***** An excellent &quot;who-dunnit&quot; mystery that kept me guessing right up until the end! Tossed with bits of humor that I could not help but enjoy. This is one I definitely did not want to end! Luckily for me, this is a series of mysteries that began with &quot;Revenge Of The Gypsy Queen&quot; and will continue.

This meant many parents got angry at Skye whenever their kids did something wrong at school or their child showed signs of being abused from home. <br />Being quizzical was necessary in Skye's job, so when she found her grandmother dead and a few curious items wrong, she made sure an autopsy was done. The rest of the family balked at the idea until foul play was found. The whole family seemed to be selfish, greedy, and full of secrets. Instead of wanting to find the killer, they all wanted Skye to stop poking her nose where it did not belong so they could hurry up and divide all the land and belongings! <br />The more family secrets Skye uncovered, she more she was amazed! Grandmother Leofanti had kept a lot of the family history silent. She had only recently began telling Skye some of it. There were a few problems going on at the school as well. So when some very cruel pranks are pulled on Skye, no one was sure if it was the work of the killer or a disgruntled parent. <br />***** This story is AWESOME! Many suspects, many clues, and many problems. This one will test the wits of the best mystery readers, no doubt! It is well written and the plot begins rolling almost immediately. The author captured my attention (as the reader) in the opening sentence. That always impresses me. Personally, I hate to go several chapters and STILL wonder what the heck the book is about or if it will ever get better! This one starts off with a bang and continues non-stop. <br />Even better, the story is complete, but Skye's life is left open and ready for the next mystery. (In fact, I understand &quot;Murder Of A Sleeping Beauty&quot; will be out around April 2002. ) This looks to be a very promising series of mystery books. <br />Do not start this one until you can settle down comfortably with no interruptions for at least a few hours. Have a drink nearby, because once you begin, you will not want to stop reading. Highly recommended! *****	2001-12-10

She would hate every shilling he spent on her and be furious every time he paraded her in front of eligible men at balls, as if she were for sale. <br />Lady Laura Vladim's lovely face his an evil heart. Due to an addiction to opium, Lord Ashcom had caught her in a bad situation. For years now Lady Vladim had been careful. She wanted Nicholas for her own. But Nicholas had eyes only for Fantine Delmere. It was only a matter of time before they admitted their feelings for each other. She got the help of some unsavory people to help her plot the fall of Fantine. <br />*** The story was great and the plot was fascinating. However, I could not help but feel that sections were missing. Areas were choppy to me. I could not get a clear picture on what was going on within Nicholas after the first few chapters. But Lady Vladim was the perfect villain and very well done! In fact, she was the type of villain that readers love to hate! ***	2001-12-03

Silently he had been plotting for revenge against Maggie and all those who either helped her escape him or that she cared for. <br />***** Pure horror at its finest! Trisha Baker hooked me from the beginning and held onto me for the entire length of the book! Parts of the book were so graphic that I admit to being attracted and repelled at the same time! It was so well written I could easily picture it happening as I read it. Yes, Readers, this author is THAT TALENTED! Extremely recommended for all horror fans! *****	2001-11-23

Her best friend was Jay Thornton, who was always too curious for his own good. Geri's other friend was Randy, who was an oddball to others his age due to his high intelligence. During a hot day Geri suggested hunting up, what the locals called, Blue Pool. It was a an isolated, tear drop shaped, crystal blue lake a few miles away. Many tales circulated about people dying at the lake or disappearing, but Geri and Jay still decide to go. That was only the first of several bad choices the two made that day. Randy was the only one smart enough not to thumb his nose up at danger. He stayed home. Soon Geri and Jay are facing venomous snakes, hopping on and off moving trains, starting a brush fire, finding a new cave, being chased by two mean men out to seriously harm them, and much more! During it all, Geri and Jay become closer and learn some interesting things about each other. <br />***** Author, W. Royce Adams, writes the way pre- teens and teens talk in today's real world. This makes the story more believable and smoother for the reader. Readers cannot help but learn a few things while reading the story as well, such as what stalactites, stalagmites, and gypsum grotto are. I would not be surprised to see this book win awards! Many will place this book upon their \\"Keeper\\" shelves. I sure will! My twelve year old son could hardly wait to get his hands on the book once I was finished. <br />Perfect for fans of \\"Hardy Boys\\" and \\"Nancy Drew\\", or just for those who enjoy a lot of excitement in their stories!

Lord Richard Dashwood was handsome, charming, heir to riches, and could have any woman he wanted. He was also selfish, a rake, a gambler, betrayer, liar, without any honor ... Well, you get the idea. <br />His best friend, Lord Sidney Lynd, was the total opposite, except that he was already rich, not just heir-to-be. So any sensible woman would wish for Lord Sidney Lynd! Therefore, I was furious at Lady Flora! <br />Lady Flora Winton was already wealthy. She had rejected several proposals as she waited to find a love match. But she fell in love with Lord Dashwood's looks and words of love. She was blind to everything else and would believe no ill of him, even after he did several awful things to her! He even proposed to her only to jilt her a few hours later for someone with more money! <br />There is much more to tell, but to do so would spoil the book. In fact, I expect many to hate this story due to Flora being so intelligent toward everything and yet be so stupid concerning Dashwood! Yet I can easily recall myself in my &quot;first love&quot;. I only too well remember being this blind, no matter what was said to me. The young can be stupid when blind! <br />**** Therefore, consider well before purchasing this one. In my opinion, it was great. I took much delight when Flora opened her eyes to REALLY see Dashwood's true self. But if you hate blind devotion, avoid this plot. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-11-07

Colt was to drop his brother, Douglas, off at their Uncle's home in Fort Worth. There, twelve year old Douglas would receive his education. Colt's plan was to continue onward to purchase cattle. <br />Elroy Peoples escaped prison by making a bomb out of horse manure and roses. So Colt was asked to join the hunt as a U.S. Marshall. He was partnered with another Marshall called &quot;Sleepy&quot;. Sleepy was awesome at finding the little clues that would help track his prey. Elroy was no exception and Colt would learn much from this lawman. <br />Sleepy and Colt separated on the search for Elroy. Not too difficult to search, just follow the bodies and money. But since the book was set in the year of 1860, there were other things that kept getting in the way. There was Geronimo, racism, and a bit of romance to name just a few. <br />***** This novel is just as great, if not better, than the first! Very fast action and historically accurate. As for making a bomb in jail out of horse manure and roses, YES, it is possible. The author showed me, as the reader, how Elroy did it. Every step of the way. Having several &quot;survivalists&quot; in my family, this was very interesting to me! I am now a big fan of Dennis O'Keefe, who proves himself to have several talents, only one of which is writing! *****	2001-11-07

The Marines, with a bunch of new recruits, continue their march to the sea in hopes of purchasing ship transportation across the monster filled ocean. <br />Getting to the city near the coast was as hard as getting transport. Of course, battles for both had to be fought and won. But with each battle the challenges get harder. Ammo was not unlimited and few of the original Marines were left. <br />A bit of romance was thrown in for the fast maturing prince. And the readers get a few surprises thrown at them! <br />***** Not as many battles as the first book in the trilogy, but just as great! I do not know which author subtly alluded to the &quot;NANCY BELL&quot; poem near the ending, but it was done so smoothly that I can not help but wonder how many people noticed it. This is the best Sci-Fi series I have read all year! I am eagerly awaiting the third book. Highly recommended! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-11-07

Her life long best friend, Eden, went with her for support. Soon Sable was in a relationship with Faith and Jacob Langtry's ranch foreman, Culley Blackwolf. As Sable slowly came to terms with both sets of parents, she also began helping Culley deal with his own difficult past.<br />Eden Eglantine was a paleontologist. As she helped Sable reunite with her biological parents, she spent time with Sable's biological brother, Roark Langtry, looking for the bonebeds of dinosaurs. Eden understood that Roark wanted her, but not WHY. Her own parents cared nothing for her and her brother, Piers, was cruel. Piers took credit for all Eden's work and kept he on a short leash! If Eden gave into her feelings for Roark, Piers would harm Roark, Sable, and the entire Langtry family!<br />But the Langtry family had a special heritage of some golden coins. Their ancestors watched over them. Sable and Eden were about to learn that the Langtry family protected their loved ones!<br />**** This was like two stories in one! Two women in two difficult romances with two difficult men! Whew! If that was not enough to keep me busy, the author continued (and concluded) a sub-plot from a previous book, titled &quot;It Happened At Midnight&quot;, of the kidnapped Langtry baby years before and the reunion once she was grown! I was delighted to read of so much happening at once! Wonderful story that I highly recommend! ****	2001-11-06

Their marriage problems were getting worse and their future together looked bleak. But friends slowly showed her how to open her heart to God. Gena must learn that sometimes God does not answer prayers for very good reasons. <br />***** An excellent example of writing! This is the type of novel that should be read slowly and savored.

One kind boy did a nice act to her. Of course, the law had not believed the dirt poor girl over the son of such an important man in town. So nothing was done to the mean boy. However, the law was angry that the kind one, Silas Koole, took Katie's side. Young Katie never saw the young Silas again.

Her life was secure and she thought she was content. But a serial killer had come to the area. One that had been invisible to the law for years. He was smart. He was kind. he had been killing for years. And he had his eyes on Katie. <br />***** Oh yeah! This one is sooooo good! Author, Tina Wainscott, writes so realistically that I actually cheered aloud at one point as Katie's courage grew! Katie was such an innocent and I watched her struggle against overwhelming odds. I could not help but feel Katie's emotional pain. Then I watched her slowly emerge from all the chaos, despite everything and everyone around her. It reminded me of how Mary Higgins Clark used to write. Therefore, I will be keeping a sharp eye on this author! Hmmm, now to see if I can find a few of her earlier books! *****	2001-11-02

The instant Wintergreen saw the lad, he knew the boy was definitely his nephew! Wintergreen also found himself deeply attracted to the mother as well! Problem was that they had a very intelligent cat named Beast as their protector. And Beast seemed to know their latest guest was not a cat lover. Of course, this meant the feline simply HAD to adopt the gentleman, if only to torment him repeatedly!<br />*I do not often give anthologies such a high rating.

Luc returned from class to hear his mother say she had caught Cher in bed with another man. <br />Fourteen years later...(San Francisco)<BR>Luc watched his mother's murderer walk out of the courtroom as a free man! Luc was possitive young Edward Compton had married Victoria for money and then had her killed. The only good thing was that the money was Luc's, not Victoria's, and Compton received nothing for his trouble. Since Compton could not be tried twice, Luc would put him behind bars for something else. The scam had been so smoothly carried out that Luc was sure Compton and his sister, Helen Ramsey, had pulled it off before. So Luc went to Phoenix to get the best person for the job! <br />Lieutenant Cher Dawson was head of Phoenix Police Department's Cold Case Unit and had a high success rate. She did NOT take kindly to Luc reappearing in her life, throwing money at Commissioner Sanchez, and forcing Cher to drop everything to investigate Compton. Not only did Cher hate being considered Luc's servant, but she feared he would learn he had a thirteen year old daughter that he knew nothing about! <br />***** The writing team of J.M.

Anne Hazlett was the lady's maid to Miss Pamela Godwyn. A storm caused the ship to sink. Pamela and her brother left Anne to die. Instead, Anne was rescued by Horatio Merivale, one of the crew. The only other survivors they located was Kai (the young, Chinese cabin boy) and two other crewmen named Ulrich and Ruut. They killed time on their make-shift raft by sharing tales. Anne told of the same dream she had every night of her life. She ruled a small island full of natives. All the survivors were amused by the dream, as well as, of the red kingfisher bird that she often saw and seemed to be guiding her. Ruut said it to be part of The Hand Of Destiny&quot;. <br />They drifted a long time before being picked up by the famous French privateer, Philippe Chartier. Chartier was quite mad. He had Horatio put in chains. Anne he believed to be a Queen (having heard rumors from her fellow survivors) and treated her as such. Even his monkey, Mango, loved her! The others became part of the ship's crew. Thanks to Anne, they take over the ship, casting the original crew out in longboats. With nothing better to do, they all decide to follow Anne and her kingfisher, to see what may happen. The insane privateer hunted them during it all. <br />***** The author spent three weeks in Borneo researching for this story, staying in the jungle with the descendants of headhunters and traveling by longboat up the shallow rivers. Therefore, she was able to make this book come alive! As with her previous book, The Mermaid Of Penperro, the characters each had their own personality and were easy for me to care for. Full of adventure, romance, and a touch of humor, this story is a winner! *****	2001-10-17

During a desperate moment, Alex had copies of an expensive jewelry set made and planned to switch them for the real things, for money to get a kidney on the black market. Only seconds after she made the switch, Alex realized she could not go through with it and returned the real set. But Spurgeon in Security caught it on tape and edited out the part of Alex returning the set. He made sure Alex knew he would demand a price at a later time. <br />Alexandra attended the Fifth Annual National Kidney Foundation Celebrity Ball and Auction under orders from her supervisor. Alex was to use Sturbridge's money to out-bid anyone for the auction prize of winning a date with Chase Thomas. Chase was vice-president of &quot;Panache, The Jewelry Experience&quot; and Sturbridge's direct competitor. The press would eat up the news of that date! Even though it was all for publicity, Alex and Chase clicked immediately and romance bloomed. <br />Enter Spurgeon and his blackmail. He forced Alex, at gun point, to help him steal the priceless and famous King Soloman's ring from Panache. He had it video taped as well, for extra blackmail material. Alex felt as though her life would never get better.<br />**** There are many sub-plots I did not mention. They are as wonderful as I believe the romance between the main couple to be.

Worried for his biological and adopted daughters, he took measures to protect them without their knowledge of anything being amiss. <br />Carolina (Carly) Sullivan loved her adopted family thoroughly. She considered them her real family. But Carly was as addicted to her photography as her biological mother had been before her death. Carly was now shooting a series of commercials for a Caribbean cruise line. She was a stubborn, hot headed, and determined woman who pushed herself past all limits to be the best! Her sister, Daphne Brandon, assisted her and tried to make sure Carly ate and slept if nothing else. The model for the shoot turned out to be a dud. The only possible replacement on the ship refused the job. She had to somehow convince him to work for her at least temporarily. <br />SEAL Commander Ford McKay had been pulled from another assignment and ordered to protect Carly. This meant he would have to take the modeling job with the irritating red head that he had just turned down. As much as he hated it, orders were orders. Soon her amazing spirit and dedication to her loved ones and work had him changing all his opinion of her. They seemed to always get under each other's skin though. But when someone began trying to kill Carly, Ford put his deadly training to use! <br />***** Best story I have had the pleasure of reading in a long time! Alluring, romantic, subtly humorous, and loaded with fun and action, this novel is an instant best seller! Highly recommended! *****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-10-11

Now she was back, but no one would hire a recovering alcoholic, until Greenvale Hospital. Taylor had the chance to revive her career. She was hired as chief of cosmetic surgery at Greenvale Hospital, where the rich and famous went for discreet face-lifts, tummy tucks, and the like. <br />Not everyone was happy about the hospital. In the five years it had been in the small town, cults have popped up in attempts to destroy the hospital's reputation. When suspicious deaths happened to a number of her patients, Taylor thought the cults might have been guilty of murder. She began her own investigation when the brakes were tampered with on her car. Taylor learned that Dr. Sam Slater was conducting research in organ cryopreservation. In fact, he was up for an award for it! But sometimes, being ambitious and being desperate can come together to create the ultimate horror! <br />*** The only draw back about this book, in my opinion, is that the first half is long and drawn out. Details were told more than once. However, the last half was executed excellently! (Pardon the pun.) Though I do not believe the author is up to Robin Cook's level as yet, I do believe she will be. I plan to keep my eye on Nancy Fisher's future work! ***	2001-10-11

Aided by an evil Vachyn sorcerer, Talon would conquer the castle. She gave the region's fiercest warrior, Gailard (a Highlander), the task of spiriting Princess Ellyn away and guarding her with his life until such time Ellyn was old enough to gain her hereditary powers, defeat Talon, and regain the throne. <br />Gailard and Ellyn had no love for each other. With Ellyn at the awkward age between child and woman, she had no understanding of the burdens of commanding armies, politics, magic, and zero patience. They gain an unlikely ally in Shara, another Vachyn. Shara promises to teach Ellyn the magic while Gailard teaches the princess how to battle in combat. Then, somehow, they must raise an army, defeat the mighty sorcerer, kill Talon, and regain the kingdom.<br />It sounded like fun!<br />***** An excellent Fantasy book!

Sofia Rose Cardinella left the groom standing at the alter for the third time! But even being stood up three times by the same woman, Vincent expected to marry her. He had been hand-picked by her mafioso father. Debi, Sofia's chubby sister, was in love with Vencent but he would see no one but Sofia. Sofia was in love with an ex-lawyer, Ben Estes, who was trying to become a singer with the tone of Frank Sinatra. When Daddy sent two bumbling goons out to kill Ben, Sofia and Ben fly to Carmel, California, to let things cool down. When the goons follow, they marry. After all, Daddy would not kill his own son-in-law, right? <br />* In my personal opinion, Sofia and Ben are the two most immature people I have ever read about. Neither took anything seriously, not even the idea of marriage! Sofia came off as a spoiled girl out to irritate her father by marrying someone she knew he would hate. The dialogue was full of humor and wit, but too much so, as if every sentence of the book simply had to be funny. It got old fast! It was the two goons I hated most. No man is going to order someone murdered by sending two idiots that he knows will end up leading back to him ... if they got lucky enough to kill him. <br />The story idea had promise, but I saw way too many unrealistic problems. My personal opinion is to pass on this one. *	2001-10-11

No one even noticed Mary, except Mr. Griffin who loved to inflict pain. But Laura had become more vain and self centered lately. She often made sure Mr. Griffin knew where to locate Mary. Therefore, Mary would find quiet places away from the crush during parties to read or privately sketch.<br />Lord Grayson, Earl of Rothmoor, was considered a rake. Rumor stated he ruined at least two ladies within the last few years. Gossip also stated Lady Constance Turner found herself in the family way and Lord Grayson rejected her, leading her to take her own life! None was true, but Gray stayed away from unmarried ladies.<br />While hiding from one such lady, he found Mary. Fate seemed to keep throwing them together after that. Then Mary saved his life! Only at that moment would Gray admit two things to himself: he cared a great deal for Mary and someone was out to kill him! Gray would help Mary with Laura's cruelties and help divert scandal on the family name. Mary and Nick (Gray's closest friend) would help prove Gray innocent of all Society's charges, restore honor to his name, and help find out who wanted him dead!<br />***** Here is Allison Lane's best book to date! I am telling everyone about it! Mary is such a level headed heroine, unlike most, and Laura is the type of two-faced person that everyone loves to hate!

Oberon, King of the Fae, was Robin's father. Thus, he kept an eye on his son's life in the mortal realm. Now, in Karen Fox's second novel, we (the readers) are treated to witness another magical love story between a Mortal and a Fae. <br />Ariel had been Queen of the Pillywiggins (the flower faeries) since the beginning of time, until she defended Robin from Titania, Queen of all the Fae. In a fury, Titania banished Ariel from her court and stripped her of her rank. Feeling useless and unneeded, Ariel jumped at the task Oberon gave her. Robin and Kate had a newborn child (who was mortal). Ariel was to check on Oberon's grandchild and send back a magical report. <br />From the first sight, smell, and touch of the baby Ariel was enthralled! She decided this was what she needed! A baby! A baby of her own would make her needed again! But the Fae could not impregnate each other. She would need a mortal for that. Once pregnant, Ariel and her baby could return and live in the magical realm! She chose Robin's brother-in-law, Rand Thayer. But when she asked him to impregnate her, he refused! <br />Rand had ten sisters, zero brother, and a tribe of nieces and nephews. No matter how great he was with kids, he did not want any of his own, until he met Ariel LeFay. He had not meant to get her pregnant, but it happened. It did not take much to convince him she was a fairy either! One thing he knew for sure, she was NOT going to deliver his baby and then disappear with the infant forever! She was stuck in his realm until delivery (one month). He had that long to think up a plan. <br />***** I would never have guessed that tears of the Fae turned into opals! Or that each hic-cup made a buttercup fall into their lap! Or that green Jell-O could ... well, you get my point.

Dr. Sam Pritchett) played a big part in young Colt Patterson's life. Peoples convinced the authorities that the cattle on the Patterson ranch had anthrax and must be slaughtered. That set events into motion. <br />Texas Ranger Billy Dixon was tired of hunting down criminals and bringing in the heads in pickle barrels. He decided it was time to retire, marry the Widow Tucker, and relax for the rest of his days. On his last hunt for fugitives, one of which was Peoples, Billy rescued Colt from death's door. Billy took Colt on as a partner and began to teach him how to survive, Ranger style. <br />Charley Tree had been raised by one of the Apache Tribes at the Bosque Redondo, a reservation. He declared war on all whites and began a bloody campaign. Other Apaches believed Charley insane, instead of brave, which made matters worse. The Indian Renegade felt he had a personal grudge against Billy and Colt. The two lawmen thought the same of Charley. Soon they would meet in a battle to the death. <br /> Now THIS is my type of Western! I have been a fan of a few western series like \\"Headhunter\\", \\"Lone Star\\", and \\"Long Arm\\". But, in my opinion, they pale in comparison to this book! This one is much more realistic! Author Dennis O'Keefe, for example, goes into details on how Billy teaches Colt. I witnessed how Billy taught Colt to aim without dipping the head of the pistol, how a racket of card sharks were cheating, and how to get yourself out of a tough situation while making money at the same time! This author has a new fan in me! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READING!	2001-10-09

He knew something was wrong, but she would not confide in him. So he called in a favor to Che, the one he trusted most! <br />Detective Clay Blackthorn (aka Che) posed as the new security manager at Porto Sereno, where Marisol Calderon lived. She kept busy with her salon business and was all Marcos had warned him of. It quickly became obvious that she had a stalker. She received phone calls, flowers, and messages daily. Each were more bold than the last. clay's cover did not last long. Marisol quickly found out that Clay was a real cop. But he kept quiet about her brother sending him. If she got wind of that he would find her door slammed in his face! One problem was that there were few suspects and all of them were checking out clean. Another problem was that Clay and Marisol were getting too close to each other. Desire was hot between them. But Clay had long ago vowed never to trust women again! <br />***** This book is awesome! I began the book and did not stop until the last page had been turned! Marisol is no helpless damsel in distress either! She packs some mean defense moves of her own (unfortunately for Clay). I am hoping this author means to give Dr. Marcos Calderon his own story someday. I see lots of potential there! :) An excellent book to lose yourself in. Plenty of romance and excitement! *****	2001-10-09

His last wish was for his sister, Fabienne Beranger, to take his ashes to India and scatter them over the Narmada River. Once done, Fabienne found she wanted to stay awhile. There, she learned that she had been reincarnated. Back in 1849, she had been known as Lakshmi. She had been a commoner. (Her fiancé had been Mukunda.) Lakshmi had been murdered, trampled under an elephant, by a Kali worshiper. Princess Korana had wanted Mukunda in her bed. When told of Lakshmi's death, Mukunda directed his anger at the princess, knowing she had somehow been responsible. He died, never seeing his beloved again. <br />Mukunda was reincarnated as an American. He was called \\"Sahib\\" by all, but had the honor of being renamed by a swami named Baba. He was renamed, amazingly, Mukunda. He was the chief engineer of the dam project in India. The project had about ten more months of work to be completed. He met Kora, who worked in the beauty shop. She had an Australian accent in today's world. (But you guessed it, she was the Princess Korana from the past!) She, again, wanted Mukunda as her own. <br />Once again, Mukunda and Fabienne were reunited in love. Yet, once again, Kora would try to tear them apart! <br />*  Author, Vijaya Schartz, succeeded in making Princess Korana  the type of villain that everyone loves to hate! That alone shows major talent! The story was slow to start off, but once done (and it did not take too long) I was hooked! The book blended the past and present so well that, while reading, I was not sure which time intrigued me more, 1849 or present date. In fact, I'm still not sure! The characters were well developed. By the ending, I even saw Kora in a different light. An extremely satisfying read!  *	2001-10-01

She agreed to be part of the bachelorette auction for a charity. However, she NEVER expected the handsome Dr. Marcos Calderon to bid ten thousand dollars for a date with her! <br />Marcos told Abuelita Coqui, his grandmother, that he was engaged to a lovely Latina so he would not have to go down to Venezuela when he visited and have her throw ladies at him. Ever since his sister, Marisol, married and had babies he had been on the spot! But Marcos never dreamed Abuelita would be so happy that she would jump on a plane to meet her! The female doctor he was dating, off-and-on, was not Latina OR anyone Abuelita would like. Marcos planned to talk Gabriela into playing the part of his fiancé, to make an old woman happy. <br />As love would have it, the pretense becomes real. Now Gabriela and delightfully wicked Abuelita and Marisol, would teach Marcos a lesson about messing with Cupid, Latino style! <br />***** Victoria Marquez has written the most outstanding Encanto I have ever read! I loved seeing Marisol (from her last book &quot;Wild For You&quot;) again. It made the story more real! I had been hoping her over-protective brother would get his own book. And Man-Oh-Man, did Victoria Marquez deliver! Full of humor and romance with a grandmother's touch! Highly recommended reading here! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-10-01

Lady Abigail Weston was a twenty-five year old spinster and determined to see her younger sister, Caroline, wed well. However, without knowing what happened in the marriage bed (except the horrible things she had been told) Abby could not explain it to Caroline. To rectify this, Abigail hired someone to give her lessons! <br />James Stevens was the illegitimate son of an earl. James thought nothing could ever surprise him again, until Abigail's request for love lessons! Curious and intrigued, he agreed! <br />**  I warn everyone up front that this book contains A LOT explicit sex! I can only recommend this book for mature readers! The love scenes go into detail and each is several pages long. Not really much of a plot to this book, except for a past paramour interfering out of jealousy. Caroline seemed, to me, as if she was thrown into the book as an after thought. The book is well written, grammar wise. But, in my opinion, the book came across to me as soft porno instead of romance.  **	2001-10-01

When Rebecca Neville was attacked by her employer, she defended herself and had to flee from the law. During her flight, Rebecca met a dying woman, Elizabeth Stanmore, who was on her way to America with her new born son, James. They left London together with the agreement that once Elizabeth died, Rebecca would raise James as her own. <br />Ten years had past when the lawyer for the Earl of Stanmore showed up at Rebecca Ford's door. James was hard of hearing and had one misshapen hand, but the kind lawyer relayed that the earl was claiming James as his heir. Rebecca went with them to London to make sure James was happy before she left his life. The father, Lord Stanmore, was a handsome, but cold hearted man who cared nothing for his new found son. Slowly, the earl saw what true love really was as he watched Rebecca and James. Passion ignited between Rebecca and the Earl. All might have been well, however, outside forces were at work. <br />Lady Louisa Nisdale had been the Earl's mistress for quite a while and refused to acknowledge the fact that their affair was over. In addition, the Earl had been fighting in Parliament to end slavery in England. The Earl's neighbor, who owned and abused slaves, was none too happy about that either. <br />***** A definite winner!

All the humans were dying. The Authority called it &quot;The Diversity Crisis&quot;. Only one planet remained untouched, Pandora. The Pandorans were isolated from the Authority and kept close to nature. No machines, no medicines, only &quot;Guardians&quot;. The Authority was desperate and gave Pandora an ultimatum: Help find a cure or be destroyed. <br />There was no need for prisons. Anyone who broke the law forfeited their body right. That meant The Hothouses took them for experimenting on to find a cure. The Eden Project was a theory of creating a fetus with a high immune system that would not turn against the body of the mother hosting it. Of course, this meant only certain females were compatible. Luckily, the closest genetically perfect hosts, one family, left the Athena Station and settled on Pandora. They were (single parent) Helice Trust, and her young daughters, Chena and Teal. If they refused to volunteer for the Hothouse, they were to be forced. <br />Pandora was ruled by governments called &quot;Family&quot;. Each colony (complex) had a Family. Each member of the Family had a &quot;Conscience&quot; which was a chip that strongly persuaded the member to do what was considered right. Each complex had a &quot;City-Mind&quot;, an artificially created (but living) intelligence that WAS the complex, itself. Aleph was the city-mind for the Alpha Complex, where the story took place. She kept in touch with all the other city-minds. The city-minds took care of the Families, who in turn, took care of the villages in the colony. However, someone had been making covert alterations to Aleph without her knowledge. Someone who was out to force the Trust women into the Eden Project. Someone who altered nature's insects to kill any invaders the Authority may send. <br />***** This is the story of Helice, Chena, and Teal Trust. The story covers a ten year span, after all it deals with genetics. It is so well written that it was surreal! I found myself fully engrossed in the story and detested any time I had to stop reading.

The characters and the story flowed together so well, I forgot I was reading a book. I kept on looking over my shoulder making sure Isabel wasnt there watching me. Look at the reviews on B&N online and you will see everyone thought this book was 4 or 5 stars! Most reviewers here have only theirselves to blame, since they did not seem to read what the book was about. They simply are used to this author writing a different TYPE of book. However, that does not make this type of book bad! It is EXCELLENT for those of us who like GOTHICS! I don't care what others think, this one sent chills down my spine!

Matthias &#8220;Matt&#8221; Southers was a professor of Medieval Literature. He taught Remedial English and Literature at Arkwright. So, of course it is reasonable that he enjoyed the hobby of &#8220;role playing&#8221; in &#8220;Dungeons And Dragons&#8221; type games all his life. And that life changed forever one evening in a library. <br />Verene was an adept of the Order Of Marankwar. His talent of &#8220;the Arts&#8221; was great. He seemed to know everything of everybody and never told the full truth about anything. Using &#8220;the Arts&#8221; he searched the worlds until he found Matt, who was the spitting image of the prince. Verene and Captain Imre then confronted Matt in a library to request his assistance for their world. <br />Matt soon found himself on a world called Urrathe, imitating Prince Methos. It seemed that a great wizard, Gremian Brecc, had taken over within the last six years. Now only a small rebel band (led by Commander Hawkmoon), Verene, Captain Imre, and a few noble houses stand against Brecc. Prince Methos was believed dead and had been the last of the royal line. Matt was needed to BE Prince Methos and lead the troops into battle against, not only humans, but also griffins, dragons, ogres, trolls, dwarves, dire wolves, centaurs, and probably a roc or two! <br />The more Matt learned about his double, the less Matt liked him. And the longer he played the role of prince, the more he longed to remain and be prince in truth! Things may never be the same on Urrathe again! <br />Excellent! Fast paced, exciting battles, and a touch of romance are blended together to make this a story to remember! It leaves the reader with a sense of satisfaction and hungry for the second in the Urrathe Wars Trilogy!<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-08-21

His troop, led by his mother (Leandra), left him with the Masters when he had been raging with fever. He was to catch up to them once well. However, he awoke one morning to find Master Adrian shaking him awake and announcing that he was about to undertake the role of his life! <br />Prince Melos had been left to the Masters about nineteen years ago, by his aunt, Queen Ffazia the Fourth. Since all dozen or so others of royal lineage had died, accidentally of course, and the Queen was near death as well, the Queen ordered Prince Melos to wed the commander of her majesty's army, Ravyn Malakar. However, Melos had died four years ago and the Masters had never informed their Queen! So now he was to play the part of Prince Melos and to actually take the throne! <br />Ravyn Malakar did not want to wed Melos. Only to keep him alive long enough to take the throne. Her job (before and after the so called wedding) was, not to sire heirs, but to be his bodyguard for life! Tough job since it seems several assassins were now after Melos. And all the magic in the air simply could not be healthy for a prince-to-be! <br />***** Hmmm, this one has an interesting twist for an ending! It holds the possiblity of being continued as well. Good thing, since I hope to see more of these characters in the future. Well written and sure to please! K.G. McAbee has written a world that will entrap readers, willing or not! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-08-21

Rick has compiled this book full of many family tales that Jack has told him. Jack's life began in the year 1913, above his father's harness shop in Brooklyn. So there are many tales to read of the Depression, World War I (aka The War To End All Wars), the amazing changes in society, medical care, politics, and their not-so-ordinary family! <br />Jack's generation was the first born in America. His family before had been Russian Jewish peasants who survived the 1902 slaughter of the Tzar's army. But most stories are 1913 and later. Each show humor, shout of family pride, and end with a grin. The author even uses the words his elders used when they told him their family stories, so unusual words are printed in italics when first used and included in the glossary at the end of the book. This will bring back wonderful memories for those who have been around this world awhile. And it will educated those of us who want to know what things were like back then! <br />***** Perfect for those who love to listen and learn stories from their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents! There is no doubt in my mind that every reader who finishes and closes this book will do so with a warm feeling on their inside, a smile on their outside, and the urge to talk to their elders about their own family history!

He had been a P.O.W. of Vietnam for six years of his military time. Figuring it was all behind him, he and his wife, Alexandra, planned to finally get their yacht out of the charter service and sail the Bahamas. The pain and terror of Matt's captivity was about to help his future! <br />The night before Matt and Alex was to sail out, two men made a huge mistake. They were suppose to stash a big shipment of cocaine inside a certain boat's locker and build a fiberglass wall around it. However, the coke was placed on the wrong boat! Matt and Alex sailed out, ignorant of the drugs hidden onboard. <br />Senor Raoul Chaves was the Colombian drug lord known as \\"El Jefe\\". And he wanted his property back! Before his thugs could retrieve it though, Matt found it. For safety, he hid it where only he knew where it would be. But he returned to his boat to find out Alex had been kidnapped. The police would not help since they were on the drug lord's payroll. Time to either negociate with Chaves or rescue his wife. Problem was, Chaves was attracted to Alex and planned to keep her! <br /> Awesome story! Like a modern day Rambo, but more realistic! Here is a scenario that could actually happen and probably has already happened more than once! Stafford shows much talent in her writing and is one for readers to keep an eye on for future works!

Now comes the story of the younger brother, Byronic Ferdinand Dudley!<br />The Dudley family was always different from most of the Ton. Ferdinand was the brother who had always lived recklessly, and with much zest! He won Pinewood Manor from the Earl of Bamber. When he went to inspect his new estate, he found out that Miss Viola Thornhill had been living there for two years! She claimed the late Earl had left a codicil to his will, leaving Pinewood Manor to her! A copy of the will was sent for. Until it came, Viola refused to leave her home. Ferdinand felt badly for her and had given her several options (which she refused) before he declared he would not leave his home! War between the two began! The servants and nearby villagers were all on Viola's side. She had been so generous to them all, like their own guardian angel. But the more Ferdinand was around, the more they (reluctantly) began to respect him too. <br />Enter Tresham, with news of Viola's past secrets! Tresham believed he was rescuing his brother from a schemer. He ended up making the war worse! Soon the roles were reversed. Viola and Ferdinand were in London with him among friends and family. However, where Ferdinand's war was about property, Viola's war was about love for her family, honor, and survival. She had more to lose! She would fight dirty if need be!<br />***** Oh, this was soooo good! The perfect ending to the lives of the three Dudley siblings! I will place this story in my Keeper Bookcase.

A war broke out resulting in the extinction of both races. However, one Nightshade had been sealed off from the world. It was buried in an underground tomb and topped with a flowing river. The world was safe. Until... <br />In the present date, while renovating the Blake estate, a river was drained and a cement sealed passage was found. An ancient evil was released, Moloch.

(Each sibling has their own book.) Four years pass ... <br />The letter from Tom's lawyer caught up to Sone in Fort Worth. Each child must return to the ranch within a short amount of time to claim a portion of the inheritance. Being broke, Stone was forced to return. He was the last to show. His other siblings, including a half-brother he had not known existed, was already gathered. Each were happily married and had made new lives for themselves. Tom was on his death bed, but just as mean as ever. Facing his family was heard, especially the hateful and scheming Clare, but not nearly as hard as seeing Annabelle again! <br />Annie was alone in the world now. She owned a boardinghouse for her meager living. She had three workers, a cook and her daughter (Josefina and Carmen) and Henry (a crippled ex-ranch hand). Having Stone rent room and board from her was difficult since she still cared for him. But she needed the money. The fire that had been between them was still there and getting hotter! <br />***** An excellent conclusion to this series! This is not a story that readers will find able to set aside.

She was very good at her job because she was tenacious! <br />U.S. Marshal Quinn Diamond had been searching for Amy Ireland for over twenty years. The case was personal, possibly linked to the death of his father. He linked Amy with a friend in Chicago who had been murdered. Lisa O'Malley had handled the crime scene, so Quinn went to Lisa for help. However, by doing so, he put Lisa's life at risk! <br />Quinn had been friends with the entire O'Malley clan for years. Lisa was the one who touched a cord deep within him though. Unlike him, Lisa did not believe in the Resurrection. Her past had made it virtually impossible for her to do so.

Meara and Robert would wait for Kathleen to do so and then they would all leave together and live happily ever after. However, once Kathleen began talking to Rian, Meara and Robert deserted her! <br />When Kathleen realized she had been abandoned and was alone in a strange country, she feared telling Rian the news she had. She decided to let him believe she was his fiancé for a short while. She never expected to fall in love with him though. <br />Rian was not eager to wed after witnessing his father's second marriage. However, he felt responsible for his fiancé since he never wrote to cancel their betrothal. Meara had apparently changed over the years and seemed entirely different than he remembered. The more he was with her, the more he decided marriage would not be bad at all. However, his property (called Green Lawns) was experiencing several unfortunate accidents. Someone was out to ruin Rian. <br />Then Meara reappeared to once again shatter Kathleen's happiness. Life with Robert was awful and Meara needed the money she had told Kathleen to give to Rian. Even though Kathleen had yet to tell her new husband that she was not who he had thought, she had already turned the money over to Rian. <br />**** This one is terrific! I never really cared for Meara though. Such a snob! But that just proved to me that this author, Candace McCarthy, was talented! I could not help but fall in love with many of the co-characters. They seemed so full of life, so real! The book is very well written and flows smoothly. Perfect for Summer reading! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch	2001-08-02

He had been running on instinct for days until Callie Gabriel showed up. She obviously knew him though. She was pregnant with his child! Without letting her know of his memory loss, he made excuses to stay near her so he could learn more about himself. The more he learned, the less he liked himself and the more he cared for Callie. <br />Zeus and Hera were playing &quot;Cupid&quot;. Long ago Hera had harmed a woman named Callisto. Hera was determined to make amends by bringing true love to one of Callisto's decedents, Callie Gabriel. Her mate was to be a decedent of Ares, Armond Marceaux. <br />Bad things happened to Gabriels who married. Not only to the bride, but to the whole family. Generations have proved it! So all members of the Gabriel family were independent, all Gabriels were females, and all Gabriels gave birth to only daughters! Therefore, Callie knew her unborn child was female and would not marry Armond. Besides, Armond's work (FBI) always came before her. He left twice, without saying good-bye, and disappeared for months! <br />At the same time, someone high in command of the Atlanta division of the FBI had betrayed Armond to one of his enemies. Armond's memory loss was due to experiments of DC-909c and psychic studies. They were watching him. As his memory returned, he and Callie became targets! <br />***** WOW! A lot going on in this story! I never had a dull minute. It was not choppy (as most are with so much happening). Instead, it flowed smoothly and kept me riveted! Recommended! *****	2001-07-31

Seven year old Luke Chandler lives in the cotton fields of rural Arkansas with his parents and grandparents, in a house that's never been painted. The lack of paint is significant because it indicates a lack of money and a lower status; however, the members of this family are staunch Baptists (they have a sin-for-everything) and really good folks. Since the Chandlers rent the land on which they live, they are known as sharecroppers. <br />This story is told completely from little Luke's point of view, and he already knows that he never wants to grow up to be a farmer. His passion is baseball, and he plans to become a major player with his favorite team, The Cardinals. When this story begins, it's cotton picking time in September of 1952, and the father is hiring, at random by the side of the road, a family of &quot;hill people&quot; and a group of migrant Mexican workers to help the family harvest the cotton. This is the customary thing to do during this season, because it takes many hands and long hours to pick 80 acres of cotton before the rains come. <br />Luke has looked forward to the new people being on their farm, because he has been lonely since his young uncle went off to the war in Korea. As soon as the &quot;hill people&quot; set up their camp in the family's front yard, Luke senses trouble. The &quot;hill people&quot; have a beautiful teenage daughter, who catches the eye of the one tough guy in the Mexican camp. They also have a younger son who has a deformed arm and lacks great mental capacity. Add to this mix an older son who is truly evil with a propensity for fighting, and you have a volatile situation. <br />Luke has an urge for adventure that ultimately scars him forever by the secretes he finds himself keeping. He witnesses brutal fights and becomes totally enamored by the beautiful teenage girl. During most of this book, little Luke has secrets that affect everyone's lives. <br />***** I simply can't say enough great things about this book! I hope that Mr. Grisham will continue to write legal thrillers, but I also hope he will write a sequel to A Painted House. Having been a Grisham fan for many years, I began impatiently waiting for A Painted House when I first heard that it was coming out. After reading this book, I'm absolutely certain that John Grisham's talent knows no bounds. *****	2001-06-17

The killer raped the wife, Carolyn, and left her barely alive. When she recovered from her physical injuries, Carolyn identified the Hispanic male attacker from a photo line up and a police line up. She even recalled the dragon tattoo on his genitals. He was Aurelio Estebanoza. <br />Victoria Kinsey was the D.A. on the case. She had a teenage son named Paul, who was the center of her life. Her (soon-to-be) fiancé was Evan Tanner and he was selected to take the vacant Judge position.

Lady Honoria Dunster had just snagged a marriage proposal from Adrian Linsley, Viscount Marquand, when it all began. Adrian's father, the Earl of Chittenden, had lost all he owned while gambling with Lord Hertford. The only thing the Earl had left was Woolsey Hall. In a desperate chance to win it all back, the Earl agreed to Lord Hertford's offer of an all-or-nothing wager on a round of golf. <br />Adrian had no choice but to honor his father's wager to play against Hertford even though he knew nothing about golf. He went to Scotland to be tutored in the game. He and his caddy, Derry, clashed on sight. It did not help matters that Lady Honoria and her parents decided to arrive either. <br />Miss Derrien Edwards had her own reasons not to trust Englishmen, especially ones with titles. Yet she hated Lord Hertford enough to let Hugh talk her into helping tudor the Viscount. Only Hugh knew the caddy, Derry, was really her. Botany and golf were not normal for a female to study, hence the Derry disguise as she grew up. She also did not want to like the &quot;bloodless&quot; Viscount. Yet the longer the two were together, the more they found in common. <br />**** This story has a strange twist to the normal stereotype of Regency Romances! Golf!

Even though the oldest son was named Erskine (&quot;Quill&quot;), she was to marry the younger son named Peter. Quill had a head injury some years ago and rhythm, for any amount of time (such as making love or horseback riding), caused him to suffer a severe migraine for the next 3-5 days. Therefore, he was considered lame. If a man could not make love to a wife, then he could not have a child, or heir. So Peter would have to marry Gabby. <br />Peter was considered perfect by the Ton. He found Gabby to be too talkative, have too curvy a figure, and no sense of style. In fact, he disliked everything about her. Quill thought just the opposite of Gabby and was determined to claim her himself! Her love was worth anything, including nauseating migraines! <br />At the same time, the East India Trading Company and England's Foreign Affairs believed Gabby knew the whereabouts of the missing Indian Prince, Kao Rasi. Kao was only 10 years old and was to be a pawn in the Indian government. Gabby would never reveal she knew where Kao was or her part in his disappearance. <br />*** No gripping suspense, just a sweet love story. I felt the urge to slap the hero and heroine often though. The co-characters, Lady Sophie and Lady Sylvia, were a delight! I often found myself smiling or chuckling at them. This one is not the author's best work, but still highly enjoyable. ***	2001-06-11

I keep telling myself that this is a work of fiction.

There they were guaranteed three meals a day and were expected to sit out their lives with nothing to look forward to except daily boredom and a sagging bed. These women, Grace Singleton, Amelia Declose, and Hannah Parrish come from very different backgrounds. However, they soon become fast friends and make the brave decision to take off together on a little trip. Needless to say, their grown children are not happy with this sudden spurt of independence, but each of these women soon learn that they have skills, talents, and a depth of spirit that they never believed was possible. Later, what started out as a bit of adventure became a turning point for each of them. They made the decision to put the boarding house behind them and begin new lives together in a sadly rundown farmhouse near Asheville, North Carolina. <br />The reader follows these ladies as they build on each other's talents and transform the farmhouse into the house of their dreams. It was here that these three women reclaimed their productive lives and wove themselves into a new community. I found myself overjoyed at each of their successes and profoundly sad at their difficulties. This book was a joy to read and I became totally absorbed in the daily lives of these three women as they found self-acceptance and the courage to do the unexpected. In so doing, they found that it was their love and friendship for each other that was the most important ingredient in their lives. <br />***** This book was SO good!

Long ago a meteor fell onto Earth with a magical, metallic form within it. Witnessing its power, it was forged into the (thought of) holy form of a triangle and a temple was formed to protect it. A city grew around the temple, The People of the Light were there. During an invasion, the nine planets aligned and the power of the Triangle was shown. Realizing no mortal should possess such power, the High Priest ordered it cut into two smaller triangles. One stayed at the temple. The other was hidden at the end of the Earth. However, the Craftsman who cut the Triangle in half secretly made a highly advanced device. It could serve as a guide to find the hidden piece, and preserve the Triangle's powers for future generations. It was a magic clock. <br />Lady Lara Croft was much like her father had been. Beginning with a clock he had hidden for her to find someday and tales he had told her as a child, she must set out to save the world. The Illuminati, a secret group of powerful people, were out to find the two triangle pieces before the planets aligned (which happened only once every 5,000 years). At her side was Mr. Hillary, her butler, and Bryce, her technician. Two tombs must be entered and survived or the world would belong to Manfred Powell. <br />***** I made that brief as possible, but left out much to do it. Even though the movie, as of now, has not been released, I can already tell that the book gives much more insight to Lara and the adventure in which she finds herself. However, many scenes have the potential to be much more vivid and exciting on the big screens! I found it to be a wonderful book! I plan to be in the theater, with a huge group of friends, on its first night out!	2001-05-29

Once done, the Marquess would become a powerful political ally for Anthony and would ensure Anthony's child labor reform measures would be passed. <br />Morwenna Halliwell was a descendant of Morgan le Fay, the Enchantress. Abandon was enshrouded in legends that all who lived there believed. The people looked to Morwenna to change Anthony's mind about selling Abandon. The plans of the Marquess would scare off all the fish and the villagers would starve. <br />At first, all believed Anthony to be cold. None knew he could not stop the sell without killing hundreds or thousands of children. Not even when he fell under Morwenna's innocent spell; or was it a spell from another source? There was a raven that warned of danger and considered to be King Arthur. Lilies were pulled up by their roots only to grow back within minutes. Fairies and Wee People seemed to be everywhere. A strange book with messages and an even stranger white cat kept appearing and disappearing with odd timing. There was a self proclaimed dark sorcerer to cause trouble, strange sounds and sightings, and dark mists that were so thick you could not see your hand in front of your face! Between all the odd things going on and his attraction to Morwenna, Anthony never stood a chance! <br />***** I do believe that Jillian Hunter could be an Enchantress herself!

Fort Walsh was close to the Canada/United States border. The American Sioux were on the run. The battle of Little Big Horn was fresh in the minds of all. Canada granted sanctuary to the Sioux as long as they obeyed only a few rules. The Sioux easily agreed. <br />Sitting Bull was the chief and led his people wisely. The Blackfoot tribe was nearby but each tribe respected the other during these uncertain times ... to an extent. Dancing Bird was the niece of Sitting Bull and unlike most of the other women in the tribe. Acting as interpreter, she and Braden got to know each other well. They fell in love. However, Braden was not given permission to wed and the United States Government was interfering too often. The future of the Sioux tribe was unclear, as was any possible future for a relationship between Dancing Bird and Braden. <br />**** In the first book Colen and Maggie were the main characters with Brayden as the Irishman co-character. In this second book about the Mounties, Colen and Maggie are seen a couple of times which makes the story feel more realistic. Brayden's story was fascinating to me! The author changed history a bit for the sake of the story, but not much. The story was well written and flowed smoothly. An excellent story by the talented pen of Kathryn Fox!	2001-05-29

She made an emergency landing on a muddy runway and headed toward the lone ranch house in hopes of warmth and a phone. She never recognized the man who answered the door. <br />Retired and reclusive country singer Antonio Carrera thought the reporters had found him again and dreaded pulling up the roots of his teenage son and daughter again. When he found out Julia really was who she claimed to be, he calmed down and actually became friendly. The two were attracted to each other from the start and Julia stayed many hours longer than expected. But she eventually had to return to her practice in Phoenix. <br />The way Julia found out who Tony really was came about like a punch in the gut! It would take some fast talking and sneaky strategy from Tony's two teens to bring this perfect couple together! <br /> A refreshing new type of twist in Romance! Brava Diana Garcia! This one is &quot;A Keeper&quot; for your shelves to read and reread in the future! I figured out that I was hooked from the first sentence when I tried to go cook dinner, only to find out that my eyes had a mind of their own. I could not stop reading! Excellent story!	2001-05-09

Nothing would stop that, but he planned to take quite a few low-lifes with him! Eckman was a man who had it all planned out and was cold-blooded enough to do it. <br />Roosevelt Holmes had raped, maimed, and/or killed over thirty-four women, girls, and boys. Yet his sentence was only two years. He was released early, for good behavior, thinking he could easily continue if he was just a bit more careful. However, he was not the only one counting down his days and hours until freedom. <br />Nancy Rausch kept tabs on Holmes. She planned her revenge carefully, all the way down to how she would castrate him. Chris would help her get him. Chris also had planned revenge...on the world! Chris had set up a way to rid the Earth of much of its scum. A bit of IVG-5 introduced into the Minneapolis waterworks would work for starts. <br />***** Never have I read a book like this one. We have all heard of Hannibal. He was labeled (correctly, I might add) a Cannibal. Now meet those with the label Sociopath. Many with this mental disorder get rich because they do things &quot;normal&quot; people would not dare. Others end up poor, due to the same reason, or in prison. But some are like this! <br />Here is a book that will keep you up late into the night reading! You will never look at the strangers around you the same way again!

Emilio DeLeon's code had been used to embezzle a large amount of money from the bank in which he was Vice President. The board of directors hired L &amp; H Investigations (at the Bank President's request) to either find proof of Emilio's guilt or to find the true thief. <br />Mia Hartmann and John Lennox were the two private investigators. Mia went undercover as Emilio's temporary secretary. John covered the computer and paperwork from the office. The more Mia got to know Emilio, the more convinced she was of his innocense. Things began to point into another direction. (Good thing, since Mia and Emilio were VERY attracted to each other!) Mia and John continued their investigation at a &quot;jiggle bar&quot; known as Fantasy Island, where more went on behind the scenes than people could ever guess. <br />The lies, omissions, and other factors worked both for and against the blooming romance between Mia and Emilio. When he found out who Mia really was, Mia could not help but wonder if he could forgive the necessity of her lies. <br />***** A hot romance that will capture its readers almost immediately and drag them into the world of high tech crime.

She had lived her entire life on the ranch with her brothers. She knew the dangers of rodeos! Since Davis intended to become a cowboy, they had no future together. <br />***** To me, Charlotte was more of an Imp than an Elf.

Every month Charles Harrison Ashford, Viscount Ashmead, would ask Ada to marry him. Every month Miss Ada Westlake would decline. Being neighbors for so long, Ada thought of &quot;Chas&quot; as a brother. Ada thought Charles saw his proposals as rescuing a damsel in distress. He was overflowing in money. She was impoverished. However, that was not the case! He loved Ada deeply and had no idea how to make her see it. Her most recent declining of his marriage proposal had him drowning his sorrows in a local tavern. By morning, he had an awful headache and he could not find the sack containing Prelieu's coins. <br />Leo Tobin was Charles' illegitimate brother. They were as close as brothers could ever hope to be. Leo and Charles did missions for the government. Leo did his mainly by sea. In fact, many thought he was the ring leader for a smuggling group. Prelieu was a Frenchman who was to give valuable information to Charles for the Crown and then use the coins for a new start on life. But Prelieu had not shown up and the sack of coins somehow ended up high in one of Ada's apple trees. <br />While shaking the tree for apples, coins rained down. Thinking smugglers were using her land and set the money there as payment, she was determined to return it! It was blood money! Her sister could care less for anything but making her opera and paintings. Her sister-in-law, Jane (widowed), and Jane's freeloading uncle wanted to spend it on luxuries. Charles begged her to use it for debts and kept harping about marriage. And poor Ada was having her blinders jerked off, due to the commotions, and was seeing Chas (thanks in part to Leo) in a totally new and confusing way! <br />*** This one is set in one of England's most uncertain and dangerous times of history. It was a bit slow to begin, but once started the story flowed smoothly. (I wanted to whap Ada on the head a few times though.) The co-characters were just as great to watch as the main ones were! I was utterly charmed by Leo! ***	2001-05-09

Angus did it for immunity for Anne and his mother. Two men in love with the same Scottish Amazon, Wild Rhuad Annie. Both willing to die for her and probably will. <br />**** This is not Marsha Canham's best, but it is still a very good read. The author shows the love, hate, and anguish the people must have felt in that time of history. In my personal opinion, there was too much time spent on war strategies. However, I do not see how the story could have been told otherwise. After all, the main characters were in the thick of it all. The author did a marvelous job creating this one! ****	2001-04-29

They are Buffalo Dreamer, a Lakota holy woman, and Rising Eagle, her husband. Their children are now grown. Rising Eagle still did not know he had a son in the white world, from a previous captive, that was raised by Florence, whose Lakota name was Fall Leaf Woman.

But white trappers stole it from her. Until it made its way back to her, all who owned it would have bad luck! <br />The author followed history as she wrote too!

The biggest problem was the brother, Flynn, who often disappeared to side with the rebellion. <br />Maeve vowed to hate Kieran. She wanted freedom for Ireland, but not at the cost of lives. Kieran loved battle. That was obvious. Yet she saw him help her sisters when he did not have to. Slowly, Kieran and Maeve would learn about each other.

Anyone who knows me understands that I seldom read non-fiction. The few non-fiction books I accept for my book review site are reviewed by my other reviewers. However, the title of this one was so unexpected that I found myself giving it a second glance, then a third, and a fourth. Curiosity being a weakness of mine, I opened it. I only wanted to convince myself that, to me, it would be boring. This would put an end to all my curiosities and I could get someone else to review it. Instead, I found myself reading the first page and never putting the book down except to grab a soda. <br />Dr. Alma Halbert Bond seems to share my weakness. She wanted to know why one out of every two marriages ended with divorce. Did the divorced women love their husbands when they married them? Did they marry because they were &quot;a couple&quot; and family or friends expected them to? Did society press them into it? Did they marry someone like their parents for security instead of love? Was there a connection between an unhappy childhood and a failed marriage? Dr. Bond interviewed 71 divorced women for answers! <br />The book is broken down to several categories and each have sub-categories. Dr. Bond covers:  <br />The Physical Abusers,  The Verbal Abusers,   The Withholders,   The Need For Space,  The Unfaithful,  The Abandoned Ones,   The Homosexuals,  Married For The Wrong Reasons,   The Narcissists,  He Changed After We Married,   The Control Freaks, and  The Good Marriage.  <br />All her findings are within these pages! Using her experience of 30 years in psychoanalytic practice, Dr. Bond created a book that people (men or women) should read if they have been divorced, considering divorce, having problems in their marriage, or about to marry! <br />I proudly submit this book to my viewers and consider it to be highly recommended reading!	2001-04-11

Jack even found a way to get around the law too. Jack Kathio, the gambler in love, was going for the ultimate prize! <br />**** Here is a fascinating story with an even bigger moral. I won't tell what it is though. Jack is no Hero and Mia is no Heroine, which made this tale unique to say the least! In fact, Jack may very well be one of the most realistic characters I have ever read. The author obviously did thorough research into making this character! I was appalled of Jack at the beginning. Yet as the book continued, my attitude toward Jack, and a few others, did too. I am very happy to recommend this book to the public.

Lord Sebastian Whitbury thought himself in love with Natalie Talbot. She refused to marry him until he made his fortune. His quick fortune would be made with the arrival of a single ship. <br />That was why he was on Charlotte Deems's cliffs when her two year old son, Oscar, needed help. However, by saving the widow's son, he could be identified and hanged as a smuggler. To keep her silent, he had her wait with him each night on the cliffs for the ship. She could not turn him in if she were an accomplice, even if an unwilling one. Time together made them become friends and an attraction grew. Sebastian no longer knew what his feelings for Natalie were, but the feelings for Charlotte were becoming even more dangerous than smuggling!<br />***** This one will not bore its readers! Each time things seem to be calming down, more trouble erupts. Well worth you time to read!	2001-03-20

Dr. Cherijo Torin had come to terms with finding out she was a clone of her &quot;father&quot;. She learned to adjust to the fact that her Jorenian lifemate, Kao Torin, was dead. She was even doing well as a Healer among her adopted Jorenian race on the ship Sunlace. But the ship had been sabotaged and the Jorenian Warriors were out for blood! The culprit would be found and the right of ClanKill would take place! This meant the guilty one would be disemboweled (while he still breathed) by Jorenian claws. The Jorenians had many different decorations made out of the entails before the body was displayed as a warning to others not to hurt anyone of the Clans! Since Cherijo had been the Chosen of Kao, she was now of Clan Torin. Thus, any harm to her meant death by ALL of the Clans. <br />Reeves from Kevarzangia Two (book one) returned as well. So he is among the fighting when Dr. Grey Veil and the League (and bounty hunters and merchs, etc) come with weapons blazing! <br />***** This book is just as WONDERFUL as book one was! It has several surprises and twists to keep the reader off center. I especially recommend it to all the Honor Harrington fans out there! Cherijo's story is a masterpiece and S.L. Viehl will (if not already) become a huge name in Sci-Fi/Fantasy circles!	2001-03-20

She met Kate, Cooper, and Annie at an Equinox gathering. She seemed to be starved for acceptance, love, and friendship. She was hard to trust though. After all, she had stolen Annie's spell book and did a spell to steal Scott away from Kate. <br />Soon the three find out that Sasha's whole life story was all lies ... and why. <br />**** In my opinion, book two was much better than the first. It left me with high hopes that the third will be great too! The only thing I did not like was that the book stopped suddenly and left me hanging. I much prefer no cliff hangers when I close a book. However, the story flowed smoothly and the author beautifully described the changes in Kate's life, as well as, how Kate matures. Kate is not my favorite character of the series though. I am hoping I get to see some stories in view-points from Annie or Cooper soon. ****	2001-03-18

However, Galen did not even take the time to consult Edward before disappearing. At Durance Guarde, Galen planned to search within himself for the meaning of his recent visions, without endangering anyone he cared for. <br />Lady Honor Jennings was now a widow. To avoid her greedy In-Laws and a forced new marriage to those who coveted her lands and wealth, Honor planned to become a Vowess. She returned to her father's home. Her father, Sir Walter Stafford, expected her to remarry also. But was in no rush. <br />The Staffords and the de Marlowes never really decided who rightfully owned Durance Guarde. Honor had hoped to build her own manor there and print books. Finding Galen there led to several clashes of will! The two are thrown together during one of history's darkest hours! Galen and Honor must find out who murdered her husband and stop the royal assassination Galen has visions of. <br />**** Suzanne Robinson has succeeded in weaving a magical new spell for her readers in this, her latest story!

The Death Goddess, Hel, had sent several Hel-warriors to slay the traitor King Nidhug over the centuries. None had succeeded. Nidhug was not only a king, but also a warrior and sorcerer.

She had been a fighter/slave in King Nidhug's arena and had led the other slaves in a mighty rebellion for freedom. Eventually Nidhug found her and forced her to watch as he killed her husband and son. He had then left her to die with her unborn child, never thinking that Hel would use her in the forth-coming battle. <br />Bloodsong had made a deal with Hel. She would kill King Nidhug and regain the War Skull. In return, Hel would free Bloodsong and Guthrun (the baby that had died when Bloodsong had) to live a normal life. With the aid of a witch and two former arena slaves, the biggest magical battle was about to be fought and the battle cry will be heard again! \\"Bloodsong and Freedom!\\" <br />*** Fans of Red Sonya, Raven, Xena, and other MUST have this one!

As a lark, she did the spell to make a boy, Scott, fall in love with her. It worked, but now every boy in school was in love with her. She also cast a spell to help her ace a Chemistry test. She aced it, but that back fired too. Noticing another name that had checked out the book several times, Annie Crandall. So Kate went to Annie for help. Perhaps together they could figure out how to stop the problems Kate had started in the school. <br />Annie had gotten tired of checking out the spell book, so she bought her own copy at the Crones' Circle, an off beat book shop owned by witches. But her spells had backfired too. She was still getting rats in her kitchen to prove it! So they went to the last name in the book who had checked it out, Cooper Rivers. <br />Cooper Rivers had witches in her family tree, though she would never admit it to others. She reluctantly joined the attempt to correct everything though, with the help of the witches who owned the book shop. All three join forces to cancel out all the spells and end up becoming close friends. Only Kate's other group of friends (the ones she had before the first love spell was cast) was putting on some serious peer pressure. <br />** I purchased books 1 - 3 in hopes that this series would be as great as the series &quot;Regeneration&quot; and any L.J. Smith book. This first book leaves me wondering if I wasted my money. I am sure this book will appeal to others; however, nothing seemed to flow smoothly to me. It was choppy. The characters did not seem real to me. It did stress how careful one must be to understand something fully before jumping right in!

Then a fate filled, middle of the night, unexpected event happened and Olivia met Lord Neville Hawke. The meeting was much less than friendly. Olivia left him, too upset to remember her journal, which Neville found and read without guilt. <br />Lord Neville Hawke had thought Olivia a mistress and the journal where she kept her information on possible future protectors. Upon returning the journal he was proven wrong and found himself very disappointed that she was really a lady of quality. Even so, he could not get Olivia out of his mind. The attraction between them was too strong. But Olivia hated him and he had a horrible secret that kept him from even considering courting her. <br />**** An excellent read! This is pure romance at its finest! I adore books where the hero will do anything to marry her (even compromise her) and the heroine is attached but has reasons to deny or hate him. Fabulous! ****	2001-02-12

Leah Harris, of the Seattle Police Department, was called out at two o'clock in the morning. She was the lead of the &quot;HIT&quot; Team (Homicide Investigation Team) that was assigned. The victim had been a college girl, Christina Herrera. Her body had been slashed several times. Investigator Frank Milkovich of I.A. (Internal Affairs) was called in when a photo of a copy, John Darby, was found in Christina's home. That was bad since Leah had just left Darby in her bed when she'd been called to the homicide. Since the time of death could not be pinpointed, Darby was considered a suspect without an alibi. <br />Worse, the victim's house seemed to be part of a Colombian Drug Cell. Christina looked as though she had been &quot;house-sitting&quot; to protect the Cartel's hidden money. Her uncle was a V.P. of a local bank and he seemed to have many cops on his payroll! It was an explosive situation which WILL only get worse! <br />***** AWESOME AUTHOR! Authors are told to write what they know about. The little detailed facts that only insiders know make the stories more real to the readers. Well, Sheriff Mike Hawley does exactly that! This story is an outstanding piece of work! In fact, I believe Mike Hawley may be to Homicide Investigation novels what John Grisham is to Legal novels! I lost a lot of sleep because I simply could not put the book down. It was non-stop action and mystery from the first paragraph. Michael A. Hawley is destined to hit the best seller list in the future! Keep your eyes on this author, Readers! *****	2000-11-03

Star Dreamer has the Sight, like her grandmother before her. She fears her own daughter, Morning Moon, has it as well. Star Dreamer considers the Sight a curse, especially when she foresees her husband die and could not save him. In hopes of hiding her daughter from the Spirits in a crowded place, she goes with Colonel Grady O'Brien (Emma's father in the last book) to St. Louis to look after Renny. Star Dreamer faces many prejudices and makes a friend in a free slave named Hattie. <br />Grady and Renny slowly must build trust between themselves. Grady is grateful for Star's company. Renny had spent much time with the Sioux and considered Morning Moon her sister. An attraction between Grady and Star begins but both fear of the consequences of falling in love. In addition, there is a ring of men kidnaping and selling free slaves. The leader is known only as The Dragon. The Dragon wants Hattie and Star to be next on his growing list. <br />*** Book five in the &quot;WHITE&quot; series! Author, Susan Edwards, still has the talent of hooking her readers in the first paragraph and selfishly holding onto them until the last page has been turned! Each book in the &quot;WHITE&quot; series is a story in itself; however, seeing familiar characters makes the stories seem much more realistic! Highly recommended reading! ***	2000-11-02

This is the story of José Gaspar from his early childhood on the banks of the Guadalquivir River in Spain, to his last moments of life near Florida. The reader follows the observant lad through the Naval Academy, his leadership times, and his pirate career. The reader witnesses his true love, Dona Rosalita Santiago, and rejoices with them. Then witnesses his overwhelming tragedies. <br />I often found myself highlighting areas of interest and jotting down notes of wisdom, like the art of foot massage. I found the hero, José Gaspar, to be too pure of mind often, but the life he led was too fascinating to enable me to put down the book. <br />I believe this book to be a must to those who reside in Florida of The United States of America or anywhere in Spain, as well as, all who have interest in the history of pirates. Very interesting reading between these pages! <br />Now, apart from the book itself, I am told that Gasparilla Sarsaparilla (a non-alcoholic beverage that comes from the book) may well be available at the NFL Super Bowl in January 2001. The Super Bowl is scheduled to be in Tampa, Florida, along with the Gasparilla Pirate Fest celebration! So two fabulous events will be happening in that area in January!

She is already Captain of her ship, Fury, when the story began. I watched her have affairs, not all of them men, and witnessed her try to keep those she cared for safe from harm. She was hard  when she needed to be and though tired of death, did not hesitate at  killing when she had to. She killed not only when her life was in danger,  but also to show her strength, such as keelhauling a crewmate when he stole  booty from the others. <br />I was very pleased with the ending as well, which  I will keep mute about. All-in-all, I will highly recommend this book to  everyone. This is not a mushy romance book. Neither male nor female  audience was targeted. It is one that I believe both sexes will enjoy  thoroughly!	2000-07-11

Following the investigation, the officer  discoveres that two of them had a definant connection, which made him  persue that somewhere, they were all connected. He has help, one officer  from another county, a woman whom he becomes involved with in a personal  manner as well as professional, and several male officers from his own  precinct.

So OK, I figured &quot;Get  Even&quot; was great, but the rest would be rehashes of the tricks in his  first book... NOT SO! He is undoubtedly one of the wicked and sneaky minded  men on earth! I would NOT want to ever be on the wrong side of this man, so  OF CORSE I am gonna give him rave reviews! :) <br />These books are very  funny, packed full of info, and offer ideas to get your own creative juices  flowing.

(Let's all say  it together now: &quot;If you get caught doing some of this stuff, you WILL  go to jail!&quot;)  The Down Side:<br />As expected, his first book &quot;Get  Even&quot; is a bit outdated in the computer areas, sometimes referring to  &quot;punch cards&quot;, but each book is more &quot;updated&quot; than the  last.

Now, You might say &quot;Why Buy the book, I can find these mods on line free&quot;. I have a junk pile of  burned up radios and scanners I'll sell you if you believe that to be the  case. I have literally burned up scores of radios following &quot;On  line&quot; advice. The Most recent was almost an expensive 10 meter Radio,  something kept saying to me &quot;This isn't right&quot; so I stopped and  drew out the circuit myself.. Bingo.. I had almost torched this baby.  <br />You won't have that problem with Jerry's book, his designs and mods are  based on sound, proven mods and practices on the more popular scanners of  our time. He has good color photos, and walks you through each mod step by  step. He gives you a list of tools needed and how to use them. <br />I  personally enjoyed the section on antennas. Antennas are an often  overlooked part of radios, which are probably more crucial than the radio  itself! Jerry covers many antenna types, as well as &quot;Stealth  Antennas&quot;.

Not only are the topics of Firearms covered, but also how to  use knives, flashlights, and your body as a weapon in the dark.<br />After a  late night &quot;can't put it down&quot; reading of this book, I have to  say that if you aren't using the dark to your advantage, you are seriously  handicapping yourself!

I'm almost afraid to put this  one online, so let me say that it IS ONLY for Academic Study! While not as  detailed and comprehensive as some other books I have reviewed, what it  does cover is &quot;In your face&quot;, down and dirty, and from my  experience as an Electrical Engineer, VERY workable. How to crack answering  machines and make free calls are among the listed topics, Paladin makes it  clear that this is for Academic Study only. Brother, if you are caught  doing anything this book shows, you WILL go to jail!<br />Don't let the name  fool you, this book is as modern and up-to-date as it can be. The &quot;Old  Fashioned&quot; refers to the type of person who gets out and does the  spying himself. I spent a few hours tracing the schematics of a few of the  circuits shown, and I have to say, he's got some clever ways to get around  modern problems... Can't find the device you need? No problem, he shows you  several ways to build one. I consider it a book to get before any books are  banned in this country, cause this one will be on the list!	2000-07-07

So Gareth washed his hands of it all and left for his  waiting government assignment. <br />After three years, Susannah returned to  London from Bengal as a widow.

To stop this, Christy went to London as Lady Flora Randall to seduce  her husband. With his bairn in her belly she could return to Glenmoor in  triumph! Glenmoor would have an heir, Sinjun would never know Flora had  really been his wife and he would live happily in London unawares, and  Calum's plans would be thwarted. <br />All went as planned until a pregnant  Christy returned home to Glenmoor.

Upon arriving in Ireland, Michael has some strange tales to tell, about an old  man that only he and Sean (and now Kelly) can see and a stone found just  outside the Druid's circle. Something evil has been aroused by Jack Mullen,  a man who sees visions, and it looks like it will be up to the three  cousins, with the help of elder Hugh O'Donnell to see that this evil is  sent back where it came from. Hopefully in the process they can also rescue  one of their ancestors who was placed under an evil spell. <br />*** This  story has much Irish history in it and some of the legends. Once again the  author uses an old diary to tell some of the story. The Druid Stone is  definitely a book for older teens as there are scenes in this story that  would be inappropriate for younger children. This is a spooky story that  should keep the reader interested until that last page is turned. I did  have a problem with it as it justifies keeping secrets from parents. ***	2000-04-27

His determination to capture her alive was fueled by the fact that he believed her to be the mistress of the outlaw, Jack Cannon. Ash had been after  Cannon ever since Cannon had murdered his wife and unborn child many years  ago. <br />Tamsin was running for her life! Sam had stolen her two  thoroughbred horses. She had planned to slip into his stables and steal  them back! She found him dead, shot in the back. The Judge, Sam's brother,  saw Tamsin running from the stables with two horses and claimed she had  killed Sam. Tamsin had witnessed Sam and his brother fighting over a woman  just a few hours prior. If he was at the stables at this time of night,  that proved HE killed his own brother over a female. But since he was the  Judge, she knew she could never prove it or get a fair trial. <br />*** Okay,  I do not think I gave anything away. I believe Readers will easily figure  out who the guilty party is, but that is such a small part of the book that  it does not matter. Tasmin is a fabulous character who, I am happy to say,  is smart and full of guts! No whimpering and stupid heroine here! I thought  her to be wonderful! There is more action than it sounds like too. Toss in  some renegade Indians, several outlaws, and even some wild animals. Now  THAT is guaranteed action! I am proud to recommend this one to Historical  Romance lovers everywhere! ***	2000-04-24

Edward was Geoffrey's half brother. He had loved Evangeline, but she loved and married Geoffrey. In his madness he had their house set on fire when Catherine and Victoria were but one year old. A servant found  Catherine up that night and instinctively hid when she heard men coming  into the house. Once the fire was set, she saw she would be unable to alert  the rest of the family. To save the baby, she fled into the night. She gave  the baby to an Irish outlaw before she died in hopes of finding a home for  the baby. <br />The outlaw, Sean O'Banyon, took her home to his wife to raise  her as his own. Catherine grew up with two older brothers and in a family  of pirates. Needless to say, she learned many skills females were not  suppose to have. As for Victoria, the family survived the house fire.  Everyone believed Catherine and the servant had died in the fire. Victoria  grew up as an only child with an intelligent head for business, like her  father and a lovely lady. The sisters never knew they had a twin somewhere  else in the world. <br />Catherine became known as &quot;Lady Cat&quot; a  notorious female pirate, who had no parallel! Miles Grayson captured Lady  Cat and was amazed to find she looked exactly like his fiancé, Victoria,  who had recently been abducted. An idea was born to find Victoria with  Cat's help. Thus begins the incredible story of twin sisters and the  romance they find with two amazing men. <br />*** Readers, that is the basis  of the story. To tell more would let out too many surprises. Edward would  unknowingly give both much grief and pain. However, he would also  unknowingly bring the family back together. I was enchanted by all the  twists and surprises within the complicated plot the author, Susan Grace,  had created. I do not begin to tell all the trouble and amazing things.  This is an incredible tale that all romance readers would do well to keep  an eyeout for! ***	2000-04-24

He had banished his son long ago to America. Since there was no other to inherit the title, and so many depended on it, he sent the title to his grandson, Lad, in America. He had Diana write out his wishes of Lad coming to claim the title, care  for the castle and people, and marry Diana. <br />P. Lad Walker had lost his  parents and brothers. Some to the war, some due to other causes. He was  urged to go see the land his father had spoken so much about, even though  Lad had his own estate to run in America. Once there he fell in love with  Diana. She returned the feeling. However, she would never leave Kerlain and  he could not imagine staying. None of the people liked him since he was  American. None would listen to his American methods of putting the castle  and its land back on its feet. To make matters worse, he lost the estate to  a man to Eoghan in a card game during a time of grieving. He did not know  how much the man coveted his wife. Lad had thought the man in only friend  in the country. <br />Diana was being blackmailed by Eoghan. Eoghan gave her  three years to pay back the sum he named for regaining Kerlain. The hardest  thing Diana ever had to do was send Lad away to find the funds. If she left  England with her husband, Eoghan would see it that the estate went to ruin  and that the tenants, down to the last child, would die of starvation.  Diana had to agree that if Lad, the new Earl, could not pay the sum, then  she would willingly divorce Lad, marry him, and be his wife in all ways.  This bargain she could not reveal to her husband though. If Lad were to  know, he would kill Eoghan. Lad, being American, would not even get a  trial. <br />*** Incredible story! Diana is such a brave and strong woman. Lad  was her match in every way. Author, Mary Spencer, concluded this marvelous  trilogy with a big climax. A keeper for your book shelves! ***	2000-04-24

Granny had told Drake his parents had legally wed before his birth and would give him the proof when the time was right. But his father had come to take him to  Eyre where Drake's younger, half-brother, Waldo, was named as the  legitimate heir. Drake grew up labeled a bastard. He vowed to someday be a  knight, despite his label. <br />Raven had loved Drake ever since she reached  puberty. But Drake only had eyes for her sister, Daria. Daria betrays his  love for her, but Raven is thought to blame. For several more reasons  (which I cannot divulge or it would ruin the story for you. Sorry.) Drake  is banished. He becomes the King's champion and once he has land and title,  he finds the chance for a bit of revenge against Waldo. <br />On Waldo's  wedding night, Drake claims Raven's maidenhead and then kidnaps her. As for  Raven, she has every right to fear her new husband, Waldo. He meant to see  Raven as dead as his first wife, but his half-brother was to die first!  <br />*** An exciting story of honor, courage, and love as only Connie Mason  can write!

Since Liz had attacked some sort of diplomat the year before and was not allowed in England, she snuck in and was staying with Ralph and his sister, Hillary, at the Hatchett estate. Hillary is convinced that Liz  is tired due to a vampire draining her blood. So Hillary and Bradstreet  begin a vampire hunt and is staking the newly dead at their wakes (or  anyone who even LOOKS dead!) <br />There is also a caped highway man on a  horse. He is very nice! He even paid for the damage he did when he shot a  car while he was holding it up! Last, but not least, there is the male  kidnapper who keeps appearing as absurd characters, like Margaret Thatcher  who works at &quot;the OTHER Scotland Yard&quot;. Not only were his  characters outrageous, but the disguises kept falling off! <br />A hilarious  book of British Humor that had me chuckling at some parts and laughing out  loud at others. I do not believe anyone in a bad mood could stay that way  while reading this one! Wonderful!	2000-02-01

Art is a lieutenant just back in the States from Nam. He had done his BA at Oklahoma University and was returning to teach and finish his masters. This book is one year of Art's life as he begins to see himself and the world as it really is. The picture  is not pretty. <br />Anyone old enough to remember the 1960's, or to have been  one who had to serve in the war, will thoroughly understand and empathize  with Art. Anyone who does not know what the 2S Deferment is, will get a  little understanding of it and how many used it to their advantage. The  author, Ken Kottka, does not insult the Reader's intelligence and go into  detail. Personally, I liked that. <br />A word of warning. This book has much  sex, violence, adult situations, all types of substance abuse, and of  language. Never say you were not warned!	2000-01-12

Wonderfully told story on how a woman married for years suddenly finds out her husband is gay. The whole book began looking like two friends of the opposite sex out for a night out on the town together. She, wanting to know  what his gay night life was like, got him to take her with him. But they  are really married. <br />Then chapter one takes you back into time to tell  the tale from the beginning. It was fascinating to watch Michael come to  terms with being gay. I was horrified for Emily as she found out the truth,  even though I knew it was coming. <br />The author shows exactly what I  believe it must be like to find myself in this situation. The question,  &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; is not an easy one to answer.  However, Lisa Rogak pulls me, the reader, along with her with her humor and  was of facing facts.

In truth, he was under  orders by the Fay King, himself, to keep an eye on Clarice. <br />The most I  can tell you without revealing the surprises, yet to help you understand  what this book is about and whether you would enjoy it, is that the Fay  King needed Clarice as a pawn due to a war in the Fay world. Dominic was to  be her jailer and guardian, because the King's enemy was trying to kidnap  Clarice for different reasons. <br />Full of magic, faeries, and a few  mythical beings, this is the ULTIMATE of Super Natural Romance books!	1999-12-31

He marries another generous woman  named Ellie. As time goes by, Robb's career bring enormous successes and  money is no longer a concern. However, soon money is all that matters. Robb  never understands that cash in the bank is not the same as owning as much  as possible. <br />Belva Plain also shows the effects all this has on Ellie,  his two children, as well as the the girl he left behind all those years  ago.

Sparks flew immediately between Arledge and Ellen Heyward, who was struggling to simply  survive and protect her sister, Pam. The sisters were forced to flee to  Columbia and reside with a relative. However, they were hardly there before  General Sherman's march on Columbia (Feb. 1865) happened. <br />*** Here is a  tale that shows the author's deep research and knowledge on her topic! It  is bold and authentic in historical detail and rich in colorful characters!  Miriam Freeman Rawl shows the trials women like Ellen and Pam had to  survive through during this hard time of America's past. It also reminds us  that even among holocausts and its rubble aftermath, love can still be  found. In my opinion, this author has succeeded in creating a story to win  the hearts of readers everywhere. A MUST for people who enjoyed \\"Gone With  The Wind\\"! ***	1999-12-13
