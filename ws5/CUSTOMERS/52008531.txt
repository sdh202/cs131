It is the reason the book earned 3 stars from me at all.  However the organization of the book is difficult to follow, the table of contents has no pages and the \\"chapter/section\\" titles don't appear in the book itself.  There is no bibliography and citations are rare.  Quotations are sometimes difficult to attribute and their placement seems random at times.  Overall I was greatly disappointed in the book.  The images are lovely and of value but that's about it.	2005-10-04

I like that the maps are organized by topic to a degree but I found a lot of the commentary to be more introductory history (simplistic at that) than atlas commentary.  I liked that the maps themselves are simple gray scale and not all the colors that can get confusing when you deal with smaller nations and tribes but overall I think they lacked some detail.  Given so much of the book is this simplified history it really needs a bibliography too. For $15, I think I can put up maps on our class overhead or computer which are as good and in many cases better.	2005-10-04

The intensity of the feelings this bloodbond and their personalities create is very deep and demanding.  It is a testiment to their personality that they are able to overcome it enough to do their jobs.  However I really wanted more on what \\"normal\\" was in this world -- more on how Istvan is different, what the normal life of companion is life to an average vampire. Yes, I could sense it wasn't good but I think it would have been stronger to see some clear examples and not just the results or the emails about it.	2005-09-16

If you are used to sexy vampire books, this isn't one -- there is some kissing and some implied romance but it is very much a \\"teen acceptable\\" book.  I like how Atwater-Rhodes gave us highlights of Turquoise's, the primary character, life before becoming a slave and a vampire hunter.  However I felt the book ended too soon leaving a lot of questions unanswered.  Perhaps that was the plan, the topic of future books?	2005-08-10

In an era where girls do try out for and get placed on \\"boys\\" teams, these issues seem outdated.  Likewise rules were recently changed in Indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender.  I know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.  Overall I felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different.  Even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her \\"magic\\" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking.  How much more gender role enforcement can we have?  Really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a Buffy universe story do better than this?  In general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding.	2005-07-21

The book is beautifully written in a story telling fashion that calls to mind sitting around a fire and listening to you elders talks.  Given the setting, the way the book is constructed is perfect.  But you have to patience with it because it will take you a while to digest what is inside and figure out how to use it.  Yes, you could just set a story before Columbus but you could also use it to add atmosphere and information to any Werewolf story you are running.	2005-07-09

So I picked up this book at a sci fi convention thinking there'd be a few stories in an anthology that would be worth the cost.  Out of 15 stories, four of them grabbed me.  I'd want to read these four, by Sharon Lee & Steve Miller, Rosemary Edghill, Kerrie Hughes, and Robin Wayne Bailey, over again.  The others were ok stories but none of those characters really grabbed me the way those four did.  If you like military matters more or questions about what is right and wrong in terms of military violence then I'm sure you'll like the book better than I did.	2005-07-09

The quality of writing and the characters are very consistant.  That said I was more interested in the characters and the cultures they were from than the military and battle encounters.  I also still felt that too many characters and too many cultures were being juggled for me to truly get into any of them.  The result is that I know the lead female character is Rose but I didn't feel like I really got to know her over the course of three books.	2005-07-09

I think the idea and the research behind this story is interesting.  The characters are interesting and well-written.  However, I kept asking \\"how did things get this way?\\" and that was never answered in the book.  Such a radical change in the human condition really needed a good explanation otherwise I just had to accept it and the questions of origins just wouldn't leave my mind.  I was also disappointed that I didn't know what these Hoots are -- what exactly are they?  How exactly does prey overcome predator?  Are human beings so easily classified as predators?  But if you don't have these sorts of questions then you should just enjoy the book.	2005-07-05

But that isn't my problem with the book.  Instead my problem is that story is all too common: robots as better than humans and aware of it.  Its another \\"robots = bad\\" scenario.  The first book was about the acquiring of humanity by both a robot and a human; this is about the loss of humanity, the development of a pseudohumanity.  The title female character is well designed, a survivor in a world where surviving is what the majority of people struggle to do day today.  The robots however made little sense.  Why would anyone even make robots who could do what these do?  It made \\"them\\" unbelievable.  I would have been happier with just focusing on the main female character and her world minus the robots.	2005-06-22

While the title suggests one type of literature is being investigated, it is really a mixture of both types along with a good discussion of the cultures which produced the literature in question.  The book is strongest on the 18th century until the mid twentieth century.  Primarily it is concerned with issues of censorship and the reasons behind calls for censorship.  It is not a collection of literary examples so you'll need to know the literature to truly use the book well.	2005-06-07

This is not a serious book about kink or about alternative sexualities: its a humorous book, one of many in the series from IvoryTower, about sex.  Some of the humor is funny, some is rather lame, most is average.  But I got mine for a dollar so it was worth it.  At least men and women are shown in the drawers about equally so it does not promote any gender stereotypes in the images at least.	2005-06-07

A young pretty boy willing to play the submissive role, in this case a pet.  I like the fact that the main female character is struggling with this new and unique relationship.  And pretty boys calling women \\"mistress\\" or \\"master\\" always makes me weak in the knees -- guess that's how I'm wired.  I hope the rest of the series develops things further but I worry about it lossing the \\"pet-owner\\" thread to a more traditional romance.	2005-04-15

One thing I found very enjoyable about the four stories in this book are the strong female characters are still very much people with problems, concerns, agendas, and needs not just sexual desires.  The book is more about sexual encounters than romance really, brief encounters or beginnings of relationships.  Normally that is more than fine with me.  However, I noticed a rather conservative attitude toward the sexuality -- all het, sometimes overly focused on the intercourse, sometimes rather negative about intercourse.  I'd think supernatural creatures (vampires, werewolves, and demons) would have more variety.  These samples did make me interested enough to see if the local library has a few books by Laurell K. Hamilton and Eileen Wilks but it didn't make me want to spend money on novels yet.	2005-04-04

This is something that women, and I'm one of them, seem to have a difficult time doing.  It can work, not always, but often it can work especially if you are unwilling to tolerate anything else or to do it yourself.  However advice is only good if it can be heard and accepted.  The tone of this book is one of, its difficult to classify, but some type of \\"hip,\\" urban, lingo between \\"sister goddesses\\".  The level of familiarity made me uncomfortable, the number of vague vignettes were unhelpful, and the focus on feeling your sexuality also a bit vague.  That is my biggest complaint: lots of general advice, little concrete suggestions and examples even though there are numerous \\"exercises\\" throughout the book.  This isn't about \\"men\\" this is really about women and should be marketed as such.	2005-04-04

But this is really more of an autobiographical account of his own lifestyle choice to focus on the use of hustlers or male prostitutes.  A solid definition of \\"virtual boyfriend\\" isn't even offered and the \\"how-to\\" parts are very few and far between.  If you read his first book and thought he was an interesting man, you might like this.  If you want to know how to get a virtual boyfriend, you mostly need to figure that out for yourself.	2004-12-01

While the problems a woman may have with deciding to do this it is just assumed that men are so horny they'll jump at the chance.  This ignores the homophobia in our culture that hits men very hard.  Also Gammon repeats that it is most commonly men who want a threesome yet focuses on what they must convince their primary partner to do in order to get another woman involved. I found many of the statements about men and women both to be sexist, rude, and downright offensive. She mentions many previous studies but other than ancedotes she does not offer documented research of her own.  She claims that this book will lead you step by step through a process to achieve the two women and one man sexual encounter but frankly I was so offended that if I knew someone was using this book or even had it in their library, I'd walk away.  The title needed to be far more honest.	2004-11-04

If however you are just interested in the basics and especially how men's underwear has changed in the past two centuries in America then this book is a good place to start. There are many photographs and ad copies incloded that are interesting but since Griffin talks a good deal about the role of popular media in helping to make chances to underwears sales it would be better if he'd included ads featuring some of the \\"heartthrobs\\" he mentions.

The survey is copy and each respondant's answer is included -- this is very helpful in judging the data and his summaries.  The summaries could be more indepth and detailed.

This is not a how-to manual.  This is instead a look at relationships and how they might actually work or not work using one man's life as the basis.  He covers about every topic I can think of that a gay master-slave couple might encounter but there are no how-to details here as he states in his introduction.  Frankly given the personal nature of the book I wish the stories could have continued, often we just see snippets that left me wanting to know more especially on the slave side of the relationship.  If you are looking for someone to give you the \\"one true path/method\\" look elsewhere.

They each have a story in this collection.  Both are good, Rowe's better than Saylor's.  I was also very impressed with Wallace Nichols older story; it made me want to try and find his other work.  Caroline Lawrence's children's story was also interesting but I didn't think it did the period justice.  In fact, maybe because I study ancient history (and just taught a college level Roman History course in the spring of 2004) I couldn't get over some of the historical problems with several of the stories in this collection.  For example Michael Jecks' piece was full of very odd words that just did not fit in the context of his chosen time period and that made it very difficult for me to read.  Other stories just didn't have main characters that grapped me.  *shrug* Large collections are generall so-so in quality so I guess I should not have been very surprised.	2004-10-15

The quality of the personal accounts of single and coupled swingers varies but the non-fiction essays from the Abrams were quite interesting and well written.  However I found the type font to be a bit too small to comfortably read and the overall tone of the book a bit negative.  I thought the book was to give us information to help society accept swinging a bit more but I found myself a bit angry at the number of women \\"forced\\" into trying it at the urging of the spouse and at the rather blow-by-blow accounts in some of the essays.  Overall not what I was expecting and it didn't give me a most positive view of swings or swingers.

Almost 50% of the pages have coloar photographs of primarily Eastern art.  However, pictures aside, Camphausen states his goals early in the book then does not see them through as  well as he could.  While there are many rare facts covered there are also very commonly known terms, deities, and objects included.  Most terms do not have references so we can't tell where the information was found.  The bibliography is done well but without references how can one truly do extra research?  The index is completely worthless because it just lists things under general categories but not the pages they appear on; yes, the terms are alphabetically done but really, is putting a page number too much to ask?  So if you want some great pictures, this is a good way to get them.  Luckily the price is good just for the pictures themselves.	2004-10-08

As in most academic articles the reader may be surprised by the personal focus and \\"attacks\\" in some of the articles -- sadly this is all too common in many of the social and  medicial sciences.  Not geared toward the average reader; having a good grasp of social or psychological theory plus some experience in college level analysis is practically a must to get the most from this book.	2004-10-08

Have things changed?  We can hope so.  For now this is a good read but the essays could be more carefully organized.  Frankly it feels like the essays were collected first then the table of contents fitted around them leaving some a bit odd feeling.  The quality of the essay varies with the author frankly.  The best and most wide reaching essay is the very first: Greta Christina's look at the power of words.  A good introduction for almost anyone on any topic.	2004-10-08

Instead most of the stories are hard horror with interesting characters trying to either live a \\"normal life\\" or finding themselves with new opportunities for changing their status.  The book is divided into four sections.  The first includes both witch and werewolf stories -- frankly I think these could be separate sections with one more werewolf and two more witch pieces.  Next are the stories about the living dead -- zombies, constructs, mummies.  Then the vampire section that has four stories and is the largest section.  Finally a section for demons which I found the most difficult to empathize with.  Overall good quality writing from several well-known horror writers.	2004-10-06

Unfortunately, while it is very obvious that Hand has done more than average layperson research into the Amazon legend, especially the Achilles & Penthesileia legend, she does not pull the story out well.  For example, I could forgive the embellishments to the narrative, it is, afterall, a very short legend only truly expanded in Late Antiquity to anything than just the battle.  But there are too many characters who get their own chapters in this book.  Given the title I wanted the book to focus on Penthesileia and Damonides -- when it did, it was very well written and interesting to read. Instead we seem to spend time in several characters' heads and it gets distracting.  Also in the first part of the book, Achilles et al take off for Amazon regions and the Amazons know they are there but nothing happens -- why was that even in there?  Overall disappointed.	2004-10-03

Some day my family wants to afford to build such a nice house so these give us ideas.  However, that only really works if we have full information -- like what types of materials are used, layouts of the floors that we can read, etc.  Several, about 40% of the designs in this book lacked understandable or complete basic blueprints for the structure.  Only a page or two about the building and the philosophy behind it were included.  Primarily this is a pretty picture book and for $30 it should be more.	2004-10-03

This book, however, reads like two books.  The first is about a community whose world we see through several different eyes.  The second is the story of Dian who travels to investigate another community who have asked to be allowed to move into her valley.  The problem is that a lot of the characters from the first \\"book\\" are left hanging after the reader gets interested in them and the focus in the second \\"book\\" honestly isn't very clear -- after reading it I'm still not sure why Dian does what she does and why there's not time spent on the fact that when she first visits the foreign community it looks radically different than when she returns just a few months later -- they've been invaded I assume but that isn't clear and it seems like everyone has been living a very military life there for a long time.  Overall I was disappointed.	2004-09-28

Autobiographies and biographies are best sellers in America these days and there are increasing numbers of them focused on people who enjoy kinky sex.  \\"The Puppy Papers\\" is a biography told through emails.  It is not, however, really just the story of one woman.  Through Puppy Sharon's emails we certainly do read about her life but also about the lives of the men and women she'd met.  Most of these are rather clueless in terms of how to do kink safe, sane, and consensually, often letting their fantasies dictate where experience would be a better guide.  Her story, however, is probably far more common in the kink community than most people realize.  At least with her current dominant, the man who organized and encouraged her emails, she has found someone better and that should give hope to everyone.	2004-09-11

The book is divided into four main sections that focus on a particular concern for bisexuals: coming-out; personal stories; community; and politics.  Finally there is a history of bisexual activism in the USA.  Most of the pieces are essays of a fairly personal nature but there are a few interviews, some poetry, and some visuals; there are even some non-bisexuals writing about their friends and family who have come out to them.	2004-09-10

Samuel Steward became a tattoo artist but kept his scholarly mind working as he did so upon the urging of Kinsey, yes, that Alfred Kinsey.  The result many years later is this book.  Part history, part personal recollection, and part social sciences, this is an interesting and easy to read book.  If you don't except detailed interviews with people or rigorous research protocols you won't be disappointed.  I think the first half of the book which focuses on what he observed is much better than the second more \\"historical\\" half.  It could use photos and a better spine to hold the book together.	2004-09-10

Now there are several options.  This one is geared toward women and yet I don't that enough time is spent on women's isssues compared to men in the book.  Most of the information can be found in other sources.  Franky I think the book needs more specific information and stories about and from women to justify the title.  However, if you are a woman or have a female partner who is worried that guides are anal sex are really for gay men, this could be a good way to get to read up on the subject.  Taormino's enthusiasm for anal sex is clear from the beginning of the book but she is sensitive to the negetive images and fears about anal sex. That makes it a safer feeling read for some women.	2004-08-19

The book is detailed and specific and the average person may not understand some of the jargon.  For the average person, if you like women that is, there are ample photographs, maybe even 100, and midsection of color shoots.  The historical notes of important photographers and their struggles in an inmature sexual society is also very interesting for the average reader.	2004-08-12

The nine stories and one satirical essay are more focused on character and plot than the previous collection.  There is also a lot less fetish that stories are built around.  Many of the stories are nonconsensual in nature or become that during the telling.  Several contain raunchy elements and all, of course, are gay male in character orientation.  \\"There's No Such Thing as a Pushy Bottom (and Other Myths Debunked)\\" is one of the funniest and truest essays I've ever written.

If you've found the previous more general books useful but wanted a more sex specific version, this is one of them.  Not a book for those with a great sex life or with tons of experience but a nice little guide for others feeling confined or unsure.

If you don't know what IML is, or if you have attended regularly, perhaps Joseph W. Bean's book International Mr. Leather: 25 Years of Champions will entice you to purchase it.<br /><br />  I am notoriously difficult on history books in these reviews, a product of my training as a historian.  Primarily I judge books by what the author claims they are doing.  Both Chuck Renslow and Joseph W. Bean explain their goals and their methods at the beginning of the book.  This is an endeavor of love and was spurred by people asking questions.  They ran into common problems, lost sources, conflicting memories, and incomplete records.  Their directness about the problems practically eliminate any complaints I might have.<br /><br />  At $20, with the money going toward the Leather Archives and Museum (LA&M), this book is an excellent way to entertain and educate yourself while you support a non-profit organization geared toward preserving the history of the leather subculture.  If you know someone who likes to look at leathermen, loves IML or just wants to learn more, this is an excellent gift.	2004-07-30

The focus is on women so there isn't so much really enough about men to call it &quot;the ultimate&quot;. While there are some images there need to be more to help those trying to figure how to use them and especially on the positions you can use because a strapon is never in the same position as biological penis. A good book to help someone start out and feel more comfortable. It even includes very rare topics such as clit pumping. &quot;101 Sex Toys&quot; is a better guide to dildos and the equipment but this is a good solid place to start exploring strapons.	2004-07-30

So while I could point out the minor differences in historical interpretation I don't think that most people are looking at this book to replace a textbook on the Empire in Britain.  Three of the characters are repeat performers: the pavement maker (not quite how I would describe him given what he creates) Liberatus, his slave and apprentice Junio and his patron Marcus (who may be related to the Emperor Commodus).  This time the mystery involves the murder of a local administrator and a murder of his slave, a boy whom did far more than merely serve meals to his master.  This is an interesting twist because in order to understand the more important murder, the minor one must be solved as well.  Rowe overplays the differences in status a bit too much for my taste and she underestimates the power and authority of women by the end of the 2nd century CE.  Overall if you liked the first book, this one will please  you as well.	2004-07-06

The story is intriquing and erotic here means there is sex and there is sexulaity --- it isn't porn nor it is by any means explicite.  However the words that are used over and over in the book such as \\"retainer\\" and \\"thrall\\" do not seem to have the same meanings as the game I play and the story I run, and have beening running for six years.  \\"Retainer\\" a particular word with a certain meaning in the system and it is used rather oddly in this book (unclear if these are ghouls or bonded Kindred which are different and have different lives or unlives as the case may be); \\"thrall\\" too is rather oddly used to refer to blood dolls.  This is, by the way, not a story with a happy ending so don't get attached to the characters.	2004-07-02

But this novel, which was a best seller in Europe when it came out in German in 1987, has almost nothing but stereotypes.  There's the boss controlled by the female underling who really seems incapable of true affection.  They both seem to have a mental illness or at least emotional problems.  She's cold and wears lots of leather and boots; so are all her female friends, even the lesbians who are still attracted to the main male character.  And finally, and most disappointing, there's the death or faked death of one of the characters.  I'm so tired of books claiming to be BDSM and yet fulfiliing  all the negative stereotypes.	2004-06-24

However, if you don't and you consider yourself a fan of gay SM fiction, you must at least borrow a copy to read.  Though we don't learn much about The Network that sells human beings into what is initially consensual slavery, we see the beginning of one young man's journey into that world.  Along the way Preston explores the biases that switches once faced (they might still in some places) and the interworkings of a few men's minds and groins.  Well done.	2004-06-24

However, unlike the Gor series here the women are the main characters and not merely broken into stereotypes.  The main male character is named Zoot, thus the title.  He isn't a Gorean man by any means even though he does expect his harem to be ready and eager to have sex with him at all time, bending to his will in all things.  There is a reason for this that becomes clear as you read.  Nor is the main female character, kidnapped earthling Connie, submissive at any point in the novel.  A refreshing twist on the idea of kidnapping women for male pleasure off-world.	2004-06-17

By and large the 19 stories do that.  But this is where fiction reviews are tricky because we all have different tastes.  I loved 12 of the stories -- the characters were believeble but most importantly I wanted to find out what happened to them.  Yes, a lot of them had to do with motherhood or lack thereof or sexism -- sadly both are factors in a woman's life, one by biology (perhaps not always) and one by society still.  It would have been nice to see a story where that wasnt't the case but we are all trapped by our own experiences.	2004-06-11

There are the stories by M. Christian, Felix D'Angelo, and Thomas S. Roche -- if you've read bdsm erotica before these names may be familiar to you.  The other 18 cover many subjects and kinks but they leave out one huge population: gay men.  None of the stories could be called gay while there area certainly lesbian, het, thressomes, and solo adventures.  This was very disappointing for a book of the \\"Best\\".	2004-06-10

Warning: there are lots of picture here so if you find yourself upset by any of the subject covered, either don't read those chapters or don't buy the book.  Gates does an excellent job of letting those with these desires speak for themselves without making many judgemental statements.

The essays themselves are unchanged but the introductions are rather defensive in nature, reflecting the political climate in which this book is published.

However the images, while nice, could be more numerous especially for beginners who may fumble over some of the terms and descriptions.

There are lots and lots of resources and frankly this book adds little in terms of the basic planning.  Instead what this book offers is affirmation of same sex unions but understanding that the businesses that can help you plan your big day may not know how to work with you.  Overall the message is simple: make your ceremony your own & any business worth doing business with, will respect your wishes regardless of gender or sex, or anything else.  I think the check lists included here for various stages of planning are also well done so if you have trouble oganizing they can help you regardless of whom you are marrying.	2004-04-02

A good deal of the book is about fighting and finding allies.  Like much of &quot;Vampire: the Masquerade&quot; it is also about using others to get ahead and the effects of doing that on the mind, the emotions and the soul. This time both the effects on Kindred and ghouls are explored.  I have a fondness for ghouls and have several players playing these servants in my annual summer tabletop game.  Dedopulos does a good job of looking at the newness and horror of newbie Kindred and ghouls both though I wish someone would write more about ghouls in general.  I was very pleased to finish this third book. Maybe I'll have good on Theo show up this summer when  our rpg group restarts up Vampire.	2004-02-11

These are for not only the newbie but also the very experienced but the key is to pay attention to your partner.  There is one huge problem with the book, the reason I could not give it 5 stars.  While time is spent on getting a woman to allow you to go down on her, there is really not much about helping a person learn to enjoy or even try giving cunnilingus.  Not everyone is eager to do this and it would be very very helpful if that were addressed in at least as much detail as is given to the subject in Blue's book about fellatio.	2004-01-26

In six sections she covers a lot of information, all of it well documented and much of it in the words of the scholars, authors, and thinkers she's used in her research.  This isn't a how-to book, it isn't erotic or porn, and it isn't for the casually curious.  It is a well-written and supported look into the often taboo subject of self or mutual pleasure for pleasure's sake.	2004-01-26

Cardini promises to show us what it was like there but instead really focuses on one person: the doorman, Cam.  Cam is an interesting guy, no one can say otherwise, and certainly he provided many a visitor with hot experiences and hotter fantasies.  However, I was really expecting to see the club in all its glory and was very disappointed when most of the action stayed near<br />Cam and the door.	2004-01-26

There are all pairings here and the immortal isn't always the one with the power.  Some pieces are better than others but that is more a matter of taste and not a statement of the quality of writing.  Cecilia Tan, the editor, can be picky with this third book and so the quality is overall very high.  Of course, I'm a bit biased because I like vampires, especially when they are powerful women or involved with powerful women are there are a few of those here.	2004-01-26

However, today there are much better books on gladiators and Roman entertainment and religion that do not have the heavy-handed moralizing tone that this book has.  Likewise Grant's sources are very limited compared to more current research on the topic.  If you want to see how far ancient history has come, its a good book; if you want to get a basic understanding of gladiators, it is an acceptable book.  It should not be your sole source of information.	2004-01-26

Perhaps Bud is there merely to give us a taste of Stephenson's world, a feeling of how changeable and out of control his children's lives are, but I found his disappearance frustrating.  Nell's story is the central story, her use of the Primmer and its effects on others was compelling to read.  Other characters seemed a bit confused and out of place or perhaps I just didn't find them very interesting and thus didn't invest the time into close reading when the focus shifted to one of them.  There are many things left unexplained in the story: why is the world that way? why does Nell go to work in what amounts to a brothel?  what is the Primmer showing little girls?	2004-01-21

While the premise of a ghost so strongly attached to a house that its &quot;life&quot; is dependent on it was interesting, I just didn't get into the characters that much.  Who we think is the female lead just stops a few chapters into the book.  The reason for the house's powers and what that power is was unclear to me.  The neighbor ladies were probably the best characters in the book but without a fuller explanation of why they were so afraid and attached to the house, I felt empyt as I kept reading.	2003-12-29

Having never read fiction by Jeff Long, I read the first chapter while at the sale before deciding to purchase it.  I was a bit disappointed that the main character we meet in the first chapter fades into the background for a while then is separated from the main action.  However, the lead female character was very engaging so I kept reading and was rewarded when everything started coming together.  There are some unanswered questions here and some odd relationships and events but if you like apocalyptic fiction and don't rely on the backcover to tell you what the book is actually about, you may enjoy &quot;Year Zero&quot;.	2003-12-24

Impressing me means that the characters were interesting and I wanted to keep reading.  It also means that these six were stories that I could understand the first time through and which I could enjoy and relax with.  Yes, sometimes it is good to have something to think over and chew on but sometimes I just want a good story.  There are several stories in this collection that if the characters had been more appealing I could chew over and enjoy but frankly I was disappointed this time around by the types of stories and the writing.	2003-11-04

Not as many flashbacks as in the first book and these read more distant from the plot.  There is also several unclear relationships in the book -- for example who are Adam and David?  Ghouls, childer, what?  Also I'm not sure I buy how easily lend astray the prince of Minneapolis is and her disrespect for an Archon.  Maybe some of my questions will be answered in book three.	2003-11-02

Some things just don't fit. However, the idea of Newcomers wanting so much to fit in that they risk their health to change their look is very powerful and unique.

Hughes is attempting to put into book what it took him many years of apprecticeship to learn.  While he does a good and thorough job of tackling almost anything I could think of, I still think the best way to learn is to learn from a practicing druid who uses sex magic in positive ways.  On the other hand, Hughes has opened up some of the secret about magic and made them understandable to the layperson.  Just because you think you understand however is not reason enough to just hop out and try it.	2003-10-11

The writing by Barry B. Longyear is excellent, he drifts between characters and time periods with ease.

Today kinky people use terms like endorphins and tribe to describe what they do, but you know where those ideas came from?  Geoff Mains was one of the first leathermen to take his vanilla career as a professional scientist, a biochemist, and turn his lens onto his sexuality.  Today these ideas seem a bit old but this classic is something I highly recommend for anyone wanting to learn about leather history, gay leather culture, or ideas of biology and anthropology in relationship to kink.  The culture Mains describes isn't always pretty, it isn't the cleaned up media picture, but it is an honest look into the leathermen of the early 1980s.	2003-10-11

In that universe, human beings are at the bottome of the ladder, used as sex slaves.  However, we aren't shown alot of what that really means.  Oh, there are scary emotions described but beyond some beginning lines nothing explicitedly sexual happens.  That left me wondering what was so bad -- sort of like the movie &quot;Spartacus&quot; before the director's cut came out.  Beyond this, Wright does a good job of showing the complex social and political relationships between characters, sometimes there is too much to follow and you have to slow down your reading to be clear on what is happening.  A question for the publisher: what is the deal with the cover?  It has nothing to do with the book.	2003-10-06

The multi-ethnic and gendered drawings add a lot to the descriptions.  Nothing here about BDSM however, it doesn't tell you how to use a whip on a human being even though it is published by Greenery Press.  Also, I don't think that just a book can make one compentant in using a bullwhip -- luckily that is never Conway's claim.  So if you want the basics for bullwhips for fun, sex, or profit, this is a good introduction.	2003-09-15

The vast majority of these are very personal, dealing with her kink, her experiences, and her feelings.  Only a few are really about topics of general information and even these are based on her experiences.  Overall if you know who Sadie is and have enjoyed her online columns this book is a good way to catch up.  If you aren't familiar with her, you'll get to be as you read.  I really wish the entire book were organized chronologically instead of by subject because I think that would make our journey into her mind more powerful.	2003-09-15

He primarily uses dramas, epitaphs, and poems but he doesn't get the texts for most passages he discusses.  I know it is popular to have both the Latin and the translation but frankly it would be better to have only Latin or only a translation if it would allow more examples to be discussed in detail.  He raises the interesting question of if and how other literature from other periods might shed light on his topic but doesn't go into detail.  The book is very short; it could cover a lot more than it does for the price.	2003-08-14

Stanford Memorial Lectures)	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Well worth the money if you have the advanced knowledge	If you are looking for an introduction to slavery in the ancient world, do not get this book.  To fully understand and use this book, one must not only be knowledgeable of the ancient world but also have a pretty good grasp of the many authors Garnsey looks at.  Instead of trying to make some grand generalization about slavery in the Greco-Roman world, this book tries to look at individuals and different &quot;schools of thought&quot; in the ancient world.  The result is a nice journey through several ancient texts.  However, Garnsey does have an agenda and an opinion: slavery is bad, and even ancients questioned it.  The second is true, the first is debatable especially in the ancient world.	2003-08-14

Don't be confused by the title, it isn't just for sociology, it can help all teachers in college or university.  There is also a CD included that has 70+ other articles and resources you can use.  It should help me as I write my own articles but also as I design new courses and revamp old ones.  I'm glad it was recommended to me at the last teaching workshop I attended.

You see, there is supposed to be a &quot;succubus club,&quot; the toughest Kindred hangout in the World of Darkness but this book isn't about that place (which is what I was expecting it to be).  No, instead its about organizations, meeting places, parties, etc that Kindred can have when they wish to hang out to brag, fight, or just be social.  I think there was enough information in all the other books to allow me to have a multitude of such events for my own players.  This book is too detailed and frankly too limiting in that it stiffles some of the creativity that can make the game truly scary for players.  At the same time, it is vague on certain principles such as how do you hid the place from mortals or enemies.  And finally I was deeply disappointed that the focus isn't on the Succubus Club itself.  I mean, really, I have the CD for it; where is the description of the place?	2003-07-22

For this sort of &quot;vacation&quot; into the continent, &quot;The Ebony Kingdom&quot; is a bit too complicated and too complex.  Understanding the Kindred of the continent requires some shifting in how you understand Kindred at all.  But if you and your players want to spend time (your players will need to spend hours reading and thinking before trying to create a character for this part of the world) it could be challenging and scary.  It would also allow for some neat political and social commentaries.  I really wish it had more sample characters included to help me figure things out a bit better -- also give storytellers who just want to visit a helping hand.	2003-07-22

It would have been easy for someone to give up or to become self focused, but Flanagan used his body and his mind to push himself, push his illness, and try to educate the rest of the world about his struggle and about kink.

There are lots of fiction collections of lesbian SM but the first &quot;Coming to Power&quot; was ground breaking because it tackled SM in a straight forward and honest yet controversal way when the debate about SM, lesbians, and feminism was first raging loudly.

Written as a storm was raging about feminism, SM, and being lesbian, this offers honest and explicite discussions of how lesbian SM worked.  There's advice on how-to do some activities, discussions of the politics of SM, and also some very in your face theory about being kinky and defining relationships.  Its a book I've read several times.  It is very short, mind you, but so worth the price to get your hands on articles you just can't find any more.	2003-06-10

Sometimes the things we are taught in history aren't very exciting for fiction.  This book does an excellent job of describing how Judiasm was forced to adapt after the destruction of the Temple.  The characters' journeys are powerful and confusing at times because certainly it would have been a confusing time to be alive.

First, the description of the species that the main characters are from is a bit difficult to follow at first.  They seem to be some cross between fairies and bees but it isn't clear.  Second, even though we are told that males are second class (or below) there are still males who are quite assertive and hints that some sexual relationships are more patriarchical than one might imagine in such a society.  Third, I found the scenes a bit jumpy especially as more locations and more characters are added.  However for all these rough spots it is a good world, well connected and fairly described.  The characters are interesting and the sex is frequent if a tad repetitious and overwhelming at times.  I'm not sorry that I bought it and am glad it was recommended to me.	2003-06-09

There is some great sex descriptions here but also some rather sensual non explicit stuff as well. \\"Erotica\\" here also refers to the use of sexuality as a means of character growth and not just characters having sex.  The greatest number of stories involve two men and one woman -- something I wasn't expecting.  Several others do not directly show us bisexual experiences even though the main character may be bisexual -- this will probably disappoint some people.  As with the vast majority of anthologies, there are always great pieces and poor pieces, but primarily it is a matter of taste.	2003-06-03

First it lets us know what types of movies you can get through Good Vibrations and why they are so selective.  That probably isn't so interesting to most readers of this review.  The second thing this guide does is give a good background on what adults movies should do, advice on finding what you like, and a historical lesson on the industry.  If you are looking for hundreds of pages of reviews, that isn't this book, nor will this book give you a blow by blow description of the movies it does review.

The pursuer here is an important slightly older woman; the pursued a younger man from an important house.  On certain levels the gender roles are reversed -- he plays hard to get, wants his freedom, she is protective but feels it is her right to have him. On other levels the gender roles are actually promoted -- he is able to physically overpower her at one point because he is physically bigger (why would genetically engineered men who are supposed to be submissive be made bigger than women?)  One huge problem I had with the political and social set-up was the gendered terms when they were not appropriate -- &quot;she-lord&quot;? if only women can rule why add the &quot;she&quot; onto it?  I think that Joy had a cool premise and for those of us into female rule we can still enjoy the book, but frankly the political and physical comparisons needed to be better thought out.	2003-06-01

We meet Theo, a Brujah archon who was once a slave in the antibellum south, whose method of operations appears to be very traditional until his mortal life memories get triggered by his latest assignment.  Some Kindred and some mortals are working together to run a slave ring of mortals for high profit to markets around the world.  This ring seems to cut across all lines that exist in the world of Kindred politics or perhaps its just a cover for something more serious.  Burdened with a neonate Brujah who is a survivor of this modern slave ring, Theo must balance his duty, his clan, the politics of the Midwest, and his own memories as he searches for other survivors and the leaders of the slavers.  The writing is excellent, showing depth to Kindred characters that is often lacking in many RPG groups and in the books themselves on occassion.  There is plenty of violence for those just interested  in the mechanics of combat but primarily this is a story of lies and coverups discovered by someone with a century and a half chip on his shoulder.	2003-05-29

In most ways, this is a book about adding an apartment onto your house.  The plans are rather dull to look at and a lot of the advice is rather commonsense but they are a useful place to begin research if you are interested in such construction.  I wish it had examples of houses and suits created by people today though -- some more realism to the entire book and some good ideas of how such an arrangement might work between families.	2003-05-29

The fact is, that I easily have more sources on the legends I work with than this book does.  As a result I am deeply disappointed in this book and its claims to be a great resource.  My advice is to check with the nearest university library near you and the read some of the principle source books in the field you are interested in; they'll have more references and moreinformation than this collection but you may need to read French or German to benefit from them. Can't read French or German?  Then this book may be your best starting point to begin your own investigations into classical mythology.	2003-05-29

However she does a good job of looking at the evidence on both sides of the issue.  This book is best not because of the evidence but because of its understanding of why the theory of matriarchy is so powerful and pulls at so many women (and men, too, though that isn't really the focus of her work).  Usually matriarcy is either ignored, rudely dismissed using sexist statements, or happily accepted but Eller's commentary really tries to get to the heart of the controversy without name calling or belittling sides.  As a feminist and a scholar, I appreciate her work.	2003-05-29

There is a lot of information here, frankly too much at times yet too little for other questions.  For example while there is a great deal on weight and ways to figure out why you are overweight, there is not information on why a woman might have sudden substantial weight gain and what to do about that.  Likewise while the medical possibilities are addressed in the book, none of these are given the same detailed coverage as ideas about dietary and mental changes.  Over and over the message seems to be that the woman got herself into this mess (whatever that is) and she must return to a \\"normal feminineness\\" to be cured.  I know that Northrup isn't promoting a sexist view but it could easily be interpreted that way I fear.  I think there is too much emphasis on some some ideals of health and too little focus on individual health and needs -- sorry most doctors you'll visit won't get you there and I had hoped this book would have advice on finding better health care advisors.	2003-05-29

Gordianus' prefered methods of discovering the truth, conversation and observation, are tested as he talks to seven very important women who showed up at the funeral of a young woman who seems to have been gifted with prophecies.  While Saylor does a good job with the conversations and giving us a view of Roman life there are multiple threads here that aren't as well interwoven as I would have liked.  For example, I have nothing against jumping around in time but since there was a consistant pattern of when this was going to happen, I got a bit lost every now and then.  Also there are many things going on in Gordianus' house that we see briefly or which are mentioned briefly but that do not really seem to make the Finder as concerned or as thoughtful as a father or husband as we might expect given his character in earlier books.  Are we to assume that this is a comment on all men, that even the best and most observant will stray?	2003-05-29

I'm a big fan of sourse books for students and scholars both because they enable us to focus on a particular topic in some detail and to discuss the problems in using primary and ancient sources.  I think that Brent Shaw's introduction and commentary throughout are excellent but I have one big question: is this all the evidence he could find out about agricultural slaves and gladiators?  Having read the 'handbooks' some of the passages are drawn from, I think there is more out there.  Likewise I think there is more evidence for how gladiators lived and were viewed/treated by freepeople that could shed further light on the causes and reactions to the three biggest slave wars in Rome's history.	2003-05-28

Thomas Moore's &quot;Dark Eros&quot; has a clear agenda to achieve -- to show that Sade was a genius who saw the reality of the human mind and emotional needs.  Unfortunately this agenda clouds his logic at times and limits the quotations and questions he addresses in his book.  If you haven't read Sade yourself, please do so before you get this book then judge the comments and theories promoted in this book.  This is not to say that Moore analysis is poor or completely incorrect, just that by being so focused on finding the genius in Sade and the sadism in everyday life he is blinded to historical and gender questions and evidence to answer these questions.	2003-05-21

This book is cutting edge and I'm certain will cause a stir from people who preach that \\"thin is the only sexy\\" but guess what, most people don't look like models or movie stars so this is really a book for the majority of Americans.  There are six chapter which cover everything from personal identity issues, dating, community groups, health, and sexual suggestions for a more fulfilling intimate life.  I have two complaints about this book (thus the 4 stars instead of 5): facts without citation (yup, I know she did a survey but still there are facts tossed about that need evidence) and a jumping around between \\"fat people\\" and \\"fat admirers\\" that can make things a bit confusing.  It could also really use some diagrams for some of the positions she discusses in chapter six -- if we can't assume that the existing sexuality books address \\"fat\\" needs, how can we assume that larger people know what a certain position looks like?	2003-05-21

Here, and in much of the erotica I like personally, erotica also means literature where sex and sexuality play an important role in characters' lives.  This is a collection of stories about larger people who battle the social idea of \\"thin is sexy\\" and the people who empower or challenge them.  There is plenty of hot scenes here for het and lesbians (I'd say it was about 50/50), nothing really for gay men however.  Most of the characters are larger women with the men usually not described.  The quality of the pieces varies but four were my favorite for their uniqueness and power to draw me into the tale.  These were pieces by Catherine Lundoff,Eleanor Brown, Veronica Kelly, and Diana Lee (two lesbiand and two het piece by the way).	2003-05-21
1119697:US	52008531	R3VC7JI776GIVJ	1573182036	987926571	L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Vol. 16	Books	4	0	3	N	N	As advertized	If you are thinking that this is just a collection of stories from the Writers of the Future contest, then you are mistaken.  As the cover indicates, there are 13 stories plus 4 essays that are included in this almost 500 page book.  As we'd expect from a contest under Hubbard's name, one of the essays is by him.  The 13 stories are quite varied and I won't repeat the brief introduction to the plots done by another reviewer.  I liked 4 pieces enough to consider finding other writing by their authors.  &quot;Home Grown&quot; by William Brown, &quot;Like Iron Unicorns&quot; by Paul D. Batteiger, &quot;Guildmaster&quot; by Dan Dysan, and &quot;The Quality of Wetness&quot; by Ilsa J. Bick.  I thought these storylines were original but the characters were familiar enough to really hook me. &quot;Atlantis Ohio&quot; by Mark Siegel was a cool idea but the story just goes on and one far too long.  So if you like hard science fiction, social fiction, or alternative pasts or presents, there is some story in here you may enjoy.  So why only 4 stars?  Frankly I think the essays could be left out, the price dropped a bit on the book, and it would be a much better buy overall. People who want insight into the craft or writing and direction toward publication can get a book geared toward that.	2003-05-18

The first is to get off on. Neale's \\"To Serve Two Masters\\" is well suited to this tasks because his descriptions are explicit without being repetitious.  There are a few brief het scenes but 98% of the sexual encounters are between men.  The other reason to buy erotic literature is because sex can be a great way to explore human life.  This book is not an erotica masterpiece.  While there are some plot twists, overall the book seems to jump around too much, especially when the main characters go in search of another slave.  The philosophy promoted in this book is pretty standard: you must first know how to serve, to be humilated before you can dominate -- a pretty common view in gay male porn.  I have the \\"idol\\" edition of this book so you may get the \\"virgin books\\" edition instead if you order it.	2003-05-16

The mystery and the way it is solved isn't particularly complicated; it seems more a matter of luck and logic than investigation as is the case in books by Steven Saylor.  Unlike characters in Lindsey Davis' books, the &quot;hero&quot; and his own slave, Junio, are both likeable and you want them to succeed.  Rowe has done a good job of trying to explore how Romanization affected distant parts of the Roman Empire as well as exploring the reality that slavery was a social institution embraced and used by everyone, ex-slaves and freeborn, wealthy and poor.  What would be truly interesting and difficult to do would be to have a slave who is a &quot;hero&quot; in these ancient mysteries, someone who could really explain this darker institutioin that seems so favored to modern authors yet so distant from their experiences.	2003-05-15

There are two books here really.  The first looks at SM as a romantic experience where the focus is on the sexuality, especially of the woman.  There is a lot of advice on what a woman can do to get herself into the mood and determine what works for her; not much advice on actually serving another person.  The other book is scattered about and looks at SM as a means for heightened states of consciousness but without a lot of practical advice.  Overall for men and women who see submission as an sexual exploration, it is a pretty good book.  For anyone looking for advice on how to be submissive however, this book does not really address issues of service you may be looking for.  The book is fairly different from her guide for dominant women but both books really focus on the needs and desires of the bottom partner and not on service.	2003-05-14

The problem with this approach is that the argument becomes tied up in questions of childhood abuse and institutional correction.  While I was impressed with the variety and number of historical literature Anthony uses, he does not show why human beings today are interested in these topics.  The evidence he cites is almost always historical, about children, or about comic pop cultural references in modern England.  There is nothing in this book that says that adult spanking, CP or flagellation is indeed seen as a &quot;vilified vice&quot; because he does not look at that issue.  Attempts to describe why people are interested in these activities have no grounding in current reallife practice only passages from historical lierature.  This book really needs to be spun as an historical investigation instead of an attempt to make CP, spanking and flagellation between adults understandable.	2003-05-14

The chapters are increased from 6 to 10 and more information  is included while everything else is updated.  There is a lot of basic information here but this isn't a how-to book -- its focus is more on the mental and emotional and social aspects of starting out in SM (or BDSM if you prefer).  So if you are starting out because you or a parnter knows you are interested, this book will help you figure out what next steps to take, how to discuss things, where to find resources and community; it will not teach you to tie knots or flog.	2003-04-24

This isn't fiction, however, but accounts of the real lives and interests of these authors (all of whom are much much risque than myself in reallife).  Every type of pairing can be found but don't think this is for hets, gays, or bis because the point of the book isn't really arousal (you'll find plenty that turns you both on and off) but to share how sexuality is experienced by real people who in turn create fantasies for the rest of us.  I, honestly, did not find myself turned on very much but I found it all very interesting.  If you are looking for pages upon pages of arousal, look elsewhere; if you want to see how strange real sex can be, then give this book a try.	2003-04-16

Here you'll read about how the man she thought was her savior turned into a nightmarish character who used money and her children to get her to publically and privately transgress her own morals and her own desires.  I'm not convinced that the translation is the best and frankly the translators need more time giving us their creditials.  I also found the images that are included to be distracting from the main message: she was abused, she was never a dominant or a sadist.  Wanda's life is a sad reminder that women have not been legally equals to men for most of human history and that any &quot;incidents&quot; of SM we see in the past is probably not BDSM but instead a reflection of the abuse that such unequal societies promote and sanctify.	2003-04-08

The story revolves around MacLeod, his lover, and his assistant as their daily lives are interrupted by several events: a nearby murder, a runaway gay teen, and a nosy reporter.  The mysteries here are really all that great, go read a more mundane mystery if you want that.  The sex too while it can be hot isn't numerous enough to really push this into the porn category.  Instead this really is a novel that attempts to make us see that SM can be healthy or it can be unhealthy.	2003-04-08

Basically it is a list of words (primarily English language words) that seem to fit into a range of categories that can be general (male parts) or very specific (tasty terms).  Some lists are set up as charts that focus on the play with one phrase or rhyme systems.  The picture throughout could be funny or distracting depending on your personal taste -- I found them a bit of both.  Once more we see that in the English language words relating to women's bodies and sexuality are fewer and less \\"active\\".  It could be fun to read with friends but since no real definitions are offered for the terms, not very helpful to writers I think.	2003-04-08

For Bob Flanagan it was a way to exploit the body that was betraying him through illness and make himself as much of a master of it as he could be.  Six interviews are the bulk of the book -- each accompanied with pictures from his life.  This is also a brief collection of his art and an interview with his partner.  Three years after this book, Bob Flanagan's body would give out and he would pass into a better world where I hope that the only \\"pain\\" he feels are those that are good for him.  It is a moving and distrubing account of his struggle with illness and his attempts to make the world more aware of and accepting of others like himself.	2003-04-08

However I found two problems with the book.  First, not all of the sections flow smoothly and the stream of consciousness moments can be distracting and patronizing on a few occassions.  Secondly, I think the definition used of &quot;gender&quot; is far to broad to really give the book a solid foundation to build on.  You'll find yourself agreeing or disagreeing with much of the book -- isn't that the appropriate thing for a book of self-growth?	2003-04-08

If you are familiar with Townsend's work and enjoy it, then this is a great collection to own. However, Townsend's writing is on the rougher side of SM so if non-consensuality, under-age, risking, or dirty sex is a turn off to you, steer clear.  I really wish the collection had an index of the stories so you could find that \\"really cool piece\\" more easily.	2003-04-04

In \\"The Velderet\\" it means a world where individuality has been sacrificed because of historical guilt and sexuality has become limited and government approved.  But this is your average distopian novel where all sex is outlawed or what you do is so important as why you do it and with whom.  Yes, there is the invasion of a foreign people who seem rather new guard or old guard in their approach to power relationships but that isn't really the focus of the story.  Instead the two roommates who discovered shared kinks and give us insight into the power of fear and authority are the reasons to read this book.	2003-04-03

This is the third of Luc Milne's Pleasure Corporation series.  More than in the two previous novels the characters are developed and the idea of why people might be interested in such a ranch and the \\"fantasy of SM\\" is raised.  There is a very wide range of sex highlighted in this novel and shown through the eyes of four \\"new recruits.\\"  I was not thrilled with the first book in this series but S/M Ranch shows growth in Milne's abilities as a writer.

But if you love drawings, love women's butts, and get turned on by spanking them, then you may enjoy this book.  It is all told through the eyes of a minor celebrity who meets a spanking master on an Italian train.  The encounters may read a bit unrealistic but it is fiction so set aside your reality meter please.  The story has a nice flow of events to it and the finale is pleasant and appropriate.	2003-04-03

Her relationships will evil men and wonderful gentlemen help her see how real women, the ones probably calling on  her for help, live and this gives her compassion.  By the end of the story Meriath is no longer the spoiled young goddess but a deity someone might not only have wet dreams about but feel happy to worship.  The book cannot be easily classified as male dominant and female submissive however because the characters vary from life to life.	2003-04-03

In addition to a great introduction, there each of these nine chapters offers a unique and fairly detailed analysis of the Roman Empire in popular culture today.  This ranges from the common commentary on \\"Spartacus\\" to the unusual look at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas today.  The filmography includes both well-known and lesser known movies, especially for American audiences who may not be fully aware of what has been going on in Britain even though it does influence the colonies today.  The listing on this Amazon.com entry includes the names and authors of the chapters so I won't waste space by repeating them.  Oddly for a collection, I believe that if any article is less than the others it would be the first and the final which really could use more basic definitions and most gusty analysis.  All in all, I was pleased with each article's scholarship and presentation. I think a layperson could understand most of these articles and the academic can find a lot to argue for or against.	2003-02-14

At times there is real oppositions, an Italian movie arguing for a fascist state while during the same period an American movies makes a pro-democracy film -- both movies are based on the same book, the same historical events, or the same legend.  All of that changes as society and politics changes in both the USA and Italy.  Maria Wyke tackles a huge amount of material and traces these changes over more than a century.  I'm certain it wasn't easy to research and write and it isn't a quick read, not even for a scholar of the ancient world or film.	2003-02-14

Sobol is not a scholar of the ancient world so anything you've heard about his ground-breaking work may be incorrect.  It is a good introduction to the scholarship and theories about Amazons through the 1970s.  It is a good attempt to make the layperson aware of the different stories and tales about Amazons in the ancient world.  However, unlike I've seen claimed in political motivated studies of Amazons, this book is not a collection of the legends themselves.  In fact, Sobol rarely gives citations and flat out states that he combining various accounts into one for each legend type he examines.  Read this for the backgound of previous scholarship; go get a Loeb for the actually texts or wait until my dissertation is published because it will have all the texts.	2003-01-15

That isn't a problem for this book, because while she looks briefly at Amazon tales in the Greek world her focus is on how the stories have changed over the centuries in the Western world.  She does an excellent job of addressing why women find the legend difficult to grasp and yet quite attractive.  Her analysis of how useful the icon of the Amazon is to Western culture is first-rate so while I found myself disagreeing from time to time with her opinions I could follow the flow of logic and the evidence fairly well.  I think she could have used more background on the ancient tales but hey, that's what my dissertation is.	2003-01-15

Bennett's book is from the early part of the twenieth century.  While it is clear that she accepts to a large degree cultural evolutionary theories, her book is actually one of the first to attempt to analysis the legends themselves. Her focus is on connections between Amazons and religious rites or deities.  Scholarly from this period will sound weighty and seem less than ideally cited, but her book is often used by scholars looking at the legends and political thinkers using the Amazons for their own agenda so it is good to be aware of her work if the subject interests you.  I'm so glad I was able to find a copy available.	2003-01-15

While it may not be very common in India at the beginning of the twenty-first century, it was quite common during the first half of the twentieth.  This book presents short story &quot;Sultana's Dream&quot; and the recollections of women living under purdah complied by Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain.  There is also an introduction to each work and an analysis of Hossain's life and writing by Roushan Jahan interspersed between each piece.  In other words, there are four individual essays and one short story in this collection.  It could be difficult for women today who do not live in purdah to understand but it is important to remember our collective past and realise similar things are happening today.	2003-01-15

Each story is fairly original as the front cover claims, the robots aren't just servants, they represent social conflicts, have personalities, and sometimes are the only characters around.  For me, that isn't enough, I have to want to keep reading because I care about the characters.  The best story is a tie between Rusch's touching tell of a poor family in 'A Helping Hand' and Nye's equally touching 'Sacrifices' where a fairly wealthy but constantly moving family loses one of its \\"own\\".  The worse is easily 'K-232' by Collins because its really more of a short essay on what its like to explore the universe than anything that really pushes our concepts of humanity or paints a future picture.  And that is important since one of the editor, Larry Segriff, says that this is a collection about our children, humanities children in the form of robots.	2002-12-03

This is true of Coba where a Skolian heir crash lands.  He lives a full, very full, life for a man in Coba society as a member of six different \\"harems\\" or Calanya for 18 years.  In the process he starts serious social changes, not because he wants to overthrow the matriarchy (thank goodness, that thread gets tiresome in science fiction and fantasy) but simply because he is so desired.  Yes, there is sex here but more than that is the intellectual dynamics are the more intriguing and enticing parts of the book.  Finally a book with a positive look at a female dominant society that doesn't claim to be utopia or in need of \\"a man's hand\\".	2002-12-03

But Asaro's societies are still complex and well represented.  There are actually three space-age societies: Skolian, Eubian, and Earth Allied.  Only two of these, Skolian and Eubian, are dealt with in any great detail and they are almost polar opposites.  Almost because both are really oliogarchies.  Here the battle is between two races of &quot;improved&quot; humans -- one telepathic and one with almost no ability to feel at all.  Allied Earth is somewhere in between and in fact, I get the feeling that Earth may be the big problem that hasn't reared its ugly head yet in the series.	2002-12-03

Far too often the result is the promotion of negative stereotypes in these books.  \\"Murder at Roissy\\" and \\"The Torquemada Killer\\" by John Warren are refreshing because they show positives of the kinky community while not denying that criminals can hide in the leather world.  This book takes place in a real setting -- yes, kinky B&Bs do exist out there folks.  The only major problem I had with the book is that I really wanted more time spent on the people visiting the B&B; they seemed under developed.	2002-11-30

Its sad how few things have changed.  The target audience of the book are monogamous and het couples who practice role-playing where the woman is the \\"top\\" and the man is the \\"bottom\\".  Role-playing is the key here; the book will not tell you how to do 24/7 or switch or even just be yourself.  The book contains two apparent contradictions: the fantasies discussed are \\"male\\" but women are told to do only what makes them feel good.  Frankly, I don't think the five main fantasies (nursemaid, governess, queen, Amazon, and goddess) are necessarily \\"male\\" and realisticly if the focus is time and again on figuring out what the man wants, how can a woman figure out what she wants.  The fact is that Lorelei is correct: relationships take compromise but that doesn't equal sacrifice from either party.	2002-11-30

When we hear or see the term CBT we think &quot;torture&quot; and that usually makes us all cross our legs.  But Haberman's book is really focused on creating intense or simply pleasureable sensations for male genitals in ways that do not involve intercourse.  The book has four main divisions: anatomy, safety (please don't skip over this one), basics &amp; toys of CBT, and finally a collection of nine short stories to demostrate the first three sections.  The stories aren't really arousing, they are more instructive.  If CBT is something you've thought about but know little about, this is a great place to get information.  Read it with your partner and you can figure out what he is interested in.	2002-11-27

While she covers many topics ranging from disease, to burnout, to maintaining clients, a good deal of this book is rather vague.  More details were needed in several areas but it is a good first attempt at such a how-to book.  The types of sex work discussed focus on those that use your body (pictures, street walking, dancing, etc) or your voice (phone sex) but not producers of the written word or those who take pictures -- aren't they all involved in sex work too?  Please be aware of your state's laws before ordering this book or enacting any of the advice in this book. Note that I suspect the name is created specifically for sex work -- Meretrix is a Latin term for female harlot.	2002-11-27

This is the first book you should read!	This 2001 edition of what I consider to be a classic BDSM book is expanded and improved.  An additional 69 pages (I don't think that was on purpose) covers changes in the community and resources that are available.  It focuses not solely on how to get what you want as a bottom but also how to give your top what they want -- this balance of advice can be difficult to find but Easton and Liszt have done a great job here.  There are 10 different chapter that cover everything from basic &quot;how do I feel about this&quot; to &quot;how to do X&quot; to more rare and less physical aspects of some peoples' scenes.  It is not geared toward any gender or orientation except it does not cover 24/7 or TPE couples in any way -- but those are advanced subjects and practices anyway.  This is a book I have both bottoms and tops read in my household and among those I recommend books to.  If you haven't read it, please do so even if you've been doing this for 40 years you can learn something or see something in a new light.	2002-11-19

I'm not sure this is strictly a mystery -- its more a cop drama really and I suspect the characters are ones that George has used previously. As for the positive SM, is it positive if the lead detective is constantly thinking how sick all these people are or how much drug or alcohol use is shown or how alligned it is with prostitution?  Didn't seem particularly positive to me but maybe things are quite different in England.  It is a very English book -- so if British language and terms throw you, you'll have difficulty following this.  I, too, got a bit tired of following one character, a female detective who's off the case really, and the two male detectives around separately but if you've seen these characters before it may be more interesting to you.	2002-11-19

This was a gift that I finally got the time to read and I was very pleased.  Aside from a few historical issues I had, the story is paced appropriately so that I was never bored with what I was reading.  The characters were nicely paralleled between the Roman Empire and modern day LA yet clearly not the &quot;clone&quot; design that is often dreadful to read.  None of the descriptions seemed unnecessary and the events followed smoothly.  I have the book in my fantasy/sci fi/horro collection simply because of the &quot;time travel&quot; component.  If those categories don't appeal to you, this is good solid fiction from a woman's viewpoint even if it was co-authored by a man.

The language of the storeis is simple so children in upper grade school may be able to handle it.

The first is that the appendices at the end of the book.  That information, all of it valuable, could have been easily woven into the rest of the book.  Second, the last part of the book is a collection of personal reflections on fisting.  Only one of these addresses the fears and limits some women may have with the activity.  While Addington does address this reality, it is very brief.  Frankly I think it could have used its own chapter.  The book is balanced between information and encouragement for the fistee and the fister; a pleasant surprise when most books about sexuality focus on one role over another.	2002-11-13

Unfortunately, Macdonald doesn't provide a bibliography at all or address where she got her information so I had to take off one star.  However, her information seems quite solid and I love the way the book is laid-out with the life journey of one woman into slavery and her experiences there. There are obviously several of the less pleasant things left out of this book such as sexual slavery, but it did contain more reality than I had expected for a book at this level.  The sidenotes are great and they actually give you the advice the cover of the book promises.  There are also hints for the younger audience that things are not simple, even something they've been taught is an evil, is actually quite varied and complicated by gender, race, age, skill, and personality.	2002-11-11

I want to applaude the Watts Library for tackling such a book but frankly they needed a better scholar.  Greene's writing is well done and the images are great.  But the sources she relied upon are horrible and out-dated.  Her concluding sentence at the end of the \\"notes on sources\\" section should clarify to anyone who knows anything about slavery in the Roman world: \\"Just as in the Roman empire, it took a civil war, and many lost lives, before slavery finally ended.\\"  First problem: don't compare United States slavery with ancient slavery, they are not the same.  Second, there is no civil war that ends slavery in the Roman world, it dies out overtime and that time extends into the Middle Ages.  As an ancient historian who studies slavery and values education at all levels I am extremely disappointed by this book.	2002-11-11

Add into this the fact that the cultures being discussed here use languages which only a few scholars know and you are set for very limited information.  Greene does a better job at finding useful information for the layperson in this book than in her other book on slavery in Greece and Rome.  I was pleased to see the book laid-out according to culture and not just pushing all of the Mesopotamian world into one section.  There are some things I'd disagree with but overall it seems like a very simple introduction for a younger junior high student.  She needs better references on slavery itself to help such students further their independent interests.	2002-11-11

Usually when we think of people being harmed by a stereotype we think of other, more powerful groups, picking on minorities.  What do you do though if the minority you are part of (gay men) ignores you because you don't fit the stereotype (not athletic, young, expensively dressed with expensive tastes in clothes, etc)?  Well you can establish communities and band together for your betterment as many bears have done.  However, there is also a point in which a group must laugh at itself, and Kampf's \\"The Bear Handbook\\" is one of the signs of that time.  I've talked to Bears I know and they remember the big uproar when this book came out -- seems that some folks did not understand that it was first and foremost a satire.  As satire Kampf's book does its job very well -- it makes you laugh while pointing out how bear community may be repeating some of the stereotyping and social confinement it rose against.	2002-11-11

I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because this is a collection of projects by several different people and thus the instructions vary greatly in terms of technical knowledge required to follow them.

This another in the \\"Isaac Asimov's\\" series that collects stories from his magazines and publishes them on a comment theme.  This theme is sexuality in science fiction -- no, not about sex and robots as the cover suggests; yes, I was disappointed by that.  Of the ten stories, five are great -- they flow well, the characters make you care, the dialog is realistic, and the plot ties together well throughout.  These five are: Brian Stableford's \\"Bedside Conversations\\" about sex change and childbirth in unlikely bodies; Peni R. Griffin's \\"The Goat Man\\" about how the beastly man is not always the beast your mother told you to avoid; Connie Willis' \\"Even the Queen\\" about alternatives to \\"naturalness\\" and the willingness to forgo it for less pain; Tanith Lee's \\"Zelle's Thursday\\" which is thankfully about robots and domestic problems of human beings; and finally Deborah Wessell's \\"The Last One to Know\\" that has shows gender extending into marital roles in surprising ways.  The other five are either a bit too confusing, a bit too long, or a bit too, well, much for my personal tastes -- that's coming from a BDSM erotica folks!	2002-11-07

There is still a mystery but the resolution is based on accidental encounters more than investigation.  However, we get to see Rome as a confused, dangerous, and determined to remain civilized city as the clock counts down on the Republic.  We briefly meet some of the big names you've heard of in Roman history courses but only briefly as would make sense for a mere \\"finder\\".  No, this book is best read as an exploration of Roman society and of Gordianus' family as it grows up and increases in number, complications, and love.  Gordianus would be considered a poor Roman father and husband in his day but for us, he is understandable and expressive.  This novel made me more interested in him than any of the previous novels.	2002-11-06

The drawings are simple black and white that you could color if you wished but I think the book is beautiful on its own and I'm not sure my coloring skills could do Wright's designs justice.  The projects include both private homes and public buidlings.  Each image is accompanied by a brief description that includes where, when, and for whom it was created.  Several quotations from Wright himself are scattered throughout the book.  I do wish the book had an index or a table of contents however.

However, the basics about what archaeology is and how it works is still the same; Wenke explanations are very clear and well illustrated.

Unlike simiplistic models that claim it was the might of the Emperor or the brutality of the army, this book looks at the interactions of the local people, the idea of the Emperor, the legal and social codes of the Empire and the realities of military occupation of a region.  Certainly more current research will answer some of the questions I had while reading this book but Isaac's approach was unique in the early 1990s and it was an eye opener.  It is not for anyone without a basic understanding of Greek or Latin and an advanced grasp of the ancient world during the Roman Empire.  In order to best use this book, you must be a historian, an ancient historian.	2002-10-29

Snyder addresses this question by relying heavily on surviving poems by women and there aren't many of them.  While it is difficult to just let women speak for themselves, I think that this record of surviving works is useful just for that reason -- Snyder's interpretations have been argued about but the fact remains that little survives.  I especially like that an attempt at contextualizing the poetry is made and this is not easy to do when little &quot;factual&quot; evidence about the poets themselves exists that is untainted by bias throughout history.	2002-10-29

Slavery did not begin in the New World nor was New World slavery typical of the condition throughout history and around the world.  Watkins is the first real attempt I've seen at trying to express this reality on the level that a older grade schooler or a junior high student could understand.  In 15 short chapters, the variety of slavery is fairly good.  However, at least 6 chapters are focused on the New World but these are mixed in with the other chapters making it a bit awkward to follow.  There are a few errors in the book and some contradictions that are not explained by the inherite contradictions of human slavery.  Frankly the bibliography is horribly brief and very New World focused too.  Add into this that the tone is rather judgemental especially about slavery in the modern world.  So why 4 stars?  This is a very brief book whose target audience is the 14 under group.  The pictures are beautiful and I think that Watkins is riding a good balance between too much information and realistic information.	2002-10-28

Handballing, or fisting, has a danger to it it aside from disease, danger that is both physical and for some personal because it challenges not only the ideas of gender and sexuality but also runs right into some strong taboos.  Now, the disease and barrier information is outdated so don't rely on this information, ask your doctor.  However, the basics about how to do it phsyically and how to do it emotionally are still very useful.

In the past, Gordianus is dealing with political struggles and economic gains but in this book something is tackled: the unequal dynamic between the ....  Almost everything Gordianus thinks he knows about women is challenged and thrown out in this one book.  This is where Saylor himself is stepping out of the \\"historical knowns\\" and stepping into spectulation.  However, the spectulation is also reasonable given what is know about gender, ... and ... dynamics for the late Roman Republic.  Also this is a very urban and family focused book, reflecting again the increasingly personal nature of the arguable decay in politics and society during this time.  This book is more explicit so if the directness of Saylor's writing has been uncomfortable for you in the past, be forewarned; for those of us who could handle even more expliciteness, its a bit better.	2002-10-27

Sadly it cannot.  The essays will interesting and focused still are too general in some areas such as women and religion where it seems that there is no change over time in Egypt.  That simply isn't true.  In other sections, change is suggested but it isn't explained.  Overall too little time is spent on each subject to justify its separation from the whole.  A good solid introduction to the basic chronology and traditional history is covered in only 20 pages!  I was so disappointed in the book that I'm returning it for a refund.  I have specific and general books on Egypt already and this adds nothing to them.  On the bright side, if you like a very general book then you should like this one because it is organized by topic and has very nice images and decent maps (not as good as others I've seen however).	2002-10-24

The title of this book claims it is an &quot;anatomy of a civilization&quot; and that civilization is Egypt.  That isn't what this book is, however, because that title suggests that this is some sort of geneal introduction or study of Egyptian history.  It isn't.  In fact, even though the first 180 pages look at the formation of the nation, the first two kingdoms, and the twointermediate periods, this is really just a build up to the second half of the book.  This second half is focused on the New Kingdom, especially Amarna and Akhenaten.  The overall idea of this book is that this odd period in Egyptian history is somehow &quot;better&quot; than the previous and following periods and that it is a foreshadow of later times, maybe even our future.  Kemp's ideas are certainly intriguing and indeed may have strength but they should not be promoted this way because it will mislead readers into thinking they are getting a general history when they are not.  This is really an academic argument, a worthy one in fact, but it is not appropriate for an introductory audience.  If you want to look at Amarna, this is a good resource.	2002-10-23

That isn't what this book is, however, because that title suggests that this is some sort of geneal introduction or study of Egyptian history.  It isn't.  In fact, even though the first 180 looks at the formation of the nation, two kingdoms, and the intermediate periods, this is really just a build up to the second half of the book.  This second half is focused on the New Kingdom, especially Amarna and Akhenaten.  The overall idea of this book is that this odd period in Egyptian history is somehow &quot;better&quot; than the previous and following periods and that it is a foreshadow of later times, maybe even our future.  Kemp's ideas are certainly intriguing and indeed may have strength but they should not be promoted this way because it will mislead readers into thinking they are getting a general history when they are not.  This is really an academic argument, a worthy one in fact, but it is not appropriate for an introductory audience.  If you want to look at Amarna, this is a good resource.	2002-10-23

It is, as its title suggests, a book about the discovery of Egypt by modern Europeans and research on the civilization through the 1980s.  In a lot of ways it reminds me of a National Geographic issue which isn't bad it just isn't highly technical or academic but geared toward a general audience.  If it is judged with this audience in mind, it rates as an excellent book.  For anyone more serious, it may be amusing and interesting and certainly a nice change in that it attempts to discuss fairly recent research.	2002-10-23

Sure the pictures are cool to look at, there are ok timelines and tables, and just having an alphabetical source of Egyptian terms is wonderful.  But this should not be somone's primary source for Egyptian information especially if you are doing anything academically like writing a school paper or giving a talk on Egypt.  I'll tell you this for certain, it is not worth [the money]...	2002-10-23

I see this has been revised and is now entitled &quot;Cultural Atlas of Ancient Egypt&quot; which makes sense because it is really is focused on how the culture of Egypt is a reflection of the geography and natural environment and how humans learned to adapt it to them.  This was one of the books we used in a course I had back at Columbia University and I've kept using it ever since.  The maps are wonderful, the insets about the society are great, and the pictures both drawn and photographs of surviving artifacts are very useful.  I plan on using the updated version of this for my own class on Egyptian history.	2002-10-23

If you want a multitude of pictures and a fair discussion of the tomb's discovery and the objects found in it, then this is an excellent book.  We used this in a grad/undergrad level seminar I took back at Columbia University because it is so detailed on the tomb and its discovery.  However, when it comes to information about Tutankhanum himself there are only 20 pages that look at his life and the historical context of his life, most of that is spent on his family and the dynasty he is part of.  20 pages out of 200+?!  This is why I'm giving this book only 4 stars -- the cover and the summary offered by the book itself suggests the book has three parts and this first one is barely there.	2002-10-23

It is rather older than I'd ideally like an introductory textbook to be, but until I see a better and more accessible book this may have to do.  I think Grimal (and Shaw) do a good job of interweaving economics, culture, and political history together; a rather difficult thing to do at times and there are moments of confusion in the text.  However, many other books on Egyptian history focus on one particular issue or use one historical approach and those are just not appropriate for introductory texts in either the classroom or for the layperson.  I think that if a teacher were to use other information in lecture or assignments this particular textbook is just fine for the college level.	2002-10-23

I've loved Steven W. Saylor's work even before he published under this name and his Gordianus series is better by far.  This is actually a collection of 9 short stories, all of which were previously published in mystery magazines.  All of the stories are good solid character pieces with mysterious happenings and detective work that makes sense for the time period involved (90-73 BCE).  Several of the stories are told as stories by one character to another though several are also the ongoing investigations of the finder himself.  Historians may cringe a bit but frankly, in this ancient historian's opinion, Saylor's series is about the best I have ever read particularly his portrayal of slavery, a human institution often misunderstood and misrepresented by modern Americans.	2002-10-21

In my opinion, Tepper's work is often hit or miss -- either I'm intrigued and enjoy it like I did with &quot;The Gate to Women's Country&quot; or I'm turned off and just can't connect with any character as happened in &quot;Gibbon's Decline and Fall&quot;.  &quot;Six Moon Dance&quot; is as complex as GD&amp;F but the characters are interesting and easily empathized with as in G-WC.  But it is slow going at 61 chapters in 520 pages!  The chapters are first seem disconnected but the main character, Mouche, is so interesting because enough background is spent on him, that you find yourself plodding through slower chapters to get to his next part.  About half way through, it all flows together even though the mysteries are still unsolved until the last 50 pages of the book.  No surprises here, the plot and the flow is strong enough that you don't say &quot;what?&quot; you just say &quot;Oh, that's it!&quot;.  However, Tepper's style is not to everyone's liking and you may wish for a firmer conclusion, so unless you've enjoyed other of her books, I suggest borrowing this from the library first before buying it.	2002-10-20

Or has the skills to do most of that work? My father and grandfather and, indeed, one of my nephews, are homebuilders not just for their own families but for others as well.  That took years of training.  If you are just starting out, perhaps the advice to just keep adding on as you can afford it is good, but most people aren't settled down into an area for the first several years out of school or after marriage.  My husband and I got this book hoping it would give us advice to minimumize a mortgage but it is really about building from the ground up and that requires time and skills we don't have.  If you have such time, are a bit savings, or even a lot of house building skills (or family who lives near by and will help) then you'll probably find this book far more useful than we did.  Ultimately, there are things we don't know how to do and taking the time to learn is more likely to result is damage to the home or our pocketbook later on.  I was glad to know that for those who can, this book should be helpful in a general way.	2002-10-17

The best thing about this collection is Shelly Shapiro's introductory essay that attempts to define &quot;alternative history&quot;.  As a historian and a college instructor, I can't really agree with Shapiro that using &quot;alternative histories&quot; is a great way to discuss history -- students seem confused enough about history at least at the earliest levels.  Most &quot;alternative history&quot; seems focused on WWII or the American Revolution and thus I've not found it very interesting.  I bought this specifically for the variety of time periods covered.  However what I discovered was that I either had too much historical knowledge or too little really grasp the stories depending on the period covered.  Of the 10 stories included in this book, Robert Silverberg and A.A. Attanasio's work stood out in my mind for their ability to tell a story that seemed worth reading and yet also be close enough to &quot;historical facts&quot; to make sense.  Some of the stories are so subtly different that you have to really think to understand what is going on while others seem a bit confused in the telling.	2002-10-17

However, the 'how-to' part is very general so unless you know your house building, this book will not help you much in the practical issues of home creation.  It will give you ideas and suggestions that you can then use to find a good contractor and keep your eyes on the company you hire.  It is very difficult to find books about underground or even earth beamed houses now, which is sad because they can be very energy effecient and lovely.  This is a good start and Rob Roy is well-known for his work and his workshops on home building.	2002-10-17

As with many writers who dip into that genre infrequently, it can be a toss up whether or not the next attempt will be good.  \\"He, She, and It\\" is good.  The main character is Shira and we follow her life for a few months as she fights for her child, herself, her family, and her hometown, and her lover.  These \\"fights\\" are almost universal, they seem as though they could happen at any time but by placing them into the future, Piercy allows us to question the reasons for these fights at all.  Are they \\"natural\\" or \\"social\\" or a mixture?  Frankly I found the idea of corporations controlling most of the world except for agriculture and a few \\"free towns\\" difficult to grasp but since this isn't really the point of the story, I'm not docking points  stars for that...	2002-10-17

In other words, this is a book for crossdressers who love women's clothes but have no desire to be female or women.  The book is very sensitive to the feelings of both the men who wear women's clothing and the reality of women's lives in America today -- I was especially impressed with Anders understanding of how clothing can be used as an oppressive item and how culture can influence a person's self-esteem.  There is an excellent resource directly included and the practical, time-saving tips might help women who find themselves wanting to be more traditionally feminine but lacking the time or experience.	2002-10-14

Either way, I love home design books.  However this is also an advertisement for Lindal Cedar Homes so I'm sure they are highlighting their best work and not putting in their prices for a reason: I bet the homes are fairly expensive.  Regardless  I loved the multitude of color photographs and drawings.  Perhaps I'll consider the company once I'm settled down to build a house.	2002-10-10

The book is a combination of current reflection, memories and scenes that demonstrate not only how much Bastian has changed but how much his subculture has changed.  However the book claims to talk about a leather family, a family that is similar to several I know of, yet very very little time is spent exploring who is in Bastian's family.  Having a non-traditional family is difficult, add into it any power dynamic and it is even more confusing.  Each kinky family really creates its own model -- I had been hoping this book could be one model and I was deeply disappointed it was not.	2002-10-10

In his previous book, \\"Gladiator School,\\" Elliott benefited from little surviving knowledge about how exactly the gladiatorial centers functioned and as long as he kept the Roman as \\"masters\\" there was little issue with just having historical fun.  However, how Roman conquered, what they did with those they conquered, and the more general ideas about sexuality in the Roman world make this second book less realistic to the trained eye.  Now the sex is still pretty hot but I found myself saying \\"no, that's not right, that's not likely\\" so many times that I was distracted.  Basically the plot falls into a sort of \\"Spartacus\\" model by the last fifth of the book though without a sad ending.  So if you aren't as picky as me with \\"historical information\\" and you liked the roughness and grandeur of his first book, then you should like this one too.	2002-10-10

The book has four main sections: intro, skills, scenes, and conclusion.  The basic message is both simple and somewhat revolutionary if you listen to the general BS in the vanilla world: bottoms are powerful.  There are layout problems in this edition such as mislabeled sections and as always I would really like writers to do more research and more citations.  Only one group of kinky folk are left out of the chapter: the 24/7 or lifestyle persons.  But the book is for beginners and in my opinion beginners need to start slowly.	2002-10-10

By focusing on the personal and individual journey of someone who imagines himself as a slave, this book challenges several of the assumptions current in the gay SM subculture.  While the chapters are thought provoking and the \\"exercises\\" possibly useful, the emotions of the writer (whoever that is since the \\"slave\\" is unnamed) are what really stick out.  Patrick Califia's response from the dominant side of things is a wonderful addition.  This book cannot and should not be the one and only you use if you are undertaking the slave role but it can be a useful addition to your education.	2002-10-10

You have likely heard the expression &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot; but it also true that it takes a group of people to abuse a child.  Nothing happens in a vacuum, no single person is ever totally responsible for abusing someone because others know even if they wish to pretend they do not and societies, be they small religious groups or nations of millions, create dependent relationships that trap the victim.  This is not the story of victims, this is a story of survivors, especially Donald himself.  The book is told on several levels: First, we see glimpses of the Donald now who is writing this book; then there are two layers of flashbacks -- those triggered during his journey back to the &quot;homes&quot; he knew as a child and young adult as well as the flashbacks he experienced throughout his life; finally the bulk of the book is a chronological account of the abuse and its effects over the years.  As someone who has also survived abuse, I can tell you that the feeling such levels creates in a reader only approaches the feelings you deal with throughout your life -- may none of you ever get more than this basic approach.  An important book but a difficult book to read if you have a human heart at all.	2002-10-01

The monologues begin in 1950 when Franny is just accepting who he is and learning to become part of his community.  The monologue chronical Franny's life for four decades as he interacts with dragqueens, butch gay men, lesbians, politicos, and intellectuals who come to view Franny as a staple and inspiring force in their lives.  No explicit sexuality at all but a serious of honest and common spoken pieces representing the changes gay men and the mainstream culture around them experience post WWII.

For Preston pornography seems to be anything that includes sexuality where one of the goals is sexual arousal; a definition you may not personally agree with but it took guts in the late 1980s and very early 1990s to say that.  Preston didn't just write pornography but just like today that would not have kept him alive because it pays either so poorly for quality or you create a lot of junk just to pay the bills.  In a way, some of these essays could almost be classified as a manifesto for writers, especiallythose of us who use sexuality to communicate, entertain, and investigate humanity.  If you aren't interested in the political, the social, and the controversial in gay porn from one of the \\"masters\\" of that field, don't buy this book.

I say this for two reasons.  The first is my own personal dislike of any fiction that protrays rape as a precusor to a loving relationship and there are a few rapes in this book.  The second is that I'm an educator who works with a university and a student organization to promote and explain BDSM as viable form of sexuality.  While I'd happily recommend seeing the movie version, I'd be hestitant to say to a newbie \\"watch this\\" for fear they might think the book is reflecting an actual BDSM relationship.  A complaint I've heard about the book is not true: The main characters do not say they give up SM at the end; instead it is greatly downplayed leading to the common assumption that SM is seen as inferior to vanilla.	2002-09-20

The lives examined inclue Theseus (perhaps more legend than history), Solon (also a tad more legend than history), Themistocles, Aristides, Cimon, Pericles, Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lysander.  There are two descent maps -- one of the Aegean and one of mainland Greece.

Jokes can be both funny and cutting, and often it seems that women have been the victims of comedy more often than men. But jokes aside, this book of quotations demonstrates that even if the numbers are not equal, men too have been the target of commentary but amusing and attacking for centuries.  The illustrations are simple black & white drawings of a \\"Victorian\\" style, rather satirically in itself considering the gender roles at that time.  The book is organized on the premise that males are a extincted species and this is a pseudo-historical view of them by the survivors, females.  The book has five chapters where the quotations are organized by subject and tone.  I found it actually quite interesting but not necessarily funny, but them I'm a historian and a feminist so I was over-analyzing the content, I'm sure.  I find it to be a good source for bitting commentary when I write some of my fiction.	2002-09-17

It includes lists of ancient sources that mention each entry, the works connected to the mentioned person, and brief reference to some of the scholars' whose research was used in writing this guide.  Some basic institutions and terms attempt to balance out the names of people and places.  There are several good maps in the Appendices but these aren't very big so you'll want a much better altas.

The general problem that most textbooks have -- too focused on 2 or 3 regions with barely a mention of other ancient cultures -- is the exact opposite problem with this book.  First there is the problem of defining when ancient civilizations existed.  This book goes from pre-history to the 16th century after the Europeans start settling the Americas!  Second so many cultures are touched upon that very few get the treatment they deserve.  It feels as though these authors are attempting to compensate for an &quot;too Mediterranean view&quot; but as a result note dealing with them in any acceptable way.  A much better survey book would first limit the time periods it looks at (I'd suggest beginning of cities to fall of Rome in the West) then think about the themes you want to cover.  Use those themes (urbanization, status, economics, trade, military, gender, intellectual matters) to look at a variety of civilizations in that period.  So basically, I'm still waiting for a better ancient survey textbook to come out.	2002-09-16

As I force my players to dive deeper into the mysterious world of Kindred and fight against destruction, prophecy can be a wonderful thing.  I use this book, along with &quot;The Book of Nod&quot; and other WoD books to develop unique interpretations to the story we have just finished our fourth summer of playing.  Told from the point of view of someone investigating the cults concerning Lilith, we get 3 &quot;books&quot; about the Dark Mother. These three agree on many points but it is the contradictions that I find most useful in the game.  A creepy feeling surrounds the book and you may get chills just from reading it.	2002-09-14

At the end are two other strips by Holbrook -- \\"Safe Havens\\" and \\"On the Fastrack\\" which I know nothing about except the characters are human not anthropormorphic animals.  The very last six pages of this book return to \\"Kevin & Kell\\" but in color.	2002-09-14

Of these 9, three are outstanding works of scholarly deduction and clear writing; another two are very good though they wander a bit or lack a clearly defined conclusion.  The topics covered include visual representations on a variety of mediums, writing from women, drama and satire, and finally religious connections between \\"correct behavior\\" and control.  This is not a book for anyone with a casual interest in gender and sexuality in antiquity -- the more you already know, the better your own Greek and Latin (at least), the more good you'll get from these studies.	2002-09-14

In this very short book we learn about 3 new clans of Kindred, their disciplines, a whole butch of specialized skills, talents, and knowledges, along with weapons and armor specifics.

Written from the point of view of a Kindred scholar, this book collects three version of the development of Kindred, their laws, and the curses the earliest generations either created or earned.  Lots of &quot;footnotes&quot; add an air of authority to it but I just didn't feel as creepy as I did with &quot;Revations of the Dark Mother&quot; or &quot;The Erciyes Fragments&quot;.

However, it is not thorough and an agenda is clear -- there need to be far more citations to really prove some of the touted &quot;facts&quot;.  The book approach several different topics but none with a great deal of depth or undenialable evidence.  The pictures, and there are many of them, are beautiful.  If you are looking for ways to incorporate the yoni into your spiritual life this book will help you -- but I don't think it will satisfy the serious scholar.	2002-09-13

For the novice the tone of the work should be reassuring.  For those of more experience, I'm sure you'll find useful suggestions.  There is a few brief mentions about women but honestly that isn't the focus on the book so don't be upset if you don't find the answers and you are female or have a female partner.  My only complaints are the fact that this book, as with so many on sexuality, lack good citations for their \\"facts\\".  Frankly the more I encounter this problem the bigger it becomes in my mind.	2002-09-13

There are two stories, 8 paintings and 40 black and white pieces.  Odds are if you look at kinky gay male art online, you've seen Etienne's work.

For a long time, Nagle's survey books were the only ones available.  This is not true for the &quot;readings&quot; book that is written to accompany his survey book.  Overall the selections are rather haphazard -- they are organized both thematically and chronologically but not culturally or geographical.  Some of the entries are great but many are far too brief to be of real use to students.  There are many &quot;source&quot; books for ancient history but they all have this same problem.  Ultimately I suspect that most instructors will spend time creating course packets than relying on these source books.	2002-09-11

Finding a single book that does a decent job of discussing several civilizations is difficult and Nagle's revision does a better job than the last four versions.  The book has four division: ancient Near East, Greek world, and Roman world.  Saddly the book is really focused on the Greek and Roman worlds and pathetic 87 pages looks at the variety of cultures in the Near East.  By the way, neither India, China, or a few other civilization about as ancient as the Near East, Greece or Rome or presented.  However, what is include is well-written and decently organized, primary sources and images supplement the information well.	2002-09-08

Prior to that I had taught two of my own courses and been an associate instructor for two more.  I wish I had read this book prior to my teaching because it asks a lot of very good questions and gives suggestions that you can use in the classroom.  The variety of courses that can be helped by such tips is endless -- even if you don't think your particular field could use a particular chapter or really has a particular issue I found reading it always helped me devise new strategies for teaching.  This is not, however, a model of how to teach (could there ever be such a model?), you'll have to read and evaluate what may work for you for each particular class.	2002-09-05

In 21 chapters, yup you read correctly, 21!, he covers everthing from disease, to fees, to agencies, to legal advice, and personally balancing sex for money with sex in your private and personal life.  Guess what?  Escorting is neither  total fun nor total depravity, for Lawrence it is a career.  The book is geared toward escorts, and I'd say clients too, who are both male.  This isn't a guide for female escorts or males escorts who do female clients but some of the basics could be applied to either group I suspect.	2002-09-02

This is one of  Califia's non-fiction works.  In 8 chapters, Califia tackles the public lives of several transgendered folks in the twentieth century.  In no way does Califia endorse their views, in fact she points out that many of them are hardly gender radicals because they embrace very traditional views of gender roles.  In many ways, this was quite sad to read.  If you know that Califia has now become Patrick Califia you can read this book as both a historical and psychological analysis of the issue of transgenderism as well as a historical look at Califia's own personal journey.  This book is not for those of you with very conservative views of sexuality or gender roles so if you buy it, it will make your upset but now you are warned.	2002-09-02

Brame's \\"Come Hither\\" is really for those who are looking to either spice up their love life or those who are turned off by the average BDSM books and organizations.  However, Brame does suggest that you getinvolved and do more reading -- an excellent piece of advice since the bibliography and recommended books she lists leave a good deal out and \\"common sense\\" is rarely a great guide to life, especially sex.  In 13 chapters she does a good job of looking at several issues and behaviors that one may want to try that fall into the BDSM umbrella.  As I find frustrately common in non-fiction sexuality books, there is a lack of correct citations.	2002-09-02

In fact, I suspect that readers would get the most from this book if they read the previous one.  Virtual Foreplay is a very simple guidebook to the Internet and the various resources available to find a partner.  Hogan clearly believes that face-to-face encounters are superior to online ones so if you were looking for a guide to getting cyberlaid this won't do the job.  A word of caution: anything about the Internet or the Web can get outdated quickly in terms of addresses and sites so don't be surprised if you can't find the same sites she does.  Overall the advice is very sound but the book is really for those with questions about dating, finding a partner, and learning the Internet.  For anyone else, its not very useful.	2002-09-02

The nine stories in this collection fall more into the dystopian category than either of these two definitions.  Only Ursula K. Le Guin's &quot;Mountain Ways&quot; was really intense and interesting enough to make me want to reread it.  Stories by Stableford, Resnick, Purdom, Dedman, and Sterling were all just boring -- I couldn't care about any of the characters.  &quot;Nevermore&quot; by Ian R. MacLeod had potential but it was too disjointed to make me feel much.  David Marusek's &quot;Out of Touch&quot; also had a great beginning but a very weak and rather sudden ending.  &quot;Smart Alec&quot; by Kage Baker was well-written but very very sad.

Regardless there are both really good stories and really boring stories in this collection -- I use boring purposely because the writing isn't bad, some of the stories are just boring.  Normally  I like Nancy Kress but her piece &quot;Evolution&quot; was slow and it wasn't clear what disease was being fought.  Frederik Pohl's &quot;Fermi and Frost&quot; was a bit hard to follow as we jumped from one character's view to the authors.  Gregory Benford's &quot;A Desperate Calculus&quot; wasn't well-paced and it seemed like a surprise when the cause of it all was revealed.  Richard Cowper's &quot;A Message to the King of Brobdingnag&quot; lacked characters I could relate to though the idea of advancements in agriculture ending the world was new for me.  &quot;...The World, As We Know'T&quot; by Howard Waldrop had both interesting characters and  an intriguing replay of 19th century theory.  Both Gardner Dozois' &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; and Raccona Sheldon's &quot;The Screwfly Solution&quot; look at doomsday cults and the horrorific spread of them.  The characters which grabbed me most were in Fritz Leiber's &quot;A Pail of Air&quot; -- I wasn't expecting it to grab because I normal hate his work.  Allan Danzig's &quot;The Great Nebraska Sea&quot; reads like a history book.  &quot;Inconstant Moon&quot; by Larry Niven was also unexpectedly good and positive.  Geoffrey A. Landis' &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; was too short to get me involved much.  And finally &quot;Down in the Dark&quot; by William Barton was so long and so paced that I gave up on it.	2002-08-19

I think a good source book is one which can be used by a storyteller regards of when/where your own story is set.  While I could use of the information here for history or for lost artifacts, I was disappointed by the rather sketchy nature of the information in the book.

I found the book to be very interesting but the history revisionist in many ways especially regarding women and gender roles.  Some of my students found the characters boring while others liked the \\"every day\\" aspect of the narrative.  If you like revisionist history and stories that explore the everyday life then you should like this.

Gordianus again is involved with Cicero and yet very little interaction occurs between the great orator and the &quot;Finder&quot;.  In fact, this novel is far more a &quot;life in Gordianus' house&quot; than a mystery of any sort.  Sure, Saylor does a good job of making everyday life realistic but I was expecting more of a mystery, more intrigue, and more insights from Gordianus who seems  highly out of place both in plots around him and in his own family at times.  Yet, it is much better than the Falco series.	2002-08-12

How very ironic that the week after my students I am discussed and read Cicero's letters to his slave, Tiro, that I should get this book.  I read it quickly and enjoyed every minute of it.  While I might argue on some historical points, the speculations about society in Rome in 80 BCE are well done and played out with depth and personality.  I suggested it to my students today on our last class as a good example of popular history also being well-done history.  Saylor does an outstanding job in this entire series, it seems now having read a second book in it, of protraying slavery as a realistic institution.	2002-08-08

There is almost an imbalance between the good retelling of the fairytale and good erotic material.  The stories that seemed to best recreate the feeling of the original fairytale seemed less arousing in terms of our modern concepts of sexuality.  However, there is a variety of characters, fetishes, and acts for anyone to find something of interest.  If you can read the stories as literature first and erotica second, you'll be more pleased than if you are looking for orgasmic aids.	2002-08-08

It is a bit difficult to follow because it is in diary form.  You will be shocked, you will be frightened, and you may be turned-off especially if you came into BDSM in the 1990s when SSC because was pretty standard.  Because it is a diary, because it attempts to look at Johnson's life, there is little reflection or questioning of the events and people protrayed though there are entries where such analysis does appear it is still from within the mindset of an &quot;old guard slave&quot;.  For people who &quot;pine for the good old days&quot; this can be a reality check but it may not have been the average reality for every person in the SM lifestyle in the 1970s and 1980s.	2002-08-08

While specialists may disagree with some ideas and therefore profit from considering her take on classical women, her approach is also enticing enough and short enough to keep undergraduates interested.  I think this is a great book to use in a women's history course or a course focused on the classical period.  Needs better citations overall.	2002-04-24

Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 13 are very general as they look at the nature of education and gender roles in England during the lifetimes of these six authors.  At times her analysis of how the real lives of authors are reflected in their work seems stretched to the limit -- but this could be claimed in most literary analysis.  As a writer, I can say that yes, our lives affect our work, but how it affects it can only be truly understood by talking to the author herself and there is no evidence that Hoberman has done this.  She uncovers a good number of books which I did not know exist and so I'm off to find a few of them.	2002-04-10

A historian herself, Davis applies performance theory to examining how feature films do and can be an educational vehicle for history.  Five films are examined: Spartacus, Burn!, The Last Supper, Amistad, and Beloved.  The last four all deal with slavery in the &quot;new world&quot; of the Americas.  Davis points out incidents where historical fact has been replaced with fiction, where events have taken on a modern twist, and how film-making has hindered or aided in connecting the past to the modern audience.  None of the five films are perfect but Davis feels they are good overall because their goals are all to make the audience feel what the slaves or freed felt so that we can form a better understanding of a social institution that currently is frowned upon in most of the developed world.  It would have been better if she spent more time on the history of the period and events each movie covered but for an early attempt at using performance theory in history, it is an excellent start.	2002-04-08

If you approach this book with the mindset that you are rereading fairy tales then you'll enjoy how Szereto maintains the language and rhythm of fairy tales themselves though I think calling this a collection of the \\"Classics\\" isn't correct because many of the tales are rather obscure.  Fairy tales are written this way though -- odd language, lots of visuals and info that seems out of place.  If however you approach the book as erotica you will find it failing in several places as the terms are odd to our modern ears and the activities often too obscure to create a clear erotic image.	2002-04-05

Perhaps if one has read the series from the beginning, the characters would feel fuller, richer, more like people.  However the sign of a great book is to make a newcomer to a series feel for the characters regardless of which book in a series is read first.  I didn't feel much of anything for any of the characters.  Likewis it seemed that the mystery was solved haphazardly with little evidence and more luck than anything and a satisfying conclusion came with a whimper.	2002-03-30

Diamant's \\"The Red Tent\\" is one of these though told through a female voice.  The voice is that of Dinah and her story here is far different from the one you'll encounter in the Biblical text.  This could be offensive for some readers so if you personally believe the Bible to be the unerring word of  God, don't get this book because you will not like it.  However, if you like conflict between peoples, power struggles between the sexes, some fair historical speculation, and a good deal of sorrow, then you may enjoy this book.  Dinah herself is an engaging character and her recounting of generations of females memories was an intriguing way to tell this story.	2002-03-30

I teach a study and learning skills course linked to an American history course at a university in the USA and this biography must be read by the students.  With all the time spent in the colleges and universities and now in the media about how historians need to cite their sources, this biography is a sad and sorry example.  Nothing is cited, even the direct quotes have no citations!  Yes, Youngs does discuss his sources at the end of the book but that is not the same as giving credit to the sources where he drew his quotations and facts from.  The publisher, Longman, should be ashamed for allowing such poorly cited scholarship to be printed for used in either courses or the general public. I would have given this 1 star but the writing is engaging.	2002-03-18

Also, while I am, in fact, a storyteller for a Vampire: the Masquerade game each summer for a great group of players/actors, I found it odd just how much information from this gaming system was in the book (and also with errors) compared to other entries. Yes, the game is popular but it is just a game.  Also I was disappointed that the movie guide is not a separate book.  The other &quot;lists&quot; were great however.  It isn't really a book you can enjoy reading straight through, is any encyclopedia?  But if you know a term or an actor or director or writer, you can easily look them up here.	2002-03-17

While the feeling of the book is different as one reviewer states because it is told from a different viewpoint, the facts, the information, and the descriptions are pretty much the same. In terms of new paths and new rituals, I found &quot;Blood Magic&quot; and &quot;Guide to the Camarilla&quot; more informative.  I think the new view of this book follows very neatly into the overall changes in the tone of the game books.  Something very useful are the examples of character design and info on how to fit a &quot;Mind's Eye Theater&quot; player into a table-top game or the reverse.  Frankly, our game is a bit of both -- I have had some really really great players/actors so it gives me reason to continue collecting and reading the books for this game.  I just feel a bit like this one wasted some of my money because so much is a repeat.	2002-03-17

Now I do.  In fact, now I have more information on the philosophy, politics, and social lives of what might be considered \\"one-third\\" of the vampire population in terms of the major categories the undead can be placed into.  I really liked the comparison between elder and younger Sabbat members because it shows some of the tensions in the Independent and Camarilla groups too.  A lot of time is spent on how to make a Sabbat character more than a stereotyped killing machine and how to make a Sabbat story more than a murder spree.  One huge disappointment was the repetition of information about the various clans in the Sabbat -- I think the two page summary might be better worked into the more general discussion of the clans so one doesn't have to flip back and forth so much.  I also think some stories from the view of \\"allies, antagonists and others\\" would strengthen the good job done on describing Sabbat packs and Sabbat society in general.	2002-03-17

However what does not seem to be mentioned in other reviews is the strange brief introduction to Egyptian family \\"history\\" before the story begins.  Over and over I asked \\"where did she get ideas like this\\" and had to conclude since her \\"facts\\" are not cited or documented in any way that she must be reading Herodotus or some modern pseudo-historical work based on misconceived ideas about the benefits of finding matriarchical, matrilineal, and matrifocal cultures.  Aside from the questionable family \\"history\\" there is also the fact that the story itself does not make reference to the introduction in almost any way until we get to the plot to kill Pharaoh in the last third of the book.  The idea of creating  female character who could have contact with Joseph and playing up the competition of religions is very well played out in the story.  The plot and characters were interesting enough to keep me reading.  It is less \\"G-rated\\" than many stories based on the Joseph tale or almost any modern fictional retelling of a society that readily embraced slavery -- still not as accurate as it could be but is our society truly ready for such accuracy?	2002-03-15

But this book, the first I read from Steven W. Saylor gives me hope that there are good mysteries set in a fairly historically accurate Rome afterall.  My first summer class I'm teaching will be reading this this early June and we'll talk about the historical and social realities behind the book.  I'm glad I took the risk of buying this book.  I look forward to reading more Saylor books, especially those with Gordianus whose detective skills seem to fit well into the late Republican period of Rome.  Little seemed strained or &quot;modern&quot; not even the attitudes toward slavery which were, even then, a mixture and varied from person to person, class to class.	2002-03-12

Christian Focus books claims that it publishes \\"biblically-accurate books\\" and while this fictional retelling of Paul's letter to Philemon may be true to the New Testament account, it is not true to the historical reality of its time.  It isn't that St. John doesn't grasp the horror of slavery, in fact she plays it down a bit but this is more for children and teenagers than adults.  But the period, 1st century not long after the death of Jesus, is too early for so many Christians, especially among the middle and upper classes of Rome, to be running around everywhere.  The character of Onesiumus though is well done and shows complexity and conflict where it should -- other characters too are fairly done.  Its a good book to preach with, just not a good both to teach history from.	2002-03-11

The illustrations are very poorly drawn and this is a great disappointment because many women (and men) do not have the education and experience the book is really assuming on several levels and clear, correct illustrations could be helpful for them.  Also the book isn't really about lesbians, its a women and women's bodies.  Regardless of your sexual orientation and your sex or gender, I think you can learn a lot from this book.  Your experiences may not be the same and that is ok, keep remembering that as you read and you'll get a lot from it.	2002-03-10

However, the majority of the books and films examined are not mainstream so really the essays can only be fully appreciated and understood by a small audience.  Likewise, far too much time is really spent looking at bisexual women to justify the title &quot;Bisexual Men&quot;.  Only the last essay by Marshall Miller, &quot;Ethically Questionable?': Popular Media Reports of Bisexual Men and AIDS&quot; is truly accessible to most people and it does a great job of discussing cultural preceptions of bisexual men.  What would be wonderful is a book that actually examined the mainstream of American culture and society.	2002-03-10

The goal of the book is to make the novice safe -- usually the focus is on teaching the top partner but I think that the bottom partner could learn something too.  This book won't make you safe, only practice and experience can do that, but it will give you basic guidelines on a very wide range of subjects so you can try things out slowly and with less risk.  The overall feel is toward male top and female bottom (note please that the terms bottom and top or dom and sub are often refering to the same role) but there are sections specifically for other orientations and it written non-threatheningly so you can get value regardless of your role.  It is a book I insist all my apprentices purchase and use.	2002-03-10

It is a fast read but unfortunately a disappointing one.  There are many awkward phrasings throughout the book that took me a second to understand.  While the character of Joseph is nicely cocky in the beginning, such little time is actually spent on his journey to Egypt, his slavery to Potiphar, and his time in prison that it is difficult to understand and empathize with the emotional and psychological changes he shows.  Likewise the relationships Joseph develops with Egyptians, especially those he would be close to such as his master and his wife, are treated rather briefly and in his wife's case a bit sexistly.  Overall I was very disappointed.	2002-03-10

There are hundreds of fiction books that portray unrealistic relationships and a few dozen which show more the heart and soul of BDSM.  But John Warren in one book does both.  This book, &quot;Safe, Sane, Consensual and Fun&quot; is a great hybred of fiction and how-to.  14 stories show different orientations (primarily het) and different activities that people who do BDSM engage in.  At the beginning we are given a list of the tools used in the story. As the story goes along, there are safety notes, suggestions, and info on how that scene is being done.  Its a good way to start exploring and a good source to have your partner read before you try something out.  Just remember that you aren't a fictional character and other things can come up during your scenes.	2002-03-10

This second book by Miss Abernathy is set out as a series of lessons to be undertaken (ideally) by a wouldbe erotic slave and an owner or trainer.  However, the order of the chapters is a bit odd at times so when I use it I assign lessons in an order which makes better sense to me.  Likewise I do not agree with every idea or exercise so I use those lessons to get discussion going or just ignore them.  The book is great because it is divided into general training then more advanced or specialized types of erotic slavery.  A book for the very serious Ds relationships...Just don't think you have to use the book as it is written and it will serve you much better.	2002-03-08

Not his best work, but still a well-developed and well-written account of a community gay leather men who run into space when threatened on their home worlds.  There is a lot of sex but it is clear that Townsend has spent time thinking about how the technology and the society aboard ship would function.  There are three main characters: the \\"Master\\", Ian and Kraag whose sexual and torturous exploits may be a bit too rough at times for some people.  However the emotional connections are also explored so if you don't like it quite so rough, skip a few pages.  The drawings by SEAN add a good deal to the text.	2002-03-08

This book is really the philosophy part of a set of books written about erotica slavery, or what Miss Abernathy calls \\"slavehood\\" in today's so-called kinky community.  The book has two parts: \\"The Training Program\\" and \\"D/S Relationships\\".  The basic philosophy is that a training program contains basic standard components but also needs to reflect the individual needs of erotic owners and erotic slaves.  Likewise relationships have certain common characteristic but are unique to the couple (or group) involved.  It is one of the books I highly recommend.	2002-03-08

The health information could also use an update too but by and large it is still an good guide toward all sorts of safety concerns ranging from disease, to physical stresses, to emotional vulnerability.  I can't say that the community the authors refer to over and over is one I've ever really seen or that I agree with all of the philosophical comments they make, but it is a book I recommend that people read if they are interested in basic health issues involving BDSM.	2002-03-08

Nan is not the stereotyped femdom you might be thinking of though she can clearly dress up and put on a well-scripted and eleborate scene.  The descriptions are not pornographic though they are careful to mention both physical and emotional aspects of the scenes.  There are both male and female submissives and bottoms discussed throughout the book, the most extreme scene involve Nana and her primary female lover (she also has a husband).  It should stimulate your mind and your groin so be prepared. I would have been better if Nan had gotten more personal -- why she does it, what it feels like to her, how she has changed over time -- as the title suggests.	2002-03-08

He spends enough time on the safety issues to satisfy a safety freak like myself but in a way which isn't too frightening if you are already interested in the practice.  Using scripts to demonstrate and re-enforce the procedure he has outline was a wonderful teaching method.  He is also very realistic about what can and cannot be done using hypnosis though I think many of these activities and changes are likely to take more time than the average person is willing to spend.  Another great non-fiction book from Greenery Press.	2002-03-08

Wiseman's book is the most detailed discussion of erotic bondage to date.  A wide range of equipment is examined and basic positions and rope work is laid out in words and images.  It would be great if the book were spiral bound though so you can lay it out flat when you are practicing.  The book, however, is not a substitution for either learning hands-on style  or just practicing over and over.  There is also a good discussion of the emotional and creative components of erotic bondage.	2002-02-24

Written at the end of the Bush-Reagan era, this anniversary edition is itself a historical document that shows how far kinky sex has come as well as how thin the social on which it stands truly is.  The only strong negative I have is that the vast majority of the contributing authors are homosexual and hets have serious concerns and problems because of their BDSM that gays and lesbians may not have -- it would be good to include everyone in such a colllection because if one group falls, the others may follow.	2002-02-24

I highly recommend that it be read out loud and with your partner(s) and that you go slowly, maybe a chapter a day, so you can discuss the issues and ideas in it.

It can be difficult to balance between talking down to those who will feel they have a lot of experience in BDSM and tallking over those who are just learning about BDSM.  This book does a good job of looking at a wide range of activities and interests, some of them for the first time, so that newbies can feel grounded while advanced kinky folk can mull over the concepts.  Even though the book grew out of Bean's own journey toward becoming a master, I think the book can speak to anyone regardless of vanilla sexual orientation.  However the book often reads more like it is geared toward the bottom or submissive partner in a relationship.	2002-02-24

Joshel and Murnaghan's introduction sets the intellectual stage for the entire collection and I could easily see assigning it in an upper level undergraduate class.  However there are two reasons why I can't give this more than 3 stars.  First, 7 of the essays do not follow through with their stated agendas and indeed seem a bit confused or wandering without reaching specific conclusions.  Secondly, the essays do not seem to be arranged in any logical or chronoligical fashion and frankly there is no &quot;Greco-Roman&quot; world -- there is Greek culture, there is Roman culture and then there is where the two meet but these are three different cultures and should be treated as such.	2002-02-23

Books	5	5	8	N	N	Interesting Collection of gender/anatomy issues	52 women and 2 men wrote pieces for Fiona Giles discussing how having a penis for 24 hours might help them understand males, men, and masculinity.  What Giles has collected are 17 art pieces ranging from drawings to photos and 37 written piece ranging from short essays to poetry to short stories.  Among the contributors are Pat Califia whose essay addresses stereotypes and what \\"phallic envy\\" may really be about, Jane Yolen's modern fairtale, \\"Ask Isadora\\" advice column by Isadora Alman.  Some of the pieces are funny, some are nasty bits of revenge, and a few are even quite insightful.  I'm sure something in it will offend everyone but I also think everyone can finding it amusing and moving.  Now when we have the reverse experiment?	2002-02-23

Here we see the harsh social realities faced by foundlings in the life of Beric, Roman child adopted from the sea by Britons during the Roman Empire -- when exactly isn't given.  While I'm glad the attempt was made to show the harshness of life both in the north and then among the Romans there was still a bit of sugar-coating that is perhaps the result of wanting to respect our own morals or the result of a lack of knowledge.  Thus the sexual terror and abuse of slavery is not mentioned and there is the idea that slaves have special clothes or jewelery to mark their status which is not the case unless one had been a runaway or a master really wanted to use a collar or brand or tattoo.  The ending was also a bit too positive but then again most people don't want to read a sad tale even if it is more realistic.	2002-02-20

The theory promoted in this book, called Societal Stockholm Syndrome, is supposed to be a universal law of behavior which states that femininity, love of men, and heterosexuality are a function of patriarchy and thus cannot be called natural.  The book tries to understand this newly discovered law and propose ways in which a more natural woman may be promoted.  While the gender stereotypes of expected behavior fit well within the definition of the Societal Stockholm Syndrome, very little time is given to understanding that gender stereotypes are merely that: stereotypes, models for how people might behave, not a fact of how people must behave.  When the theory is applied to the individual lives of each woman I doubt it will hold up for all of us.  It certainly did not hold up for me.  The most helpful part of the book is the final chapter, which discusses how gender stereotypes of what it means to be a woman can be recognized and fought.  Overall it offers good insights but needs to be expanded to include the fact that women themselves may relate in such ways and often encourage such stereotyped behavior from other women.	2002-02-20

The biggest problem is the main character, Michael LaGuardia, who frankly seems like a poser to me but that may be the intention of the book. We do get a few more insights to Chris Parker and meet the Trainer of Trainers herself in the book.  So it is well worth reading if you have enjoyed the previous two books and want a bridge to the fourth in the series.	2002-02-20

Several issues covered are emotional reasons, physical safety, sexual desires, comfort for both spanker and spankee, as well as suggestions on how to incorporate spanking into your love life.  It is not comprehensive nor will it make you a great spanker or spankee but it can give you good insights into issues you should consider before bending over or taking a whack at your partners butt.	2002-02-20

Most of these are porn but the quantity reflects a relatively common interest for some men (and some women too).  This book attempts to create a sissy maid in 30 days and frankly this is the greatest disappointment of the book because I don't think it can succeed in such a task in such a short among of time -- it would be better to adapt the daily assignment into weekly ones, in my opinion, to get better and more positive results.  Likewise it really needs references to stores and other printed materials that the common reader can access.  But it is a good general introduction to the philosophy and feelings of many men and women who do sissy maid training and service. It helped me understand that a world a little better.	2002-02-20

The audience of this book are those already in the community, those who are interested in promoting education, better public images or finding common ground between individuals and kinky organizations.  Dominguez speaks to activists in 16 essays that look at his own personal journey, touch on important issues affecting the kinky community, and challenging activists to be better whether they serve on the front lines for legal changeor via the pen to educate and entertain. There is a focus more toward gay men's experience of the world and activism but this reflects the author's own experience and should not lock out others who truly wish to help themselves and others become accepted in society and to better society.	2002-02-20

The first half of the collection contains the best pieces of the entire collection with Hyde's contributions being among the very best.  All orientations and roles are explored to some extent though the gay politican and the sex for votes ideas are the most common.  Not all the stories look at politicans however or look at voters and politicans -- sometimes the politicans are together and sometimes it is only political views and platforms that are touched upon.  This collection is a fun read if you don't take it too seriously but you may not want to give it to a very sexually conservative friend.	2002-02-20

Primarily gay men who get off of stories of force and humiliation focused on male feet and shoes.  This isn't a well written collection of short storie but more a collection of porn published and written by members of a a foot fetish organization.  None of the pieces are horribly written, except the first one, but there is no real depth to the characters and plots because the point is to turn you on and help you get off quickly.  So if feet, raunch, boots, and men turn you on, so might this.	2002-02-20

Arranged by topic or activity addressed in the piece (there are five categories in all), this collection spans 2600 years of human work in the words of 122 individuals.  There is some activity or topic for everyone but this means that some may be offended now and again by other pieces.  Dillard has done a good job of collecting materials together though some historical background might be interesting too -- but then I'm a historian so that is one of my fetishes.	2002-02-20

There are not &quot;how-to&quot; sections nor fiction in this book but observations of reallife BDSM that are attempted to be turned into &quot;rules&quot; about the subculture.  Be careful, you are as likely to agree as to disagree with some of the conclusions reached but it will get you thinking. It is not, however, the best book to use if you are trying to introduce your partner to the scene -- it best serves those interested in a more clinical study of BDSM.	2002-02-20

For those who are not familiar with the political, social and public issues involved in what you can see almost every week on Jerry Springer, this is a good introduction to publications and attitudes of 20th century America.  I found Califia's analysis and presentations sharp and challenging -- especially since she has become Patrick Califia and he has written his own books.  There were occassions where there needed to be more citations for the statements and facts which Califia makes but overall this is an excellent book.	2002-02-19

The language is clear and simple for the most part and Brame's tone is one of understanding.  Most of the chapters are organized well and there is no attempt made to tell someone who to do different activities -- that is rightly left to more specific guides.  However, just as with \\"Different Loving\\", this book is in serious need of citations and evidence for many many statements which are made -- so a word of caution to not just blinding believe what you read.  Another very odd problem is the \\"kinky reading list\\" which does not included many very well written books from Greenery Press and yet includes far more advanced books (such as \\"Beneath the Skins\\" and \\"Leatherfolk\\") that beginners really do not need to read until they are far more experienced and grounded.	2002-02-19

If this were merely a philosophical text, I could bite my tongue and say that some people will find it offensive while others will not.  However, the book attempts to be both scientific and academic and it fails at both.  Historical facts, mytholigical reconstructions, and scientific studies are all clearly misunderstand at the best and falsely presented at worse.  Ultimately we end up with a very old male sexuality -- one built on biogical determinism, anti-homosexual and anti-bisexual feelings, with a strong dose of stereotyped sex and gender roles.  I was deeply disappointed.	2002-02-19

Let me briefly tell you about the language and situations in the book so you can see if it is a good choice for you.  First it all takes places on one part of an international corporation which caters to men who like to consume ejaculate.  Second, this particular branch uses equipment and terms which equates the men who produce [sperm] to cows.  There is also some more resort style arrangments in the hotel part of the farm but by and large the fantasy is farm and animal based.  Normally I'd give a book that focuses on such a specific fantasy three stars however I also feel that the motivations and internal drives of the characters are seriously short changed in this novel.  Likewise the plot cuts off then we flash ahead to months later and frankly the events that lead up to those runaway mancows would have been entertaining.  Thus I give this 2 stars only.	2002-02-19

It centers around the life of a young wealthy man named Philocleon who in the course of a few months meets, befriends, and kills Homer and his own father, loses his family estate, loses his eyesight, frees his slaves and finds love matches for those who help him, as well as make sure the words of one of Homer's poems, The Illiad, are written down and dedicated to Apollo.  The ending is quite aburpt actually and leaves many questions and Philocleon's own marriage hanging.  I took this as fictiion and yet as an ancient historian somes things were a bit odd.  Why this one poem and how would others then be acredited to Homer?  Why were the writing tutors Assyrian when it is Phoenician that Greek develops from?	2002-01-07

Books	4	60	63	N	Y	Great for young adults	People fantasize about the ancient world and as an ancient historian I'm often amused and annoyed by what these fantasies entail.  This is especially true in books written for children and young adults where the nastiness (by our modern standards) of the ancient world are often overlooked and underplayed.  Mary Ray's &quot;The Ides of April&quot; does a fairly good job of looking at the concerns of citizens, young people, and slaves in mid-first century Rome.  While the murder mystery kicks off sharply I do wish she'd spent more time on the characters before the entire legal nightmare began so that we could be more emotionally invested in the characters. Likewise it ends a bit aburptly.  I haven't read any of the other books of the series yet, but it seems like the same characters may not be encountered which is a pity.  The characters are well done, they seem to grasp the mindset of the people of that time though I think holding onto a Greek identity when one is born a slave in Rome is a bit awkward.  I'd recommend it to anyone between 14 and 20 who is interested in the ancient world or in power dynamics in history.  For those of us who are older, it can be entertaining as well.	2001-12-27

In addition the novel itself, this Mystic Rose edition has a short story, &quot;A Familiar Ring&quot;, which takes us futher along in Robin's service and gives us a glimpse back into the BDSM community as it exists today.

I understand completely.  The five short stories she does share (two of which are not science fiction in nature) are excellent and demonstrate the high level and intense emotional content we expect from Butler.  Two of these, &quot;Bloodchild&quot; and &quot;Speech Sounds&quot; I read in sci fi magazines years ago and they are what made me search for more of her work.  The two essays also included are good insights to Butler's philosophy and experiences as a writer.  She may not be a &quot;short story writer&quot; but I am glad that she has shared these five pieces with us.	2001-12-24

The introduction details how the &quot;documents&quot; were recovered and we discover something which I've known as a storyteller all along -- ghouls are a vital part of Kindred existance.  We see just want a ghoul will go through to service his master and himself, we see his identification with a clan, and indeed we see his own desires for knowledge -- all of these are something that other Vampire guides might lead you to think were impossible once enslaved by the blood.  The &quot;documents&quot; themselves are written interestingly -- text from the &quot;ancient sources&quot; interspersed with a dialogue of commentaries through the ages each written in a unique script giving the sense of a real exchange of ideas and personalities.  Some intriquing play on previous &quot;ancient texts&quot; as well as comfirmation of some ideas I'm sure are not unique to our game.  Well worth buying and using.	2001-11-19

Each chapter is an essay looking at a particular time period(s) or type of erotic literature and discusses the cultural and historical background against which it was composed.  However, it is very very focused on Western Europe and American literature.  Pre-modern times are condensed into two chapters and non-European or non-American cultures are only included in these chapters.  While I have designed a course which will use this book, it will only use certain chapters because it is too limited in terms of the variety of erotic literature examined.	2001-11-19

This is one of those introductory books that I highly recommend to people who think they may be interested in BDSM -- the other is &quot;Sensuous Magic&quot; by Pat Califia which I see is being reprinted this year.  Race Bannon, you have to wonder if he chose this as a penname or if its his real name, has done a great job on be concise and yet clear in describing a type of sexuality and initmacy that some people enjoy.  It also does a good job of being realistic, not making SM too romantic or simple so that everyone wants to run out and try it because frankly BDSM is not for everyone and should not be attempted by everyone.  Publishers out there, I think it is time to reprint this book and make it more widely available.  In an age of increasing media attention on the kinky, it would be a great way to make people's sex lives and relationships a bit safer and a bit more rewarding.	2001-11-19

Far too often the writers are more interested on getting the reader off than on making the setting authentic.  Whether something is porn or erotica doesn't really make a difference either in terms of historical accurracy.  Ben Elliott does a fair job of making &quot;Gladiator School&quot; historically correct (aside from the fact that male-male sexual relationships would never been this public in ancient Rome) and of making this an erotic novel and not merely a pornographic adventure.  The main characters grow and change, their personalities can be complex, and I think there is a good feeling for how some people in slavery may try and make the best of things.  The male-male sex is hot but there is a lot of violence too.	2001-11-19

My hope was to find one or two such collections that would be all that was necessary for my students to buy.  However, no books exists on the market today.  While the essential guide is good I find it too focused on the modern world and too focused on American and European erotica to be of use in a history or literature course of any diversity.  But if your interest in is erotic literature of the European or American variety then this is a good collection of interesting and varied work from the modern period.  Volume two is currently out of print but it would be nice to know what it included as well.	2001-11-19

Let me say immediately that as far as I know, this is the first and only book focused on flogging in a BDSM sense.  Many books have looked at the history and techniques of corporal punishment but in a consensual relationship you'll need different guides.  The book is structured to look at different aspects and issues related to flogging using four types of relationships falling under four different sexual orientations.  The male top and female bottom chapter looks at the basics of flogging and negotiation.  The gay male chapter examines the growth and compromise involved in a long-term SM relationship.  The lesbian chapter examines how things can and indeed may well go wrong and how a couple moves passed the problems to explore flogging as a positive sexual activity.  The female top and male bottom chapter  unfortunately is a professional relationship that has slid into the long-term, serious Ds model -- this does not reflect the  vast majority of such Ds relationships.  After each chapter, Bean looks at what has happened in the scenerio. For the first two couples these are solid commentaries and build on each other.  This starts to break down with the section on problems however and the analysis after the fourth couple doesn't really mention them or any other scene much at all.  A pattern was going and it really needed to be followed to make this an outstanding book. As it is, it is useful for beginners and experienced floggers and floggees who want to think and learn about it all a bit more.	2001-11-19

Thus the storyteller is the single most important person in the group and players will often join or leave a group based on the personality of the storyteller and their ability to create an intriquing journey.  But it is also very challenging to be a storyteller, especially if you are used to the less story-focused role-playing games where the DM or guide focuses on technical matters over characters or plot. This is a great book because it makes a lot of good suggestions, gives some needed guidelines, and also spends a good deal of time being honest about the storyteller's role, power, authority and the dynamics of players in this system. Does it answer every question?  No, but it will help you become a better storyteller and everyone in your group will benefit.	2001-11-18

When I'm the storyteller, I make sure we have ghouls in our games and I love when players are willing to take on ghouls as characters.  Why?  They are an interesting combination of vampire and human, a mixture of emotions, and far more powerful that most storytellers and players would like to believe.  This book gives you some insights into ghouls though I've seen other passages in other &quot;world of darkness&quot; books which should have been included here.  I was expecting a read guide to all ghouls you see so that did disappoint me greatly.  The pictures are probably some of the scariest in the series and in fact have turned off one really great player from being a ghoul -- very sad because he was so talented and he had such potential as this character.  I think another ghoul book perhaps modeled on the &quot;Children of the Night&quot; book would be a great aid.  Surely there are very powerful and very important ghouls in the world of darkness too.	2001-11-18

I say &quot;conclusion&quot; because the complex world which Anne Bishop has created calls for more investigation.  I do hope she is considering other books beyond these three and &quot;The Invisible Ring&quot;. Same basic complaints that hetereosexuality is viewed negatively in many ways, especially a woman's first sexual encounter.  Also I do not like how quickly she jumps from one scene and character to another, often spending only a page on a scene then far too many details on another section.  It was difficult to feel much for the &quot;bad characters&quot; and even though should capture our feelings to a degree.  However, the the plots are consistant, the world is complex and interesting.  I enjoyed the fact that there is no real happy ending, because in such a world it is doubtful own concept of &quot;happy&quot; could be found.  If you've read the first two and want to know what happens, then this will answer some of your questions but not all.	2001-11-18

I think this book has so much information, so many great ideas and guidelines, and clan background that it is really only useful for storytellers and maybe wouldbe writers who like the &quot;world of darkness&quot;.  I think a player would get a lot of ideas, many of which would not be compatible with a story from this book so the best way to combat that and still allow Tremere and other magic using Kindred to develop would be for storyteller and player to look at this book together.  I think it does a good job of detailing how to design paths and rituals, a sample worksheet might help in this regard, but also in talking about the limitations of the practice of bloodmagic.	2001-11-18

Ok, I love the beginning and for those who've read the &quot;ghoul book&quot; you'll recall the fine Malkavian doctor and his ghoul assistant as they now share their research into the &quot;thin blooded&quot; vampires and these strange new creatures some of them can parent.  I also loved the insights from the thin-blooded themselves.  However, I still had some questions such as when these 15th generation vampires first appeared and any connections to other ancients arising.  Also I felt that the &quot;story-like&quot; sections were merely repeated in later sections and that the insights on character creation is not as strong as in other books.  Also why would 13th or 14th gen kindred even be trying to make others?  And why are 15th gen so interested in sex when supposedly other gens aren't?  How much of this is propaganda? I know, I'm a stroyteller, I can make this stuff up, but I had hoped for better guidelines.	2001-11-13

Laura Antoniou had a great idea: her Marketplace series was so popular and fans wanted so much more, why not continue the story but also allow others to create their own Marketplace pieces?  The result is the wonderful story of the Marketplace worldwide meeting with the intriguing Kris Parker as the main character.  We also meet older slaves, trainers, and owners, and those somewhere in between at the Asia meeting.  Not only do we find out more about Kris Parker but we also get the wonderfully varied works of sevearl well-known and fairly new erotica authors other than Antoniou.  Almost every taste and every orientation and every combination is covered as we go from formal slavery in Asia and England to the new age of California and the proper victorian style households.  I enjoyed it greatly; only wished I could have written a story for it too.	2001-11-13

This reissue is very welcomed and the new short story at the end covers a gap between this and the second book of the series, \\"The Slave\\" very well -- this short story alone is worth the cost of the book for any Marketplace fan.  You'll meet all the important and reoccuring characters from Antoniou's series; you'll develop strong opinions about each too that may surprise some of you.  This isn't soft and romantic BDSM though so if you can't handle DS without limits, serious punishment, and even sexual use to the extreme, you'll want to skip this series.  It appeals across the board to all seuxal orientaions within the BDSM category -- in fact it plays around with the orientations in wonderfully engaging ways.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-11-13

This is a good introductory guide on BDSM for heterosexual, male dominant and female submissive couples and for others who view BDSM as a form of sexual and romantic play.  It is not, as some reviewers both on the book itself and elsewhere, claim the most complete BDSM guide today -- it never claims to be that either.  It is simply what it claims, one couples' view of BDSM that may click well with others of a similar bent.  However, the tone is a bit sarcastic at times and a bit &quot;in scene&quot; at other times and this may confuse very new people so I recommend other books such as the &quot;Topping Book&quot; and the &quot;Bottoming Book&quot; by Greenery Press first and if you can find a copy, Pat Califia's &quot;Sensuous Magic&quot; as a basic intro to the activities of SM.  In 1,000 words there is little time to go into all the good and bad points about this book but I hope this can aid in deciding whether or not to buy.	2001-11-13

For specialists, this book will seem simple but for advanced undergraduates or disinterested graduate students the book is wonderful and I highly recommend it for them.

There must be a problem with indexing at White Wolf and their various gaming systems.  This book is quite good at explaining the Camarilla clans and giving insights to how they really operate.  But it is poorly indexed.  Also I think that WhiteWolf needs to make a bigger character sheet or have more blank lines for abilities and disciplines since they keep expanding what your character can learn. A guide to how to use these new things with older abilities would be helpful too.	2001-08-05

But sometimes it is good to have the help of a few pre-created characters too, especially lower gen ones.  A very helpful section of this book gives guidelines for designing low-gen characters which I wished I'd had sooner.  The book is divided into three sections: Sabbat, Camarilla, and Independent important/powerful figures.  But it could really use an index so you can find clans or roles more easily.

Since I never used the original edition I can't compare this one to say whether it was an improvement or not.  While the basics are all here, it would be nice to have a stronger index.  Also the descriptions of how to use the dice, when and why, is confusing.  Charts would be better than paragraphs to explain all of this I think.  The art work is cool and the little mini-stories are a nice touch.  It leaves some unanswered questions but perhaps the sysem is expanding more organically so the makers don't know all the answers -- the clan books suggest this as well as new abilities and disciplines and rules are created.	2001-08-05

This book is a great explanation of and suggestions for evaluating teaching and learning primarily at the college level.  In college, a professor or instructor may have hundreds of students unless you teach a very rare subject or at are a very small school.  These fast and often fun exercises are a neat way to figure out how much your students are learning and how to teach better.  They could also be used as graded tests but primarily the book was intended for pure assessment.  Since students, over-booked with classes in the age of a flat-fee system, may resent too much gradeless assessment, you'll have to read the atmosphere of your own classes and decide how best to use this.	2001-08-05

That is something I've asked myself again and again as I read this book.  Not being male and not being homosexual, I still felt a bit uncomfortable as I read page after page of stereotypes.  The book represents the &quot;gay male culture of big cities&quot; as primarily a hunting ground for sex -- which it may be at some level but still not all gays are out looking to get laid every night.  There is some discussion about safety, both emotional and physical, and some suggestions for how to find and date someone, then how to please them.  This focus on &quot;your partner&quot; was probably the best part of the book because it breaks that stereotype that gay men are self-absorbed (except for those &quot;types&quot; of guys who are really focused on themselves).  The basis of the book is that if you are a gay man, you are looking for sex.  The book was very witty, sometimes on purpose but sometimes I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be funny.  If you are a gay man (or know gay men) in a big city this may be more understandable to you; frankly in the small city I'm in, most of the gay and bi men I talked to didn't recognize some of the terms or find it all that funny.  If you don't buy it to be a serious guide, I think you'll enjoy it a lot more.	2001-07-07

Faludi does not seem to understand the concept of &quot;brief and to the point&quot; but then again her books aren't philosophy they are a journey she's taken and shares with us so that we too can find answers and understand other human beings.  The focus here is on men.  Originally her question was: &quot;Why do men oppose the feminist movement?&quot; but became &quot;Why don't men start a movement to help themselves?&quot;  By this she doesn't mean to fight feminism but instead to fights against all the modern confusions over what it means to be a man.  She interviewed and followed over the course of six years several different groups of men ranging from the &quot;Spur Posse&quot; to porn actors to laid off McDonald-Douglas workers to the generational conflict between Vietnam vets and their anti-war brothers.  She finds a sad trend: masculinity is no longer defined by community but by individuality and that is lost in the competition for recognition.  A long book, you may have to make yourself read it at times but it could expose the reality behind the soundbites the media gives us about &quot;angry men&quot; and &quot;bad boys&quot;.  It is only by discovering reality that any changes can occur.	2001-07-07

This is an erotica book, not a porn book so if you are looking for lots of measurements, non-stop sex, and vulgar words, don't buy this book.  But if you like a hstorical setting, that does appear to be fairly well researched, the imagined &quot;true story&quot;, with a femdom leaning then you might like this.  I found the writing top notch and the plot well thought out -- however, only three or so months seemed to be covered in what was a three year relationship in much detail.  And I want to know why all these femdom tales have sad endings, where the man returns to his world and spends the rest of his life yearning for the powerful female or she dies or she is brought around to the reality that she just needs a strong man.  At least this was a romantic tale by the end and for that and the research I give it four stars.	2001-07-04

Erickson's &quot;Slave Academy&quot; does better than most but not as well as he could have.  The introductory first chapter was a bit too short to give us a full feel for the society in which his story happens.  And why do many of these sci fi erotica stories end up reversing the society?  Can't there be a story where it may not be great but it can be fixed?  And why is being submissive or a bottom often negative?  What is good about the book is the character of Den; whose fall from grace is felt via rapid pacing and first-person accounts -- if it had stayed this way the story would have been much better.  If you like rough gay sex and can tolerate a negative view of power relationships at times,  you might like this book.	2001-06-30

While some of his interpretations I'd argue with, 90% of his comments seem well supported.  The illusions and the primary text examples were helpful and should interest the reader without overwhelming him/her.  Though he does not go into great detail on some topics (such as violence and sexuality) these are addressed to a degree that most parents and high school teachers should be comfortable with.  A good list of references are provided in case you want further information.	2001-06-30

It is the same with this series by Anne Bishop.  The negativity of the society, the hostility between men and women, all of this is cranked up in the second book.  The characters seem more disjointed, more confused -- and well they could be given what has happened and is happening to them.  I just didn't get as into the characters as the first or third book enticed me to be.  The third book however will make little sense without the second so you should read it if you are a fan of the series.  Indeed if you plan to read &quot;The Invisible Ring&quot; I recommend the trilogy first because it will explain the culture better and allow you to be more a part of that adverture.	2001-06-25

A classic, this work attempts to find the origins of Greek thought through the reconstuction of mythology and religion -- there is, by the way, a difference between these.  Vernant's work always shows new insights and new avenues but he is so tied to the structionalist concepts that I believe he makes some assumptions without ample proof.  While it may be difficult to find all the answers when dealing with dead civilizations, it does not mean that we have to abandon the attempt to find evidence and discover the realities.  A must read for anyone interested in myth theory or Greek thought so you are aware of all the ideas which have come before.	2001-06-25

Ah, I notice that the book this review is with is obviously not the same edition I received as a gift -- the woman above is actually the color she should be: blue with black hair.  The other edition had a woman whose coloring was white and it just completely mismatched with the book. So what is good about this book?  It looks at two societies (there are three different races but one, the &quot;white,&quot; is all but ignored) who in sociological terms are opposites.  One is matriarchical and the other patriarchical -- it is clear from the characters and their lives however that the patriarchical one is far more repressive to its people (females are property, can't do business, don't have a public voice, and children are nothing until the age of 12) than the matriarchical one (where men are expected to become husbands and fathers first and only females directly inherit).  The two main characters, Kit and Nolan, show us the same events, the same time period from their different eyes until they meet and travel together.  This provides the reader with unique perspectives and a real interest in both characters lives.  We are pleased by the end even though it may be that trouble is just starting on this world and for them.	2001-06-20

However, this book I could not relate too.  Perhaps I'm not into computers enough, perhaps the first chapter where &quot;her friends&quot; (?are they?) talk about her not being there and about new laws was just too boring, or perhaps the book is too much into telling me what is going on in the realworld compared to showing me what is going on in cyberspace.  Whatever it was, this book did not catch my interest, did not make me want to keep reading.  But I did read it because it was a gift.

The focus is on sexuality and some of the best known and respected scholars have contributed: Marilyn B. Skinner, Amy Richlin, Sandra R. Joshel, and Judith P. Hallett stand out because their pivotal work on Roman sexuality already.  However, it is the essay by Holt N. Parker, &quot;The Teratogenic Grid&quot; that provides the field with an understandable model of sexuality in Roman culture.  Most of the pieces focus on men, something relatively new in the ancient field, but there are also a few that deal specifically with women.  As in any academic work, there will be theories you love, some you see as valuable, and others you disagree with.  But this not for someone unfamiliar with the research and changes in the study of Roman sexuality to dive into.	2001-06-15

When I was younger, a teacher sent a story I'd written into the writer's workshop at one of the universities in our state.  It came back with great comments and the writer's seemed to like it alot.  One comment stuck in my mind: it is bigger than this you know. That is how I feel about the two novels of Tanith Lee presented in this one volume.  The first, &quot;Don't Bite the Sun&quot;, does a great job of laying the background, getting us into the mind of the main character and helping us feel &quot;her&quot; disillusionment with the utopic life that resembles hell more than heave.  However the second novel, &quot;Drinking Sapphire Wine&quot; is too short -- I needed and wanted more background, more connection, more feeling, and more time between the characters.  Given that this is a collection of two novels, it would have been great to expand on each.	2001-06-10

In mythology and folklore, there have been attempts to use language and the narratives themselves to recreate the origins.  Others attempt to apply pyschological theory to explain the commonness of &quot;man's mythic past&quot; -- &quot;man&quot; here a term purposely chosen to reflect the patriarchical veil that most studies have processed the world through.  Marcel Detienne does some of these things in his search for the origins of Greek mythology -- the term &quot;mythology&quot; is used as a general word and does not reflect later attempts to classify and identify different type of narratives.  While I may not agree with all of his statements and the translation leaves a bit ot be desired (as all translations due I might add), I am very pleased as a historian to say that Detienne has no problem saying flat out &quot;we may never know&quot; the origins of Greek mythology.  This may leave many readers at a loss if the book was chosen to give all the answers but it is a far more realistic approach that attempts to create what can never be uncovered and to understand what has no record.	2001-05-23

I read this book in the hopes of including it in a review essay on teaching at the college level but found that it does not fit into this category at all.  Instead it is a philosophical or literary critique of the preceived condition of scholars at the college level by laypeople and by other academics.  Divided into three sections, only the last two really address the issues that are often said to plague university scholars today -- the first is more of a comment on the conflict between experts and non-experts in all other aspects of society, especially politics and mass media.  Garber makes a strong case that all of these &quot;so-called problems&quot; within the academic world are not new and indeed may be necessary for growth and the pursuit of knowledge.  However, she ignores some of the very real and serious issues that rip departments apart, isolate graduate and undergraduate students, and threaten funding for education both on the professional and on the consumer level.	2001-05-23

Why are human beings drawn to folktales, fairy tales, mythic figures?  Barthes discovers that this draw surrounds us everyday, used both commerically and unconsciously from the personas of professional wrestlers (who resemble those seen on American television today) to our discussions of public figures.  Mythology, Barthes argues, is a vital and living part of our society but it is also one used without real understanding because it is so deeply ingrained in the human mind and heart.  The essays are light so that the non-specialist can enjoy but deep enough that the scholar can see and understand the theory underneath.	2001-05-23

The book is well organized with a glossary right after a good discussion of special terms used in BDSM.  Likewise sample negotiation forms are found at the end of the chapter where the procedure is explained.  The largest section of the book concerns safety but not necessarily the kind you might find in &quot;On the Safe Edge&quot; or &quot;Learning the Ropes&quot;.  Here the focus is on learning about yourself first, learning about your partner second, and then how to explore BDSM.  Throughout the idea that BDSM is primarily a pleasureable partnership is embraced and indeed in my personal experiences the best SM or Ds relationships are partnerships.  Neither Henkin nor Holiday say that their way is the only way but they give solid reasons for their opinions and make suggestions based on years in the scene and as scholars and educators.  This is definately a book I have proud to have in my library and one I recommend to people new to BDSM.	2001-05-22

This book was a Valentine's Day gift and I'll treasure it for that -- I just was not impressed with the book.  There is nothing particularly wrong with the information (except for using pantyhose or ties for bondage -- don't do that) and there is nothing new here.  The presentation with what I guess was an attempt at humor, only made the book seem like one a very vanilla person might put out to &quot;shock&quot; friends.  It won't &quot;hurt&quot; you partner or you to read this, but please make sure you get another &quot;how-to&quot; book to double check the information; better yet, contact a nearby BDSM organization and learn about safety first hand.  Some of you by like the black and white drawings of the book.	2001-04-03

One of &quot;The Body, in Theory&quot; titles from the University of Michigan Press, this collection is over-whelmingly about theory.  Theory is, of course, quite important in scholarship but it need not interfere with solidly written and well-evidenced arguments.  Unfortunately in this case theory often over-rides good writing.  The subjects are primarily literature and the studies for the most part are focused on one author or one event at a time though the reader must be familiar with the subject in order to use or analyze the essay.  The one exception is Maria Wyke's essay &quot;Herculean Muscle!&quot; which looks at the classic tradition revamped by modern body builders and modern media.	2001-03-14

Barr decided that she was going to be a reviewer for what was important to her and not what was important to her academic career -- would that more of us made that decision.  The result of over a decade of her reviewing this important work, feminist science fiction and feminist fiction in general, is presented in this one volume of thirteen of her essays.  For Barr feminist fiction challenges the patriarchy, it speaks the truth through exaggeration, and it pushes for change.  And while most men can only manage to write antipatriarchical ficion, some can indeed become male feminists just as not all women can be feminists.  While I do not agree with her that we need a new category, which she calls fabulation, to replace other genre, I did find a lot of her commentary to be strong and well-reasoned.  If you like literature criticism or need suggestions for good feminist or antipatriarchical work,  this collection is well worth your time.	2001-03-14

The essays are well-written and arranged in a chronological order that crosses the Greek and Roman lines as it should while the essays themselves recognize the often ignored fact that societies change over time and thus we do not have the Christians compared to Homer's heroes -- a serious problem in some classical studies.  These essays challenge many of the assumptions about antiquity including the use of grave goods to determine the sex of the buried.  The collection, however, is not for just anyone interested in gender, sexuality and art history or archaeology.  In order to benefit the most from this book one needs to be at least casually versed in the issues and debates about ancient Greece and Rome.	2001-03-14

No, instead it is a journey of one man whom after a long life finally writes down his fantasies along with accompanying drawings.  The drawings are well done though I bit difficult to see -- the nature of the media I suspect.  The book itself is not a novel in the sense that it is actually a story of a particular length but instead more like a short story or a draft of what could have developed into an intriguing world.  As it is, the development of the characters is too quick, too short, and thus I never empathized with anyone nor truly cared what happened to them.  I found that I was more interested in the man that created this book, why these fantasies, why these images, why did it take so long for him to express himself and did he ever get that fantasy even briefly in real life.	2000-11-12

But upon a second reading I realized that much of what I was offended by might be the &quot;Britishness&quot; of the text and author, and that is something to keep in mind, what may be published in Europe and liked in Europe but not sell in America, or Asia, or elsewhere.  The chapters are short, I think they might do nicely for first time writers, and the harsh facts about not deluding yourself when you write could be good for those embarassed by their writing.  But frankly some of us do write others types of books and we don't think of our erotica as taking any less skill or talent.  Since erotica is about a very personal matter -- intimacy and sexuality -- it should be something that writers and readers spend time and talent on whether for private use or public consumption.	2000-11-12

I expected an actual, albeit short, history of erotica but instead got a simple view of different peoples and time periods in far too short of text with accompanying images. I've been asked to design a course for my university as an experiment and have been trying, unsuccessfully to find approach books about the history of erotica, particularly the written kind.  This book will not do at all for as I read it, my familiarity with several of the cultures briefly looked at showed me that the book has very very little depth or understanding of those cultures (here I am especially referring to the ancient Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian cultures). The only saving points are that 1) this book tries to show erotica (here almost exclusively of the visual sort) from around the world and throughout time and 2) it has a good definition of erotica on the sixth page.	2000-11-12

Styled after the homosexual and bisexual support books for those who love &quot;non-traditional&quot; people, this book is the first of its kind addressing the question of &quot;kinky&quot; or BDSM practicioners and those who love them.  The book is best read as it suggests: with at least two readers, the kinky person and the person who loves him/her.  The takes care of the not surprising conflicting emotions for those who have discovered a loved one's kinkiness while supporting the kinky person too.  My only concerns are that it is could be much larger, but then then I think the purpose is to be general, not definative, and that the language may at times seem patronizing.  Both of these concern can, of course, be dealt with by reading it together.  Overall, an excellent way to start talking to those you love and to stop hiding.	2000-10-11

It is often said that history is about men.  This is incorrect.  History is about what men do -- politics, war, science, etc which until modern history has been the primarily arenas of males.  However, how men see  themselves, what it means to be a man, and how each society differs in this  regard is a fairly new topic.  Foxhall and Salmon collect wonderful and  well written essays about how men viewed themselves in Greece and Roman in  antiquity.  I am using it extensively in the course I'm teaching at Indiana  University fall 2000!  I highly recommend it to professors in history,  classics, and gender studies.	2000-07-27

So why should you listen to a guy who doesn't have the &quot;prefect&quot; yet?  Because it is unlikely any of us will and yet most of us will keep looking.  The chapters are honest approaches writing to the dominant's eyes that  remind us that it isn't just fantasy it is work!  Working that can be  rewarding in itself before we find that &quot;prefect&quot; whatever.  Personally I found a few things I disagree with, but I didn't perceive this  book to be about a &quot;one true way&quot; other than deal with reality.  Fantasies are great, but reality is what we must face and Rinella's book is  a great reassurence for all us tops that the pursue is worth the work and  that we are not alone in our search.	2000-07-26

When a scholar uses such a wide range of sources, it is inevidentual that some will be used better than others.  I think Cantarella has a good grasp of the legal and epigraphical evidence but her  use of literature and plays is more tenuous.  Likewise she crosses over  from time periods at times, combining Greek sources from a Roman context  into her discussion about Greece when they might best be a reflection of a  new multiculture world.  Finally, I can tell this was done on a computer.  Several pages are word for word from her previous book &quot;Pandora's  Daughters&quot;.  Computers are wonderful things but I don't think they  should take the place of writing something new. There are several good  points about this book.  She uses a wide range of sources and attempts to  place &quot;reality&quot; apart from &quot;philosophy&quot; a difference  often overlooked in scholarship it seems.  Her attempt to look at women's  bisexuality is good though limited by the sources available.  Finally the  book is written clearly so that both scholar and non-scholar can appreciate  and learn from it.	2000-07-26

A collection of any type of writing is always a risking purchase.  It is unlikely that all the essays will be of the same quality or hold the same interest for the reader.  However, a scholarly collection should have a  high standard to begin with and thus I was disappointed by &quot;Rape in  Antiquity&quot;. Out of 12 articles, I can only strongly recommend three by  Rosanna Omitowoju, Daniel Ogdenm, and Karen F. Pierce.  All the others lack  sufficient evidence to prove their theses, do not write well-enough to  explain their opinions, or seem to be reading sources that are quite  different from what I've read.  Note that two of the twelve essays are  really about the medieval world, not antiquity, and that two of the  articles are about Roman ideas leaving the bulk, eight, concerning Greece,  especially Athens in the classical period.	2000-07-13

I received this book as an anniversary present and as I looked through it I asked my spouse &quot;is this a gift for you or me?&quot; as I pointed to the overwhelming number of naked and semi-naked images of heroines.  The  biggest question I had with this book was: What is the definition of  heroine that both Miller and Sargent are using?  Next I wanted to know why  the book was so short.  I've read several books about women writers, women  characters, and feminism even in science fiction and fantasy.  While the  number of characters and authors they address is usually fewer they are  more detailed.  I can't say after reading this book that I understand why  some of the characters are listed as heroines at all.  Instead, the book  seems more focused on starting to look at the changes in female characters  over decades -- a topic that deserved at least twice this number of pages  even if the pictures had to be a much smaller part of the concept.	2000-07-13

However, do not buy this thinking you are getting women's views, that is rare in the record.  Well organized and well  cited, it provides an excellent teaching aid to the professor and a quick  reference to scholars and laypersons.  It is best used in an introductory  history class or a women's studies class.  Could be difficult to understand  without basic background materials.	2000-06-19

The problem is that most of those who promote the idea that Western  civilization inherited and stole African civilization are people who  understand neither the languages nor the histories they are compared.

Now, I've never been one to not go to a doctor because of my sexuality -- I just don't like doctors period.  But I always get an annual from my Gyn and I'm very  upfront with my sexual choices -- I figure I'm paying, she can listen and  give me the best information.  Others however are not as comfortable and  thus they miss those very necessary check ups. Now I don't think that the  doctor should be someone's primary source of information about bdsm, but  about general and specific health questions, that is their job.  Doctor  Moser gives two audiences reassurance that to be honest about your  sexuality in relationship to doctors is a necessary thing: the lay public  or consumers and the health care providers.  I'm not sure that the two  audiences in one book was the best approach -- I found the  &quot;providers&quot; sections a bit dull to read but I think the  &quot;providers&quot; can gain insight from the &quot;consumers&quot;  section.  The overall message of the books is simple: you are ultimately  responsible for your well-being, this means getting your physical and  emotional health tended to on a regular basis.  Trust me, someone with  experience in the scene, you are doing yourself a favor by seeing your  doctor and you are performing a necessary task if you want to protect and  care for your partners.  Moser's book will help you overcome your concerns  and reclaim your rights as a consumer and a human being.	2000-06-12

This book  is a series of questions and suggested answers about situations which most folks will never have to consciously deal with as long as homosexual, polyamoury, and bdsm are in the background.  However for those of us who claims these different ways of living,  the book is a helpful beginning.  Personally I don't think anyone should  blindly follow an etiquette book, but use the questions and answers to come  up with the appropriate behavior for their community or at least to monitor  their own behavior. Good etiquette is for everyone -- class, race, role,  sexuality, sex, or gender are irrelevant when it comes to matters of  getting along at the basic level.  Or to paraphrase an expression:  etiquette was developed so two people could avoid killing each other.  There are some questions missing that I would have liked addressed.  For  example, when you've been at an event and you and yours have volunteered to  assist someone in a demostration, how is that person best thanked?  Who  says thanks and how quickly?  Or how do you make suggestions for changes in  an event without hurting the organizers feelings?  Or how do you protect  victims of abuse without lending strength to the &quot;traditional  world's&quot; negative image of your alternative group?  Overall a good  resource to begin discussions of etiquette from and to read together as a  couple or group.	2000-06-12

A good deal of the book tells us who Jay Wiseman is, why he is  qualified to write this book, and how he went about researching,  experimenting, and writing it.  A bit long for those who know about him but  shoudl reassure those who are exploring this for the first time.   Let me  begin by saying that I am &quot;lazy&quot; and easily bored. I've never  been a fan of bondage either, as those who read my erotica can attest to.   So, I would have prefered the knots section to be more interwoven in the  positions section, I had to flip back and forth, but I have enough  experience that primarily the book is inspiration.   Bottoms who like to  wiggling and get out of bondage may be angered a bit at the section about  their &quot;tricks&quot; but tops will pleased to learn how to counter some  of these.  Likewise the description of rope helped me understand those  &quot;safety cautions&quot; you always here but which are not explained.  Good for the beginner, those apprenticing to learn knots or being a good  boyscout might be a good idea first.	2000-05-31

How I wished I could be Jane and own Silver.  I  think this started my robot fetish but I digress.<br /><br />I liked the illustrations of the book was good though it didn't quite match the images I had in my mind.

The only thing lacking is more of a historical sense of how things changed and why. Bradley does a good job of balancing the  &quot;master&quot; view with the &quot;slave&quot; view, presenting several  sides to each issue without much moralizing of his own -- a rare thing  often in the history of slavery.

However the text has two major flaws which necessiated my using an additional text for my Classical Mythology course.  First, when he  does not directly sight a document his reporting of what happens in the  narrative is sometimes incorrect, for example it does not say in the Enuma  Elish that the younger gods danced and thus distrubed Anu and Tiamat -- it  just says that the elder gods were troubled and the younger gods were  noisy.  Secondly there are historical errors and controdictions in the test  as he attempts to provide background for the stories.  An good attempt at  classical mythology but not the best I've seen.	2000-05-17

And, of course, by reading it you are undermining one of the basics of this distopian society: buy new things all the time.  Sound  familar?  You beat it does.  The characters aren't as well developed as I  would ideally like but the focus is on a society where the individual is  lost so there is a reason (or that's what I tell myself ;-))  A great read  for high schoolers just investigating the world around them with a critical  mind and a terrifying read for those of us caught up in the material world  already.	2000-05-17

For the layperson, the evidence may be overwhelming, but for the ancient historian the immediate question is: &quot;how do these family  connections prove his theory&quot;.  The answer leads one to other  questions as certain parts of the book enlighten and inform while others  merely build up impression collections of names and familiar ties.

However, while the movie lacks the complexity of this book, it at least gives us even to care about some of  the characters a little bit.  Perhaps it is the science aspect that is  bringing me down -- I'm just not buying the premise of the book.

Yet, there have been writers who can combine great characters, intriguing situations and hard science.  Michael Crichton isn't  one of these.  A classic worth reading but unless you are very into medical  mystery, perhaps not worth buying.	2000-05-17

Faraone's book on Greek love magic will challenge several of the widely held assumptions about sex and gender roles, showing once again that they are not the same nor were they seen by the ancients as being the same.  His  connections seem solid but fuller quotations of the texts might help  strengthen his arguements.  Good food for thought.	2000-05-15

Strong use of ancient evidence and knowledge of medicine itself, help make this book a must read for those  interested in women, motherhood, or medicine in the ancient world.  More  time spent on women's view of medicine might improve but such information  is scarse.  Not written for the layperson or undergraduate.	2000-05-15

Butler won the &quot;genius&quot; award a few years back and this book shows why.  Her characters are engaging and lifelike, the situations believable, and the results not always what you wanted but  clearing what makes sense.

While one may not agree with everything Buxton has  to say, his theories are well supported by the evidence he uses and he has  a firm grasp of the ancient Greek mind and culture.

I wouldn't recommend this be the first book anyone studying classical mythology reads -- the analysis may be a bit over the newbie's head and the issues  require more knowledge about ancient Greek and Roman culture.  However as an advanced undergraduate, graduate or professional resource,  Edmund's analysis provides good food for thought which you agree or  disagree.  Good interweaving of  poem, play, philosophical, and visual  accounts of the myths with details about Greek society itself.  Could use  some stronger citations at points.	2000-05-15

The book does concentrate on a few periods in Egyptian history, but then  the evidence does not allow for much detail. Written in a fairly clear  manner, a good instructor will find it useful and students will find many  sections of it more interesting than the lists of pharoahs.	2000-05-15

If one wants information about goddesses in specific or  citations to other scholarship, don't look to this book.  Interpretations  can be amusing when one has read the primary sources and knows about the  cultures she looks at to a deep degree.

Here in one source can be found information about a variety of cultures and deities.  However, the  depth of the essays is shallow and the type of analysis and amount of  materials covered varies greatly from one essay to the next. Knowing  something about mythology and women in the ancient world, I found some  goddess just plain left out of the book and treated rather shortly.  Instead of evidence I found more discussion of the society of the Greeks  and Romans and the Celts while the article on Egypt spent more time looking  at individual deities.  Overall it might be a good place to start looking  for comparative information and for some questions which should be asked in  any research project but the book is not a one-stop resource on goddesses.	2000-05-15

First the amount of primary materials covered allows one to forgo lots of other books being ordered, a consideration for academia at this  point in time. Second, the controversal interpretations of ancient society  and the meaning of the myths can be balanced by either the teacher of  Powell's &quot;Classical Myth&quot; book.  I think that for the college  level, this exposure to different views is valuable because it challenges  students to think.  Not useful beyond the introductory level though.	2000-05-15

However, Frazer's almost mythology standing as one of the first mythologists in Ancient History has led to an  over-evaluation of some of his work, in my opinion.  Written in ramble  manner only confuses the reader and weakens Frazer's arguements so that one  may find it difficult to argue with specific passages.  By the end, it  seems that Frazer has gotten lost in his &quot;search for Ur&quot; and  forgotten that his assumptions are meaningless until proven by text,  records, and logic.	2000-05-15

This is a edited version of my review because some people are taking for too much offense at this short review.  I advise them to read it again.  Green is a specialist in the Hellenistic period, a culture quite different from the Classical city of Athens or the archaic development of the polis for example.<br />If one reads the review below you'll note that I did not trash this book, I pointed out that it was lacking evidence and topics btut also how it might best be used in a classroom.  I'm a college instructor so I think in terms of what I would use in a history class and how best to use it.  I stand by what I said below because I'm comparing the book to others of its type, and this book is not the best (that would earn 5 stars).<br />You should also note the \\"?\\" in my title -- you are entitled to your own opinions but when people start sending me nasty private emails about my reviews, I can only feel sorry for their lack of professionalism.<br />For the specialist, Green's book is too concise, short on evidence to support all of his \\"facts\\".  However, for the introductory history class, it might be a good book if supplemented by cultural and  social history by the instructor.  It is clear that Green's area of  specialization is not ancient Greece but he is knowledgable nonetheless.	2000-05-15

Instead let me just say that I cannot agree with the high praise other reviewers of this collection have given  here on Amazon.com. There are two primary reasons for my lower evaluation.  First, as an ancient history who focuses on mythology and women, I must say  that I found the retellings of the classical myths to be lacking in an  understanding of the culture which created them. If one wants to believe in  an ancient matriarchy, fine, but don't expect such opinions to be valued by  historians or classicists.  I think the idea to retell the stories from a  female point of view is great but I don't think ancient women would have  such a political agenda as seems evident in this collection. Secondly, the  bulk of the stories follow one young woman's adventures among two wandering  Amazons during a time when things are changing for the tribe/nation of  women.  I wish more time had been spent on the characters, the plot,  anything because I did not feel enough time was devoted to the characters  to create empathy with them -- a mark of good fiction in my opinion.  However, if one enjoys feminist retellings and a bit of weak lesbian  tension, then the book may be worth your time and money.	2000-05-15

The stories are retold in an engaging fashion, capturing the imagination of the reader.

Since high level theorizing, however, makes the book  unaccessible to the layperson and even difficult at times for those less  familiar with either culture. Likewise some of his translations or  interpretation may cause discomfort for the experts on either culture.  The  book is an interesting addition to the field of comparative mythology and  should be read by any seriously engaged in either ancient or traditional  systems.	2000-05-15

Let me simply say a few things to the layperson and the scholar searching for this book on Amazon.com. The book  is highly specialized; the more you know about archaic and mycenean Greek  culture the better you will understand this book.  Detailed in evidence and  rich in interpretation, Blok does leave some of us scholar a bit perplexed  at times at her logic, though 90% of the time that is solid.  For the price  the book is not worth even the specialists purchase; instead, borrow from  the library and take careful and numerous notes.  She suggests far more  questions than she offers answers for but this just means the book is a  good beginning to research into the Amazons, early Greek Epic, or even the  socio-political exchange of ideas in the ancient world.	2000-05-15

Whether you  are gay or straight, male or female, bottom or top, I think you can  empathize with the trials and tribulations of our lost soldier not doubly  lost from his native master.

While not a follower of this particular part of the &quot;BDSM&quot;  umbrella, I did learn quite a bit from the essays and now can better  understand when my partners say that I've helped them see &quot;god&quot;  -- they should really say &quot;goddess&quot; though.	2000-05-11

Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the  politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard  to follow and identify with otherwise.  I had difficulty empathizing with  any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there  are so many characters in the story.

Indeed anyone reading this book for the first  time should remind themseleves that this is the creation of one man, some  of his opinions may not be shared by others but overall his words are well  chosen and his attitude similar is not identical to many in the  &quot;BDSM&quot; community.

Some of the stories are a bit too short, we  the reader do not have enough information to empathize with the characters.  Others are connected in theme and character but separated from each other  by other stories.  Personally, whenever I read a collection of short  stories, I mark in the table of contents which ones I liked best so that  later I can reread those I enjoyed and ignore those I did not.  If you  enjoy tight writing and honry men, you will find something to appreciate in  this collection.	2000-05-11

A odd assortment both in content and quality is this collection of short science fiction.  The one story that stands out above the crowd is &quot;Auto Erotica&quot; about cars as substitutes for sex or a form of  foreplay in the future.  Beyond this story however, I did not find the  others particularly arousing or memoriable.	2000-05-11

Three short stories by three different authors take us into the world of magic, violence, and sex.  The first story is one of my favorites not just because it features a female dominant and a male submissive, but because we  have enough time to empathize with both characters. The second story does  not spend as much time on character development, we don't understand really  how the elvish princess becomes a slave, but for those of the male dominant  and female submissive bent it may be worth reading.  The third story is gay  in nature and gives us insight into the romantic aspects of fantasy  erotica.  For the price, it is worth purchasing.	2000-05-11

I found the stories less unique and the plots slower, less sexy even.  However, there is still plenty of action, plenty of plot  and plenty of variation to satisfy most readers of the genre.	2000-05-11
2485124:US	52008531	R1MCMPZ3LH7C1W	1890159077	669234794	Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners	Books	5	29	32	N	N	Part of a program.	This book is a must read for anyone interested in either becoming or training erotic slaves.  I especially appreciated Abernathy's emphasis on the fact that erotic slavehood is a vocation, something different for those  of us to whom &quot;BDSM&quot; is more than fun and games or a spiced up  sex life.  One may, however, feel that Abernathy is preaching a &quot;One  Way&quot; approach but when read closely it is clear this is merely one of  many ways that &quot;BDSM&quot; may be part of your life.  Not for those  who do not seriously value service and long term, intense preparation.	2000-05-11

This is the second of Grant Antrews novel and once more we find a sad ending for our main character.  We follow the life and explorations of one man under that guiding hands of a group of women.  Instead of him finding  his true calling in life, however, we follow him back out of the kinky  world and back into the mundane existance.  Perhaps he is better for his  experiences under dominant hands but we are left wondering about that by  novel's end.  Are there no happy femdom stories out there?	2000-05-11

A must read for anyone claiming to know anything about &quot;BDSM&quot; erotica.  Filled with complex characters and interwoven plots which leave you with questions you pant after, this is  truly a masterpiece.  There is something here for every orientation!	2000-05-11

Pat Califia's intense collection of lesbian erotica starts with a bang and does not slow down until the end of the final story.  These are stories of possible realities, not fantasy or science fiction which I usually prefer  and yet the characters and plots were so wonderfully interwoven with  passioniate SM and sex that I found myself enjoying most of the stories.  Definately a collection I return to every now and then.	2000-05-11

No, this is not a how-to  book, this a calm and serious approach to questions about the human body  and its reactions to different activities encompassed in &quot;BDSM&quot;.  However, this subject in and of itself is so large that Jacques' work can  only be an introduction.  Use it as a starting point then research specific  interests in greater detail.  A &quot;must have&quot; for all beginners in  my opinion.	2000-05-11

We follow several couples of different orientations back to their homes where they  play out fantasies inspired by the film.  Some of the characters seemed  more fully developed than others, but this is a risk in any short format.  Likewise some of the stories were hotter than others but this could be  personal taste.  Overall there should be a story to interest almost anyone.	2000-05-05

Well written and  fairly evenly plotted, we meet again the mysterious trainer Chris Parker  though the book does little to answer the questions raised in the first two  books of the series.  Clearly there is a bias toward the &quot;Old  Guard&quot; style in the book, the newer approach and what most of use know  as the &quot;scene&quot; given less than ideal representation.  But  Antoniou fairly shows us the down side to the Marketplace system as well.  If you enjoyed the first two books you should read this one as well.	2000-05-05

Laura Antoniou pleases her  readers by continuing her series set in the world of the  &quot;Marketplace&quot; which many of those in the SM community wish  existed, I'm sure.  If you've read the first three books in this series,  you'll be well equipped you jump into the Academy and learn along side the  trainers and spotters.  Many questions from the previous novels are  answered in intelligent and arousing ways.  Even better, the format, a  novel with short stories interwoven into it, allows one to easily return to  a section or two to enjoy over and over if one wants a more immediate form  of gratification. Kudos to Ms. Antoniou for this novel and these short  stories!  It was well worth the wait.	2000-04-18
